The '''American Software Testing Qualifications Board''' ('''ASTQB''') was founded in 2003 as the American Testing Board. In April 2005, the name was changed to the American Software Testing Qualifications Board.

ASTQB is a non-profit organization whose members comprise a group of highly experienced experts in software testing who volunteer their time to the development, maintenance, and promotion of the ISTQB Certified Tester program in the U.S. They also represent U.S. interests internationally as the national board for the U.S. within the [[International Software Testing Qualifications Board]] (ISTQB). The ISTQB is responsible for the international qualification scheme called "[[ISTQB Certified Tester]]".

ISTQB certificates at Foundation Level are also dual certified by ISEB, which was established in 1967 and is the world's leading issuer of Software Testing certifications and the only certifications aligned with the worldwide Professionalism in IT campaign.

ASTQB's exam and accreditation fees are charged to cover the cost connected with the administration of exams, applications for accreditation, the maintenance of a physical office, exhibits at leading software testing conventions, and the employment of administrative staff.

An '''antifuse''' is an electrical device that performs the opposite function to a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]. Whereas a fuse starts with a low resistance and is designed to permanently break an [[Electrical conduction|electrically conductive]] path (typically when the [[electric current|current]] through the path exceeds a specified limit), an antifuse starts with a high resistance and is designed to permanently create an electrically conductive path (typically when the voltage across the antifuse exceeds a certain level). This technology has many applications.

==Christmas tree lights==
Antifuses are best known for their use in mini-light (or miniature) style low-voltage [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas tree lights]]. Ordinarily (for operation from mains voltages), the lamps are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]. (The larger, traditional, C7 and C9 style lights are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] and are rated to operate directly at mains voltage.) Because the series string would be rendered inoperable by a single lamp failing, each [[Light bulb|bulb]] has an antifuse installed within it.  When the bulb blows, the entire mains voltage is applied across the single blown lamp. This rapidly causes the antifuse to short out the blown bulb, allowing the series circuit to resume functioning, albeit with a larger proportion of the mains voltage now applied to each of the remaining lamps. The antifuse is made using wire with a high resistance coating and this wire is coiled over the two vertical filament support wires inside the bulb. The insulation of the antifuse wire withstands the ordinary low voltage imposed across a functioning lamp but rapidly breaks down under the full mains voltage, giving the antifuse action. Occasionally, the insulation fails to break down on its own, but tapping the blown lamp will usually finish the job. Often a special bulb with no antifuse and often a slightly different rating (so it blows first as the voltage gets too high) known as a "fuse bulb" is incorporated into the string of lights to protect against the possibility of severe overcurrent if too many bulbs fail.

==Antifuses in integrated circuits==
Antifuses are widely used to permanently program [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs).

Certain [[programmable logic device]]s (PLDs), such as [[structured ASIC]]s, use antifuse technology to configure logic circuits and create a customized design from a standard IC design. Antifuse PLDs are one time programmable in contrast to other PLDs that are [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] based and which may be reprogrammed to fix logic bugs or add new functions. Antifuse PLDs have advantages over SRAM based PLDs in that like [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s, they do not need to be configured each time power is applied. They may be less susceptible to [[alpha particle]]s which can cause circuits to malfunction.  Also circuits built via the antifuse's permanent conductive paths may be faster than similar circuits implemented in PLDs using SRAM technology. [[QuickLogic|QuickLogic Corporation]] refers to their antifuses as "ViaLinks" because blown fuses create a connection between two crossing layers of wiring on the chip in the same way that a [[Via (electronics)|via]] on a [[printed circuit board]] creates a connection between copper layers.

Antifuses may be used in programmable read-only memory ([[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]]). Each bit contains both a fuse and an antifuse and is programmed by triggering one of the two. This programming, performed after manufacturing, is permanent and irreversible.

===Dielectric antifuses===
Dielectric antifuses employ a very thin oxide barrier between a pair of conductors. Formation of the conductive channel is performed by a [[dielectric breakdown]] forced by a high voltage pulse. Dielectric antifuses are usually employed in CMOS and BiCMOS processes as the required oxide layer thickness is lower than those available in bipolar processes.

===Amorphous silicon antifuses===
One approach for the ICs that use antifuse technology employs a thin barrier of non-conducting [[amorphous silicon]] between two [[metal]] conductors. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the amorphous silicon it is turned into a [[polycrystalline]] silicon-metal [[alloy]] with a low [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], which is conductive.

Amorphous silicon is a material usually not used in either bipolar or CMOS processes and requires an additional manufacturing step.

The antifuse is usually triggered using an approximately 5 [[ampere|mA]] current. With a poly-diffusion antifuse, the high current density creates [[heat]], which melts a thin insulating layer between [[polysilicon]] and diffusion electrodes, creating a permanent resistive silicon link.

===Zener antifuses===
[[Zener diode]]s can be used as antifuses. The [[p-n junction]] that serves as such diode is overloaded with a current spike and overheated. At temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C and current densities above 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the metallization undergoes [[electromigration]] and forms spikes through the junction, shorting it out; this process is known as '''Zener zap''' in the industry. The spike is formed on and slightly below the silicon surface, just below the passivation layer without damaging it. The conductive shunt therefore does not compromise integrity and reliability of the semiconductor device. Typically a few-millisecond pulse at 100-200&amp;nbsp;mA is sufficient for common bipolar devices, for a non-optimized antifuse structure; specialized structures will have lower power demands. The resulting resistance of the junction is in the range of 10 ohms.

The Zener antifuses can be made without additional manufacturing steps with most CMOS, BiCMOS and bipolar processes; hence their popularity in analog and mixed-signal circuits. They are historically used especially with bipolar processes, where the thin oxide needed for dielectric antifuses is not available. Their disadvantage, however, is lower area efficiency compared to other types.

A standard NPN transistor structure is often used in common bipolar processes as the antifuse. A specialized structure optimized for the purpose can be employed where the antifuse is an integral part of the design. The terminals of the antifuses are usually accessible as bonding pads and the trimming process is performed before wire-bonding and encapsulating the chip. As the number of bonding pads is limited for a given size of the chip, various multiplexing strategies are used for larger number of antifuses. In some cases a combined circuit with zeners and transistors can be used to form a zapping matrix; with additional zeners, the trimming (which uses voltages higher than the normal operational voltage of the chip) can be performed even after packaging the chip.

Zener zap is frequently employed in [[mixed-signal circuit]]s for trimming values of analog components. For example a precision resistor can be manufactured by forming several series resistors with Zeners in parallel (oriented to be nonconductive during normal operation of the device) and then shorting selected Zeners to shunt the unwanted resistors. By this approach, it is possible only to lower the value of the resulting resistor. It is therefore necessary to shift the manufacturing tolerances so that the lowest-value typically made is equal to or larger than the desired value. The parallel resistors cannot have too low value as that would sink the zapping current; a series-parallel combination of resistors and antifuses is employed in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/vlsi/1996/023706.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street-lighting (obsolete)==
In a similar fashion to that of Christmas tree lights, before the advent of [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s, [[street light]] circuits using [[incandescent light bulb]]s were often operated as high-voltage series circuits. Each individual street-lamp was equipped with a ''film cutout''; a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. In the same fashion as with the Christmas lights described above, if the lamp failed, the entire voltage of the street lighting circuit (thousands of volts) was imposed across the insulating film in the cutout, causing it to rupture. In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and illumination restored to the rest of the street. Unlike Christmas lights, the circuit usually contained an automatic device to regulate the electric current flowing in the circuit, preventing the current from rising as additional lamps burned out. When the failed lamp was finally changed, a new piece of film was also installed, once again separating the electrical contacts in the cutout. This style of street lighting was recognizable by the large [[porcelain]] insulator that separated the lamp and reflector from the light's mounting arm; the insulator was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have routinely operated at a potential of several thousands of volts above ground/earth.

An '''astrolabe''' ({{lang-gr|ἀστρολάβος}} ''astrolabos''; {{lang-ar|ٱلأَسْطُرلاب}} ''al-Asturlāb''; {{lang-persian|اَختِرِیاب}} ''Akhtaryab'') is an elaborate [[inclinometer]], historically used by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[navigators]] to measure the [[orbital inclination|inclined position]] in the sky of a [[Astronomical object|celestial body]], day or night.

It was used in [[classical antiquity]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Islamic world, it was used to navigate deserts, then oceans, and to calculate the [[Qibla|direction to Mecca]].&lt;/ref&gt; the European [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Age of Discovery]] for all these purposes.

The astrolabe's importance not only comes from the early development of [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but is also effective for determining latitude on land or calm seas. Although it is less reliable on the heaving deck of a ship in rough seas, the [[mariner's astrolabe]] was developed to solve that problem.

==Etymology==
[[OED]] gives the translation "star-taker" for the English word ''astrolabe'' and traces it through medieval Latin to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''astrolabos'',&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50013806 |title=Astrolabe |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrolabe?q=astrolabe |title=Astrolabe |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''astron'' "star" and ''lambanein'' "to take".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astrolabe |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval Islamic world the [[Arabic]] word ''"al-Asturlāb"'' (i.e. astrolabe) was given various etymologies. In Arabic texts, the word is translated as ''"ākhdhu al-Nujuum"'' ({{lang-ar|آخِذُ ٱلنُّجُومْ}}, lit. "star-taker"), a direct translation of the Greek word.{{sfn|King|1981|p=44}}

[[Al-Biruni]] quotes and criticizes medieval scientist Hamzah al-Isfahani who stated:{{sfn|King| 1981|p= 44}} "asturlab is an arabization of this Persian phrase" (''sitara yab'', meaning "taker of the stars").{{sfn|King|1981|p=51}} In medieval Islamic sources, there is also a [[folk etymology]] of the word as "lines of lab", where "Lab" refers to a certain son of Idris (Enoch). This etymology is mentioned by a 10th-century scientist named [[Ali Ibn Ibrahim Qomi|al-Qummi]] but rejected by [[al-Khwarizmi]].{{sfn|King|1981|p=45}}

==History==

===Ancient world===
An early astrolabe was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization]] by [[Apollonius of Perga]] between 220 and 150&amp;nbsp;BC, often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. The astrolabe was a marriage of the [[planisphere]] and [[dioptra]], effectively an analog calculator capable of working out several different kinds of problems in astronomy. [[Theon of Alexandria]] (c. 335 – c. 405) wrote a detailed treatise on the astrolabe, and Lewis{{sfn|Lewis|2001}} argues that [[Ptolemy]] used an astrolabe to make the astronomical observations recorded in the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''. The invention of the plane astrolabe is sometimes wrongly attributed to Theon's daughter [[Hypatia]] ({{circa}} 350–370; died 415 AD),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Deakin (August 3, 1997).&amp;nbsp;"Ockham's Razor: Hypatia of Alexandria".

Astrolabes continued in use in the Greek-speaking world throughout the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.  About 550 AD, Christian philosopher [[John Philoponus]] wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.{{efn|Modern editions of [[John Philoponus]]' treatise on the astrolabe are ''De usu astrolabii eiusque constructione libellus'' (On the Use and Construction of the Astrolabe), ed.

London: Holland Press, 1976, {{OL|14132393M }} pp. 61–81.}} Mesopotamian bishop [[Severus Sebokht]] also wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in the [[Syriac language]] in the mid-7th century.{{efn|{{cite book| publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul| last = O'Leary| first = De Lacy|authorlink=De Lacy O'Leary| title = How Greek Science passed to the Arabs| date = 1948 |url=http://www.aina.org/books/hgsptta.htm}} "The most distinguished Syriac scholar of this later period was [[Severus Sebokht]] (d. 666–7), Bishop of Kennesrin. [...] In addition to these works [...] he also wrote on astronomical subjects (Brit. Mus. Add. 14538), and composed a treatise on the astronomical instrument known as the astrolabe, which has been edited and published by F. Nau (Paris, 1899)." &lt;br /&gt;Severus' treatise was translated by Jessie Payne Smith Margoliouth in R.T. Gunther, ''Astrolabes of the World'', Oxford, 1932, pp. 82–103.}} Sebokht refers to the astrolabe as being made of brass in the introduction of his treatise, indicating that metal astrolabes were known in the Christian East well before they were developed in the Islamic world or in the Latin West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Severus |last=Sebokht |title=Description of the astrolabe |url=  http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/severus_sebokht_astrolabe_01_trans.htm |publisher=Tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical background was established by Muslim astronomer [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|Albatenius]] in his treatise ''Kitab az-Zij'' (c. 920 AD), which was translated into Latin by [[Plato Tiburtinus]] (''De Motu Stellarum'').

The [[spherical astrolabe]] was a variation of both the astrolabe and the [[armillary sphere]], invented during the [[Middle Ages]] by astronomers and [[Inventions in the Muslim world|inventors]] in the Islamic world.{{efn|{{cite journal|first=Emilie|last=Savage-Smith|year=1993|title=Book Reviews|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=296–299|doi=10.1093/jis/4.2.296|quote=There is no evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the spherical astrolabe, but rather evidence so far available suggests that it may have been an early but distinctly Islamic development with no Greek antecedents.}}}}
The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to [[Al-Nayrizi]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 892–902). In the 12th century, [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] invented the ''linear astrolabe'', sometimes called the "staff of al-Tusi", which was "a simple wooden rod with graduated markings but without sights. It was furnished with a plumb line and a double chord for making angular measurements and bore a perforated pointer".&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Tusi_Sharaf|title=Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geared mechanical astrolabe was invented by Abi Bakr of [[Isfahan]] in 1235.&lt;ref name=Bedini&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Silvio Bedini|first1=Silvio A.|last1=Bedini|authorlink2=Francis Maddison|first2=Francis R.|last2=Maddison|year=1966|title=Mechanical Universe: The Astrarium of Giovanni de' Dondi|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1–69|jstor=1006002|doi=10.2307/1006002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Contractus, the abbot of Reichman Abbey, examined the use of the astrolabe in ''Mensura Astrolai'' during the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889717964|title=Encyclopedia of world trade : from ancient times to the present|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|others=Northrup, Cynthia Clark, 1959–|year=2015|isbn=0765680580|edition=[Enhanced Credo edition]|location=Armonk, NY|pages=72|oclc=889717964}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter of Maricourt]] wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe in the last half of the 13th century entitled ''Nova compositio astrolabii particularis''. Universal astrolabes can be found at the History of Science Museum in Oxford.

English author [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343–1400) compiled ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' for his son, mainly based on [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Messahalla]]. The same source was translated by French astronomer and astrologer Pélerin de Prusse and others. The first printed book on the astrolabe was ''Composition and Use of Astrolabe'' by [[Christian of Prachatice]], also using Messahalla, but relatively original.

In 1370, the first Indian treatise on the astrolabe was written by the [[Jainism|Jain]] astronomer [[Mahendra Suri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first=Thomas|editor1-last=Glick|editor2-first=Steven J.|editor2-last=Livesey|editor3-first=Faith|editor3-last=Wallis | title = Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia | date = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-96930-1 | page = 464 | display-editors = 1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;pg=PA464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified astrolabe, known as a ''balesilha'', was used by sailors to get an accurate reading of latitude while out to sea. The use of the ''balesilha'' was promoted by [[Prince Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]] (1394–1460) while out navigating for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889717964|title=Encyclopedia of world trade : from ancient times to the present|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|others=Northrup, Cynthia Clark, 1959–|year=2015|isbn=0765680580|edition=[Enhanced Credo edition]|location=Armonk, NY|pages=460|oclc=889717964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known metal astrolabe in Western Europe is the Destombes astrolabe made from brass in tenth-century Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1379&amp;lang=en |title=Qantara – 'Carolingian' astrolabe |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Marie Brown (2010), "The Abacus and the Cross". Page 140.  Basic Books.  {{ISBN|978-0-465-00950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal astrolabes avoided the warping that large wooden ones were prone to, allowing the construction of larger and therefore more accurate instruments. Metal astrolabes were heavier than wooden instruments of the same size, making it difficult to use them in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward the Setting Sun: Columbus, Cabot, Vespucci, and the Race for America|first=David|last=Boyle|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|date=2011|isbn=9780802779786|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x92SNeDpKqsC&amp;pg=PA253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The astrolabe was almost certainly first brought north of the Pyrenees by Gerbert of Aurillac (future [[Pope Sylvester II]]), where it was integrated into the [[quadrivium]] at the school in Reims, France sometime before the turn of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Marie Brown (2010), "The Abacus and the Cross".  Page 143. basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, French instrument maker Jean Fusoris (c. 1365–1436) also started remaking and selling astrolabes in his shop in [[Paris]], along with portable sundials and other popular scientific devices of the day.  Thirteen of his astrolabes survive to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58493.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One more special example of craftsmanship in early 15th-century Europe is the astrolabe designed by Antonius de Pacento and made by Dominicus de Lanzano, dated 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern (2010), ''Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit''. Band 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck. Cologne, S. 204. {{ISBN|978-3-86560-865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Johannes Stöffler]] published ''Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii'', a manual of the construction and use of the astrolabe. Four identical 16th-century astrolabes made by [[Georg Hartmann]] provide some of the earliest evidence for [[batch production]] by [[division of labor]].

===Astrolabes and clocks===

[[File:Het gebruik van het astrolabium door Amerigo Vespucci, Jan Collaert II, Museum Plantin-Moretus, PK.OPB.0186.018.jpg|thumb|[[Amerigo Vespucci]] observing the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] with an Astrolabium, by [[Jan Collaert II]]. [[Museum Plantin-Moretus]], [[Antwerp]], Belgium.]]

Mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, [[Richard of Wallingford]]'s clock (c. 1330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.{{sfn|North| 2005}}

Many astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous [[Prague Orloj|clock at Prague]], adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker Dr. Ludwig Oechslin designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with [[Ulysse Nardin]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024043/http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |archive-date=2 January 2011 |title=Astrolabium G. Galilei |website=Ulysse Nardin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch watchmaker Christaan van der Klauuw also manufactures astrolabe watches today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klaauw.com/ |title=Christaan van der Klauuw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An astrolabe consists of a disk, called the ''mater'' (mother), which is deep enough to hold one or more flat plates called ''tympans'', or ''[[Clime|climates]]''. A [[tympan]] is made for a specific [[latitude]] and is engraved with a [[stereographic projection]] of [[circle]]s denoting [[azimuth]] and [[altitude]] and representing the portion of the [[celestial sphere]] above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into [[hour|hours of time]], [[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the mater and tympan, the ''rete'', a framework bearing a projection of the [[ecliptic]] plane and several [[Pointer (rod)|pointers]] indicating the positions of the brightest [[star]]s, is free to rotate.  These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/astrolabe.htm|title=Star Names on Astrolabes|publisher=Ian Ridpath|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astrolabes have a narrow ''[[ruler|rule]]'' or ''label'' which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of [[declination]]s.

The rete, representing the [[sky]], functions as a [[star chart]]. When it is rotated, the stars and the [[ecliptic]] move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is therefore a predecessor of the modern [[planisphere]].

On the back of the mater there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and a graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge.  The ''[[alhidade|alidade]]'' is attached to the back face.  An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above.  When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read ("taken") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: "astron" (ἄστρον) = star + "lab-" (λαβ-) = to take.

'''Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company''' was a company founded in 1881 by [[Horace Darwin]] (1851–1928) and  [[Albert George Dew-Smith]] (1848–1903) to manufacture [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]].

Darwin was first apprenticed to an engineering firm in Kent, and returned to Cambridge in 1875. Dew-Smith was an engineer, photographer and instrument maker who was at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] with Darwin.  Darwin's grandson [[Erasmus Darwin Barlow]] was later chairman.

Designed between 1884/85, The rocking [[microtome]] was one of Darwin's most successful designs which continued to be manufactured until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co| url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Cambridge_Scientific_Instrument_Co | publisher=gracesguide.co.uk | accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[partnership]] became a [[Limited Liability Company]] in 1895. In 1920 it took over the [[Robert W. Paul|R.W. Paul Instrument Company of London]], and became The Cambridge and Paul Instrument Company Ltd. The name was shortened to the Cambridge Instrument Company Ltd. in 1924 when it was converted to a [[Public limited company]]. The company was finally taken over by the [[George Kent Group]] in 1968, forming the largest independent British manufacturer of industrial instruments.

Several early employees went on to further renown, including [[Robert Stewart Whipple]], who was appointed personal assistant to Horace Darwin in 1898, and later became Managing Director and Chairman of the company. His collection of scientific instruments later formed the basis of the [[Whipple Museum of the History of Science]] in 1944. [[William George Pye|William G. Pye]], who had joined as foreman in 1880, left in 1898 to form the W.G. Pye Instrument Company with his son, which ultimately become the [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] group of companies.

[[Image:Chocolate fountain.jpg|thumb|A commercial '''chocolate fountain''' in a shop in [[Brussels, Belgium]]]]
A '''chocolate fountain''' is a device for serving [[chocolate]] [[fondue]]. Typical examples resemble a stepped [[cone (geometry)|cone]], standing 2–4 feet tall with a [[fountain|crown]] at the top and stacked [[tiers]] over a basin at the bottom. The basin is heated to keep the chocolate in a liquid state so it can be pulled into a center cylinder then vertically transported to the top of the fountain by an [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedes screw]]. From there it flows over the tiers creating a chocolate "[[waterfall]]" in which food items like [[strawberries]] or [[marshmallows]] can be dipped.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
"Chocolate fountain machines" were invented by Ben Brisman and popularized in 1991 by a Canadian company called [[Design &amp; Realisation]]. They did not become very popular until Design &amp; Realisation began displaying these fountains at the National Restaurant Show in Chicago, starting in the early 1990s.

Jay Harlan (an entrepreneur and former Marriott catering executive) collaborated with D &amp; R to introduce the chocolate fountain to the U.S. hotel and resort industry.  Jay Harlan's company (Buffet Enhancements International) began distributing the D &amp; R fountain in the U.S. in 2001. It wasn't long after 2001 that Buffet Enhancements copied and improved the D &amp; R fountain idea and began manufacturing their own American-made version.

== Types ==
Chocolate fountains can be categorized as commercial-use and personal-use.
Commercial Chocolate Fountains can be categorized as Auger system and Pump system.

[[Image:Woman-using-chocolate-fountain.jpg|thumb|Woman using a home chocolate fountain]]

Commercial chocolate fountains usually range in size from about 20" inches to 50" inches tall and are designed for use in professional environments such as [[catering]].  These fountains are normally constructed of food-grade stainless steel and, as such, are quite durable.  Depending on the model, commercial chocolate fountains may hold as much as 35 pounds of chocolate. Originally, chocolate fountains consisted of multiple tiers that formed curtains of chocolate. New models on the market now have a 'cup' design, dropping chocolate from cup to cup which can be much more chocolate efficient than traditional models, and save quite a lot of money.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Home chocolate fountains range in size up to about 19" tall.  They are primarily made of plastic and may have some stainless steel components (although all-stainless models do exist) and are usually dishwasher safe.  Home chocolate fountains normally hold 6 or fewer pounds of chocolate.

== Chocolate ==
Melted chocolate is very temperamental, so rich [[couverture chocolate]], which is high in [[cocoa butter]], is commonly used to ensure consistent flow. If the cocoa butter content of the chocolate is too low, an additive must be mixed in to decrease viscosity.  (Vegetable oil is most commonly used to do this.)  But even couverture chocolate—unless specifically designed for fountains—often still requires an additive to make it flow smoothly.  Because of this, it is highly recommended that chocolate formulated specifically for fountains be used to avoid the need for the addition of vegetable oil, as the oil gives a slimy, gritty taste and texture to the chocolate.  Few chocolate fountains are capable of melting chocolate directly in the basin, so chocolate is typically melted in a microwave or double boiler before pouring it into the fountain.

The fluid dynamics of home chocolate fountains are particularly problematic (it is a so-called [[non Newtonian fluid]] [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1115/251115-chocolate-fountain-physics]), since the gravitational forces are much lower than the viscous forces; this means that small chocolate fountains need a very high proportion of vegetable oil. There is a trade-off between looks and taste: if perfect smooth flow may be sacrificed, it's possible to use non-oily chocolate.

A cheaper alternative to couverture chocolate is chocolate-flavored syrup, also called "chocolate coating".  Chocolate coating is already in liquid form and costs much less than couverture chocolate - although many would argue{{who|date=January 2015}} that the extra expense of gourmet Belgian couverture chocolate is more than worth it. Another alternative is to use dark chocolate, such as 70% cocoa chocolate. This contains much less sugar, so it isn't so sticky; a small quantity of hot water may be added to thin it further.

==Increasing popularity==
Originally, the market was entirely commercial, with chocolate fountains costing a large amount of money and requiring significant upkeep. The popularity of chocolate fountains grew to a point of demand at a consumer retail level as people who had seen commercial models at catered events inquired about purchasing their own fountains. Then, at the end of 2004, the [[Hellmann Group]] began marketing the Nostalgia Chocolate Fountain for personal use.

This expansion into the retail market caused the demand to peak drastically. As a result, the catering industry saw more requests for chocolate fountains at events. Flavoring oils such as mint, orange, and cappuccino were developed to give the chocolate extra taste. Caterers began adding food coloring to white chocolate to make it coincide with special holidays or events.  Caterers and home users created special recipes for a variety of fondues that would flow well in a fountain; some of the more popular recipes included caramel, cheese, maple syrup, ranch dressing, and BBQ sauce.  Because of the growing practice of using chocolate fountains for other types of fondue, chocolate fountains became interchangeably referred to as "fondue fountains".{{cite web |url=http://www.addictedtofondue.com/chocolate-fountains-explained/ |title=Chocolate Fountains Explained |access-date=11 June 2016}}

Today, commercial chocolate fountains are a common fixture at well-to-do galas, weddings, and catered parties; while home chocolate fountains are more commonly seen at birthday parties and friendly gatherings.

New models often incorporate more than one flavour of chocolate and a 'cup' design in place of the traditional tiered models. These models are designed to cater to new customer desires, to decrease the amount of chocolate needed and chocolate wastage.

The Jean-Philippe [[Patisserie]] at the [[Bellagio (Hotel and Casino)|Bellagio Casino]] in [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]], [[Nevada]] is home to the world's tallest chocolate fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellagio.com/pages/about_press_pressrelease.asp?PressID=108 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045728/http://bellagio.com/pages/about_press_pressrelease.asp?PressID=108 |archivedate=2007-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Computer Says No'''", or the "'''Computer says no attitude'''", is the popular name given to an attitude seen in some public-facing organisations where the default response to a customer’s request is to check with information stored on or generated by a computer, and then make decisions based on that, often in the face of [[common sense]].

There may also be an element of deliberate unhelpfulness towards customers and service-users, whereby more ''could'' be done to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome, but is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Computer+says+no+but+we+need+our+say%3b+BEHIND+THE+HEADLINES.-a0214819160 |title=Computer Says No but We Need Our Say |work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] |date=20 December 2009|last=Bird|first=Jackie |via=[[Free Online Library]] |accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name gained popularity through the British [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Little Britain]]''.&lt;ref name=bank&gt;{{cite web|author=Bank accounts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/bank-accounts/10324271/Who-to-blame-when-computer-says-no.html |title=Who to blame when 'computer says no'? |work=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Little Britain'' ==
In ''Little Britain'', "Computer Says No" is the catchphrase of the character [[Carol Beer]] (played by [[David Walliams]]), a bank worker and later holiday rep and hospital receptionist, who always responds to a customer's enquiry by typing it into her computer and responding with "Computer Says No" to even the most reasonable of requests. When asked to do something aside from asking the computer, she would shrug and remain obstinate in her unhelpfulness, and ultimately cough in the customer's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

==Usage== 
The "Computer Says No" attitude often comes from larger companies that rely on information stored electronically. When this information is not updated, it can often lead to refusals of financial products or incorrect information being sent out to customers.&lt;ref name=bank /&gt; These situations can often be resolved by an employee updating the information; however, when this cannot be done easily, the "Computer Says No" attitude can be viewed as becoming prevalent when there is unhelpfulness as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peachey |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8105015.stm |title=When the bank's computer says no |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude can also occur when an employee fails to read human emotion in the customer and reacts according to his or her professional training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Pat |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28437-professionals-your-time-is-up-prepare-to-be-sidelined-by-tech/ |title=Professionals, your time is up, prepare to be sidelined by tech |work=New Scientist |date=2015-11-03 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or relies upon a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lythe |first=Ruth |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-3210669/The-lives-wrecked-COMPUTER-SAYS-NO-Major-report-reveals-human-toll-inflexible-customer-service-banks-insurers.html |title=The lives wrecked because COMPUTER SAYS NO: Major report reveals human toll of inflexible customer service by banks and insurers |publisher=This is Money |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude also crops up when larger companies rely on computer credit scores and do not meet with a customer to discuss his or her individual needs, instead basing a decision upon information stored in computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortgages: 'Computer says no' issues hitting the self-employed|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/mortgages-computer-says-no-issues-hitting-the-self-employed-1-1803711|website=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations attempt to offset this attitude by moving away from reliance on electronic information and using a human approach towards requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31412044.html |title=Planners' move from 'computer says no' response is welcome |work=Mid-Devon Gazette |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Computer Says No" happens in a more literal sense when computer systems employ filters that prevent messages being passed along, as when these messages are perceived to include obscenities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14177">{{Modulation techniques}}
In [[radio]], a '''detector''' is a device or circuit that extracts [[information]] from a [[modulated]] [[radio frequency]] current or voltage. The term dates from the first three decades of radio (1888-1918). Unlike modern radio stations which transmit sound (an [[audio signal]]) on an uninterrupted [[carrier wave]], early radio stations transmitted information by ''[[radiotelegraphy]]''. The transmitter was switched [[On-off_keying|on and off]] to produce long or short periods of radio waves, spelling out text messages in [[morse_code|Morse code]]. Therefore, early [[radio receiver|radio receivers]] had only to distinguish between the presence or absence of a radio signal. The device that performed this function in the receiver circuit was called a ''detector''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xHNBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA364#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false J. A. Fleming, ''The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony'', London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1919, p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of different detector devices, such as the [[coherer]], [[electrolytic detector]], [[magnetic detector]] and the [[crystal detector]] were used during the wireless telegraphy era until superseded by vacuum tube technology.

After sound ([[amplitude modulation]], AM) transmission began around 1920, the term evolved to mean a [[demodulator]], (usually a [[vacuum tube]]) which extracted the [[audio signal]] from the radio frequency [[carrier wave]].  This is its current meaning, although modern detectors usually consist of [[semiconductor diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, or [[integrated circuit]]s.

In a [[superheterodyne receiver]] the term is also sometimes used to refer to the [[frequency mixer|mixer]], the tube or transistor which converts the incoming radio frequency signal to the [[intermediate frequency]].  The mixer is called the '''first detector''', while the demodulator that extracts the audio signal from the intermediate frequency is called the '''second detector'''.

In microwave and millimeter wave technology the terms ''detector'' and ''crystal detector'' refer to waveguide or coaxial transmission line components, used for power or SWR measurement, that typically incorporate point contact diodes or surface barrier Schottky diodes.

== Amplitude modulation detectors ==

=== Envelope detector ===
[[File:Simple envelope detector.svg|thumb|300x300px|A simple envelope detector]]
[[File:Simplest crystal radio circuit.svg|thumb|right|upright|A simple crystal radio with no tuned circuit can be used to listen to strong AM broadcast signals]]
One major technique is known as envelope detection. The simplest form of [[envelope detector]] is the diode detector that consists of a [[diode]] connected between the input and output of the circuit, with a [[resistor]] and [[capacitor]] in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground to form a [[low pass filter]]. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit will be a nearly identical voltage-shifted version of the original signal.

An early form of envelope detector was the [[crystal detector (radio)|crystal detector]], which was used in the [[crystal set]] radio receiver. A later version using a crystal diode is still used in crystal radio sets today. The limited frequency response of the headset eliminates the RF component, making the low pass filter unnecessary. 

More sophisticated envelope detectors include the [[grid-leak detector]], the [[plate detector (radio)|plate detector]], the [[Plate detector (radio)#Infinite-Impedance Detector|infinite-impedance detector]], transistor equivalents of them and [[precision rectifier]]s using operational amplifiers.

=== Product detector ===

A [[product detector]] is a type of [[demodulator]] used for [[amplitude modulation|AM]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] signals, where the original carrier signal is removed by multiplying the received signal with a signal at the [[carrier frequency]] (or near to it). Rather than converting the envelope of the signal into the decoded waveform by rectification as an envelope detector would, the product detector takes the product of the modulated signal and a [[local oscillator]], hence the name. By [[heterodyning]], the received signal is mixed (in some type of nonlinear device) with a signal from the local oscillator, to give sum and difference frequencies to the signals being mixed, just as a ''first mixer'' stage in a [[superhet]] would produce an [[intermediate frequency]]; the '''beat frequency''' in this case, the low frequency [[modulation|modulating signal]] is recovered and the unwanted high frequencies [[Low-pass filter|filtered out]] from the output of the product detector. 

Product detector circuits are and so essentially [[ring modulator]]s or [[synchronous detector]]s and closely related to some [[phase-sensitive detector]] circuits.  They can be implemented using something as simple as [[ring modulator|ring of diode]]s or a single dual-gate [[Field Effect Transistor]] to anything as sophisticated as an [[Integrated Circuit]] containing a [[Gilbert cell]].

== Frequency and phase modulation detectors ==
AM detectors cannot demodulate {{Anchor|Slope detection}} [[Frequency modulation|FM]] and [[Phase modulation|PM]] signals because both have a [[Amplitude#Waveform_and_envelope|constant amplitude]].  However an AM radio may detect the sound of an FM broadcast by the phenomenon of '''slope detection''' which occurs when the radio is tuned slightly above or below the nominal broadcast frequency. Frequency variation on one sloping side of the radio tuning curve gives the amplified signal a corresponding local amplitude variation, to which the AM detector is sensitive. Slope detection gives inferior distortion and noise rejection compared to the following dedicated FM detectors that are normally used.

=== Phase detector ===

A phase detector is a [[nonlinear]] device whose output represents the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference between the two oscillating input signals. It has two inputs and one output: a reference signal is applied to one input and the phase or frequency modulated signal is applied to the other. The output is a signal that is proportional to the phase difference between the two inputs.

In phase demodulation the information is contained in the amount and rate of phase shift in the [[carrier wave]].

The detector consists of a special center-tapped [[transformer]] feeding two diodes in a full wave DC [[rectifier]] circuit. When the input transformer is tuned to the signal frequency, the output of the discriminator is zero. When there is no deviation of the carrier, both halves of the center tapped transformer are balanced. As the FM signal swings in frequency above and below the carrier frequency, the balance between the two halves of the center-tapped secondary is destroyed and there is an output voltage proportional to the frequency deviation.

The output in this case is taken between the sum of the diode voltages and the center tap. The output across the diodes is connected to a large value capacitor, which eliminates AM noise in the ratio detector output. The ratio detector has the advantage over the Foster-Seeley discriminator that it will not respond to [[Amplitude modulation|AM signals]], thus potentially saving a limiter stage; however the output is only 50% of the output of a discriminator for the same input signal. The ratio detector has wider bandwidth but more distortion than the Foster-Seeley discriminator.

===Quadrature detector===
In quadrature detectors, the received FM signal is split into two signals.  One of the two signals is then passed through a [[Reactance (electronics)|high-reactance]] [[capacitor]], which shifts the phase of that signal by 90 degrees. This phase-shifted signal is then applied to an LC circuit, which is resonant at the FM signal's unmodulated, "center," or "carrier" frequency. If the received FM signal's frequency equals the center frequency, then the two signals will have a 90-degree [[phase difference]] and they are said to be in "phase quadrature" — hence the name of this method.  The two signals are then multiplied together in an analog or digital device, which serves as a phase detector; that is, a device whose output is proportional to the phase difference between two signals. In the case of an unmodulated FM signal, the phase detector's output is — after the output has been [[electronic filter|filtered]]; that is, averaged over time — constant; namely, zero.  However, if the received FM signal has been modulated, then its frequency will vary from the center frequency.  In this case, the resonant LC circuit will further shift the phase of the signal from the capacitor, so that the signal's total phase shift will be the sum of the 90 degrees that's imposed by the capacitor and the positive or negative phase change that's imposed by the LC circuit.  Now the output from the phase detector will differ from zero, and in this way, one recovers the original signal that was used to modulate the FM carrier.

This detection process can also be accomplished by combining, in an [[XOR gate|exclusive-OR]] (XOR) logic gate, the original FM signal and a [[square wave]] whose frequency equals the FM signal's center frequency.  The XOR gate produces an output pulse whose duration equals the difference between the times at which the square wave and the received FM signal pass through zero volts.  As the FM signal's frequency varies from its unmodulated center frequency (which is also the frequency of the square wave), the output pulses from the XOR gate become longer or shorter.  (In essence, this quadrature detector converts an FM signal into a [[pulse width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] (PWM) signal.)  When these pulses are filtered, the filter's output rises as the pulses grow longer and its output falls as the pulses grow shorter.  In this way, one recovers the original signal that was used to modulate the FM carrier.

* Weiss discriminator which uses a single LC tuned circuit or crystal

==Phase-locked loop detector==
The [[phase-locked loop]] detector requires no frequency-selective LC network to accomplish demodulation. In this system, a [[voltage controlled oscillator]] (VCO) is [[phase lock]]ed by a [[feedback loop]], which forces the VCO to follow the frequency variations of the incoming FM signal. The low-frequency error voltage that forces the VCO's frequency to track the frequency of the modulated FM signal is the demodulated audio output.

Between the late 1990s and 2000, Napolis posted a series of [[pseudonym]]ous accusations alleging that individuals skeptical of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]] were involved in a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to [[cover-up]] the [[sexual abuse]] and [[murder]] of children.

In 2001, she was charged with [[stalking]] film director [[Steven Spielberg]], and in 2002 faced more charges for making [[death threat]]s against actress [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]],&lt;ref name = Sauer2002&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | last = Sauer | first = M | date = 2002-12-31 | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | title = Stalking suspect to undergo more psychological tests | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20021231-9999_1m31stalker.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was committed to a state hospital until fit to stand trial.  After a year in prison Napolis pleaded guilty to stalking and was released on [[probation]].

==Satanic ritual abuse allegations==
Napolis originally worked as a [[Social work|child protection worker]] for nearly 10 years (leaving the position in 1996), becoming involved in the [[satanic ritual abuse]] (SRA) [[moral panic]] that arose in the early 1980s. By the late 1990s the phenomenon was rejected by mainstream scholars and law enforcement experts, but Napolis continued to believe in the existence of SRA. Napolis held that those who had discredited the phenomenon were themselves [[child sexual abuse|child abusers]] involved in a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to conceal their activities from the public.&lt;ref name = Cyberstalking/&gt;

Posting under the screen name "Curio", Napolis began a pattern of on-line harassment against those she believed were involved in the conspiracy, posting information about the individuals. Among those she targeted were Carol Hopkins, a school administrator who was part of a [[grand jury]] in [[San Diego, California]] that criticized social workers for removing children from their home without reason; Michael Aquino, a member of the [[Temple of Set]] and a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army Reserve]] against whom accusations of SRA were made but dropped as the accusations proved to be impossible;&lt;ref name = Wired&gt;{{cite web | last = Craddock | first = A | url = https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/05/3970 | title = Satanist Sues ISP to Silence Usenet Poster | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2009-12-04 | date = 1997-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Loftus]], a professor who studied [[memory]] who believed [[coercion|coercive]] questioning techniques by poorly-trained investigators led to young children making [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name = Cyberstalking/&gt;&lt;ref name = DeYoung/&gt; Loftus was confronted at a [[New Zealand]] academic conference by a group of people who accused her of conspiring to help [[child molestation|child molesters]], with information consisting largely of the postings made by Napolis.&lt;ref name = Cyberstalking/&gt;  Napolis' actions against Aquino also led to the first ever lawsuit in the state of California that attempted to place responsibility for a [[Usenet]] poster's actions on their [[internet service provider]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Internet provider sued over postings: S.D. company targeted in defamation case | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/1243471461.html?dids=1243471461:1243471461&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1997&amp;author=Thomas+Kupper&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Internet+provider+sued+over+postings+%7c+S.D.+company+targeted+in+defamation+case&amp;pqatl=google | last = Kupper | first = T | accessdate = 2009-12-04 | date = 1997-06-24 | work = [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first to be filed under the United States [[Communications Decency Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB720BB2C33E809&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title = Lawsuit to test internet decency law cult's leader fought off child sex abuse charges | date = 1997-05-24 | accessdate = 2009-12-04 | work = [[San Jose Mercury News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using public computers in internet cafes and libraries, Napolis concealed her identity for five years while continuing to post information on-line about those she believed were involved in the conspiracy. In 2000, private researcher Michelle Devereaux and the [[San Diego State University]] police tracked Napolis and caught her in the act of posting information as Curio on-line from a campus lab. No charges were filed, but by revealing her identity, those Napolis had harassed ceased to consider her a serious threat.&lt;ref name = Cyberstalking/&gt; The story was reported in ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name = Sauer2000/&gt; which was added to her on-line list of harassing parties.&lt;ref name = Sauer2002/&gt;

==Celebrity harassment==

===Steven Spielberg===
In the fall of 2001, [[Steven Spielberg]] filed a [[restraining order]] against Napolis after she made harassing telephone calls to him. Napolis claimed Spielberg and his wife were part of a satanic cult operating out of his basement that had implanted a [[microchip implant (human)|microchip]] called "soulcatcher" in her brain, an accusation to which Spielberg replied "To state the obvious, I am not involved with any form of manipulating Ms. Napolis's mind or body through remote technology or otherwise." Spielberg also expressed concern for the safety and security of his family.&lt;ref name = Mirror/&gt;  His security team indicated they believed Napolis to be suffering from a [[delusional disorder]] and posed "a serious risk of violent confrontation".  The judge ruled Napolis was barred from approaching within 150 meters of Spielberg and believed her to be a "credible threat" to the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Spielberg wins order banning cult stalker | publisher = [[The Australian]] | date = 2002-10-23 | pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jennifer Love Hewitt===
On September 18, 2002, Napolis "verbally confronted" [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] while entering the [[44th Grammy Awards|2002 Grammy Awards]], and the subsequent day attempted to pose as a friend of the actress to enter the premiere of ''[[The Tuxedo]]''.  On October 10 Napolis again tried to confront Hewitt at a filming, and e-mailed several death threats to the actress later that month.&lt;ref name = Sauer2002/&gt;  In December 2002, Napolis was arrested for [[stalking]] and making death threats against Hewitt, charged with six [[Felony|felonies]],&lt;ref name = DeYoung&gt;{{cite book |author=De Young, Mary |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |oclc= |doi= | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA234 234–5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remanded to San Diego County Jail on $500,000 [[bail]].&lt;ref name = Sauer2002/&gt;  At her hearing, Napolis also admitted to becoming involved in a shoving match with Hewitt's mother while confronting the actress.&lt;ref name = Sauer2002/&gt;  Napolis accused the actress and Spielberg of being part of a satanic conspiracy and using [[mind control]]ling "cybertronic" technology to manipulate her body.  Napolis was [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to [[Patton State Hospital]] in 2003 for three years or until fit to stand trial.&lt;ref name = Cyberstalking/&gt;

After nearly a year in jail (including five months in a state psychiatric facility where she was judged [[delusion]]al but fit to stand trial),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,626932,00.html | title = J.Love Stalker Case Ends in Guilty Plea | publisher = [[People (magazine)|People.com]] | last = Silverman | first = SM | date = 2003-09-30 | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napolis pleaded guilty to stalking on September 29, 2003, receiving five years probation; in addition, she was required to enroll in a [[Counseling psychology|counseling]] program, surrender all weapons and firearms, abstain from drugs and alcohol and refrain from using computers. Napolis was also barred from any contact with Spielberg, Hewitt and their families for 10 years and was required by the judge to continue taking prescribed medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Woman Who Stalked Actress Sentenced to Probation, Mental Health Counseling | publisher = City News Service | date = 2003-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in 1992 by David Hebel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=OSBB&amp;d_place=OSBB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10526C82B0F99B7F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|date=2001-03-19|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Dimension Technologies Media Group as a developer of third party products for the [[Video Toaster]].  In 1995 the company released ''Club Toaster'' which was a monthly CD-ROM based product for the Amiga.  The product contained animated backgrounds, still graphics, music, photos, articles, and product reviews.  By 1997 Dimension Technologies was looking to move from developing for the [[Amiga]] and instead focus on Windows and Mac based content.  The company renamed itself in 1997 to ''Digital Juice'' after the release of their first non-Amiga based product, ''Digital Juice for PowerPoint''.&lt;ref name="PCMAGAZINE2002"&gt;{{cite news |title= Pump Up Your PowerPoint Presentations|url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,7607,00.asp|publisher =[[PC Magazine]] | first= Jay |last= Munroe |date= 2001-06-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Digital Juice introduced their own online network called '''Digital Juice Television'''. At first it was limited to simple product demos and trade show coverage, but was expanded in early 2006 to include several new series involving tutorials and training videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventdv.net/Articles/News/Breaking-News/Digital-Juice-Announces-the-Launch-of-Digital-Juice-Television-38916.htm |title=Digital Juice Announces the Launch of Digital Juice Television |date=2006-08-17 |publisher=EventDV.net |accessdate=9 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723124033/http://www.eventdv.net/Articles/News/Breaking-News/Digital-Juice-Announces-the-Launch-of-Digital-Juice-Television-38916.htm |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Digital Juice finalized acquisition of The Ballistic Pixel Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunbiz.org/COR/2007/1024/70279107.tif|title=The Ballistic Pixel Labs For Profit Corporation Reinstatement|date=2007-10-24|publisher=Florida Department of State Division of Corporations|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toisa Perseus&amp;Discoverer Enterprise.jpg|thumb|In the foreground, offshore support vessel ''Toisa Perseus'' with the fifth-generation deepwater drillship ''[[Discoverer Enterprise]]''.]]

A '''drillship''' is a merchant vessel designed for use in exploratory offshore drilling of new oil and gas wells or for scientific drilling purposes. In most recent years the vessels are used in deepwater and ultra-deepwater applications, equipped with the latest and most advanced [[dynamic positioning]] systems.

==History==
The first drillship was the [[CUSS I]], designed by Robert F. Bauer of Global Marine in 1955. The CUSS I had drilled in 400 feet deep waters by 1957.&lt;ref name="Schempf"&gt;Schempf, F. (2007). Pioneering Offshore : The Early Years. [Tulsa, OK]: PennWell Custom Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert F. Bauer became the first president of the Global Marine in 1958.&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt;

In 1961 Global Marine started a new drillship era. They ordered several self-propelled drillships each with a rated centerline drilling of 20,000 foot-wells in water depths of 600 feet. The first was named CUSS ([[GlobalSantaFe Corporation|Glomar]]) II, a 5,500-deadweight-ton vessel, Costing around $4.5 million. Built by a Gulf Coast shipyard, the vessel was almost twice the size of the CUSS I, and became the world’s first drillship built as new construction which set sail in 1962.&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt;

In 1962 The Offshore Company elected to build a new type of drillship, larger than that of the Glomar class. This new drillships would feature a first ever anchor mooring array based on a unique turret system. The vessel was named Discoverer I. The Discoverer I had no main propulsion engines,&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt; meaning they needed to be towed out to the drill site.

==Application==
The drillship can be used as a platform to carry out well maintenance or completion work such as casing and tubing installation, subsea tree installations and well capping. Drillships are often built to the design specification to meet the requirements set by the oil production company and/or investors.

From the first drillship CUSS I to the Deepwater Asgard the fleet size has been growing ever since. In 2013 the worldwide fleet of drillships tops 80 ships, more than double its size in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/world/highvalueships/rigsonorder.htm | title = Drillship Building Statistics | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090917032912/http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/world/highvalueships/rigsonorder.htm | archivedate = 2009-09-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drillships are not only growing in size but also in capability with new technology assisting operations from academic research to ice-breaker class drilling vessels. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s decision in late March 2010 to expand U.S. domestic exploratory drilling seems likely to increase further developments of drillship technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/business/energy-environment/01drill.html | work=The New York Times | title=Risk Is Clear in Drilling; Payoff Isn't | first1=John M. | last1=Broder | first2=Clifford | last2=Krauss | date=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

[[File:Mohopix-1.gif|thumb|Drillship CUSS I.]]
Drillships are just one way to perform various types of drilling. This function can also be performed by [[semi-submersibles]], jackups, [[barges]], or platform rigs.

Drillships have the functional ability of semi-submersible drilling rigs and also have a few unique features that separate them from all others. First being the ship-shaped design. A drillship has greater mobility and can move quickly under its own propulsion from drill site to drill site in contrast to semi-submersibles and jackup barges and platforms. Drillships have the ability to save time sailing between oilfields worldwide. A drillship takes 20 days to move from the Gulf of Mexico to the Offshore Angola. Whereas, a semi-submersible drilling unit must be towed and takes 70 days.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"&gt;Leffler, W. , Sterling, G. , &amp; Pattarozzi, R. (2011). Deepwater Petroleum Exploration &amp; Production : A Nontechnical Guide. Tulsa, Okla.: PennWell Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Drillship construction cost is much higher than that of a semi-submersible. But although mobility comes at a high price, the drillship owners can charge higher day rates and get the benefit of lower idle times between assignments.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"/&gt;

The table below depicts the industry’s way of classifying drill sites into different vintages, depending on their age and water depth.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"/&gt;

The drilling operations are very detailed and in depth. A simple way to understand what a drillship is to do in order to drill, a marine riser is lowered from the drillship to the seabed with a blowout preventer (BOP) at the bottom that connects to the wellhead. The BOP is used to quickly disconnect the riser from the wellhead in times of emergency or in any needed situation.
Underneath the derrick is a moonpool, an opening through the hull covered by the rig floor. Some of the modern drillships have larger derricks that allow dual activity operations, for example simultaneous drilling and casing handling.

==Types==
There are different types of [[offshore drilling]] units such as the [[oil platform]], [[jackup rig]], [[submersible drilling rig]], [[semi-submersible]] platform and of course drillships. All drillships have what is called a ”moon pool”. The [[Moon pool]] is an opening on the base of the hull and depending on the mission the vessel is on, drilling equipment, small submersible crafts and divers may pass through the moon pool. Since the drillship is also a vessel, it can easily relocate to any desired location. But due to its mobility, drillships are not as stable compared to semi-submersible platforms. To maintain its position, drillships may utilize their anchors or use the ship’s computer-controlled system on board to run off their [[Dynamic positioning]].&lt;ref name="SOS-HOTLO"&gt;SOS-HOTLO.

The '''EditDroid''' is a computerized analog NLE ([[non-linear editing system]]), which was developed by [[Lucasfilm]] spin-off company, the Droid Works and Convergence Corporation who formed a [[joint venture]] company. The company existed up through the mid-80's to the early 90's in an attempt to move from analog editing methods to digital. EditDroid debuted at the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) 62nd Annual meeting in Las Vegas in 1984 concurrent with another editing tool that would compete with the EditDroid for all its years in production, the Montage Picture Processor. The EditDroid was never a commercial success and after the close of ''The Droid Works'' in 1987 and subsequent redevelopment of the product for seven years, the software was eventually sold to [[Avid Technology]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/history/ |title= Company History |publisher= Lucasfilm |accessdate= 2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 24 EditDroid systems were ever produced.

==Features==
The system is [[LaserDisc]]-based, relying on several LaserDisc players and a [[database]] system which queues up the clips in the order needed from the LaserDisc players in the most efficient way, so as to minimize skipping. This however isn't always possible. So if the edits aren't sufficiently close, the system isn't always fast enough to cue up the next clip.

It has three screens connected to it: one [[Sun-1]] computer display as the graphical UI for the product, one small preview video monitor, and one large rear-projected monitor containing "the cut" which was controlled by a custom controller.  The controller, called the TouchPad, features a KEM-style shuttle knob, a trackball, and a host of buttons with [[LED]] labels that changes in function depending on what the system was doing. The EditDroid pioneered the use of the graphical display for editing—introducing the timeline as well as digital picture icons to identify raw source clips.

Once the entire movie has been edited, an [[Edit Decision List]] of marked frames is turned over to a film laboratory where the actual pieces of [[film]] are spliced together in the correct order.

The EditDroid is obsolete by market standards, as the market for nonlinear editing systems has changed radically since its inception, with computer-based products like [[Final Cut Pro]] ranging entirely from the consumer to professional markets. In many respects the EditDroid was a concept demonstration of the future of editing, with a LaserDisc being a good 1980s simulation of what digital access would eventually become, and an editing interface and workflow that was more like today's methods than any of the videotape linear or analog nonlinear products leading up to the Avid/1 in 1990.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
{{unreferenced section |date=December 2014}}
There are numerous advantages of using a digital editing solution over the older analog solutions, such as the [[Moviola]]. Not only is it much faster to locate the clips needed, keeping track of what can in some cases amount to a staggering amount of footage, is also much easier digitally. Also, editing film digitally is a non-destructive process, whereas the analog process requires the actual cutting and taping together of pieces of film as well as manual syncing of sound.

Aside from the technological advantages of digital editing, in his book ''[[In the Blink of an Eye (book)|In the Blink of an Eye]]'', editor [[Walter Murch]] mourns the loss of the older analog solutions. Analog editing requires the editor to frequently move back and forth or [[Scrubbing (audio)|scrub]] in the source material to gain an overview, thus increasing one's familiarity with it. Since undoing an edit is such a laborious process, there is a high incentive to get the best edit cut the first time. This process which is not necessary to the same extent with NLE solutions in which one edit point can be made and undone very quickly.

Furthermore, LaserDisc has a fixed resolution, whereas film can be focused to look ideal at any display size.

While the [[LaserDisc]] format was brought to market in the late 1970s, first with the name of DiscoVision and later as LaserVision, and despite persistent promises from the [[Music Corporation of America]], a cheap method of recording LaserDiscs never surfaced.  This lack made it exceedingly difficult and cumbersome to create the needed LaserDiscs for the EditDroid.  Also at this time, the storage available on a [[hard disk]] was prohibitively small and extremely expensive.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Furthermore, many potential customers of the EditDroid were disappointed by the fact that while Lucasfilm Ltd. were the creators of the EditDroid, [[George Lucas]] had never in fact used the EditDroid on a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47225020|title=In the blink of an eye : a perspective on film editing|last=1943-|first=Murch, Walter,|date=2001|publisher=Silman-James Press|isbn=1879505622|edition= 2nd|location=Los Angeles, California|oclc=47225020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact stood in contrast to the fact that the EditDroid had been shown with ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' clips on numerous occasions at tradeshows and at demonstrations. Lucas eventually used his EditDroids in the early '90s on his series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''.

Independent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in the Romanian town of [[Galați]] but qualified in [[Berlin]]. During [[World War I]] she managed a hospital in Romania.

==Early life and education==
Elisa Zamfirescu was born in [[Galați]], [[Romania]] on 10 November 1887. Her father, Atanase Leonida, was a career officer while her mother, Matilda Gill, was the daughter of a French-born engineer.&lt;ref name=Marcu /&gt; Her brother [[Dimitrie Leonida]] was also an engineer.

Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, Zamfirescu was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians" /&gt; In 1909 she was accepted at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Royal Academy of Technology Berlin]], [[Charlottenburg]]. She graduated in 1912, with a degree in engineering.&lt;ref name=Marcu /&gt; It has been claimed that Zamfirescu was the world's first female engineer,&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cociuban|first1=Anca|title=Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu – First female engineer in the world|url=http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|website=Amazing Romanians|accessdate=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208215432/http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Englishwoman Nina Cameron Graham&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Only lady engineer (page3)|last=|first=|date=9 October 1912|work=Sheffield Evening Telegraph|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also gained a degree in civil engineering in 1912, from the University of Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;University of Liverpool archives PUB/1/1/3/18 (1924-25 copy) University Calendar: ‘1912, Graham, Nina Cameron (Mrs C.

==Career==
Returning to Romania, Zamfirescu worked as an assistant at the Geological Institute of Romania.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians" /&gt; During World War I, she joined the [[Red Cross]]&lt;ref name="Indy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michallon |first1=Clémence |title=Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu: 5 things you should know about one of the world's first female engineers |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-google-doodle-death-engineer-romania-red-cross-ww1-geology-a8626306.html |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=The Independent |date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a hospital at   [[Mărășești]] Romania. In 1917 her hospital received the wounded from the [[Battle of Mărășești]] between the German and the Romanian armies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was a victory by Romania over 28 days during which there were over 12,000 Romanian and over 10,000 of the invaders who were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/batalia-de-la-marasesti-pe-unde-nu-se-trece|title=Bătălia de la Mărăşeşti, pe unde nu se trece!|website=Historia.ro|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, she met and married chemist Constantin Zamfirescu, brother of the politician and writer [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]].&lt;ref name="TrueRomania" /&gt;

After the war, Zamfirescu returned to the Geological Institute. She led several geology laboratories and participated in various field studies, including some that identified new resources of coal, shale, natural gas, chromium, bauxite and copper. Zamfirescu also taught physics and chemistry.&lt;ref name=TrueRomania /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Zamfirescu retired in 1963, aged 75. In retirement she was involved in activism for [[disarmament]].&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt; She died at the age of 86 on 25 November 1973.

An award for women working in science and technology was established in her name, the [[Premiul Elisa Leonida-Zamfirescu]].&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Zamfirescu was the first woman member of A.G.I.R. (General Association of Romanian Engineers). A street in [[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]] of Bucharest bears her name,&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt; and she was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]] on the anniversary of her birthday in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-google-doodle-death-engineer-romania-red-cross-ww1-geology-a8626306.html|title=5 things you should know Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu, one of the world's first female engineers|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[commerce]] and [[management]], '''exnovation''', an opposite of [[innovation]], can occur when products and processes that have been tested and confirmed to be best-in-class are [[standardization|standardized]] to ensure that they are not innovated further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magsonwink.com/ECMedia/MagazineFiles/MAGAZINE-11/PREVIEW-6431/Business%20&amp;%20Economy%20October%202012-Preview.pdf Exnovation!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://tech-clarity.com/exnovate-product-portfolio/1350|title= Should You "Exnovate" your Product Portfolio? - Tech-Clarity|date= 2009-08-11|newspaper= Tech-Clarity|access-date= 2017-02-08|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://ldi.upenn.edu/voices/2014/04/29/the-exnovation-conundrum|title= The Exnovation Conundrum|date= 2015-02-11|newspaper= LDI|access-date= 2017-02-08|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.4psbusinessandmarketing.com/17112011/editorsdesk.asp?sid=4993&amp;pageno=2|title= The Mother of all Innovations Exnovation|website= www.4psbusinessandmarketing.com|access-date= 2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that have followed exnovation as a strategy  to improve organizational performance include [[General Electric]], [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[American Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.businessandeconomy.org/30102012/storyd.asp?sid=7052&amp;pageno=5|title= Exnovation! -|last= |first= |website= www.businessandeconomy.org|access-date= 2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the earliest usages of the term came in 1981, when John Kimberly referred to "removal of innovation from an organisation".&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly, J.R. (1981) 'Managerial Innovation'. In Nystorm, P.C. and Starbuck, W.H. (eds) Handbook of Organizational Design. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 84–104.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 [[Cult (book)|A. Sandeep]] provided the modern definition of exnovation as the philosophy of not innovating – in other words, ensuring that best-in-class entities are not innovated further. Since then "exnovation" has become a notable parlance in various practices, from management to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 27620686 | doi= 10.1111/1468-0009.12213 | volume= 94 | title= The exnovation of chronic care management processes by physician organizations | year= 2016 | journal= Milbank Quartlerly | last1= Rodriguez | first1= H | pmc=5020147 | pages=626–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 22040949 | doi= 10.1258/hsmr.2011.011014 | volume= 24 | title= Organizational readiness for innovation in health care: some lessons from the recent literature | year= 2011 | journal= Health Serv Manage Res | pages= 213–8 | last1 = Williams | first1 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Exnovation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=n4aQ00e6GtYC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=%22Exnovation%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ldMf3NNcvI&amp;sig=jrUc5y54QplbfawbqIr8nK0_8W0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBjgyahUKEwj-r_uOiYjGAhXjF6YKHTRkAHE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Exnovation%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title= Better But Not Well: Mental Health Policy in the United States since 1950|last= Frank|first= Richard G.|last2= Glied|first2= Sherry A.|authorlink2=Sherry Glied|date= 2008-04-01|publisher= JHU Press|isbn= 9780801889103|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://a--sandeep.blogspot.in/2011/11/exnovation-real-innovation.html|title= The mother of all innovations - Exnovation|website= a--sandeep.blogspot.in |access-date= 2017-02-08}}

'''External Short Messaging Entity''' ('''ESME''') is a term originally coined by [[Aldiscon]] to describe an external application that connects to a [[Short message service center|Short Message Service Center (SMSC)]] to engage in the sending and/or receiving of [[Short message service|SMS]] messages.

SME is a term used in many cellular circles to describe a network entity (mobile/cell phone) that can send/receive messages.  ESME (pronounced EZ-mee) is essentially one of these but without all the wireless aspects; i.e. it is connected via [[TCP/IP]], [[X.25]] or similar. On SMPP 3.4 protocol specifications ESME refers only to external sources and sinks of short messages as Voice Processing Systems, WAP Proxy Servers or Message Handling computers, and it specifically excludes SMEs which are located within the Mobile Network, i.e., a mobile station (MS).&lt;ref&gt;SMPP Developers ''Short Message Peer to Peer Protocol Specifications v3.4''. SMPP Developers Forum, 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical examples of ESMEs are systems that send automated marketing messages to mobile users and [[voting system]]s that process SMS votes (''[[Pop Idol]]'', ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'').

SMSC uses protocols such as [[SMPP]], [[Universal Computer Protocol|UCP]], [[Object Oriented Input System|OIS]], [[CIMD]], SMCI all of which denote the concept of an ESME connecting to an SMSC.

==Relation between SMSC and ESME==
ESME always connects to SMSC using a [[TCP/IP]], [[X.25]], etc. and then binds for the service it needs from SMSC.

For [[SMPP]] it can bind for Receiving only service, Transmitting only service or both (Transceiver service). Before [[SMPP]] 3.4 it was required to have two different connections, one for Transmitting and the other one for Receiving. Starting with [[SMPP]] 3.4 a Tranceiver connection is enough for both.

The relation between ESME and SMSC is somehow a master-slave relation because SMSC is providing services to ESME, and usually ESME just uses these services from SMSC.
One of the functions of the SMSC is to store and forward the messages while the ESME doesn't have this function. When a message is sent by an ESME to SMSC towards its destination, this message may stay in a SMSC queue until its destination will become available. During this time the ESME has the options to cancel the message in queue, to replace it or to check its status. ESME can also send a message to multiple destinations which will be handled by SMSC.

ESME are usually termination points of an SMS network while SMSC are the core of it. SMSC can connect between them while ESME only connects to an SMSC.
[[SMPP]] protocol is designed exactly in this manner for connecting a small end of the SMS network (which is an ESME) to the entire SMS network (which is done through the SMSC)

ESME is submitting MTs to SMSC, while SMSC is delivering MOs to ESME.

==Routing in SMSC for ESME==
An example of how the routing can be done at SMSC level, but not mandatory as this depends a lot on the implementation of SMSC and the way the connection inside the SMSC is between routing part of the SMSC and SMPP interface can be as below:
During the service agreement between ESME and service provider(SMSC side) one unique short code will be allocated to ESME. At the SMSC end smpp server will have list of all ESME address and active connection. When you send any message to short code, messages first comes to SMSC, SMSC decodes it according to GSM 3.4 spec, then one of the modules in SMSC checks the destination address and if it is short code then that module routes messages to SMPP server part of the SMSC. Now SMPP server will have all active connection, according to destination address it selects the ESME - SMPP server connection object, that object will be responsible to encode message according to SMPP protocol and forward to ESME.

Communication between SMSC and ESME can be on either SMPP or HTTP.
If you have SMPP account, you could connect to the SMPP IP+Port on TCP/IP and the SMPP will push MOs to ESME on SMPP connection, and ESME will push MTs on the same connection in reverse.
If you have HTTP account with the operator's SMSC, then the SMSC will submit MO to an URL given by you and to push MTs SMSC will give you on URL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">'''Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL)''' was a [[United States]]–[[Australia]]n–[[United Kingdom|British]] [[signals intelligence]] unit, founded in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], during [[World War II]]. It was one of two major [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] signals intelligence units, called [[Fleet Radio Unit]]s, in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatres]], the other being [[Station Hypo|FRUPAC]] (also known as Station HYPO), in [[Hawaii]].  FRUMEL was a US Navy organisation, reporting directly to CiCPAC (Admiral [[Chester Nimitz|Nimitz]]) in Hawaii and the Chief of Naval Operations (Admiral [[Ernest King|King]]) in Washington,{{sfn|Bou|2012|p=7}} and hence to the central crypographic organization.{{sfn|Bou|2012|p=40}} The separate [[Central Bureau]] in Melbourne (later [[Brisbane]]) was attached to (and reported to) MacArthur's Allied [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] command headquarters.

FRUMEL was established at the Monterey Apartments in [[Queens Road, Melbourne|Queens Road]], in early 1942, and was made up of three main groups. First was Lieutenant Rudolph J. (Rudi) Fabian's 75-man codebreaker unit, previously based at the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Station CAST]] in the [[Philippines]] before being evacuated by submarine on 8 April 1942. The second was Commander [[Eric Nave]]'s small [[Royal Australian Navy]]-supported cryptography unit, which had moved to the Monterey Apartments from [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]] in February 1942. Nave's unit was made up of a core of naval personnel, heavily assisted by university academics and graduates specialising in linguistics and mathematics (including from June 1941 a "cipher group" of four from [[Sydney University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Thomas Room]], [[Dale Trendall]], [[Athanasius Treweek]], Eric Barnes, Jack Davies and Ronald Bond.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1992) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was a trio of [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] linguists (Henry Archer, Arthur Cooper and Hubert Graves), and [[Royal Navy]] support staff, evacuated from [[Singapore]], particularly from the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB) there. IBM (punched-card) [[tabulating machine]]s were obtained in 1942 to replace that left behind in [[Manila Bay]] on leaving [[Corregidor]].

Nave and Fabian had a difficult relationship, and Nave eventually joined the Army's [[Central Bureau]] at Brisbane. According to Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1992) p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian wasted no time in getting rid of the civilian supernumaries at Monterey, many of them British service wives who had been evacuated from Singapore. He also squeezed out the British diplomatic corps types like Cooper and Archer. Eventually he seems to have succeeded in ousting Nave, who went to [[Central Bureau]], the joint Australian-US Army codebreaking unit in Brisbane. Men like Jamieson (A. B. Jamieson, Nave’s second recruit) and [[Athanasius Treweek|(Athanasius) Treweek]], who had cordial relations with the Americans, remained with FRUMEL throughout the war.

Fabian or his deputy John Lietweller were always in the office, 24 hours a day. Fabian was "a highly professional officer with an air of authority and a hint of Central European sophistication",&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1992) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was born in Butte, Montana, in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; But he "regarded co-operation with anyone who was not in the US Navy or under its command as poor security". One senior British officer said the atmosphere at FRUMEL was "What is yours is mine, and what is mine is my own", and Fabian (backed by Redman) was not interested in any exchange of material with the Army's Central Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) pp. 140–141 &amp; 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Fabian burnt a document in front of MacArthur's Intelligence Officer (G-2), Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], to demonstrate that only MacArthur himself and Sutherland could be present at FRUMEL briefings and that Willoughby was not allowed to see it.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=169, 170}}

[[Image:Frosting spatula.jpg|thumb|240px|Typical frosting spatula]]
A '''frosting spatula''' or '''palette knife''' is a kitchen utensil designed especially for the use of spreading a substance onto a flat surface, such as [[icing (food)|frosting]] on a [[cake]]. It is also an ideal tool for applying spreads onto sandwiches in mass quantities.

The term 'palette knife' is common outside the USA, where the term 'frosting' is not generally used. However a palette knife as a culinary tool is not the same as a [[palette knife]] as used by artists. In Canada, the terms '''metal spatula''' and '''leveler''' are used also.

The English television cook [[Delia Smith]] refers to the joys of owning a "palette knife with a serrated edge", such that it provides ease of slicing cake as well as the spreading of icing (frosting) upon them. 

The traditionally accepted British source "[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]" however refers only to the use of a "broad knife" for laying on icing (frosting).

The '''Fuel Cell Development Information Center''' (FCDIC) is a [[Japan]]ese center established in July 1986 to exchange information among its members on fuel cell research, development and deployment to speed up the introduction and penetration of [[fuel cell]]s into the market.

The FCDIC consists of 154 organizations, 40 academic individuals, and 3 foreign members. The organisation publishes the quarterly journal ''The Journal of Fuel Cell Technology'' and the latest fuel cell news in Japan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcdic.com/eng/news.html The latest fuel cell news in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial compressed gas cylinders used for [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]] of [[steel]].]]

A '''gas cylinder''' or [[Storage tank|tank]] is a [[pressure vessel]] for storage and containment of [[gas]]es at above [[atmospheric pressure]]. High-[[pressure]] gas cylinders are also called ''bottles''.  Inside the cylinder the stored contents may be in a state of compressed gas, vapor over liquid, [[supercritical fluid]], or dissolved in a substrate material, depending on the physical characteristics of the contents. A typical gas cylinder design is elongated, standing upright on a flattened bottom end, with the valve and fitting at the top for connecting to the receiving apparatus.

== Nomenclature==
In the United States, "bottled gas" typically refers to [[liquefied petroleum gas]]. "Bottled gas" is sometimes used in medical supply, especially for portable [[oxygen tank]]s. Packaged industrial gases are frequently called "cylinder gas", though "bottled gas" is sometimes used.

The [[United Kingdom]] and other parts of Europe more commonly refer to "bottled gas" when discussing any usage whether industrial, medical, or liquefied petroleum. However, in contrast, what the United States calls liquefied petroleum gas is known generically in the United Kingdom as "LPG"; and it may be ordered by using one of several [[trade name]]s, or specifically as [[butane]] or [[propane]] depending on the required heat output.

==Materials==
For a detailed discussion about the materials for gas cylinders see [[pressure vessel#Construction materials|pressure vessel]].

Design codes and application standards and the cost of materials dictated the choice of steel with no welds for most gas cylinders, treated to be [[anticorrosive]].  Some newly developed lightweight gas cylinders have been made from stainless steel and composite materials. Due to the very high tensile strength of [[carbon fiber]], these vessels can be very light, but are much more difficult to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Composite overwrapped pressure vessel]] for details&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and cylinder testing==
The transportation of high-pressure cylinders is regulated by many governments throughout the world. Various levels of testing are generally required by the governing authority for the country in which it is to be transported. In the United States, this authority is the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT). Similarly in the UK, the European transport regulations (ADR) are implemented by the Department for Transport (DfT). For Canada, this authority is [[Transport Canada]] (TC). Cylinders may have additional requirements placed on design and or performance from independent testing agencies such as [[Underwriter's Laboratory]] (UL). Each manufacturer of high-pressure cylinders is required to have an independent quality agent that will inspect the product for quality and safety.

Within the UK the '''"'''[[competent authority]]'''"'''&amp;nbsp;— the DfT&amp;nbsp;— implements the regulations and appointment of authorised cylinder testers is conducted by UKAS, who make recommendations to the VCA for approval of individual bodies.

There are a variety of tests that may be performed on various cylinders. Some of the most common types of tests are [[hydrostatic test]], burst test, [[tensile strength]], [[Charpy impact test]] and pressure cycling.

During the manufacturing process, vital information is usually stamped or permanently marked on the cylinder.  This information usually includes the type of cylinder, the working or service pressure, the serial number, date of manufacture, the manufacture's registered code and sometimes the test pressure.  Other information may also be stamped depending on the regulation requirements.

==Valve connections==
[[File:Gas regulator.jpg|thumb|right|A gas regulator attached to a nitrogen cylinder. From right&amp;nbsp;— cylinder valve, cylinder pressure gauge, pressure control valve (yellow), outlet pressure gauge, 3-way outlet terminated by needle valves.]]
Gas cylinders have a stop angle [[valve]] at the end on top.  During storage, transportation, and handling when the gas is not in use, a cap may be screwed over the protruding valve to protect it from damage or breaking off in case the cylinder were to fall over.  Instead of a cap, cylinders commonly have a protective collar or neck ring around the service valve assembly.

When the gas in the cylinder is to be used at low pressure, the cap is taken off and a pressure-regulating assembly is attached to the stop valve.  This attachment typically has a [[pressure regulator]] with upstream (inlet) and downstream (outlet) [[pressure gauge]]s and a further downstream [[needle valve]] and outlet connection.  For gases that remain gaseous under ambient storage conditions, the upstream pressure gauge can be used to estimate how much gas is left in the cylinder according to pressure. For gases that are liquid under storage, e.g., propane, the outlet pressure is dependent on the [[vapor pressure]] of the gas, and does not fall until the cylinder is nearly exhausted although it will vary according to the temperature of the cylinder contents. The regulator is adjusted to control the downstream pressure, which will limit the maximum flow of gas out of the cylinder at the pressure shown by the downstream gauge.  The outlet connection is attached to whatever needs the gas supply, such as a [[balloon]] for example. For some purposes, such as welding, the regulator will also have a [[flowmeter]] on the downstream side.

The valves on industrial, medical and diving cylinders are usually of different sizes and types, as are the valves for different categories of gases, making it more difficult to mistakenly misuse a gas. For example, a hydrogen cylinder does not fit an oxygen supply line which would end in catastrophic failure. Some fittings use a right-hand thread, while others use a [[Screw thread|left-hand thread]]; left-hand thread fittings are usually identifiable by notches or grooves cut into them.

In the United States, valve connections are sometimes referred to as "CGA connections", since the [http://www.cganet.com/ Compressed Gas Association] (CGA) publishes guidelines on what connections to use for what products; e.g., in the United States, an argon cylinder will have a CGA 580 connection on the valve.

High purity gases will sometimes use CGA-DISS ("Diameter Index Safety System") connections.

Medical gases may use the [[pin-index system]] to prevent incorrect connection of gases to services.

In the EU, [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] connections are more common than in the United States.

In the UK, the British Standards Institution sets the standards. Included among the standards is the use left-hand threaded valves for flammable gas cylinders (most commonly brass, BS4, valves for non corrosive cylinder contents or stainless steel, BS15, valves for corrosive contents). Non flammable gas cylinders are fitted with right-hand threaded valves (most commonly brass, BS3, valves for non corrosive components or stainless steel, BS14, valves for corrosive components).&lt;ref name = "BS341-3:2002"&gt;BS 341-3:2002, British Standards Institution, 389 Chiswick High Road, London, W4 4AL&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and standards==
[[File:2008-07-24 Bundle of compressed gas bottles.jpg|thumb|right|It would be safer to have cylinders individually anchored in a cool place, rather than chained in a cluster in the sun, as seen here.]]

Because the contents are under pressure and are sometimes [[hazardous material]]s,  handling bottled gases are regulated. Regulations may include chaining bottles to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards  If a compressed gas cylinder tips over, causing the valve block to be sheared off, the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain.

In a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder [[Boyle's law|rises in direct proportion to its temperature]]. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically.  If the vessel contents are flammable, this event may result in a "fireball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incident Insights - Trust But Verify|url=https://www.diversalertnetwork.org/diving-incidents/trust-but-verify|website=Divers Alert Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidisers such as oxygen and fluorine will produce a similar effect by accelerating combustion in the area affected. If the cylinder's contents are liquid, but become a gas at ambient conditions, this is commonly referred to as a [[boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion]] (BLEVE).

Medical gas cylinders in the UK and some other countries have a [[fusible plug]] of [[Wood's metal]] in the valve block between the valve seat and the cylinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This plug melts at a comparatively low temperature (70&amp;nbsp;°C) and allows the contents of the cylinder to escape to the surroundings before the cylinder is significantly weakened by the heat, lessening the risk of explosion.

More common pressure relief devices are a simple [[burst disc]] installed in the base of the valve between the cylinder and the valve seat.  A burst disc is a small metal [[gasket]] engineered to rupture at a pre-determined pressure.  Some burst discs are backed with a low-melting-point metal, so that the valve must be exposed to excessive heat before the burst disc can rupture.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The [[Compressed Gas Association]] publishes a number of booklets and pamphlets on safe handling and use of bottled gases.

===Color coding===
Gas cylinders are often [[Bottled gas#Colour coding|color-coded]], but the codes are not standard across different jurisdictions, and sometimes are not regulated. Cylinder color can not safely be used for positive product identification; cylinders have labels to identify the gas they contain.

== Common cylinder sizes ==
In [[scuba diving]], the United States measures cylinder volume by the amount of free air that can be compressed into the cylinder; Europe and most of the rest of the world measure the cylinder volume as the internal volume of the cylinder: e.g. United States 19 cubic feet = European 3 [[liter]] at 180 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].

The below are example cylinder sizes and do not constitute an industry standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1644">'''Glass cloth''' is a [[textile]] material, originally developed to be used in [[greenhouse]] paneling, allowing sunlight's [[ultraviolet]] rays to be filtered out, while still allowing [[Visible spectrum|visible]] light through to plants. The cloth is usually woven with the plain weave, and may be patterned in various ways, though checked cloths are the most common. The original cloth was made from [[linen]], but a large quantity is made with [[cotton]] [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[tow]] [[weft]], and in some cases they are composed entirely of [[cotton]]. Short fibres of the cheaper kind are easily detached from the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Glass cloth|volume=12|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[List of physical properties of glass|properties of glass]] such as heat resistance and an inability to ignite, glass has been used to create fire barriers in hazardous environments such as inside of racecars.  Its poor flexibility, and its being a source of skin irritation, made the fibers inadequate for apparel uses. 

During the Dust Bowl which were storms of the 1930s in the Southern Plains, states' health officials recommended attaching translucent glass cloth to the inside frames of windows to help in keeping the dust out of buildings, although people also used cardboard, canvas or blankets. Eyewitness accounts indicate they were not completely successful.&lt;ref&gt;''Dust Bowl, The Southern Plains in the 1930s...'' by Donald Worster. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GrIDsure''' was a [[personal identification]] system which extends the [[chip and PIN|standard ‘shared-secret’ authentication model]] to create a secure methodology whereby a dynamic ‘one-time’ password or PIN can be generated by a user. It was invented by Jonathan Craymer and Stephen Howes in November 2005. It has received positive media reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/veracode/156005.html |title=Media Products Overview |publisher=Mediaproducts.gartner.com |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ovum.com/news/euronews.asp?id=6300 |title=Telecoms and Software News |publisher=Ovum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715025611/http://www.ovum.com/news/euronews.asp?id=6300 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.it-analysis.com/business/compliance/content.php?cid=9686 |title=Superior accessible security |publisher=It-analysis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GrIDsure went into [[liquidation]] in October 2011 after investor funding dried up.&lt;ref name="crn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/2122095/stricken-gridsure-talks-trade-buyer | title=Stricken GrIDsure in talks with trade buyer | publisher=ChannelWeb | date=2 Nov 2011 | accessdate=March 22, 2012 | author=Woodburn, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2011 [http://www.cryptocard.com Cryptocard] announced it has acquired the intellectual property of GrIDsure which includes 8 patents that have been granted and a further 16 pending. Cryptocard was already a GrIDsure OEM partner and uses the product in their portfolio.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Authentication method==

In order to authenticate, the user is asked to input a series of numbers based on a preregistered pattern on a grid (that the user knows) and a grid of pseudo-random numbers generated by the authenticator. This results in a different series of numbers each time the user authenticates.&lt;ref name="technet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/fesnouf/archive/2009/08/29/strong-authentication-using-your-brain-iag-and-gridsure.aspx | title=Strong authentication using your Brain : IAG and Gridsure. | date=29 Aug 2009 | accessdate=March 22, 2012 | author=Esnouf, Frédéric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic reception==
A study was carried out on the statistical security of GrIDsure by [[Richard Weber (mathematician)|Richard Weber]] in the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Statistical Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He concluded "This is one of the most beautiful ideas I have seen in many years of looking at algorithms and optimisation problems." {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In March 2008, an independent security researcher, Mike Bond,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mkb23/ Mike Bond, Security Researcher]&lt;/ref&gt; identified flaws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mkb23/research/GridsureComments.pdf Mike Bond, Comments on Gridsure Authentication, 27 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Gridsure authentication scheme, specifically commenting on Weber's analysis,  and concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Gridsure authentication mechanism remains largely unproven. Studies so far are flawed or taken out of context; my own initial studies indicate further weaknesses."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The introduction to Dr Bond's paper states "This document is not intended to be a fully representative or balanced appraisal of the scheme."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[University College London]] conducted a usability trial.
In a covering letter to the study report, Professor Sasse states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Having looked at many mechanisms which have been proposed in recent years to overcome users' problems with PINs and passwords, this is the first one that has the potential to offer good usability and increased security at the same time."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A '''heater core''' is a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]-like device used in heating the cabin of a [[vehicle]]. Hot [[coolant]] from the vehicle's [[engine]] is passed through a winding tube of the core, a heat exchanger between coolant and cabin air. Fins attached to the core tubes serve to increase surface for heat transfer to air that is forced past them, by a fan, thereby heating the passenger compartment.

== How it works ==
[[Image:BMW E32 heater core.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Heater core (arrowed) in the partially disassembled dashboard of a [[BMW E32]].]]

The [[internal combustion engine]] in most [[car]]s and [[truck]]s is cooled by a water and antifreeze mixture that is circulated through the engine and radiator by a [[water pump]] to enable the [[radiator]] to give off engine heat to the atmosphere. Some of that water can be diverted through the heater core to give some engine heat to the cabin, or adjust the temperature of the conditioned air.

A heater core is a small [[radiator]] located under the [[dashboard]] of the vehicle, and it consists of conductive [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] tubing with cooling fins to increase surface area. Hot coolant passing through the heater core gives off heat before returning to the engine cooling circuit.

The [[Centrifugal fan|squirrel cage fan]] of the vehicle's ventilation system forces air through the heater core to transfer heat from the coolant to the cabin air, which is directed into the vehicle through vents at various points.

==Control==
Once the engine has warmed up, the coolant is kept at a more or less constant temperature by the [[Wax thermostatic element|thermostat]]. The temperature of the air entering the vehicle's interior can be controlled by using a valve limiting the amount of coolant that goes through the heater core. Another method is blocking off the heater core with a door, directing part (or all) of the incoming air around the heater core completely, so it does not get heated (or re-heated if the [[automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]] compressor is active). Some cars use a combination of these systems.

Simpler systems allow the driver to control the valve or door directly (usually by means of a rotary knob, or a lever). More complicated systems use a combination of [[actuator|electromechanical actuators]] and [[thermistor]]s to control the valve or doors to deliver air at a precise temperature value selected by the user.

Cars with dual climate function (allowing driver and passenger to each set a different temperature) may use a heater core split in two, where different amounts of coolant flow through the heater core on either side to obtain the desired heating.

==Air conditioning==

In a car equipped with [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], outside air, or cabin air if the recirculation flap has been set to close the external air passages, is first forced, often after being filtered by a [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|cabin air filter]], through the air conditioner's evaporator coil.  This can be thought of as a heater core filled with very cold liquid that is undergoing a phase change to gas (the evaporation), a process which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the heater core. In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action in regulating the compressor operation, amount of reheating and blower speed depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.

== Engine cooling function ==
Because the heater core cools the heated coolant from the engine by transferring its heat to the cabin air, it can also act as an auxiliary radiator for the engine. If the radiator is working improperly, the operator may turn the heat on (together with the cabin blower fan placed on full speed, and with the windows opened) in the passenger cabin, resulting in a certain cooling effect on the overheated engine coolant.  This idea only works to a certain degree, as the heater core is not large enough nor does it have enough cold air going through it to cool large amounts of coolant significantly.

== Possible problems ==
[[Image:picofdash.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Replacing a heater core in a Volkswagen Passat.]]

The heater core is made up of small piping that has numerous bends.  Clogging of the piping may occur if the coolant system is not flushed or if the coolant is not changed regularly. If clogging occurs the heater core will not work properly. If coolant flow is restricted, heating capacity will be reduced or even lost altogether if the heater core becomes blocked. Control valves may also clog or get stuck. Where a blend door is used instead of a control valve as a method of controlling the air's heating amount, the door itself or its control mechanism can become stuck due to [[thermal expansion]]. If the climate control unit is automatic, actuators can also fail.

Another possible problem is a leak in one of the connections to the heater core. This may first be noticeable by smell ([[ethylene glycol]] is widely used as coolant and has a sweet smell); it may also cause (somewhat greasy) fogging of the [[windshield]] above the windshield heater vent. Glycol may also leak directly into the car, causing wet upholstery or carpeting.

[[Electrolysis]] can cause excessive corrosion leading to the heater core rupturing. Coolant will spray directly into the passenger compartment followed with white colored smoke, a significant driving hazard.

Because the heater core is usually located under the dashboard inside of the vehicle and is enclosed in the ventilation system's ducting, servicing it often requires disassembling a large part of the dashboard, which can be labour-intensive and therefore expensive.

Since the heater core relies on the coolant's heat to warm the cabin air up, it obviously won't begin working until the engine's coolant warms up enough. This problem can be resolved by equipping the vehicle with an [[block heater|auxiliary heating system]], which can either use electricity or burn the vehicle's fuel in order to rapidly bring the engine's coolant to operating temperatures.

== Air cooled engines ==
Engines that do not have a water cooling system cannot heat the cabin via a heater core; one alternative is to guide air around the (very hot) engine [[exhaust manifold]] and then into the vehicle's interior. Temperature control is achieved by mixing with unheated outside air. Air-cooled Volkswagen engines use this method. Depending on the design, this can cause a safety issue where a leak in the exhaust system will begin to fill the passenger cabin with deadly fumes.

==Reuse for other purposes==
Car heat cores are also used for D.I.Y. projects, such as for cooling homemade [[Computer cooling|liquid cooling systems for computers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/liquid-cooled-pc3.htm/printable Reuse of heater cores for PC liquid cooling system]&lt;/ref&gt;

| ShortSummary    = Ramsay visits the town's historical hotel that the locals feel that they were out of place there, due to an atmosphere that they call upper crust. Robert, the hotel's owner, gives Ramsay a stunning room, but it smells of "raw sewage", owing to plumbing problems that were never fixed. Juniper Hill's restaurant not only overcharges for food at rates more befitting a gourmet restaurant, the food is also not properly cooked. The staff then tell their own stories of not being paid for their work, and when they are paid, they get just a fraction of the money owed. Ramsay then discovers that Robert and his boyfriend and co-owner Ari bring their friends to the hotel where they stay, eat and drink for free without leaving a tip. When they do leave a tip, Robert takes the money for himself. An employee then shows Ramsay Robert's four storage units, the basement and the office, which are all filled with antiques and collectibles. The visit comes to a head when Ramsay approaches Robert in his $100,000 motor coach to explain his findings, mandating that he calls a friend to explain the tip situation, only to be told that she left money with Robert. At that point, Ramsay storms out in his own SUV, ending the episode in a ''To Be Continued'' [[cliffhanger]].

| ShortSummary    = Ramsay, originally thinking that Juniper Hill was a lost cause, returns with an appraiser to determine the value of Robert's antique collection, only to find that most of the original paintings turned out to be reproductions and the antiques were not at all valuable. Robert, realizing his errors, apologizes to the staff. Ramsay further compounds the situation when he brings in former guests of this hotel to rate their experience, angering Ari. This led to the hotel's refurbishment and relaunch, with Ramsay's invitation to the locals to come by.  The only change to the rooms was to repair the plumbing problem.

The kitchen uses boil-in-the-bag precooked food, and their famed pie is frozen and raw. Ramsay redesigns the decor and menu, introducing a new room to enjoy the freshly baked pie with homemade ice cream. To show John that the staff can manage the hotel without his interference, Ramsay locks him in the derelict upstairs room. The packed service is completed without a hitch, and John begins to trust his staff. Ramsay is particularly pleased with Scooter, a young kitchen assistant who has undergone two heart surgeries and back surgery, and offers to fund the remainder of his college education. Despite Ramsay's efforts, the hotel closed prior to the episode's air date due to a decision of the lender bank.&lt;ref&gt;Notice at the end of the episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

| ShortSummary    = Ramsay visits a hotel in the [[Gaslamp Quarter]] of San Diego where rooms go for $800 per night.  The owner is a former Ferrari dealer and he has decorated the hotel to his personal tastes, which lean more to form over function.  The chef at the hotel restaurant has a hard time saying "no" to the owner's menu suggestions, such as chocolate-bacon-strawberry pizza and chicken parmigiana sliders.  Room service orders are delivered in cardboard boxes and plastic containers, which do not befit a luxury hotel.  Ramsay redecorates the rooms and redesigns the menu, and convinces the owner to allow his staff to tell him "no" when needed.

| ShortSummary    = Ramsay visits a husband-and-wife-operated inn located at the former Roosevelt Elementary school. The wife was a reluctant partner in an impulse real estate investment by her husband, who had been a former student of the school. The hotel was plagued with unwashed linens, outdated decor, and a small kitchen. The owner hosted a monthly gathering for a barely profitable murder mystery, in which he played the role of Sherlock Holmes. Ramsay's team makeover included: updating the interior decor, devising a home- cooked menu that could be made from the small kitchen, and revamping their wedding business. A wedding is also celebrated the same night of the reveal.

He wonders why a hotel in New Mexico is styled after Tuscany, Italy. The food is not very good, and the owner sings karaoke in the style of Cher during service. The pool area is dirty and disused. The owner fires the general manager and asks Ramsay for help. Ramsay and his team redecorate all of the rooms, renovate the pool area and redesign the menu, all in the style of New Mexico. When the owner starts to waver on the changes, Ramsay threatens to put the pool back to the way it was and leave. He also asks her to stop singing and focus on management.

The staff informs Ramsay that the owner has a drinking problem and was jailed the night before for [[DUI]].  Ramsay stages an intervention for the owner, renovates the rooms and redesigns the menu.

Ramsay gives them several options: shut down the hotel, sell it, or hand over its operations to a proper general manager. The sisters choose the latter and Ramsay helps improve staff and visitor morale, as well as the hotel and restaurant. He also sends the sisters away to grow up.

The restaurant's storage locker contains improperly stored food and non-appetizing meals are served. It also does not tap into the local vintner tradition. In addition, the hotel's front desk closes early, causing visitors to check in at the bar. Those who stay are also disturbed by the party atmosphere from the bar that lasts well-past midnight. Goss appoints himself as general manager, the historic rooms are renovated, an online guest registry is added, and the restaurant menu which includes wine is improved.

'''Integrated flowthrough''', in [[telecommunications]], refers to the disciplines and techniques by which a [[Communications Service Provider]] (CSP) may achieve and maintain high levels of automation, efficiency and accuracy in operational processes such as fulfilment and assurance.

Typically, this involves optimization and integration of various [[Operations Support Systems]] (OSS) or [[Business Support Systems]] (BSS) as well as structuring and optimizing the activities of personnel involved in handling order fallout, with the goal of both reducing the number of orders that “fallout” and require manual handling and reducing the time and effort required to handle orders that do fallout.

The growth in the order management market is due to CSPs having higher expectations about guaranteed order completion times, thus making issues such as the management of order fallout a priority for CSPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/1057927/service_fulfilment_market_review.htm Service Fulfillment Market Analysis 2007, OSS Observer]&lt;/ref&gt; (Order fallout occurs when the progression of an order has been or rejected, resulting in the order not being successfully completed.)

While many CSPs have spent decades on continuous improvement to achieve high levels of order flowthrough for traditional services, many find that converged, triple-play or quad-play operations environments require renewed focus on this discipline due to the increased complexity of orders in this environment.

Integrated Flowthrough employs a methodology that blends the service design, network technologies, OSSs, fulfillment and assurance processes, enabling CSPs to examine assurance and fulfillment operations from every dimension, including leadership, people processes, technology and systems/data.

Integrated Flowthrough can help CSPs realize the following benefits:

* Reduced operational expenditure (OPEX)
* Close the gaps that contribute to fulfillment and assurance order fallout
* Drive revenue by speeding order completions and reducing outage times
* Reduce the costs of unnecessary truck rolls, manual handling and inefficient work centers
* Improve customer experience and satisfaction through greater on-time service delivery and repair.

'''Intermittent control''' is a [[feedback]] control method which not only explains some human control systems but also has applications to [[control engineering]].

In the context of [[control theory]], intermittent control provides a spectrum of possibilities between the two extremes of continuous-time and discrete-time control: the control signal consists of a sequence of (continuous-time) parameterised trajectories whose parameters are adjusted intermittently. It is different from discrete-time control in that the control is not constant between samples; it is different from continuous-time control in that the trajectories are reset intermittently. As a class of control theory, intermittent predictive control is more general than continuous control and provides a new paradigm incorporating continuous predictive and optimal control with intermittent, open loop (ballistic) control.

There are at least three areas where intermittent control is relevant. Firstly, continuous-time model-based predictive control where the intermittency is associated with on-line optimisation. Secondly, event-driven control systems where the intersample interval is time varying and determined by the event times. Thirdly, explanation of physiological control systems which, in some cases, have an intermittent character. This intermittency may be due to the “computation” in the central nervous system.

Conventional sampled-data control uses a [[zero-order hold]], which produces a piecewise-constant control signal and can be used to give a
sampled-data implementation which approximates previously-designed continuous-time controller. In contrast to conventional sampled data control, intermittent control explicitly embeds the underlying continuous-time closed-loop system in a ''system-matched'' hold which generates an open-loop intersample control trajectory based on the underlying continuous-time closed-loop control system.

== History ==

Intermittent control initially evolved separately in the engineering and physiological literature.

=== Physiological literature ===

The concept of ''intermittent control'' appeared in a posthumous paper&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J Craik. "Theory of human operators in control systems: Part 1, the operator as an engineering system". British Journal of Psychology, 38:56–61, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Kenneth Craik]] which states “The human operator behaves basically as an intermittent correction servo”. A colleague of [[Kenneth Craik]], Margaret Vince, related the concept of intermittency to the [[Psychological refractory period]]&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Vince. "The intermittency of control movements and the psychological refractory period". British Journal of Psychology, 38:149–157, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided experimental verification of intermittency. Fernando Navas and James Stark&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Navas and Lawrence Stark. "Sampling or Intermittency in Hand Control System Dynamics". Biophys. J., 8(2):252–302, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; showed experimentally that human hand movements were synchronised to input signals rather than to an internal clock: in other words the hand control system is event-driven not clock-driven. The first detailed mathematical model of intermittency was presented by Peter Neilson, Megan Neilson, and Nicholas O’Dwyer.&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Neilson, M.D. Neilson, and N.J. O’Dwyer.
"Internal models and intermittency: A theoretical account of human tracking behaviour." Biological Cybernetics, 58:101–112, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent mathematical model of intermittency is given by PeterGawthrop, Ian Loram, Martin Lakie and Henrik Gollee.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gawthrop, Ian Loram, Martin Lakie, and Henrik Gollee. "Intermittent control: A computational theory of human control". Biological Cybernetics, 104(1-2):31–51, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering literature ===

In the context of [[Control Engineering]], the term intermittent control was used by Eric Ronco, Taner Arsan and Peter Gawthrop.&lt;ref&gt;
E. Ronco, T. Arsan, and P. J. Gawthrop. "Open-loop intermittent feedback control: Practical continuous-time GPC". IEE Proceedings Part D: Control Theory and Applications, 146(5):426–434, September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
They stated that “A conceptual, and practical difficulty with the continuous-time generalised predictive controller is solved by replacing the continuously moving horizon by an intermittently moving horizon. This allows slow optimisation to occur concurrently with a fast control action.”  The concept of intermittent model predictive control was refined by Peter Gawthrop working with Liuping Wang,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gawthrop and Liuping Wang. "Intermittent model predictive control". Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Pt. I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 221(7):1007–1018, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who also looked at event-driven intermittent control.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gawthrop and Liuping Wang. "Event-driven intermittent control". International Journal of Control, 82(12):2235 – 2248, December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate line of development Tomas Estrada, Hai Lin and Panos Antsaklis developed the concept of model-based control with intermittent feedback in the context of a [[networked control system]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Estrada, H. Lin, and P.J. Antsaklis. "Model-based control with intermittent feedback". In Control and Automation, 2006. MED ’06. 14th Mediterranean Conference on, pages 1–6, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land rehabilitation''' is the process of returning the land in a given area to some degree of its former state, after some process ([[industry]], [[natural disaster]]s, etc.) has resulted in its damage. Many [[project]]s and [[Subdivision (land)|development]]s will result in the land becoming [[environmental degradation|degraded]], for example [[mining]], [[farming]] and [[forestry]].

==Mine rehabilitation==
Modern mine rehabilitation aims to minimize and mitigate the [[Environmental effects of mining|environmental effects of modern mining]], which may in the case of [[open pit]] mining involve movement of significant volumes of rock. Rehabilitation management is an ongoing process, often resulting in open pit mines being backfilled.

After mining finishes, the mine area must undergo rehabilitation. 
* [[Waste dump]]s are contoured to flatten them out, to further stabilize them against [[erosion]].
* If the ore contains [[sulfides]] it is usually covered with a layer of [[clay]] to prevent access of [[rain]] and [[oxygen]] from the [[air]], which can [[Oxidation|oxidize]] the sulfides to produce [[sulfuric acid]].
* [[Landfill]]s are covered with [[topsoil]], and [[vegetation]] is planted to help consolidate the material.
* Dumps are usually fenced off to prevent [[livestock]] denuding them of vegetation.
* The open pit is then surrounded with a fence, to prevent access, and it generally eventually fills up with [[groundwater]].
* [[Tailings]] [[dam]]s are left to [[evaporate]], then covered with waste rock, clay if need be, and [[soil]], which is planted to stabilize it.

For underground mines, rehabilitation is not always a significant problem or cost. This is because of the higher grade of the [[ore]] and lower volumes of waste rock and tailings. In some situations, [[Stoping (mining method)|stope]]s are backfilled with [[concrete]] [[slurry]] using waste, so that minimal waste is left at surface.

The removal of [[Physical plant|plant]] and [[infrastructure]] is not always part of a rehabilitation programme, as many old mine plants have [[cultural heritage]] and [[cultural]] value. Often in [[gold]] mines, rehabilitation is performed by scavenger operations which treat the soil within the plant area for spilled gold using modified [[placer mining]] [[gravity]] collection plants.

Also possible is that the section of the mine that is below ground, is kept and used to provide heating, water and/or methane. Heat extraction can be done using heat exchangers, that convey the heat to a nearby city (hence making it be used for [[district heating]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://warmopweg.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lokale-warmte-initiatieven-en-de-rol-van-burgercollectieven-in-de-warmtemarkt.pdf MijnWater BV recovering heat from abandoned mines]&lt;/ref&gt;
Water can be harvested from the mine as well (mines are often filled with water once the mine has been shut down and the pumps no longer operate). Methane is also often present in the mine shafts, in small quantities (often around 0,1%). This can still be recovered though with specialised systems.&lt;ref&gt;The West Cliff Collier Power Plant has successfully been able to recover methane from ventilation shafts of mines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/events_all_20101208_mattus.pdf Ventilation Air Methane]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Economy By Gunter Pauli&lt;/ref&gt; An added advantage of recovering the methane finally is that the methane does not come into the atmosphere, and so does not contribute to global warming.

A '''level shifter''' in [[digital electronics]], also called a '''logic-level shifter''', is a circuit used to translate signals from one [[logic level]] or voltage domain to another, allowing compatibility between ICs with different voltage requirements, such as [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] and [[CMOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Integrated Circuits for Computers: Principles and Applications|first=William L. |last=Schweber|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1986|ISBN=9780070536241|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horan 2013 p. 167"&gt;{{cite book | last=Horan | first=B. | title=Practical Raspberry Pi | publisher=Apress | series=Technology in Action | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4302-4972-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSonZP4Nj5sC&amp;pg=PA167 | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern full featured systems use level shifters to bridge domains between low-power application processors running at 1.8 V and other system functions like sensors or other analog intensive applications running at 3.3 or 5V.

Uni-directional – All input pins are dedicated to one voltage domain, all output pins are dedicated to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/logic/voltage-level-translation-overview.page|title=Overview for Voltage Level Translation|website=Texas Instruments|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bi-directional with Dedicated Ports – Each [[voltage]] domain has both input and output pins, but the data direction of a pin does not change.
 
Bi-directional with External direction indicator – When an external signal is changed, inputs become outputs and vice versa.
 
Bi-directional, auto-sensing – A pair of I/O spanning voltage domains can act as either inputs or outputs depending on external stimulus without the need for a dedicated direction control pin.

== Hardware implementation ==
Fixed Function Level Shifter ICs - these ICs provide several different types of level shift in fixed function devices. Often lumped into 2-bit, 4-bit, or 8-bit level shift configurations offered with various VDD and VDD2 ranges, these devices translate logic levels without any additional integrated logic or timing adjustment.
 
[[Configurable mixed-signal IC|Configurable Mixed-signal IC]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (CMICs) – Level shifter circuitry can also be implemented in a CMIC.  The no-code programmable nature of CMICs allows designers to implement fully customizable level shifters with the added option to integrate configurable logic or timing adjustments in the same device.

== Applications of level shifters ==
Since level shifters are used to resolve the voltage incompatibility between various parts of a system, they have a wide range of applications as well. Level shifters are widely used in interfacing legacy devices and also in SD cards, SIM cards, CF cards, Audio codecs and UARTs.

'''Linen''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ᵻ|n}} is a [[textile]] made from the [[fiber]]s of the [[flax]] plant. Linen is laborious to manufacture, but the fiber is very strong, absorbent and dries faster than cotton. Garments made of linen are valued for their exceptional coolness and freshness in hot and humid weather. 

The word ''linen'' is of [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] origin and [[cognate]] to  the [[Latin]] name for the flax plant, ''linum'', and the earlier [[Greek language|Greek]] λινόν (''linón''). This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably ''[[line (geometry)|line]],'' from the use of a linen (flax) [[yarn|thread]] to determine a straight line.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/line |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012710/https://www.etymonline.com/word/line |archivedate=2018-01-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Many products are made of linen: aprons, bags, towels (swimming, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins, bed linens, tablecloths, runners, chair covers, and men's and women's wear.

The collective term "[[linens]]" is still often used generically to describe a class of [[weaving|woven]] or [[knitting|knitted]] bed, bath, table and kitchen textiles  traditionally made of linen. In the past, "linens" also referred to lightweight [[undergarment]]s such as [[shirt]]s, [[chemise]]s, waist-shirts, [[lingerie]] (a word also cognate with ''linen''), and detachable shirt collars and cuffs, all of which were historically made almost exclusively out of linen. The inner layer of fine composite cloth garments (as for example jackets) was traditionally made of linen, hence the word ''lining''.&lt;ref&gt;lining. Dictionary.com. Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lining |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006115259/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lining |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }} (accessed: October 3, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Textiles in a [[linen weave]] texture, even when made of [[cotton]], [[hemp]] and other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as "linen". Such fabrics generally also have their own specific names, for example fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called [[Madapolam]].

Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world: their history goes back many thousands of years. Fragments of straw, seeds, fibers, yarns, and various types of fabrics dating to about 8000&amp;nbsp;BC have been found in Swiss lake dwellings. Dyed flax fibers found in a prehistoric cave in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back even earlier to 36,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name="Balter M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balter | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Supporting Online Material"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kvavadze | first1 = E | last2 = Bar-Yosef | first2 = O | last3 = Belfer-Cohen | first3 = A | last4 = Boaretto | first4 = E | last5 = Jakeli | first5 = N | last6 = Matskevich | first6 = Z | last7 = Meshveliani | first7 = T | year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid=19745144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linen was sometimes used as a form of currency in [[ancient Egypt]]. Egyptian [[Mummy|mummies]] were wrapped in linen as a symbol of light and purity, and as a display of wealth. Some of these fabrics, woven from hand-spun yarns, were very fine for their day, but are coarse compared to modern linen.&lt;ref name="Harris1824"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Thaddeus Mason|title=The natural history of the Bible; or, A description of all the quadrupeds, birds, fishes [&amp;c.] mentioned in the Sacred scriptures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=1824|page=135|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627161244/http://books.google.com/books?id=NtYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA135|archivedate=27 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the German city [[Bielefeld]] issued [[banknote]]s printed on linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter Grasser / Albert Pick |title=Das Bielefelder Stoffgeld 1917-1923 |publisher=Erich Pröh |location=Berlin, Germany |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, linen is usually an expensive textile produced in relatively small quantities. It has a long [[Staple (textiles)|staple]] (individual fiber length) relative to cotton and other [[natural fiber]]s.&lt;ref name="textiles"&gt;''Textiles'', Ninth Edition by Sara J. Kadolph and Anna L. Langford. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "linen" is derived from the [[Latin]] for the [[flax]] plant, which is ''linum'', and the earlier [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λίνον'' (''linon''). This word history has given rise to a number of other terms:

* [[Line (geometry)|Line]], derived from the use of a linen [[yarn|thread]] to determine a straight line
* [[Lining (sewing)|Lining]], because linen was often used to create an inner layer for [[wool]] and [[leather]] clothing
* [[Lingerie]], via French, originally denotes underwear made of linen
* [[Linseed oil]], an oil derived from [[flax]] seed
* [[Linoleum]], a floor covering made from linseed oil and other materials

== History ==
[[File:A bag of white linen, unopened. Contains rolls of linen only. Foundation deposit, Heb Sed Chapel at Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. 12th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|A bag of white linen, unopened. Contains rolls of linen. Foundation deposit, Heb Sed Chapel at Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. 12th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.]]
The discovery of dyed flax fibers in a cave in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] dated to thirty-six thousand years ago suggests that ancient people used wild flax fibers to create linen-like fabrics from an early date.&lt;ref name="Balter M. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Supporting Online Material"/&gt;

In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], [[flax]] was domesticated and linen was first produced. It was used mainly by the wealthier class of the society, including priests. The Sumerian poem of the courtship of [[Inanna]] and Dumuzi ([[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]]), translated by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] and [[Diane Wolkstein]] and published in 1983, mentions flax and linen. It opens with briefly listing the steps of preparing linen from flax, in a form of questions and answers between [[Inanna]] and her brother [[Utu]].

In ancient Egypt, linen was used for mummification and for burial shrouds. It was also worn as clothing on a daily basis; white linen was worn because of the extreme heat. 
The use of linen for priestly vestments was not confined to the Israelites; [[Plutarch]] wrote that the priests of [[Isis]] also wore linen because of its purity.

Linen fabric has been used for table coverings, bed coverings and clothing for centuries. The significant cost of linen derives not only from the difficulty of working with the thread, but also because the flax plant itself requires a great deal of attention. In addition flax thread is not elastic, and therefore it is difficult to weave without breaking threads. Thus linen is considerably more expensive to manufacture than cotton.

There is a long history of the production of linen in Ireland. The [[Living Linen]] Project was set up in 1995 as an oral archive of the knowledge of the [[Irish linen]] industry, which was at that time still available within a nucleus of people who formerly worked in the industry in [[Ulster]].

In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the [[International Year of Natural Fibres]] in order to raise people's awareness of linen and other [[natural fiber]]s.

===Antiquity===

When the tomb of the Pharaoh [[Ramses II]], who died in 1213 BC, was discovered in 1881, the linen wrappings were in a state of perfect preservation after more than 3000 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} When the tomb of [[Tutankhamun|Tutankhamen]] was opened, the linen curtains were found to be intact.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Belfast]] there is the mummy of '[[Takabuti]]' the daughter of a priest of [[Amun]], who died 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nmni.com/our-museums/ulster-museum/Things-to-see/Takabuti-the-ancient-Egyptian-mummy.aspx "Takabuti the ancient Egyptian mummy -
Ulster Museum, Egyptian Gallery"]&lt;/ref&gt; The linen on this mummy is also in a perfect state of preservation.

===Earliest linen industry===
[[File:Prices edict grades.jpg|thumb|[[Diocletian]]'s 4th century maximum prices edict showing prices for 3 grades of linen across the [[Roman Empire]]]]

The earliest records of an established linen industry are 4,000 years old, from Egypt, The earliest written documentation of a linen industry comes from the [[Linear B]] tablets of [[Pylos]], [[Greece]], where linen is depicted as an [[ideogram]] and also written as "li-no" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: λίνον, ''linon''), and the female linen workers are cataloged as "li-ne-ya" (λίνεια, ''lineia'').&lt;ref name="Francoise Rougemont: Flax and Linen Textiles in the Mycenaean palatial economy"&gt;[http://www3.lu.se/klass/textiles/throughsociety.html#rouge Flax and Linen Textiles in the Mycenaean palatial economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411124925/http://www3.lu.se/klass/textiles/throughsociety.html |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Journal of Archaeology"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=504148|title=The Agricultural Year, the Commodity SA and the Linen Industry of Mycenaean Pylos|first=A. L. H.|last=Robkin|date=1 January 1979|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=83|issue=4|pages=469–474|doi=10.2307/504148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phoenicia]]ns, who, with their merchant fleet, opened up new channels of commerce to the peoples of the Mediterranean, and developed the tin mines of [[Cornwall]], introduced flax growing and the making of linen into [[Ireland]] before the [[common era]]. It is not until the twelfth century that we can find records of a definite attempt to systematize flax production.

When the [[Edict of Nantes]] was revoked, in 1685, many of the [[Huguenots]] who fled France settled in the British Isles, and amongst them was [[Louis Crommelin]], who settled in the town of [[Lisburn]], about ten miles from [[Belfast]].  Belfast itself is perhaps the most famous linen producing center throughout history; during the Victorian era the majority of the world's linen was produced in the city which gained it the name [[Linenopolis]].

Although the linen industry was already established in Ulster, Louis Crommelin found scope for improvement in weaving, and his efforts were so successful that he was appointed by the Government to develop the industry over a much wider range than the small confines of Lisburn and its surroundings. The direct result of his good work was the establishment, under statute, of the Board of Trustees of the Linen Manufacturers of Ireland in the year 1711. Several grades were produced from the coarsest [[lockram]] to the finest [[sasheen]].

===Religion===
In [[Judaism]], the only law concerning which fabrics may be interwoven together in clothing concerns the mixture of linen and [[wool]], called ''[[shaatnez]]''; it is restricted in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:11|HE}} "Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together" and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:19|HE}}, "'...neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.'" There is no explanation for this in the [[Torah]] itself and is categorized as a type of law known as ''chukim'', a statute beyond man's ability to comprehend.&lt;ref name="religion"&gt;The Jewish Primer, by Shmuel Himelstein. New York, NY: Facts On File, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Josephus suggested that the reason for the prohibition was to keep the laity from wearing the official garb of the priests,&lt;ref&gt;Etz Hayim p. 1118&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} while [[Maimonides]] thought that the reason was because heathen priests wore such mixed garments.&lt;ref&gt;Guide for the Perplexed 3:37&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} Others explain that it is because God often forbids mixtures of disparate kinds, not designed by God to be compatible in a certain way, with mixing animal and vegetable fibers being similar to having two different types of plowing animals yoked together. And that such commands serve both a practical as well as allegorical purpose, perhaps here preventing a priestly garment that would cause discomfort (or excessive sweat) in a hot climate.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Fausset, Brown commentary, Lv. 19:19&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} 

Linen is also mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs 31, a passage describing a noble wife. {{bibleverse|Proverbs|31:22}} says, "She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple." Fine white linen is also worn by angels in the Bible ({{bibleverse|Revelation|15:6}}).

==Flax fiber==
{{Main|Flax}}

===Description===
[[Image:Labeledstemforposter copy new.jpg|thumb|[[Flax]] stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues. Ep = [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = bast fibres; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]
Linen is a [[bast fibre|bast fiber]]. Flax fibers vary in length from about 25 to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (1 to 6 [[inch|in]]) and average 12–16 [[micrometre|micrometers]] in diameter. There are two varieties: shorter tow fibers used for coarser fabrics and longer line fibers used for finer fabrics. Flax fibers can usually be identified by their “nodes” which add to the flexibility and texture of the fabric.

The cross-section of the linen fiber is made up of irregular [[polygon]]al shapes which contribute to the coarse texture of the fabric.&lt;ref name="classifications"&gt;Classifications &amp; Analysis of Textiles: A Handbook by Karen L. LaBat, Ph.D. and Carol J. Salusso, Ph.A. University of Minnesota, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
Linen fabric feels cool to touch, a phenomenon which indicates its higher conductivity (the same principle that makes metals feel "cold").  It is smooth, making the finished fabric lint-free, and gets softer the more it is washed. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron creased during laundering. Linen has poor elasticity and does not spring back readily, explaining why it wrinkles so easily.

Linen fabrics have a high natural luster; their natural color ranges between shades of ivory, [[ecru]], tan, or grey. Pure white linen is created by heavy bleaching. Linen fabric typically varies somewhat in thickness and is crisp and textured, but it can in some cases feel stiff and rough, and in other cases feel soft and smooth. When properly prepared, linen fabric has the ability to absorb and lose water rapidly. Linen can absorb a fair amount of moisture without feeling unpleasantly damp to the skin, unlike cotton.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}
Linen is a very durable, strong fabric, and one of the few that are stronger wet than dry. The fibers do not stretch, and are resistant to damage from abrasion. However, because linen fibers have a very low elasticity, the fabric eventually breaks if it is folded and ironed at the same place repeatedly over time.

Mildew, perspiration, and bleach can also damage the fabric, but it is resistant to [[moth]]s and [[Varied carpet beetle|carpet beetles]]. Linen is relatively easy to take care of, since it resists dirt and stains, has no lint or [[Pill (textile)|pilling]] tendency, and can be dry-cleaned, machine-washed or steamed. It can withstand high temperatures, and has only moderate initial [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]].&lt;ref name="classifications"/&gt;

Linen should not be dried too much by tumble drying, and it is much easier to iron when damp. Linen wrinkles very easily, and thus some more formal garments require ironing often, in order to maintain perfect smoothness. Nevertheless, the tendency to wrinkle is often considered part of linen's particular "charm", and many modern linen garments are designed to be air-dried on a good clothes hanger and worn without the necessity of ironing.

A characteristic often associated with linen yarn is the presence of "slubs", or small knots which occur randomly along its length. In the past, slubs were traditionally considered to be defects, and were associated with low quality linen. However, in the case of many present-day linen fabrics, particularly in the decorative furnishing industry, slubs are considered as part of the aesthetic appeal of an expensive natural product. In addition, slubs do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no slubs at all.

===Measure===
The standard measure of bulk linen yarn is the "lea", which is the number of yards in a pound of linen divided by 300. For example, a yarn having a size of 1&amp;nbsp;lea will give 300&amp;nbsp;yards per pound. The fine yarns used in handkerchiefs, etc. might be 40&amp;nbsp;lea, and give 40x300 = 12,000&amp;nbsp;yards per pound. This is a specific length therefore an indirect measurement of the fineness of the linen, i.e., the number of length units per unit mass. The symbol is NeL.'''(3)''' The metric unit, Nm, is more commonly used in continental Europe. This is the number of 1,000&amp;nbsp;m lengths per kilogram. In China, the English Cotton system unit, NeC, is common. This is the number of 840&amp;nbsp;yard lengths in a pound.

=== Production method ===
{{See also|Textile manufacturing#Flax|l1=hand processing flax}}
[[File:Linum usitatissimum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-088.jpg|thumb|left|Details of the flax plant, from which linen fibers are derived]]
[[File:LinenMechanicalHarvesting-Summer2009-Belgium.JPG|thumb|right|Mechanical [[Baler|baling]] of flax in [[Belgium]].&lt;!-- Summer 2009. --&gt; On the left side, cut flax is waiting to be baled.]]

The quality of the finished linen product is often dependent upon growing conditions and [[harvesting]] techniques. To generate the longest possible fibers, flax is either hand-harvested by pulling up the entire plant or stalks are cut very close to the root. After harvesting, the plants are dried, and the seeds are removed through a mechanized process called “rippling” ([[threshing]]) and [[winnowing]].

The fibers must then be loosened from the stalk. This is achieved through [[retting]]. This is a process which uses bacteria to decompose the pectin that binds the fibers together. Natural retting methods take place in tanks and pools, or directly in the fields. There are also chemical retting methods; these are faster, but are typically more harmful to the environment and to the fibers themselves.

After retting, the stalks are ready for [[scutching]], which takes place between August and December. Scutching removes the woody portion of the stalks by crushing them between two metal rollers, so that the parts of the stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as [[Linseed#Flax seeds|linseed]], [[shive]], and [[tow]] are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are [[heckling (flax)|heckled]]: the short fibers are separated with [[heckling comb]]s by 'combing' them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers.

After the fibers have been separated and processed, they are typically spun into yarns and woven or knit into linen textiles. These textiles can then be bleached, dyed, printed on, or finished with a number of treatments or coatings.&lt;ref name="classifications"/&gt;

An alternate production method is known as “cottonizing” which is quicker and requires less equipment. The flax stalks are processed using traditional cotton machinery; however, the finished fibers often lose the characteristic linen look.

=== Producers ===
Flax is grown in many parts of the world, but top quality flax is primarily grown in Western European countries and Ukraine. In recent years bulk linen production has moved to Eastern Europe and China, but high quality fabrics are still confined to niche producers in Ireland, Italy and Belgium, and also in countries including Poland, Austria, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Britain and [[Kochi]] in India. High quality linen fabrics are now produced in the United States for the upholstery market and in Belgium.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Russia is currently the major flax cultivating nation.

=== Uses ===
[[File:Bielefeld Germany Linen Notgeld 8 November 1923.jpg|right|thumb|Bielefeld Germany linen [[Notgeld]] issued by Stadt-Sparkasse on 8 November 1923]]
Over the past 30 years the end use for linen has changed dramatically. Approximately 70% of linen production in the 1990s was for apparel textiles, whereas in the 1970s only about 5% was used for fashion fabrics.

Linen uses range across bed and bath fabrics ([[tablecloths]], bath towels, dish towels, bed sheets); home and commercial furnishing items (wallpaper/wall coverings, upholstery, window treatments); apparel items (suits, dresses, skirts, shirts); and industrial products (luggage, canvases, sewing thread).&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt; It was once the preferred yarn for handsewing the uppers of [[moccasin (footwear)|moccasin]]-style shoes ([[loafers]]), but has been replaced by synthetics.

A linen [[handkerchief]], pressed and folded to display the corners, was a standard decoration of a well-dressed man's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] during most of the first part of the 20th century.

Currently researchers are working on a cotton/flax blend to create new yarns which will improve the feel of denim during hot and humid weather.&lt;ref name="agr_research"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= |first1= |title=Flax Fiber Offers Cotton Cool Comfort |magazine=Agricultural Research |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Linen fabric is one of the preferred traditional supports for [[oil painting]]. In the United States cotton is popularly used instead, as linen is many times more expensive there, restricting its use to professional painters. In Europe, however, linen is usually the only fabric support available in art shops; in the UK both are freely available with cotton being cheaper. Linen is preferred to cotton for its strength, durability and [[archival]] integrity.

Linen is also used extensively by artisan bakers. Known as a couche, the flax cloth is used to hold the dough into shape while in the final rise, just before baking. The couche is heavily dusted with flour which is rubbed into the pores of the fabric. Then the shaped dough is placed on the couche. The floured couche makes a "non stick" surface to hold the dough. Then ridges are formed in the couche to keep the dough from spreading.

In the past, linen was also used for books (the only surviving example of which is the [[Liber Linteus]]). Due to its strength, in the [[Middle Ages]] linen was used for [[shield]]s, [[gambeson]]s, and [[bowstring]]s; in [[classical antiquity]] it was used to make a type of body armour, referred to as a [[linothorax]].

Because of its strength when wet, [[Irish linen]] is a very popular wrap of pool/billiard cues, due to its absorption of sweat from hands. Paper made of linen can be very strong and crisp, which is why the United States and many other countries print their currency on paper made from 25% linen and 75% cotton. &lt;!-- this reference has to be replaced '''(3)''' --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Material take off''' ('''MTO''') is a term used in [[engineering]] and [[construction]], and refers to a list of [[Raw material|material]]s with quantities and types (such as specific grades of [[steel]]) that are required to build a designed structure or item. This list is generated by analysis of a [[blueprint]] or other design document. The list of required materials for construction is sometimes referred to as the material take off list (MTOL).

Material take off is not limited to the amount of required material, but also the weight of the items taken off. This is important when dealing with larger structures, allowing the company that does the take off to determine total weight of the item and how best to move the item (if necessary) when construction is completed.

==Definition used by the ISA (International Society of Automation)==
A material take off (MTO) is the process of analyzing the drawings and determining all the materials required to accomplish the design. We then use the material take off to create a [[bill of materials]] (BOM). Inspection does not aid in creating a bill of materials. Procurement and requisition are activities that occur after the bill of materials is complete.

[[Category:Engineering concepts]]
The final stages of the MTO is as instrumentally visible in the GAD (General Arrangement Drawing) for specific equipment. The MTO sheet is such an important document in projects as it presents a huge detail such as list of all Materials, quantities, weights, material types, material codes etc.</text>

A '''mechanical biological treatment''' system is a type of waste processing facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as [[composting]] or [[anaerobic digestion]]. MBT plants are designed to process [[municipal solid waste|mixed household waste]] as well as [[commercial waste|commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]s.

==Process==
[[File:Mechanical biological treatment flowchart.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|Process flow chart]]
The terms ''mechanical biological treatment'' or ''mechanical biological pre-treatment'' relate to a group of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|solid waste treatment systems]]. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the [[mixed waste]] and facilitate the stabilisation of the [[biodegradable]] component of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Enviros (2006) [http://www.mbt.landfill-site.com/ Mechanical biological treatment website], ''www.mbt.landfill-site.com'', Waste Technology Home Page, Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juniper (2005) [http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html MBT: A Guide for Decision Makers – Processes, Policies &amp; Markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817181127/http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html |date=2007-08-17 }}, ''www.juniper.co.uk'', (Project funding supplied by Sita Environmental Trust), Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorting component of the plants typically resemble a [[materials recovery facility]]. This component is either configured to recover the individual elements of the waste or produce a [[refuse-derived fuel]] that can be used for the generation of power.

The components of the mixed waste stream that can be recovered include:
*[[Ferrous metal]]
*[[Non-ferrous metal]]
* [[Plastic]]
* [[Glass]]

==Terminology==
MBT is also sometimes termed biological mechanical treatment (BMT), however this simply refers to the order of processing (i.e., the biological phase of the system precedes the mechanical sorting). MBT should not be confused with [[mechanical heat treatment]] (MHT).

== Mechanical sorting ==
{{See also|Materials recovery facility}}
[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Wet material recovery facility, [[Hiriya]], [[Israel]] ]]

The "mechanical" element is usually an automated mechanical [[sorting]] stage. This either removes [[recyclable]] elements from a mixed waste stream (such as metals, plastics, glass, and paper) or processes them. It typically involves factory style [[conveyor]]s, industrial [[magnet]]s, [[eddy current separators]], [[trommel]]s, [[Industrial shredder|shredders]], and other tailor made systems, or the sorting is done manually at hand picking stations. The mechanical element has a number of similarities to a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;Sita (2004) [http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf Sita Mechanical Biological Treatment Position Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908000656/http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf |date=2006-09-08 }}, ''www.sita.co.uk'', Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems integrate a wet MRF to separate by density and flotation and to recover and wash the recyclable elements of the waste in a form that can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed [[refuse derived fuel]] (RDF). RDF can be used in [[cement kiln]]s or thermal [[Combustion power plant|combustion power plants]] and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF; this is not the case, and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.

== Biological processing ==
{{See also|composting|anaerobic digestion}}

[[Image:MBT anaerobicdigesters.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Twin stage &amp; [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) [[anaerobic digester]]s]]

The "biological" element refers to either:
*[[Anaerobic digestion]]
*[[Composting]]
*[[Biodrying]]

Anaerobic digestion harnesses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] component of the waste to produce [[biogas]] and [[digestate|soil improver]]. The biogas can be used to generate [[electricity]] and [[heat]].

Biological can also refer to a composting stage. Here the organic component is broken down by naturally occurring aerobic microorganisms. They breakdown the waste into carbon dioxide and compost. There is no green energy produced by systems employing only composting treatment for the biodegradable waste.

In the case of biodrying, the waste material undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.

Some systems incorporate both anaerobic digestion and composting. This may either take the form of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a [[windrow composting]] facility.

By processing the biodegradable waste either by anaerobic digestion or by [[compost]]ing MBT technologies help to reduce the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es to [[global warming]].

Usable wastes for this system:
*[[Municipal solid waste]]
*[[Commercial waste|Commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]
*[[Sewage sludge]]

Possible products of this system:
* Renewable fuel (biogas) leading to renewable power
* Recovered recycable materials such as metals, paper, plastics, glass etc.
*[[Digestate]] - an organic fertiliser and soil improver
*[[Carbon credit|Carbon credits]] – additional revenues
* High calorific fraction [[Refuse-derived fuel|refuse derived fuel]] - renewable fuel content dependent upon biological component
* Residual unusable materials prepared for their final safe treatment (e.g., [[incineration]] or [[gasification]]) and/or [[landfill]]

Further advantages:
* Small fraction of inert [[residual waste]]
* Reduction of the waste volume to be deposited to at least a half (density &gt; 1.3 t/m³), thus the lifetime of the landfill is at least twice as long as usually
* Utilisation of the [[leachate]] in the process
* [[Landfill gas]] not problematic as biological component of waste has been stabilised
* Daily covering of landfill not necessary

== Consideration of applications ==
MBT systems can form an integral part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with [[kerbside collection]] schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a gasifier.

Alternatively MBT solutions can diminish the need for home separation and kerbside collection of recyclable elements of waste. This gives the ability of local authorities, municipalities and councils to reduce the use of waste vehicles on the roads and keep recycling rates high.

==Position of environmental groups==
[[Friends of the Earth]] suggests that the best environmental route for [[municipal solid waste|residual waste]] is to firstly maximise removal of remaining recyclable materials from the waste stream (such as metals, plastics and paper). The amount of waste remaining should be composted or anaerobically digested and disposed of to [[landfill]], unless sufficiently clean to be used as compost.

A report by Eunomia&lt;ref&gt;Eunomia (2006) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/changing_climate.pdf A changing climate for energy from waste?]&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed analysis of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling is one of the best options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for incineration or incineration of waste without MBT.

Friends of the Earth does not support MBT plants that produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), and believes MBT processes should occur in small, localised treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth (2008) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf Mechanical Biological Treatment Briefing], ''www.foe.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, any handheld computer device will have an [[LCD]] flatscreen interface, providing a [[touchscreen]] interface with digital buttons and keyboard or physical buttons along with a physical keyboard. Many such devices can connect to the [[Internet]] and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or [[Headset (audio)|headset]]s via [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], cellular networks or [[near field communication]] (NFC). Integrated cameras, [[media player (software)|digital media player]]s, the ability to place and receive [[telephone]] calls, [[video games]], and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a [[lithium battery]]. Mobile devices may run [[mobile operating system]]s that allow third-party [[Mobile app|apps specialized for said capabilities]] to be installed and run.

Early [[smartphone]]s were joined in the late 2000s by larger, but otherwise essentially the same, [[tablet computer|tablet]]s. Input and output is now usually via a [[touch user interface|touch-screen interface]]. [[Smartphone|Phones]]/[[tablet computer|tablet]]s and [[personal digital assistants]] may provide much of the functionality of a [[laptop]]/[[desktop computer]] but more conveniently, in addition to exclusive features. [[Enterprise digital assistant]]s can provide additional business functionality such as integrated data capture via [[barcode]], [[RFID]] and [[smart card]] readers.
By 2010, mobile devices often contained sensors such as [[accelerometer]]s, [[magnetometer]]s and [[gyroscopes]], allowing detection of orientation and motion. Mobile devices may provide [[Biometrics|biometric]] user authentication such as [[face recognition]] or [[fingerprint recognition]].

Major global manufacturers of mobile devices include [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]], [[Sony]], [[Google]], [[HTC]], [[LG Electronics|LG]], and [[Motorola Mobility]].

==Characteristics==
Device mobility can be viewed in the context of several dimensions:&lt;ref name="Poslad"&gt;

* Physical dimensions and weight
* Whether or not the device is mobile or some kind of host to which it is attached to is mobile
* What kind of host devices can be bound to
* How devices are attached to a host
* When the mobility occurs

Strictly speaking, many so-called mobile devices are not mobile. It is the host that is mobile, i.e., a mobile human host carries a non-mobile [[smartphone]] device. An example of a true mobile computing device, where the device itself is mobile, is a [[robot]]. Another example is an [[autonomous vehicle]]. There are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts: accompanied, surface-mounted or embedded into the fabric of a host, e.g., an embedded controller embedded in a host device. Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host, e.g., a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced.&lt;ref name="Poslad"/&gt; Hence, mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an [[autonomous vehicle]] can appear larger than pocket-sized.

As stated earlier, the most common size of mobile computing device is pocket-sized that can be hand-held, but other sizes for mobile devices exist, too. [[Mark Weiser]], known{{By whom|date=August 2015}} as the father of [[ubiquitous computing]], computing everywhere, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, pad and board sized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiser|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Weiser |title=The Computer for the Twenty-First Century|year=1991|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=265|issue=3 |pages=94–104|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0991-94}}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''tabs'' are defined as accompanied or wearable centimetre-sized devices, e.g. [[smartphones]] and [[smart cards]], and ''pads'' are defined as hand-held decimetre-sized devices, e.g., [[laptop]]s and [[tablet computers|tablets]]. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices.&lt;ref name="Poslad"/&gt; ''Dust'' refers to miniaturised devices without direct HCI interfaces, e.g., micro electro-mechanical systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres. See also [[Smart dust]]. ''Skin'': fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices. These can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains, see [[OLED  display]]. Also see [[smart device]].

Although mobility is often regarded{{By whom|date=August 2015}} as synonymous with having wireless connectivity, these terms are different. Not all network access by mobile users, applications and devices need be via wireless networks and vice versa. Wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move in between wired and wireless hotspots such as in Internet cafés.&lt;ref name="Poslad"/&gt; Some mobile devices can be used as [[mobile Internet device]]s to access the Internet while moving but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still operational even while disconnected to the [[Internet]]. What makes the mobile device unique compared to other technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and also the software. Flexible applications include video chat, Web browsing, payment systems, NFC, audio recording etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beddall-Hill, Nicola|author2=Jabbar, Abdul|author3=Al Shehri, Saleh|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Social Mobile Devices as Tools for Qualitative Research in Education: iPhones and iPads in Ethnography, Interviewing, and Design-Based Research|journal=Journal of the Research Center for Educational Technology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=67–90|ISSN=1948-075X|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/10507/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mobile devices become ubiquitous there, will be a proliferation of services which include the use of the [[Cloud computing|cloud]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Although a common form of mobile device, a smartphone, has a display, another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device, the [[smart card]], e.g., used as a bank card or travel card, does not have a display. This mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect, or be inserted into a reader in order to display its internal data or state.

A '''motor vehicle''', also known as '''motorized vehicle''' or '''automotive vehicle''', is a self-propelled [[vehicle]], commonly [[wheel]]ed, that does not operate on [[Track (rail transport)|rail]]s (such as [[train]]s or [[tram]]s) and is used for the transportation of people or [[cargo]].

The [[vehicle propulsion]] is provided by an [[engine]] or motor, usually an [[internal combustion engine]] or an [[electric motor]], or some combination of the two, such as [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and [[plug-in hybrid]]s. For legal purposes, motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including [[car]]s, [[bus]]es, [[motorcycle]]s, [[off-road vehicle]]s, [[light truck]]s and regular [[truck]]s. These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country.  [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicle types, terms and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=9389|title=ISO 3833:1977|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, to avoid requiring handicapped persons from having to possess an operator's license to use one, or requiring tags and insurance, powered [[wheelchair]]s will be specifically excluded by law from being considered motor vehicles.

The US publisher [[Ward's]] estimates that as of 2010, there were 1.015 billion motor vehicles in use in the world. This figure represents the number of cars, trucks (light, medium and heavy duty), and buses, but does not include [[off highway vehicle|off-road vehicles]] or [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy construction equipment]]. The world vehicle population passed the 500 million-unit mark in 1986, from 250 million motor vehicles in 1970. Between 1950 and 1970, the vehicle population doubled roughly every 10 years.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plunket11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx|title=Automobiles and Truck Trends|publisher=Plunkett Research|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wards11&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/world_vehicle_population_110815/|title=World Vehicle Population Tops 1 Billion Units|author=John Sousanis|work=[[Ward's|Ward AutoWorld]]|date=2011-08-15|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two US researchers estimate that the world's fleet will reach 2 billion motor vehicles by 2020, with cars representing at least 50% of all vehicles.

According to Ward's, the United States has the largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world, with 239.8 million by 2010. Vehicle ownership [[per capita]] in the U.S. is also the highest in the world with 769 vehicles in operation per 1000 inhabitants, or a ratio of 1:1.3 vehicles to people.&lt;ref name=Wards11/&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] reports an even higher motorization rate of 828 vehicles per 1000 people, and a total of 245,441,000 vehicles by 2009. According to USDoE, the rate of motorization peaked in 2007 at 842.6 vehicles per 1000 people.&lt;ref name=USeDataBook2&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Davis| title = op. cit| year = 2011| pages = 3-5 and 3-9|display-authors=etal}} See Tables 3.3 and 3.5&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Driver's license|licensed drivers]], as of 2009 the country had 1.0 vehicle for every licensed driver, and 1.87 vehicles per household.&lt;ref name=USeDataBook3&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Davis| title = op. cit| year = 2011| pages = 8-6|display-authors=etal}} See Table 8.5&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parabolic torus reflector antenna''' is a quasi-[[parabolic antenna]], where the defining [[parabola]] is not rotated around the main transmission axis, but around an axis which stands vertically to this axis.

Simulsat is a trademark for such antennas designed and manufactured by Antenna Technology Communications.

Whereas parabolic [[satellite dish]]es with one [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB) are able to receive a [[satellite television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] from one [[communications satellite]] at a time, parabolic torus reflector antennas are capable of establishing views to more than 40 [[C band (IEEE)|C]] and [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] satellites simultaneously, by employing multiple [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]]s.

A '''race engineer''' is a [[motorsport]] team member whose role is to communicate with the [[data analyst]] as well as the mechanics to determine the changes to be made to the vehicle. Off the race track, the race engineer analyzes historical data to determine the initial set up for the next race event. The race engineer function includes hands-on management of the vehicle mechanics, organizing testing schedule, as well as studying the regulations. The race engineer seeks to make all these activities occur as seamlessly as possible for their driver.&lt;ref&gt;Meet Andrea Stella. http://fakeferrarinews.wordpress.com/the-ferrari-team-profile/meet-andrea-stella &lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the vehicle set-up must stay within the regulations for the race event. The primary goal of the race engineer is to achieve the best performance from the vehicle and from the driver at the race track.&lt;ref&gt; Job Focus – The Race Engineer. {{cite web |url=http://www.its-story-time.com/wordpress/2009/02/20/job-focus-the-race-engineer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609101140/http://www.its-story-time.com/wordpress/2009/02/20/job-focus-the-race-engineer |archivedate=2013-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good race engineer must have good interpersonal relationship skills. To be effective, the race engineer must have a good working relationship with not only their driver, but also the rest of the team, both at and away from the track. Many times the race engineer is also "the face" of the team for the media; this is especially true during the race while the driver is inaccessible. This makes the race engineers media skills a priority. &lt;ref&gt;The role of the F1 race engineer http://www.f1technical.net/features/3645&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The role of the race engineer on racing teams has grown in importance since the adoption of on-board [[sensors]] in vehicles to collect performance data. The race engineer's job is to evaluate both the vehicle's performance, gathered from the [[telemetry]] in addition to their driver's feedback. The race engineer then seeks to improve the performance, and the drivers desires, by adjusting suspension, engine calibrations, [[aerodynamics]], and other variables which affect the vehicle's performance on the race track.

== Travel  ==
Race engineers tend to travel extensively, especially during the racing season of their motorsport teams.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Bush. http://intheworkforce.com/profile/?i=153 &lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level of professional motorsports, international travel is common. Off season travel for race engineers is usually for testing, training, and visiting vendors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9839">[[File:WindCollector2.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Wind measurement with a Phased Array SODAR]]

'''SODAR''' ('''SOnic Detection And Ranging'''), also written as '''sodar''', is a meteorological instrument used as a [[wind profiler]] to measure the scattering of sound waves by atmospheric turbulence. SODAR systems are used to measure wind speed at various heights above the ground, and the thermodynamic structure of the lower layer of the [[atmosphere]].
 
Sodar systems are in fact nothing more than [[SONAR|sonar]] systems used in the air rather than in water; more specifically, since they operate using the Doppler effect with a multi-beam configuration to determine wind speed, they are the exact in-air equivalent to a subclass of sonar systems known as [[ADCP|acoustic Doppler current profilers]]. Other names used for sodar systems include sounder, echosounder and  acoustic radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sodar.com/about_sodar.htm |title=About Sodar |accessdate=2007-05-08 |publisher=Atmospheric Research &amp; Technology, LLC |date=2006-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629171059/http://www.sodar.com/about_sodar.htm |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doppler Sodar ==
Commercial sodars operated for the purpose of collecting upper-air wind measurements consist of antennas that transmit and receive [[Acoustics|acoustic]] signals. A mono-static system uses the same antenna for transmitting and receiving, while a bi-static system uses separate antennas. The difference between the two antenna systems determines whether atmospheric scattering is by temperature fluctuations (in mono-static systems), or by both temperature and wind velocity fluctuations (in bi-static systems). 

Mono-static antenna systems can be divided into two categories: those using multiple axis, individual antennas and those using a single [[phased array]] antenna. The multiple-axis systems generally use three individual antennas aimed in specific directions to steer the acoustic beam. Using three independent (i.e. non-colinear) axes is enough to retrieve the three components of the wind speed, although using more axes would add redundancy and  increase robustness to noise when estimating the wind speed, using a [[least-squares]] approach. One antenna is generally aimed vertically, and the other two are tilted slightly from the vertical at an orthogonal angle. Each of the individual antennas may use a single transducer focused into a [[parabolic reflector]] to form a [[parabolic loudspeaker]], or an array of [[speaker driver]]s and [[horn loudspeaker|horns]] ([[transducer]]s) all transmitting [[Phase (waves)|in-phase]] to form a single beam. Both the tilt angle from the vertical and the azimuth angle of each antenna are fixed when the system is set up. 

Phased-array antenna systems use a single array of speaker drivers and horns (transducers), and the beams are electronically steered by phasing the transducers appropriately. To set up a phased-array antenna, the pointing direction of the array is either level, or oriented as specified by the manufacturer.
[[File:SODAR-AQ500.jpg|alt=AQ500 in northern Sweden. |thumb|300x300px|AQ500 SoDAR used in wind energy development and wind condition monitoring.]]
The horizontal components of the wind velocity are calculated from the radially measured [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifts]] and the specified tilt angle from the vertical. The tilt angle, or zenith angle, is generally 15 to 30 degrees, and the horizontal beams are typically oriented at right angles to one another. Since the Doppler shift of the radial components along the tilted beams includes the influence of both the horizontal and vertical components of the wind, a correction for the vertical velocity is needed in systems with zenith angles less than 20 degrees. In addition, if the system is located in a region where vertical velocities may be greater than about 0.2&amp;nbsp;m/s, corrections for the vertical velocity are needed, regardless of the beam's zenith angle.

The vertical range of sodars is approximately 0.2 to 2 kilometers (km) and is a function of [[frequency]], power output, atmospheric stability, [[turbulence]], and, most importantly, the [[Noise pollution|noise environment]] in which a sodar is operated. Operating frequencies range from less than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz to over 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz, with power levels up to several hundred watts. Due to the attenuation characteristics of the atmosphere, high power, lower frequency sodars will generally produce greater height coverage. Some sodars can be operated in different modes to better match vertical resolution and range to the application. This is accomplished through a relaxation between [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse length]] and maximum altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Sodar Applications ==
[[File:Wind sodar.png|thumb|240px|right|Wind monitoring using the Fulcrum3D Sodar]]
Traditionally used in atmospheric research, sodars are now being applied as an alternative to traditional wind monitoring for the development of wind power projects. Sodars used for wind power applications are typically focused on a measurement range from 50m to 200m above ground level, corresponding to the size of modern wind turbines. Some sodar products, such as the REMTECH PA-XS Sodar and the AQ510 Sodar, have been specifically developed for this market.

Compact-beam sodars are more accurate in complex terrain where the wind vector can change across the measurement area of the sodar. By providing a more compact beam angle, these sodars reduce the effect of any change in the wind vector. This provides a more accurate estimate of wind flow and therefore energy production of a wind turbine. Compact beam sodars also reduce the effect of fixed echos and allow a more compact unit design.

Multiple-axis sodars provide the capability for simultaneous firing of all three sound beams, unlike single-axis sodars which must fire each sound beam sequentially. Simultaneous firing can provide three times the number of sample points in any given period, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio (SNR), higher data availability and greater accuracy.

Sodars designed for the wind energy industry also differ in important aspects such as the traceability of data as a number of manufacturers do not return full signal and noise spectrum data from the sodar unit, but rather, only return processed wind speed data. This means the raw data cannot be re-analysed or reprocessed.

==Analogy and differences between Sodar and ADCP==

The underlying physical principles behind the two devices are exactly the same. Both devices use sound waves to determine remote properties of the environment. Both devices use the Doppler effect to measure radial speeds on at least three non-colinear beams, which after simple computations yield the three vector components of the speed of the transmitting medium (air or water) at different altitudes. Both sodars and ADCPs can use either separate transducers for each beam or use phased arrays. Finally, both devices may use [[piezoelectric]] transducers to produce and receive the sound. 

However, the operating frequencies between sodars and ADCPs are typically different. Commercial ADCPs as manufactured ''e.g.'' by [[Teledyne_Technologies|Teledyne RDI]] (the ''de facto'' leader of this market) typically use carrier frequencies that are in the hundred of kilohertz range (300 kHz, 600 kHz, 1200 kHz) while sodars transmit only in the low kilohertz range. Transmitting at a higher frequency is possible for ADCPs due to the better sound transmitting qualities of water, and this also benefits to the compacity of the device (a diameter of typically  25 cm / 10" or less for ADCPs). Also, the [[acoustic impedance]] of the transducers is not the same, because they do not operate in the same medium: air for sodars, water for ADCPs; said differently, an ADCP would not work in the air, and a sodar would not work underwater. Finally, it is more common for ADCPs to use four beams, even when they are not using a phased array. This has the benefit of adding some form of redundancy, thus making the estimate of the water currents more robust to noise. This is feasible for sodars too, but for the cost of adding a fourth transducer. The operating range of typical ADCPs is less than two hundred meters (this lowers as frequency increases, as in air).

[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|Screw conveyor|thumb|right]]

[[File:CentrelessConveyor.JPG|thumb|Centreless screw conveyor]]

A '''screw conveyor''' or '''auger conveyor''' is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical [[screw (simple machine)|screw]] blade, called a "''flighting''", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular materials.  They are used in many bulk handling industries.  Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi-solid materials, including food waste, wood chips, aggregates, [[cereal|cereal grains]], animal feed, boiler ash, meat and bone meal, [[municipal solid waste]], and many others. The first type of screw conveyor was the [[Archimedes' screw]], used since ancient times to pump irrigation water.

They usually consist of a trough or tube containing either a spiral blade coiled around a shaft, driven at one end and held at the other, or a "''shaftless spiral''", driven at one end and free at the other.  The rate of volume transfer is proportional to the rotation rate of the shaft. In industrial control applications the device is often used as a [[variable rate feeder]] by varying the rotation rate of the shaft to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process.

A flexible screw conveyor works by using the internal friction within a powder or bulk solid to transfer the forward motion of the powder in contact with the spiral to the whole tube contents. With an angled system, a dynamic equilibrium is set up with the spiral action moving some particles upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiroflow.com/maintain-mix-integrity-flexible-screw-conveyors/|title=Flexible Screw Conveyors {{!}} Mix Integrity {{!}} How It Works|date=2017-09-14|work=Spiroflow|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Screw conveyors can be operated with the flow of material inclined upward. When space allows, this is a very economical method of elevating and conveying.  As the angle of inclination increases, the capacity of a given unit rapidly decreases.

The rotating part of the conveyor is sometimes called simply an [[auger (drill)|auger]].

==In agriculture==
[[Image:Combine-harvesting-corn.jpg|This [[combine harvester]] uses a screw conveyor within the tube to discharge grain into the trailer alongside|thumb|350px]]
[[File:Screw conveyor moving grape stems at Chateau Montelena.gk.webm|thumb|A screw conveyor moving grape stems away from wine grapes after they've been destemmed.]]

The "grain auger" is used in agriculture to move grain from [[truck]]s, [[Chaser bin|grain carts]] or [[Grain hopper trailer|grain trailers]] into grain storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A grain auger may be powered by an electric motor; a [[tractor]], through the [[power take-off]]; or sometimes an [[internal combustion engine]] mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the lower end, a hopper receives grain from the truck or grain cart. A chute on the upper end guides the grain into the destination location.

[[File:First Grain Auger circa 1945.png|thumbnail|left|First Grain Auger invented in 1945 in Toronto, Canada]]
The modern grain auger of today's farming communities was invented by [[Peter Pakosh]]. His grain mover employed a screw-type auger with a minimum of moving parts, a totally new application for this specific use. At [[Massey Ferguson|Massey Harris]] (later Massey Ferguson), young Pakosh approached the design department in the 1940s with his auger idea, but was scolded and told that his idea was unimaginable and that once the auger aged and bent that the metal on metal would, according to a head Massey designer, "start fires all across Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Pakosh, Jarrod. Versatile Tractors: A Farm Boy's Dream. Boston Mills Press. {{ISBN|978-1550464160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakosh, however, went on to design and build a first prototype auger in 1945, and 8 years later start selling tens of thousands under the '[[Versatile (company)|Versatile]]' name, making it the standard for modern grain augers.

A specialized form of grain auger is used to transfer grain into a seed drill, and is usually quite a lot smaller in both length and diameter than the augers used to transfer grain to or from a truck, grain cart or bin. This type of auger is known as a "drill fill". Grain augers with a small diameter, regardless of the use they are put to, are often called "pencil augers".

==Other uses==
Various other applications of the screw or auger conveyor include its use in [[snowblower]]s, to move snow towards an [[impeller]], where it is thrown into the discharge chute. [[Combine harvester]]s use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain into and out of the machine's hopper. [[Ice resurfacer]]s use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice.  An auger is also a central component of an [[injection molding machine]].  An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.

Augers are also present in food processing. They are a tool of choice in powder processing, when it comes to convey or dose precisely bulk solids (powders, pellets...)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.powderprocess.net/Dosing.html&lt;/ref&gt;. In a conventional meat grinder, chunks of meat are led by the auger through a spinning blade and a holed plate. This method emulsifies the fat in beef to soften hamburger patties, and is also used to produce a wide variety of sausages and loaves. Augers are also used to force food products through dies to produce pellets. These are then processed further to produce products such as bran flakes. 

Augers are also used in oil fields as a method of transporting rock cuttings away from the shakers to skips.  Augers are also used in some types of [[pellet stove]]s and barbecue grills, to move fuel from a storage hopper into the firebox in a controlled manner.  Augers are often used in [[machining]], wherein the [[machine tools]] may include an auger to  direct the [[swarf]] (scrap metal or plastic) away from the work piece.

Screw conveyors can also be found in waste water treatment plants to evacuate solid waste from the treatment process.

The amphibious [[infantry fighting vehicle]] [[BMP-3]] uses an auger-type propulsion unit in water.

Sticky mats can be temporary or permanent.  Temporary sticky mats are made of a stack of [[adhesive]] plastic film layers that are periodically peeled off and discarded.    Permanent mats are made of a polymer, usually [[polyester]]- or [[polyvinyl chloride]]-based, that binds particles through [[Static electricity|electrostatic]] forces.

[[Digital goods]] are software programs, music, videos or other electronic files that users download exclusively from the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Music download]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some digital goods are free, others are available for a fee.  The '''taxation of digital goods''' is partially governed by a federal statute and has been the area of significant state legislative and rule-making activity.

==History==
In 1997, the United States federal government decided to limit taxation of Internet activity for a period of time.  The [[Internet Tax Freedom Act]] (ITFA) prohibits taxes on Internet access, which is defined as a service that allows users access to content, information, email or other services offered over the Internet and may include access to proprietary content, information, and other services as part of a package offered to customers.  The Act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods.

The statute has been amended three times since its enactment to extend this prohibition.  The first amendment solely extended the Act's duration.  The second extended it again and clarified the definition of Internet access as including certain telecommunication services, as well as reorganizing sections within the Act.  The third amendment again extended the prohibition but narrowed the definition of Internet access to "not include voice, audio or video programming, or other products and services . . . that utilize Internet protocol . . . and for which there is a charge" except those related to a homepage, email, instant messaging, video clips, and personal storage capacity.

In 2009, Anna Eshoo, Congresswoman from California's 14th District (which includes most of Silicon Valley), introduced a bill to make the Act permanent in its most recent permutation.  However, this bill died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;111th Congress, HR 1560.  This amendment would have merely made the ban permanent, not changing the substance of the Act. http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1560&lt;/ref&gt;

States levying a tax on digital goods may be violating the ITFA.  The states using their original tax code may fall within the grandfather clause of the ITFA, but there has been no litigation to clarify this or other aspects of the Act.  One of the few cases brought under the ITFA involved Community Telecable of Seattle suing the city of Seattle in Washington state court, where Telecable claimed it should not have to pay a telephone utility tax because it was an Internet access provider under the ITFA.  The Washington State Supreme Court held that Telecable could not be taxed as a telephone provider when it was providing Internet access under the ITFA.&lt;ref&gt;164 Wash. 2d 35 (2008). http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&amp;vol=2008_sc/797021MAJ&amp;invol=4&lt;/ref&gt;

Every digital-specific tax created by a state has been enacted after the ITFA became law. These laws may be preempted because the ITFA bars taxes on Internet access, and multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.  Courts have yet to clarify whether the existing laws compound taxes or are discriminatory.  Although, it is likely that these laws can survive scrutiny under the ITFA because they can be interpreted to only tax services that fit within the exception to Internet access described in the statute and to be the only taxes on these digital products.  On the other hand, there may be problems with these taxes because they may cover products and services dealing with homepages, email, personal storage, or video clips.

Without litigation, it may be difficult to distinguish the difference between the definitions of content given by the ITFA, such as between a video clip and video programming.  iTunes, for example, could be designated as video programming for the videos it sells based on the definition found in the federal statute regulating cable companies,&lt;ref&gt;"'Video programming' means programming provided by, or generally considered comparable to programming provided by, a television broadcast station."  47 U.S.C. 522(19).&lt;/ref&gt; and as video clips for its previews.  These laws may also run into trouble if they tax a download that is already taxed by another state, because multiple taxes are defined as taxing property that has been taxed once before by another state or political subdivision.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. §151 section 1105(6).&lt;/ref&gt; VIDEO software&gt;

Another possible federal limitation on Internet taxation is the United States Supreme Court case, ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992),&lt;ref&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=504&amp;invol=298&lt;/ref&gt; which held that under the [[dormant commerce clause]], goods purchased through mail order cannot be subject to a state's sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state levying the tax.  The dormant commerce clause could also apply to any efforts to tax downloads.  Since most downloads are from companies that are centralized in a small number of states, it is likely that there will not be many states with a substantial nexus to download providers.  At present, no litigation has arisen to determine what will be defined as a proper nexus for a distributor of digital content within a state.  It is possible that a state would argue that servers are enough of a nexus to tax the content passing through, although the Supreme Court has already ruled that communication by common carrier is not enough to form a substantial nexus.&lt;ref&gt;''Quill'', 504 U.S. at 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

States initially were slow to enact taxes on downloads, but with recent downturns in tax revenue caused by consumers purchasing more digital downloads, many states have sought ways to impose taxes on purely digital transactions.  There are multiple ways that downloads are taxed.  Some states use their existing franchise, sales, and use taxes to tax purchases/uses/transactions of consumers of Internet goods and services.  Other states enacted laws specifically aimed at digital downloads.

===States relying on general tax laws to govern digital goods===
Some states presume that downloads are automatically covered by their existing tax statutes based on the common law definition of tangible personal property, which is anything that holds value on its own that is not real property.
*Alabama&lt;ref&gt;http://law.justia.com/alabama/codes/27855/140539.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Arizona – Uses definition of tangible personal property to be anything that can be discerned by human perception, which includes digital goods transmitted electronically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/42/05001.htm&amp;Title=42&amp;DocType=ARS {{cite web |url=http://www.us.kpmg.com/microsite/tax/salt/perspectives/persFA01/Hitech.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103221241/http://www.us.kpmg.com/microsite/tax/salt/perspectives/persFA01/Hitech.htm |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Mexico – New Mexico Property Tax Code § 7.35.2 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=FifLink&amp;t=document-frame.htm&amp;l=query&amp;iid=56471360.2780daa8.0.0&amp;q=%5BGroup%20%277-35-2%27%5D&lt;/ref&gt;
*Utah – Clarified its tax law to include digital products in 2008, though it claimed sales tax on these products prior to the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.kpmg.com/microsite/taxnewsflash/2009/Aug/SALT_Digital_Prod.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}  http://le.utah.gov/~2008/bills/hbillenr/hb0206.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*West Virginia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/Code.cfm?chap=11&amp;art=15#15&lt;/ref&gt;

In other states, state tax boards have released bulletins to explain what products are subject to sales and use taxes, tax administrative boards have handed down revenue rulings, and statutes have been amended to define "tangible personal property" to include digital goods and therefore subject them to sales tax.
*Indiana – Interprets tangible personal property as anything that can be perceived by the senses, including electricity, water, gas and steam.  Yet, the taxes do not reach as far as purchasing virtual points for an online game because the points themselves cannot be "perceived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gov/dor/reference/legal/rulings/pdfs/rr200814st.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011071553/http://www.in.gov/dor/reference/legal/rulings/pdfs/rr200814st.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Louisiana – The Supreme Court of Louisiana has interpreted tangible personal property to be equivalent to corporeal movable property.  Article 471 of Louisiana's Civil Code defines corporeal movable property as things that physically exist and normally move or can be moved from one place to another, which is then illustrated by examples, including digital or electronic products such as audio and video downloads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rev.state.la.us/forms/publications/1001%2810_03%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Maine – Taxes all "tangible personal property" that includes any computer software that is not a "custom computer software program."  A custom computer software program is a program made in a single instance for a single customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/36/title36sec1752.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Texas – Defines "taxable items" as including tangible personal property in electronic form instead of in physical form.  TX Tax Code §151.010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm#151.001&lt;/ref&gt; This is in addition to an administrative ruling holding that electronically transmitted music is the same as taxable tangible personal property.

===States that have enacted laws specifically addressing digital goods taxation===
The remaining states that tax downloads have specific statutes that define exactly what is to be taxed and what is not.  The similarity in these taxes is that they are based on a sales-type scheme, where each download (or group of downloads) is taxed like a purchase in physical space.
*Colorado - As of July 1, 2012, software is only taxable if it is prepackaged for sale, is governed by a license agreement, and is delivered in a tangible medium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/Revenue/REVX/1251571250963&lt;/ref&gt;
*Connecticut - As long as no tangible personal property is provided in the transaction, sales or purchases of "digital downloads" are treated as sales or purchases of computer and data processing services, and taxable at a 1% rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://askdrs.ct.gov/scripts/drsrightnow.cfg/php.exe/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=750&amp;p_created=1336735999&amp;p_topview=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Idaho – Includes in its tax code a sales tax on "canned" software, no matter the method of delivery.  Other digital products are then defined as canned software.&lt;ref&gt;http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/rules/idapa35/0102.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kentucky – Defines digital property and then taxes it as common tangible personal property.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/139-00/010.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nebraska – Statute providing for taxes on sales of digital audio works, digital audiovisual works, and digital books.  Further, the state taxes digital codes that provide the purchaser with the right to obtain one or more of these products delivered electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revenue.state.ne.us/info/7-178-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193619/http://www.revenue.state.ne.us/info/7-178-2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Jersey – Statute taxes all digital property delivered through electronic means, such as music, ringtones, movies, books, audio and video works, and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/digitalproperty.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Dakota – Created a specific statute levying a tax on electronically delivered products, defining the products as analogs of their physical counterparts (CDs, DVDs, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.sd.us/drr2/businesstax/publications/taxfacts/digital.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tennessee – Amended its sales tax to include digital products, which include "specified digital products" sold with either permanent ownership rights or for less than permanent use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tennessee.gov/revenue/legsumm/2008legsumm.htm#pc1106 |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529163325/http://www.tennessee.gov/revenue/legsumm/2008legsumm.htm |archivedate=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vermont – Created a specific tax on digital audio-visual works, digital audio works, digital books and ringtones that are transferred electronically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010.1/Acts/ACT001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Washington State – Has a digital download and digital service specific tax.  This tax applies solely to the digital realm, with many exceptions (presumably to avoid preemption by the Internet Tax Freedom Act).&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=2075&amp;year=2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wisconsin – Statute specifies for taxation purposes, digital audio-visual works, digital audio works, and digital books, along with greeting cards, finished artwork, periodicals, video or electronic games, and newspapers or other news or information products that are transferred electronically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revenue.wi.gov/pubs/pb240.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===States that expressly do not tax digital goods===
*North Dakota – Defined digital products and then specifically exempted them from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.gov/tax/salesanduse/streamlinetax/recertificationltrjuly2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602120231/http://www.nd.gov/tax/salesanduse/streamlinetax/recertificationltrjuly2009.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Washington D.C. – Has a sales tax only on data processing and information services which include the distribution of news or current information.  However, the tax statute specifically disclaims sales of digital content and certain Internet related services. Title 47 §2001(n)(1)(N) &amp; (n)(2)(G).&lt;ref&gt;http://government.westlaw.com/linkedslice/default.asp?SP=DCC-1000&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these laws specifically address the taxation of software, which may or may not be interpreted by those states' courts to include downloadable content, i.e. music and video files.

==Legal status in the European Union==
The EU operates Value Added Tax (VAT) and electronic goods and services are subject to VAT at the applicable rate. Each member state may set its own rate of VAT if they want

VAT regulations are very complicated and the intent of this article is not to provide definitive guidance but rather to list some of the relevant factors.

===Businesses located within an EU member state===
If a business is located within an EU member state and its turnover through internet sales or otherwise exceeds that member state's VAT threshold then the business must register for VAT. It is then obliged to collect VAT on its sales (outputs) and remit it to the tax authorities having deducted the VAT it pays on its purchases (inputs).

====Distance selling threshold====
If a business makes sales of physical goods to a member state that exceeds that member states distance selling threshold (typically either EUR 30,000 or EUR 100,000) then it must register to pay VAT in that member state and collect VAT at that member state's VAT rate.

If sales are below the distance selling threshold VAT must be collected at the VAT rate in the business' own member state.

====Selling e-services within the EU====
If a business is located within an EU member state and supplies e-services to an individual who is not VAT registered in another EU member state then VAT rules of the state where the business is located apply. If the business supplies e-services to a VAT-registered individual in another state then the business is not obliged to pay VAT in its state and thus the individual must pay VAT in its state. If the business supplies e-services to a VAT-registered individual yet the individual receives the e-services in a state where neither the business nor the individual has their establishment then the business is obliged to register for VAT in the state where the e-services are delivered to. The 2015 EU VAT legislation requires two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to be produced so as to determine what VAT rate should be applied to these digital goods sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.taxamo.com/identifying-consumers-eu/ |title=Taxamo Blog "Chart Courtesy Of The EU Taxation &amp; Digital Goods custom Website".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A business must always charge VAT to non-VAT registered entities (i.e. consumers) but should not charge VAT to foreign EU VAT registered businesses who provide them with a VAT number. These foreign EU businesses are required to declare their purchase and the tax due to their own tax authorities.

== Proposed new Australian digital services tax ==
In his budget of May 12, 2015, the then Australian Federal Government Treasurer [[Joe Hockey]] [https://www.taxamo.com/australia-digital-services-gst/ revealed] details of a new 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) to be introduced on "certain electronic supplies".

The proposed GST has already been dubbed the '[[Netflix]] Tax' in Australia as on-demand video-streaming is one of the services that will come under the scope of the new rules. The Australian GST on digital services is due to come into effect in July 2017.

On Wednesday, February 10, 2016, the draft bill outlining Australia's new digital GST was introduced with [[Scott Morrison|Treasurer Scott Morrison]] telling the Australian Parliament that the new rules would: "ensure Australian businesses selling digital products and services are not disadvantaged relative to overseas businesses that sell equivalent products in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Treasurer introduces 'Netflix tax' for GST on digital products to Parliament|url = http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/treasurer-introduces-netflix-tax-for-gst-on-digital-products-to-parliament-20160210-gmq88u.html#ixzz3zkxuziBv|newspaper = The Age|date = 2016-02-10|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg| thumb | alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[prescription drugs]] is a feature of '''telepharmacy'''.]]
'''Telepharmacy''' is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of [[telemedicine]], as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff | title = Telepharmacy Increases the Safety of Chemotherapy Preparation | journal = [[US Pharmacist]] | date = 19 November 2007 | volume = 32 | number = 11 | page = 73 | url = http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/10195/?t=men's_health,chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist.

The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of [[telemedicine]]: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friesner | first = Daniel L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = David M. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Charles D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = Howard C. | title = Do remote community telepharmacies have higher medication error rates than traditional community pharmacies?

==Implementation==
The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation.

===Australia===
A form of telepharmacy has been in use by [[Australia]]'s [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a [[telehealth]] consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, [[Queensland]] recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesic]]s and [[gastrointestinal medication]]s. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rural Remote Health |year=2008 |issue=Apr-Jun |volume=8 |page=937 |title=Tele-pharmacy in remote medical practice: the Royal Flying Doctor Service Medical Chest Program |last1=Margolis |first1=S. A. |last2=Ypinazar |first2=V. A. |pmid=18489239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_commentary.pdf |title=Telepharmacy — opportunity or threat? |first=James |last=Davies |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/KimberPetersonTelepharmacy.pdf |title=Telepharmacy—Enabling Technology to Provide Quality Pharmacy Services in Rural and Remote Communities |first1=
Michael B |last1=Kimber |first2=Gregory M |last2=Peterson |journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research |volume=36 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including [[Medicare Part D|changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Radford | first = Andrea | last2 = Slifkin | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Fraser | first3 = Roslyn | last4 = Mason | first4 = Michelle | last5 = Mueller | first5 = Keith | title = The Experience of Sole Community Rural Independent Pharmacies with Medicare Part D: Reports from the Field | journal = Policy Paper P2006-3 | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/rural/pubs/report/WP87.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007&amp;ndash;8]], led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boyle | first = Kaitlin | last2 = Ullrich | first2 = Fred | last3 = Mueller | first3 = Keith | title = Independently owned pharmacy closures in rural America, 2003&amp;ndash;2010 | journal = Rural Policy Brief | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/rupri/publications/policybriefs/2011/Independent%20Pharmacies.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full-time pharmacist, several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[northwestern United States|northwestern]] states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy.

In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/telepharmacy/ | publisher = North Dakota State University | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site [[pharmacy technician]]s and patients through [[videoconferencing]]. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Charles D. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Howard C., Jr | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: Restoring and retaining pharmacy services in rural communities | journal = Journal of Pharmacy Technology | year = 2004 | volume = 20 | pages = 28–39 | url = http://www.jpharmtechnol.com/abstracts/volume20/January-February/28.html | doi=10.1177/875512250402000107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khan | first = Shamima | last2 = Snyder | first2 = Herbert W. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Scott | first4 = David M. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Charles D. | title = Is there a successful business case for telepharmacy? | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | publisher = [[American Telemedicine Association]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | number = 3 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2007.0045 | pmid=18570546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolpack | first = Dave | title = Telepharmacy project expands across country | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 12 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-12-virtual-pharmacy_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of [[community health centers]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by [[videoconferencing]]. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clifton | first = G. Dennis | last2 = Byer | first2 = Heather | last3 = Heaton | first3 = Kristi | last4 = Haberman | first4 = Deborah J. | last5 = Gill | first5 = Harbir | title = Provision of Pharmacy Services to Underserved Populations Via Remote Dispensing and Two-Way Videoconferencing | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = Dec 15, 2003 | volume = 60 | pages = 2577–2582 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/60/24/2577.abstract | issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Native Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], providing telehealth services to [[Alaska Native]] populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/Awards/AwardforExcellenceinMedicationUseSafety/2006AwardsRecipients.aspx | title = 2006 Awards Recipients | publisher = ASHP Foundation | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at [[Naval Hospital Pensacola]] in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Traynor | first = Kate | title = Navy takes Telepharmacy Worldwide | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1134–1136 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/14/1134.full | doi = 10.2146/news100051 | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telehealth Advancement Act | publisher = Center for Connected Health Policy, California | url = http://cchpca.org/telehealth-advancement-act | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]]'s first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Vanessa | title = Telepharmacy could save rural Iowa sites | newspaper = [[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] | location = Cedar Rapids, Iowa | date = 18 October 2012 | url = http://thegazette.com/2012/10/18/pharmacy-draft/ | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of the various American states' [[rural health]] offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Casey1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Sorensen | first2 = Todd D. | last3 = Elias | first3 = Walter | last4 = Knudson | first4 = Alana | last5 = Gregg | first5 = Walter | title = Current practices and state regulations regarding telepharmacy in rural hospitals | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1085-1092 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/13/1085.abstract | doi = 10.2146/ajhp090531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved ([[internet access]], [[Data compression|audio/video compression]] algorithms, [[microphones]] and [[video cameras]]), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Stephania H. | title = What's holding up the telemedicine explosion? | journal = Connected Planet | date = 1 June 1998 | url = http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_whats_holding_telemedicine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings.&lt;ref name="Casey1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Elias | first2 = Walter | last3 = Knudson | first3 = Alana | last4 = Gregg | first4 = Walter | title = Implementation of Telepharmacy in Rural Hospitals: Potential for Improving Medication Safety | journal = Final Report #8 | publisher = Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center | year = 2008 | url = https://www.nodakpharmacy.com/pdfs/UMRHfirstDose.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to [[Protected health information|protect patient medical information]] in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Rathke | first = Ann | title = North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: An Update | booktitle = North Dakota Pharmacist Association Convention | date = 23–25 April 2010 | location = Minot, North Dakota | publisher = NDTP | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/NDTP_PPt__Update.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Adoption of telepharmacy in [[Canada]] began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation.&lt;ref name=CADTH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadth.ca/products/environmental-scanning/health-technology-update/issue2/telepharmacy |title=Virtual pharmacists provide long-distance care |journal=Health Technology Update |issue=2 |date=January 2006 |publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote dispensing]] machines for medication began operation in [[Ontario]], Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes.&lt;ref name="BJCP"/&gt; As of 2009, a hospital in [[Ontario]], Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ross Memorial Hospital, Lindsay, Ontario | journal = Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy | date = September–October 2009 | volume = 62 | number = 5 | page = 424 | pmc=2830020 | pmid=22478928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the [[United Kingdom]] beginning in 2010.&lt;ref name="BJCP"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_news_feature.pdf| title=Remote dispensing machines to be tested in UK hospitals |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in [[Bahrain]], [[Belgium]], [[Cuba]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/blog-post/bizstream/2013-04-24/maxor-expands-puerto-rico-operations |title=Maxor expands Puerto Rico operations |author=Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corp. |date=April 25, 2013 |type=press release |work=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Mannings]] drugstores became the first in [[Hong Kong]] to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tele-Pharmacy on Show at Mannings Stores in Hong Kong | journal = Thistle: The Magazine of [[Jardine Matheson]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | page = 8 | url = http://www.jardines.com/assets/files/NewsAndEvents/thistle/10_vol3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminated merchant file''' ('''TMF''') is a tool used by [[credit card]] processing companies to screen potential [[merchant]]s before giving them a [[merchant account]].&lt;ref name="Visa Acquirer Risk Program Standards Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa Acquirer Risk Program Standards Guide|url=http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/AcquirerRiskProgramStandardsGuide_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Mastercard]] and [[American Express]] it is known as the MATCH list.&lt;ref name=MastercardAPI&gt;[https://developer.mastercard.com/portal/display/api/MATCH MasterCard API]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminated merchant files are shared among processors and act as [[blacklisting|blacklist]]s, where merchants with high-risk accounts or excessive [[chargeback]]s are put on the list and prevented from opening an account with a different [[credit card provider|credit card processor]].

Other reasons for being put on a terminated merchant file include:
* Merchant [[collusion]]
* [[Fraud]]
* [[Money laundering]]

WATIAC, and the WATMAP assembly language that ran on it were developed in 1973 by the newly founded [[Computer Systems Group]],
at the [[University of Waterloo]], under the direction of [[Wes Graham]].

In the 1970s most programming was conducted through [[batch stream processing]], where the operating systems of the day, like [[IBM]]`s [[OS-360]], would allow a single program to use all the resources of a large computer, for a limited period of time.&lt;ref name=ParentsOfInvention&gt;

| quote       = During the 1970s, the University of Waterloo, located in southern Ontario, Canada, was almost as synonymous with computing as MIT or Berkeley.  It had developed extensions to the popular general-purpose Fortran programming language called WATFOR and WATFIV and its own version of the equally popular business computing language COBOL, called WATBOL.

Since student programs were only run a few times, possibly only once, after they had been successfully written, and debugged, efficient running of those programs was of relatively little importance, compared with quick compilation and relatively good error messages.

Waterloo had been a leader in writing single pass, compile-and-go teaching compilers, with first its [[WATFOR]] [[FORTRAN]] compiler, and its [[WATBOL]] [[COBOL]] compiler.&lt;ref name=WatiacWatmap/&gt;&lt;ref name=WatiacArchitecture/&gt;
WATMAP was developed to be a similar compile-and-go teaching compiler.

The '''Yeoman Plotter''' was a [[Plotter (instrument)|plotter]] used on ships and boats to transfer [[GPS]] coordinates or [[RADAR]] echo locations onto a paper navigation chart and to read coordinates from the chart. It was manufactured from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeoman Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.waypoints.com/popups/yeomanfaq.html|website=Waypoint|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2014/2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Yeoman Chartplotter|url=http://www.precisionnavigation.co.uk/PBCPPlayer.asp?ID=1524357|website=Charity &amp; Taylor  (Precision Navigation)|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an intermediary step between traditional paper chart navigation and full electronic chart displays. It was easy to understand for people that were accustomed to paper charts and much cheaper than electronic chart displays available at the time. The continuing fall in prices of electronic chart displays, their increase in functionality such as radar overlay and the advent of cheap tablets eventually made the Yeoman plotter uncompetitive.

==Construction==
The plotter consists of a plotting surface impregnated with fine wires and a moveable "mouse" containing a sensing ring. The mouse's location on the surface can be electronically sensed.

To use the plotter, a conventional paper chart is first fixed in position on the surface (the method of fixing varies between the different models of plotter; see below). It is then "registered" - the mouse is placed over three known points on the chart and a button pressed at each. Knowing the location on the surface of these points, the system can interpolate the mouse's position anywhere on the chart. In the 1990s charts in some countries had plotter reference points printed on them, and the coordinates of these points were pre-programmed in the Yeoman unit. Other charts needed the input of the reference points to be manually added.

Although the device can provide some useful data on its own (positions of charted objects, distances and bearings between points), in practice it is invariably linked to a source of position data such as GPS. This enables many useful features, the most important of which is the fixing on the chart of the vessel's current position. In position mode, four illuminated arrows around a transparent area on the mouse are used. The device is pushed across the chart, following the arrows, until all four of them are extinguished. This indicates that the mouse is directly over the vessel's current position on the chart; if required, a [[pencil]] can be poked through a small hole to mark the fix on the chart. After a couple of goes, this procedure becomes instinctive and very fast.

The mouse can also be used to obtain the range and [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] from the vessel's current position to any other object, simply by placing it over that object on the chart and reading the figures from the display. If a suitable radar is fitted it can be combined with the Yeoman plotter for navigation in poor visibility. In one mode, the position of the mouse on the chart is reflected in a cursor on the radar display - the mouse can be placed over a charted object to identify its echo on the radar, which is very useful for objects whose reflection may not be obvious. Similarly, a position from the radar screen can be sent to the Yeoman - the mouse is moved by hand following the illuminated arrows as for plotting a fix, and is guided to the location of the radar return.

==Advantages==
The way in which the Yeoman plotter combines speedy GPS position fixing with a paper chart is cited as a benefit for two principal reasons. The first is one of safety and reliability - even the best marine electronics fail from time to time, and if the boat's electronic instruments should cease to work then a recent pencil plot on a paper chart becomes extremely valuable. Because such a fix can be made on a Yeoman in around two seconds, it is likely to be updated far more frequently. The fact that the correct chart is guaranteed to be on board, up to date, and open on the chart table ready for reversion to traditional navigation is also an aspect to consider as video chart plotters become more widely used.

The second benefit of the Yeoman plotter over an electronic chart display is cited less often, but to most of its users is the more important - they find it easier to use. While video plotter technology is improving every year, they still must display their charts on relatively small screens, with input via a single small joystick and a few buttons. By contrast, a printed chart on a Yeoman Navigator provides a 35-inch "display" at extremely high resolution, that one can draw on, make notes upon, and use for traditional operations with dividers and rulers, combined with instant (permanent!) position fixes and range-and-bearing information from the Yeoman mouse. This mixing of technology and traditional techniques was quite effective.

== Versions ==

Yeoman made four versions of their plotter for different situations:

; Maxi : Designed to be installed on the bridge of large ships, this is a self-contained chart table up to [[ISO 216|A0]] (approximately 33"x47") in size.
; Navigator : Regarded as the "normal" Yeoman, this is a 28"x21" pad of mousemat-like material, with a control box attached in one corner and six separate clips to secure the chart or the chart can be alternatively be secured using an option called the ClearView which is a transparent flexible screen under which the chart is inserted. This plotter is designed to be used on the chart table of a yacht, connected to the vessel's GPS system. It can in fact be built into the table if required; a menu setting reverses the position data so that it works properly when glued upside-down to the underneath of the tabletop - the mouse can work accurately through up to two centimeters of timber.
; Compact : For the smaller chart table measuring approximately 24" x 20" which has all the same features as the Navigator
; Sport : A portable version of the Yeoman designed to be used in the cockpit of yachts or in open boats. It incorporated a waterproof cover for the chart and velcro straps to hold it in place.

The manufacturing rights for Yeoman Plotters were purchased by Precision Navigation Ltd in 2004 and production has been relocated to East Anglia (UK). In 2014 the ownership of Precision Navigation transferred to Charity &amp; Taylor and production ceased.
