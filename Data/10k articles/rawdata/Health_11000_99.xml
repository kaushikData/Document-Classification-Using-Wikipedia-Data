'''''20 Minute Workout''''' is a Canadian-produced [[aerobics]]-based television program that ran from 1983 to 1984, in which "a bevy of beautiful girls" demonstrated exercise&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt; on a rotating platform.

==Series background==
''20 Minute Workout'' was created by [[Ron Harris (photographer)|Ron Harris]] in 1983, produced by [[Tantra Entertainment]] in association with the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]], and broadcast locally on [[Citytv]]. In the United States, it was [[Television syndication|syndicated]] by [[Orion Pictures|Orion Television]]. Two seasons of the program were produced, although reruns continued to appear for many years afterwards. The first season featured a different instructor for each day of the week, Monday through Friday. Bess Motta, Arlaine Wright, Holly Butler, Nicole Nardini, and Anne Schumacher all had speaking roles.  The second season featured only Bess and Arlaine as instructors. One selling point of the show was the young attractive girls exercising in leotards. The exercise routines were demanding, high-impact aerobics, followed by a [[stretching]] section. Pulsating music from synthesizers played in the background.  For the first season, music was performed by the group [[Shiva (Canadian group)|Shiva]], while the second season featured music by the trio Jermyn/King/Ouillet.

There are numerous websites hosted by fans that detail about the dancers, and include so-called screen-captures from the show. The '':20 Minute Workout'' is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''Aerobicise'', a series of home videos that were first released in 1981, which had varying subtitles of "The Beginners Workout," "The Ultimate Workout," and "The Beautiful Workout."{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 1982, a series of segments aired in the U.S. on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] as [[interstitial programming|unscheduled filler]] in between features, and lasting no longer than five minutes. Both the videos and the filler featured a different cast, and unlike the show they later spawned, exercise instruction was either kept minimal, or not featured at all, and any that was present was given by an off-screen [[narrator]]. The narrator was Jami Allen, one of the show's producers.

"Aerobicise" is also the name of the original 1982 pilot episode of ''20 Minute Workout''.

Scenes from the show are visible on televisions in some scenes of the 1994 Luc Besson film "Leon: The Professional"

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
AAAs occur most commonly in those over 50 years old, in men, and among those with a family history.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; Additional risk factors include [[smoking]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and other [[cardiovascular disease|heart or blood vessel diseases]].&lt;ref name=Wit2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wittels K | title = Aortic emergencies. | journal = Emergency medicine clinics of North America | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 789‚Äì800, vii | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22040707 | doi=10.1016/j.emc.2011.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic conditions with an increased risk include [[Marfan syndrome]] and [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014/&gt; AAAs are the most common form of [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014/&gt; About 85% occur below the [[kidney]]s with the rest either at the level of or above the kidneys.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; In the [[United States]], [[screening (medicine)|screening]] with [[abdominal ultrasound]] is recommended for males between 65 and 75 years of age with a history of smoking.&lt;ref name=USP2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = LeFevre ML | title = Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement. | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 281‚Äì90 | date = 19 August 2014 | pmid = 24957320 | doi=10.7326/m14-1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom and Sweden, screening all men over 65 is recommended.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sv2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svensj√∂|first1=S|last2=Bj√∂rck|first2=M|last3=Wanhainen|first3=A|title=Update on screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a topical review.|journal=European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery|date=December 2014|volume=48|issue=6|pages=659‚Äì67|doi=10.1016/j.ejvs.2014.08.029|pmid=25443524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an aneurysm is found, further ultrasounds are typically done on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=AFP2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Not smoking is the single best way to prevent the disease.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; Other methods of prevention include treating high blood pressure, treating [[hypercholesterolemia|high blood cholesterol]] and not being [[overweight]].&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; Surgery is usually recommended when an AAA's diameter grows to &gt;5.5&amp;nbsp;cm in males and &gt;5.0&amp;nbsp;cm in females.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; Other reasons for repair include the presence of symptoms and a rapid increase in size (more than one centimeter per year).&lt;ref name=AFP2006/&gt; Repair may be either by [[Open aortic surgery|open surgery]] or [[endovascular aneurysm repair]] (EVAR).&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk of death in the short term and a shorter hospital stay, but may not always be an option.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DM, Hulten EA, Ellis ST, Anderson DM, Anderson N, McRae F, Malik JA, Villines TC, Slim AM | title = Open versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in the Elective and Emergent Setting in a Pooled Population of 37,781 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. | journal = ISRN cardiology | volume = 2014 | pages = 149243 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25006502 | doi=10.1155/2014/149243 | pmc=4004021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Biancari F, Catania A, D'Andrea V | title = Elective endovascular vs. open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients aged 80 years and older: systematic review and meta-analysis. | journal = European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 571‚Äì6 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21820922 | doi=10.1016/j.ejvs.2011.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There does not appear to be a difference in longer term outcomes between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paravastu SC, Jayarajasingam R, Cottam R, Palfreyman SJ, Michaels JA, Thomas SM | title = Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD004178 | date = 23 January 2014 | pmid = 24453068 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004178.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With EVAR there is a higher need for repeat procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ilyas S, Shaida N, Thakor AS, Winterbottom A, Cousins C | title = Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow-up imaging: the assessment and treatment of common postoperative complications. | journal = Clinical radiology | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 183‚Äì196 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25443774 | doi=10.1016/j.crad.2014.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Location.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Abdominal aortic aneurysm location]]
The vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum.&lt;ref name="harrisons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fauci|first=Anthony|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2008-03-06|edition=17|chapter=242|isbn=0-07-146633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of rupture is high in a symptomatic aneurysm, which is therefore considered an indication for surgery. The complications include rupture, peripheral [[embolization]], acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and [[inferior vena cava]]) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the [[duodenum]]) [[fistulae]]. On physical examination, a [[palpable]] and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. [[Bruit]]s can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial [[stenosis]].&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;

===Aortic rupture===
{{main|Aortic rupture}}
The signs and symptoms of a ruptured AAA may include severe pain in the lower back, flank, abdomen or groin. A mass that pulses with the heart beat may also be felt.&lt;ref name=Spa2014/&gt; The bleeding can lead to a [[hypovolemic shock]] with [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]]. This may lead to [[Syncope (medicine)|brief passing out]].&lt;ref name=Spa2014/&gt;

The mortality of AAA rupture is as high as 90 percent. 65 to 75 percent of patients die before they arrive at the hospital and up to 90 percent die before they reach the operating room.&lt;ref name=SmallAneurysmTrial&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown LC, Powell JT | title = Risk Factors for Aneurysm Rupture in Patients Kept Under Ultrasound Surveillance | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 230 | issue = 3 | pages = 289‚Äì96; discussion 296‚Äì7 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10493476 | pmc = 1420874 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199909000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bleeding can be [[wikt:retroperitoneal|retroperitoneal]] or into the [[intraperitoneal|abdominal cavity]]. Rupture can also create a connection between the aorta and intestine or [[inferior vena cava]].&lt;ref name=Treska&gt;Treska V. ''et al.'':Aneuryzma b≈ôi≈°n√≠ aorty, Prague, 1999, {{ISBN|80-7169-724-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flank [[ecchymosis]] (appearance of a bruise) is a sign of retroperitoneal [[hemorrhage|bleeding]], and is also called [[Grey Turner's sign]].&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cecil&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|pages=837|edition=24th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aortic aneurysm rupture may be mistaken for the [[renal colic|pain of kidney stones]], or muscle related [[back pain]].&lt;ref name=Spa2014/&gt;

==Causes==
The exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear. There are, however, some hypotheses and well-defined [[risk factors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danmedbul.dk/portal/pls/portal/docs/6348849.PDF{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tobacco smoking: More than 90% of people who develop an AAA have [[Health effects of tobacco|smoked]] at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT 2008 494‚Äì501"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT | title = Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = N.

* Alcohol and hypertension: The inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which leads to [[hemorrhoids]], [[esophageal varices]], and other conditions, is also considered a long-term cause of AAA.
* Genetic influences: The influence of genetic factors is high. AAA is four to six times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20-30%.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baird PA, Sadovnick AD, Yee IM, Cole CW, Cole L | title = Sibling risks of abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Lancet | volume = 346 | issue = 8975 | pages = 601‚Äì4 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 7651004 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(95)91436-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clifton MA | title = Familial abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = Br J Surg | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 765‚Äì6 | date = Nov 1977 | pmid = 588966 | doi = 10.1002/bjs.1800641102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of [[X-linked]] [[mutation]], which would explain the lower incidence in [[heterozygous]] females.

* Atherosclerosis: The AAA was long considered to be caused by [[atherosclerosis]], because the walls of the AAA frequently carry an atherosclerotic burden. However, this hypothesis cannot be used to explain the initial defect and the development of [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]], which is observed in the process.&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Aortadiagramgray.png|thumb|A plate from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' with yellow lines depicting the most common infrarenal location of the AAA]]
[[File:Aortic Aneurism 76F 3D SR Nevit Dilmen.stl|thumb|3D file showing an aortic aneurysm]]
The most striking [[histopathology|histopathological]] changes of the aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the [[tunica media]] and [[intima]] layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in [[foam cells]], extracellular free [[cholesterol]] crystals, [[calcification]]s, [[thrombosis]], and [[venous ulcer|ulcerations]] and ruptures of the layers. [[Adventitial]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]] is present.&lt;ref name=Treska/&gt;
However, the [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of the tunica media by means of a [[proteolytic]] process seems to be the basic [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of [[elastin]] from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt; Other reports have suggested the [[serine protease]] [[granzyme B]] may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of [[decorin]], leading to disrupted [[collagen]] organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia.&lt;ref name="pmid20035050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chamberlain CM, Ang LS, Boivin WA, Cooper DM, Williams SJ, Zhao H, Hendel A, Folkesson M, Swedenborg J, Allard MF, McManus BM, Granville DJ | title = Perforin-independent extracellular granzyme B activity contributes to abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Am.

[[Hemodynamics]] affect the development of AAA, which has a [[wikt:predilection|predilection]] for the [[wikt:infrarenal|infrarenal]] aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta differ from those of the [[thoracic aorta]]. The diameter decreases from the root to the [[aortic bifurcation]], and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of [[elastin]]. The mechanical [[muscle tension|tension]] in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall. The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[wikt:distensibility|distensibility]] also decline with age, which can result in gradual [[wikt:dilatation|dilatation]] of the segment. Higher [[intraluminal]] pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process.&lt;ref name=Treska/&gt; Suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA's development.&lt;ref name="Biasetti"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Biasetti J, Hussain F, Gasser TC | title = Blood flow and coherent vortices in the normal and aneurysmatic aortas: a fluid dynamical approach to intra-luminal thrombus formation | journal = J R Soc Interface | volume = 8 | issue = 63 | pages = 1449‚Äì61 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21471188 | pmc = 3163425 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2011.0041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually diagnosed by [[physical exam]], [[abdominal ultrasound]], or [[CT scan]]. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the outline of an aneurysm when its walls are calcified. However, this is the case in less than half of all aneurysms. Ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine the size of any present. Additionally, free peritoneal fluid can be detected. It is noninvasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include [[MRI]] and [[angiography]].

An aneurysm ruptures if the mechanical stress (tension per area) exceeds the local wall strength; consequently, peak wall stress (PWS)&lt;ref name="Fillinger_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fillinger MF, Marra SP, Raghavan ML, Kennedy FE | title = Prediction of rupture risk in abdominal aortic aneurysm during observation: wall stress versus diameter | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 724‚Äì32 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12663969 | doi = 10.1067/mva.2003.213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and peak wall rupture risk (PWRR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gasser TC, Auer M, Labruto F, Swedenborg J, Roy J | title = Biomechanical rupture risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms: model complexity versus predictability of finite element simulations | journal = Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 176‚Äì185 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20447844 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejvs.2010.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be more reliable parameters than diameter to assess AAA rupture risk.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology. An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3&amp;nbsp;cm (normal diameter of the [[aorta]] is around 2&amp;nbsp;cm),&lt;ref name=ACC2005/&gt; or more than 50% of normal diameter.&lt;ref name="SolomonKent2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=Caren G.|last2=Kent|first2=K. Craig|title=Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|issue=22|year=2014|pages=2101‚Äì2108|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1401430|pmid=25427112}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the outer diameter exceeds 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm, the aneurysm is considered to be large.&lt;ref name=screening/&gt;
A ruptured AAA is a clinical diagnosis involving the presence of the triad of abdominal pain, shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. If these conditions are present, indicating AAA rupture, no further clinical investigations are needed before surgery.&lt;ref name=repair/&gt;

The suprarenal aorta normally measures about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm larger than the infrarenal aorta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm|title=Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm|author=Jeffrey Jim, Robert W Thompson|website=[[UpToDate]]|date=2018-03-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212246/https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm|archivedate=2018-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
*[[Smoking cessation]]
*Treatment of [[hypertension]]

==Screening==
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends a single screening [[abdominal ultrasound]] for abdominal aortic aneurysm in males age 65 to 75 years who have a history of smoking.&lt;ref name=USP2014/&gt; It is unclear if screening is useful in women who have smoked and the USPSTF recommend against screening in women who have never smoked.&lt;ref name=USP2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=MU|last2=Fitzpatrick-Lewis|first2=D|last3=Miller|first3=J|last4=Warren|first4=R|last5=Kenny|first5=M|last6=Sherifali|first6=D|last7=Raina|first7=P|title=Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in asymptomatic adults.|journal=Journal of vascular surgery|date=December 2016|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1855‚Äì1868|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2016.05.101|pmid=27871502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the NHS AAA Screening Programme invites men in England for screening during the year they turn 65. Men over 65 can contact the programme to arrange to be screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/617871/AAA_draft_short_form_decision_aid.pdf|title=NHS Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden one time screening is recommended in all males over 65 years of age.&lt;ref name="Kent2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sv2014" /&gt; This has been found to decrease the risk of death from AAA by 42% with a number needed to screen of just over 200.&lt;ref name="Ali2016" /&gt; Australia has no guideline on screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=D|last2=Mees|first2=B|last3=Verhagen|first3=H|last4=Chuen|first4=J|title=Aortic aneurysms - screening, surveillance and referral.|journal=Australian family physician|date=June 2013|volume=42|issue=6|pages=364‚Äì9|pmid=23781541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeat ultrasounds should be carried out in those who have an aortic size greater than 3.0&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Brown2013/&gt; In those whose aorta is between 3.0 and 3.9&amp;nbsp;cm this should be every three years, if between 4.0 and 4.4&amp;nbsp;cm every two year, and if between 4.5 and 5.4&amp;nbsp;cm every year.&lt;ref name=Brown2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bown MJ, Sweeting MJ, Brown LC, Powell JT, Thompson SG | title = Surveillance intervals for small abdominal aortic aneurysms: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 309 | issue = 8 | pages = 806‚Äì13 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23443444 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2013.950 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The treatment options for asymptomatic AAA are [[wikt:conservative treatment|conservative]] management, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, and immediate repair. Two modes of repair are available for an AAA: [[Open aortic surgery|open aneurysm repair]], and endovascular aneurysm repair ([[EVAR]]). An intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1&amp;nbsp;cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Fil2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filardo|first1=G|last2=Powell|first2=JT|last3=Martinez|first3=MA|last4=Ballard|first4=DJ|title=Surgery for small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 February 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD001835|pmid=25927098|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001835.pub4|pmc=4175535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms.

===Conservative===
Conservative management is indicated in people where repair carries a high risk of mortality and in patients where repair is unlikely to improve life expectancy. The mainstay of the conservative treatment is [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] cessation.

Surveillance is indicated in small asymptomatic aneurysms (less than 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm) where the risk of repair exceeds the risk of rupture.&lt;ref name=Fil2015/&gt; As an AAA grows in diameter, the risk of rupture increases. Surveillance until an aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm has not been shown to have a higher risk as compared to early intervention.&lt;ref name=SmallAneurysm&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell JT, Brown LC, Forbes JF, Fowkes FG, Greenhalgh RM, Ruckley CV, Thompson SG | title = Final 12-year follow-up of surgery versus surveillance in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial | journal = Br J Surg | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 702‚Äì8 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17514693 | doi = 10.1002/bjs.5778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADAM&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederle FA, Wilson SE, Johnson GR, Reinke DB, Littooy FN, Acher CW, Ballard DJ, Messina LM, Gordon IL, Chute EP, Krupski WC, Busuttil SJ, Barone GW, Sparks S, Graham LM, Rapp JH, Makaroun MS, Moneta GL, Cambria RA, Makhoul RG, Eton D, Ansel HJ, Freischlag JA, Bandyk D | title = Immediate repair compared with surveillance of small abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = 19 | pages = 1437‚Äì44 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12000813 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa012573 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/346/19/1437 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070910012757/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/346/19/1437 | archivedate = 2007-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
No medical therapy has been found to be effective at decreasing the growth rate or rupture rate of asymptomatic AAAs.&lt;ref name=Kent2014/&gt; [[Blood pressure]] and [[lipids]] should, however, be treated per usual.&lt;ref name=ACC2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirsch AT, Haskal ZJ, Hertzer NR, Bakal CW, Creager MA, Halperin JL, Hiratzka LF, Murphy WR, Olin JW, Puschett JB, Rosenfield KA, Sacks D, Stanley JC, Taylor LM, White CJ, White J, White RA, Antman EM, Smith SC, Adams CD, Anderson JL, Faxon DP, Fuster V, Gibbons RJ, Hunt SA, Jacobs AK, Nishimura R, Ornato JP, Page RL, Riegel B | title = ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease (lower extremity, renal, mesenteric, and abdominal aortic): a collaborative report from the American Associations for Vascular Surgery/Society for Vascular Surgery, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society for Vascular Medicine and Biology, Society of Interventional Radiology, and the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for the management of patients with peripheral arterial disease)‚Äîsummary of recommendations | journal = J Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 1383‚Äì97; quiz 1398 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16990459 | doi = 10.1097/01.RVI.0000240426.53079.46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
The threshold for repair varies slightly from individual to individual, depending on the balance of risks and benefits when considering repair versus ongoing surveillance. The size of an individual's native aorta may influence this, along with the presence of comorbidities that increase operative risk or decrease life expectancy. Evidence; however, does not support repair if the size is between 4&amp;nbsp;cm and 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Fil2015/&gt;

====Open repair====
{{Main|Open aortic surgery}}
Open repair is indicated in young patients as an elective procedure, or in growing or large, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. The aorta must be clamped off during the repair, denying blood to the abdominal organs and sections of the [[spinal cord]]; this can cause a range of complications. It is essential to make the critical part of the operation fast, so the incision is typically made large enough to facilitate the fastest repair. Recovery after open AAA surgery takes significant time. The minimums are a few days in intensive care, a week total in the hospital and a few months before full recovery.

====Endovascular repair====
[[File:Endovasc.jpg|thumb|Abdominal aortic endoprosthesis, CT scan, original aneurysm marked in blue]]
{{Main|Endovascular aneurysm repair}}
Endovascular repair first became practical in the 1990s and although it is now an established alternative to open repair, its role is yet to be clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in [[intensive care]], less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related [[quality of life]] compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower.&lt;ref name=pmid16782510&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rutherford RB | title = Randomized EVAR trials and advent of level i evidence: a paradigm shift in management of large abdominal aortic aneurysms? | journal = Semin Vasc Surg | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 69‚Äì74 | date = Jun 2006 | pmid = 16782510 | doi = 10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2006.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17502634&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lederle FA, Kane RL, MacDonald R, Wilt TJ | title = Systematic review: repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 10 | pages = 735‚Äì41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17502634 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-146-10-200705150-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EVAR1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Evar Trial Participants | title = Endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 1): randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9478 | pages = 2179‚Äì86 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15978925 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66627-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DREAM&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blankensteijn JD, de Jong SE, Prinssen M, van der Ham AC, Buth J, van Sterkenburg SM, Verhagen HJ, Buskens E, Grobbee DE | title = Two-year outcomes after conventional or endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 23 | pages = 2398‚Äì405 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15944424 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa051255 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/352/23/2398 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125113303/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/352/23/2398 | archivedate = 2008-01-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone.&lt;ref name=EVAR2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Evar Trial Participants | title = Endovascular aneurysm repair and outcome in patients unfit for open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 2): randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9478 | pages = 2187‚Äì92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15978926 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66628-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility.&lt;ref name="doi:10.1590/S1677-54492008000300016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amato AC, Kahlberg AK, Bertoglio LB, Melissano GM, Chiesa RC |title=Endovascular treatment of a triple paraanastomotic aneurysm after aortobiiliac reconstruction |journal=Jornal Vascular Brasileiro|volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=1‚Äì3 |year=2008 |doi=10.1590/S1677-54492008000300016 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1677-54492008000300016&amp;lng=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104212622/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1677-54492008000300016&amp;lng=en |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[Cochrane review]] found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badger|first1=S|last2=Forster|first2=R|last3=Blair|first3=PH|last4=Ellis|first4=P|last5=Kee|first5=F|last6=Harkin|first6=DW|title=Endovascular treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=26 May 2017|volume=5|pages=CD005261|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005261.pub4|pmid=28548204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with [[aortic rupture]] of the AAA, treatment is immediate surgical repair.

Although the current standard of determining rupture risk is based on maximum diameter, it is known that smaller AAAs that fall below this threshold (diameter&lt;5.5&amp;nbsp;cm) may also rupture, and larger AAAs (diameter&gt;5.5&amp;nbsp;cm) may remain stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Darling RC, Messina CR, Brewster DC, Ottinger LW | title = Autopsy study of unoperated abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Alternative methods of rupture assessment have been recently reported. The majority of these approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions have been shown to correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Webster MW | title = Mechanical wall stress in abdominal aortic aneurysm: influence of diameter and asymmetry | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 632‚Äì9 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9576075 | doi = 10.1016/S0741-5214(98)70227-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sacks MS, Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Federle MP, Webster MW | title = In vivo three-dimensional surface geometry of abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 469‚Äì79 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10468231 | doi = 10.1114/1.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, et al. 2009 443‚Äì54"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, Grace PA, Walsh MT, Vorp DA, McGloughlin TM | title = Vessel Asymmetry as an Additional Diagnostic Tool in the Assessment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 443‚Äì54 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19028061 | pmc = 2666821 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2008.08.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength.

==History==
The first historical records about AAA are from [[Ancient Rome]] in the 2nd century AD, when Greek surgeon [[Antyllus]] tried to treat the AAA with [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], central [[Surgical incision|incision]] and removal of [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] material from the [[aneurysm]].
However, attempts to treat the AAA surgically were unsuccessful until 1923. In that year, [[Rudolph Matas]] (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human.&lt;ref name=livesay&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Livesay JJ, Messner GN, Vaughn WK | title = Milestones in Treatment of Aortic Aneurysm: Denton A.

Endovascular aneurysm repair was first performed in the late 1980s and has been widely adopted in the subsequent decades. Endovascular repair was first used for treating a ruptured aneurysm in Nottingham in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yusuf SW, Whitaker SC, Chuter TA, Wenham PW, Hopkinson BR | title = Emergency endovascular repair of leaking aortic aneurysm | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8937 | page = 1645 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7984027 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90443-X | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(94)90443-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] was operated on for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1949 by [[Rudolph Nissen]], who wrapped the aorta with polyethene [[cellophane]]. Einstein's aneurysm ruptured on April 13, 1955. He declined surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly." He died five days later at age 76.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 Famous Patients, Famous Operations, 2002&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Part 3: The Case of the Scientist with a Pulsating Mass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043220/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 |date=2009-07-08 }} from Medscape Surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk assessment===
There have been many calls for alternative approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. ''In vivo'', AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raghavan ML, Kratzberg J, Castro de Tolosa EM, Hanaoka MM, Walker P, da Silva ES | title = Regional distribution of wall thickness and failure properties of human abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = J.

===Prevention and treatment===
An animal study showed that removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later-stage, complications. By eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin A (CypA) from a strain of mice, researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Study establishes major new treatment target in diseased arteries |date=May 10, 2009 |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |url=http://www.physorg.com/news161183060.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091215/http://www.physorg.com/news161183060.html |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent research identified Granzyme B ([[GZMB]]) (a protein-degrading enzyme) to be a potential target in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Elimination of this enzyme in mice models both slowed the progression of aneurysms and improved survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chamberlain CM, Ang LS, Boivin WA, Cooper DM, Williams SJ, Zhao H, Hendel A, Folkesson M, Swedenborg J, Allard MF, McManus BM, Granville DJ | title = Perforin-Independent Extracellular Granzyme B Activity Contributes to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 176 | issue = 2 | pages = 1038‚Äì1049 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20035050 | pmc = 2808106 | doi = 10.2353/ajpath.2010.090700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery points way for new treatment for aneurysms |date=January 27, 2010 |publisher=University of British Columbia |url=http://www.hli.ubc.ca/news_events/news.php?user=events&amp;index=1&amp;count=1&amp;date=20100101 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219124709/http://www.hli.ubc.ca/news_events/news.php?user=events&amp;index=1&amp;count=1&amp;date=20100101 |archivedate=February 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Alcohol withdrawal syndrome''' is a set of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] use after a period of excessive use.&lt;ref name=NICE2010/&gt; Symptoms typically include [[anxiety]], [[tremor|shakiness]], sweating, vomiting, [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], and a mild fever.&lt;ref name=NICE2010/&gt; More severe symptoms may include [[seizures]], [[hallucinations|seeing or hearing things that others do not]], and [[delirium tremens]] (DTs).&lt;ref name=NICE2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Clinical Guideline Centre|title=Alcohol Use Disorders: Diagnosis and Clinical Management of Alcohol-Related Physical Complications|date=2010|publisher=Royal College of Physicians (UK)|location=London|edition=No. 100|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0047840/|accessdate=21 October 2016|language=en|chapter=2 Acute Alcohol Withdrawal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131202232/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0047840/|archivedate=31 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink, are worst at 24 to 72 hours, and improve by seven days.&lt;ref name=Sim2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=SA|last2=Wilson|first2=MP|last3=Nordstrom|first3=K|title=Psychiatric Emergencies for Clinicians: Emergency Department Management of Alcohol Withdrawal|journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=September 2016|volume=51|issue=3|pages=269‚Äì73|pmid=27319379|doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.03.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Alcohol withdrawal may occur in those who are alcohol [[physical dependence|dependent]].&lt;ref name=NICE2010/&gt; This may occur following a planned or unplanned decrease in alcohol intake.&lt;ref name=NICE2010/&gt; The underlying mechanism involves a decreased responsiveness of [[GABA receptors]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; The withdrawal process is typically followed using the [[Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, revised]] (CIWA-Ar).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuckit |first1=MA |title=Recognition and management of withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens) |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |date=27 November 2014 |volume=371 |issue=22 |pages=2109‚Äì13 |pmid=25427113 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1407298|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/08b9z9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
The typical treatment of alcohol withdrawal is with [[benzodiazepines]] such as [[chlordiazepoxide]] or [[diazepam]].&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt; Often the amounts given are based on a person's symptoms.&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt; [[Thiamine]] is recommended routinely.&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt; [[Electrolyte problems]] and [[low blood sugar]] should also be treated.&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt; Early treatment improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, and society --&gt;
In the Western world about 15% of people have problems with [[alcoholism]] at some point in time.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; About half of people with alcoholism will develop withdrawal symptoms upon reducing their use, with four percent developing severe symptoms.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; Among those with severe symptoms up to 15% die.&lt;ref name=Sim2016/&gt; Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal have been described at least as early as 400 BC by [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Scott C.|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Alcohol: Social, Cultural, and Historical Perspectives|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483374383|page=Alcohol Withdrawal Scale|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=R9i5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022023038/https://books.google.ca/books?id=R9i5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156|archivedate=2016-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kis2013/&gt; It is not believed to have become a widespread problem until the 1800s.&lt;ref name=Kis2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kissin|first1=Benjamin|last2=Begleiter|first2=Henri|title=The Biology of Alcoholism: Volume 3: Clinical Pathology|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781468429374|page=192|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hp7TBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022023100/https://books.google.ca/books?id=hp7TBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|archivedate=2016-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur primarily in the central nervous system. The severity of withdrawal can vary from mild symptoms such as sleep disturbances and anxiety to severe and life-threatening symptoms such as [[delirium]], [[hallucinations]], and autonomic instability.

Withdrawal usually begins 6 to 24 hours after the last drink.&lt;ref name=Mun2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muncie HL |first=Jr |author2=Yasinian, Y |author3=Oge', L |title=Outpatient management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome |journal=American Family Physician |date=Nov 1, 2013 |volume=88 |issue=9 |pages=589‚Äì95 |pmid=24364635}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can last for up to one week.&lt;ref name="Mc2008"/&gt; To be classified as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, patients must exhibit at least two of the following symptoms: increased hand tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient hallucinations (auditory, visual or tactile), [[psychomotor agitation]], anxiety, [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s, and [[Dysautonomia|autonomic instability]].&lt;ref name="aws" /&gt;

The severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors, the most important of which are degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual has been using alcohol, and previous history of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref name="aws" /&gt; Symptoms are also grouped together and classified:
*Alcohol hallucinosis: patients have transient visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations, but are otherwise clear.&lt;ref name="aws" /&gt;
*Withdrawal seizures: seizures occur within 48 hours of alcohol cessations and occur either as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure or as a brief episode of multiple seizures.&lt;ref name="Manasco"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manasco |first=A |author2=Chang, S |author3=Larriviere, J |author4=Hamm, LL |author5=Glass, M |title=Alcohol withdrawal |journal=Southern Medical Journal |date=November 2012 |volume=105 |issue=11 |pages=607‚Äì12 |pmid=23128805 |doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e31826efb2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Delirium tremens: hyperadrenergic state, disorientation, tremors, diaphoresis, impaired attention/consciousness, and visual and auditory hallucinations.&lt;ref name="aws" /&gt; This usually occurs 24 to 72 hours after alcohol cessation. Delirium tremens is the most severe form of withdrawal and occurs in 5 to 20% of patients experiencing detoxification and 1/3 of patients experiencing withdrawal seizures.&lt;ref name="Manasco" /&gt;

===Progression===
Typically the severity of the symptoms experienced depends on the amount and duration of prior alcohol consumption as well as the number and severity of previous withdrawals. Even the most severe of these symptoms can occur as soon as 2 hours after cessation; this rapid onset along the syndrome's unpredictability necessitates either pre-planned hospitalization, treatment coordinated with a doctor, or at the very least rapid access to medical care; a supporting system of friends or family should also be introduced prior to addressing detoxification. In many cases, however, symptoms follow a reasonably predictable time frame as exampled below:

Six to 12 hours after the ingestion of the last drink, withdrawal symptoms such as shaking, headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting occur.&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments?page=2#1 |title=Alcohol Withdrawal: Symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=WebMD |publisher=WebMD, LLC |accessdate=28 February 2016 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035755/http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments?page=2#1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other comparable symptoms may also occur in this period. Twelve to 24 hours after cessation, the condition may progress to such major symptoms as confusion, hallucinations&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; (with awareness of reality), tremor, agitation, and similar ailments.

At 24 to 48 hours following the last ethanol ingestion, the possibility of seizures should be anticipated.&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; Meanwhile, none of the earlier withdrawal symptoms will have abated. Seizures carry the risk of death for the alcoholic.

Although the patient's condition usually begins to improve after 48 hours, withdrawal symptoms sometimes continue to increase in severity and advance to [[delirium tremens]], which is characterized by hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality, severe confusion, seizures, high blood pressure, and fever that can persist anywhere from 4 to 12 days.&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt;

===Protracted withdrawal===
{{See also|Protracted withdrawal syndrome}}
A protracted alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in many alcoholics when withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage but usually at a subacute level of intensity and gradually decreasing with severity over time. This syndrome is sometimes referred to as the [[post-acute-withdrawal syndrome]]. Some withdrawal symptoms can linger for at least a year after discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms can include a craving for alcohol, inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things (known as [[anhedonia]]), clouding of [[sensorium]], disorientation, nausea and vomiting or headache.&lt;ref name="Alcohol protracted withdrawal syndrome: the role of anhedonia"/&gt;

Insomnia is a common [[protracted withdrawal]] symptom that persists after the acute withdrawal phase of alcohol. Insomnia has also been found to influence relapse rate. Studies have found that [[Magnesium in biology|magnesium]] or [[trazodone]] can help treat the persisting withdrawal symptom of insomnia in recovering alcoholics. Insomnia can be difficult to treat in alcoholics because many of the traditional sleep aids (e.g., benzodiazepine receptor agonists and barbiturate receptor agonists) work via a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor mechanism and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. However, [[trazodone]] is not cross-tolerant with alcohol.&lt;ref name="Magnesium treatment of primary alcohol-dependent patients during subacute withdrawal: an open pilot study with polysomnography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dpsoteotiaps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stoawwt"/&gt; The acute phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can occasionally be protracted. Protracted [[delirium tremens]] has been reported in the medical literature as a possible but unusual feature of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Protracted alcohol withdrawal delirium"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic use of [[ethanol|alcohol]] leads to changes in brain chemistry especially in the GABAergic system. Various adaptations occur such as changes in [[gene expression]] and down regulation of [[GABAA receptors|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]]. During acute alcohol withdrawal, changes also occur such as upregulation of alpha4 containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and downregulation of alpha1 and alpha3 containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Neurochemical changes occurring during alcohol withdrawal can be minimized with drugs which are used for acute detoxification. With abstinence from alcohol and cross tolerant drugs these changes in neurochemistry gradually return towards normal.&lt;ref name="Changes in GABA(A) receptor gene expression associated with selective alterations in receptor function and pharmacology after ethanol withdrawal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin"/&gt; Adaptations to the [[NMDA]] system also occur as a result of repeated alcohol intoxication and are involved in the hyper-excitability of the central nervous system during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. [[Homocysteine]] levels, which are elevated during chronic drinking, increase even further during the withdrawal state, and may result in [[excitotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="Hughes-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=JR. |title=Alcohol withdrawal seizures |journal=Epilepsy Behav |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=92‚Äì7 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.02.037 |pmid=19249388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations in [[ECG]] (in particular an increase in [[QT interval]]) and [[EEG]] abnormalities (including abnormal quantified EEG) may occur during early withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Hughes-2009"/&gt; Dysfunction of the [[hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis]] and increased release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] occur during both acute as well as protracted abstinence from alcohol and contribute to both acute and protracted withdrawal symptoms. [[Anhedonia]]/[[dysphoria]] symptoms, which can persist as part of a [[protracted withdrawal]] may be due to [[dopamine]] underactivity.&lt;ref name="pmid20148778"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heilig M, Egli M, Crabbe JC, Becker HC |title=Acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence and negative affect in alcoholism: are they linked? |journal=Addict Biol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=169‚Äì84 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20148778 |pmc=3268458 |doi=10.1111/j.1369-1600.2009.00194.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindling===
{{See also|Kindling (substance withdrawal)}}
Kindling is a phenomenon where repeated alcohol detoxifications leads to an increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. For example, binge drinkers may initially experience no withdrawal symptoms, but with each period of alcohol use followed by cessation, their withdrawal symptoms intensify in severity and may eventually result in full-blown [[delirium tremens]] with convulsive seizures. [[Alcoholics]] who experience seizures during detoxification are more likely to have had previous episodes of alcohol detoxification than patients who did not have seizures during withdrawal. In addition, patients with previous withdrawal syndromes are more likely to have more medically complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Kindling can cause complications and may increase the risk of relapse, alcohol-related [[brain damage]] and cognitive deficits. Chronic alcohol misuse and kindling via multiple alcohol withdrawals may lead to permanent alterations in the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;ref name="GABA systems, benzodiazepines, and substance dependence"/&gt; The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[convulsions]] and [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Binge drinking is associated with increased impulsivity, impairments in [[spatial working memory]] and impaired [[social emotional learning|emotional learning]]. These adverse effects are believed to be due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified repeatedly but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be the most important factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the [[amygdala]] and [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Stephens-2008"/&gt;

People in [[adolescence]] who experience repeated withdrawals from [[binge drinking]] show impairments of long-term nonverbal memory. Alcoholics who have had two or more alcohol withdrawals show more frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction than alcoholics who have experienced one or no prior withdrawals. Kindling of neurons is the proposed cause of withdrawal-related cognitive damage. Kindling from repeated withdrawals leads to accumulating neuroadaptational changes. Kindling may also be the reason for cognitive damage seen in binge drinkers.&lt;ref name="Courtney-2009"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Many hospitals use the [[Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol]] (CIWA) protocol in order to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed.&lt;ref name=aws/&gt; When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear. The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar), while retaining its validity and reliability, to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sullivan |first1=JT |last2=Sykora |first2=K |last3=Schneiderman |first3=J |last4=Naranjo |first4=CA |last5=Sellers |first5=EM |title=Assessment of alcohol withdrawal: the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar) |journal=Br J Addict. |date=1989 |volume=84 |issue=11 |pages=1353‚Äì7 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00737.x |pmid=2597811|citeseerx=10.1.1.489.341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conditions that may present similarly include [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] (a condition also mainly caused by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor adaptation).

==Treatment==
[[Benzodiazepines]]  are effective for the management of symptoms as well as the prevention of seizures.&lt;ref name="Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal"/&gt; Certain vitamins are also an important part of the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In those with severe symptoms inpatient care is often required.&lt;ref name=Mun2013/&gt; In those with lesser symptoms treatment at home may be possible with daily visits with a health care provider.&lt;ref name=Mun2013/&gt;

===Benzodiazepines===
Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are generally safe and effective in suppressing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bird |first=RD |author2=Makela, EH |title=Alcohol withdrawal: what is the benzodiazepine of choice? |journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |date=January 1994 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=67‚Äì71 |pmid=8123967|doi=10.1177/106002809402800114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This class of medication is generally effective in symptoms control, but need to be used carefully. Although benzodiazepines have a long history of successfully treating and preventing withdrawal, there is no consensus on the ideal one to use. The most commonly used agents are long-acting benzodiazepines, such as [[chlordiazepoxide]] and [[diazepam]]. These are believed to be superior to other benzodiazepines for treatment of delirium and allow for longer periods between doses. However, benzodiazepines with intermediate half-lives like [[lorazepam]] may be safer in people with liver problems.&lt;ref name=Mc2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKeon |first=A |author2=Frye, MA |author3=Delanty, N |title=The alcohol withdrawal syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |date=August 2008 |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=854‚Äì62 |pmid=17986499 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.128322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary debate between use of long-acting benzodiazepines and short-acting is that of ease of use. Longer-acting drugs, such as diazepam, can be administered less frequently. However, evidence does exist that "symptom-triggered regimens" such as those used when treating with lorazepam, are as safe and effective, but have decreased treatment duration and medication quantity used.&lt;ref name=Mc2008/&gt;

Although benzodiazepines are very effective at treating alcohol withdrawal, they should be carefully used. Benzodiazepines should only be used for brief periods in alcoholics who are not already dependent on them, as they share cross tolerance with alcohol. There is a risk of replacing an alcohol addiction with benzodiazepine dependence or adding another addiction. Furthermore, disrupted GABA benzodiazepine receptor function is part of [[alcohol dependence]] and chronic benzodiazepines may prevent full recovery from alcohol induced mental effects.&lt;ref name="Changes in GABAA receptor function and cross-tolerance to ethanol in diazepam-dependent rats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronic ethanol produces a decreased sensitivity to the response-disruptive effects of GABA receptor complex antagonists"/&gt; The combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol can amplify the adverse psychological effects of each other causing enhanced depressive effects on mood and increase suicidal actions and are generally contraindicated except for alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Alcohol use and anxiety"/&gt;

===Vitamins===
Alcoholics are often deficient in various nutrients, which can cause severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome|Wernicke syndrome]]. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of [[thiamine]], [[folic acid]], and [[pyridoxine]] intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a [[banana bag]] for intravenous administration.&lt;ref name="Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal"/&gt;

===Anticonvulsants===
Very limited evidence indicates that [[topiramate]] or [[pregabalin]] may be useful in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.&lt;ref name="Hammond2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=CJ|last2=Niciu|first2=MJ|last3=Drew|first3=S|last4=Arias|first4=AJ|title=Anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol use disorders|journal=CNS Drugs|date=April 2015|volume=29|issue=4|pages=293‚Äì311|doi=10.1007/s40263-015-0240-4|pmid=25895020|pmc=5759952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited evidence supports the use of [[gabapentin]] or [[carbamazepine]] for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin does not appear to be effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting.&lt;ref name="Hammond2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=JG|last2=Hall-Flavin|first2=D|last3=Nelson|first3=S|last4=Schmidt|first4=KA|last5=Schak|first5=KM|title=The role of gabapentin in the management of alcohol withdrawal and dependence|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=August 2015|volume=49|issue=8|pages=897‚Äì906|doi=10.1177/1060028015585849|pmid=25969570|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 [[Cochrane review]] similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported.&lt;ref name="Minozzi-2010"/&gt; [[Paraldehyde]] combined with [[chloral hydrate]] showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms.&lt;ref name="Minozzi-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minozzi |first1=S. |last2=Amato |first2=L. |last3=Vecchi |first3=S. |last4=Davoli |first4=M. |title=Anticonvulsants for alcohol withdrawal |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005064/pdf_fs.html |format=PDF |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=CD005064 |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005064.pub3 |pmid=20238337 |last5=Minozzi |first5=Silvia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFSvGjiZ?url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005064/pdf_fs.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |deadurl=no |editor1-last=Minozzi |editor1-first=Silvia |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term anticonvulsant medications are not usually recommended in those who have had prior seizures due to withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Wise2018&gt;{{cite web |title=American Epilepsy Society Choosing Wisely |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-epilepsy-society/ |website=www.choosingwisely.org |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of further drinking===
There are three medications used to help prevent a return to drinking: [[disulfiram]], [[naltrexone]], and [[acamprosate]]. They are used after withdrawal has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acamprosate: A New Medication for Alcohol Use Disorders |url=https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/MS974/MS974.pdf |accessdate=8 January 2016 |date=2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906045606/http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//MS974/MS974.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
[[Clonidine]] may be used in combination with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms.&lt;ref name="aws" /&gt; There is insufficient evidence to support the use of [[baclofen]] for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.&lt;ref name="Liu2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=J|last2=Wang|first2=LN|title=Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=April 2015|volume=4|issue=4|page=CD008502|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008502.pub4|pmid=25836263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antipsychotics]], such as [[haloperidol]], are sometimes used in addition to benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis.&lt;ref name=aws/&gt; Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. [[Clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], or low-potency [[phenothiazines]] (such as [[chlorpromazine]]) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.&lt;ref name="Desk Reference for Clinical Pharmacology"/&gt;

While intravenous [[ethanol]] could theoretically be used, evidence to support this use, at least in those who are very sick, is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodges |first=B |author2=Mazur, JE |title=Intravenous ethanol for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in critically ill patients |journal=Pharmacotherapy |date=November 2004 |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=1578‚Äì85 |pmid=15537562 |doi=10.1592/phco.24.16.1578.50945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Failure to manage the alcohol withdrawal syndrome appropriately can lead to permanent brain damage or death.&lt;ref name="pmid19670554"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanwella R, de Silva V |title=Treatment of alcohol dependence |journal=Ceylon Med J |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=63‚Äì5 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19670554 |doi=10.4038/cmj.v54i2.877}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that brain damage due to alcohol withdrawal may be prevented by the administration of [[NMDA antagonist]]s, [[calcium antagonist]]s, and [[glucocorticoid antagonist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hunt-"/&gt;

===Substances impairing recovery===
Continued use of benzodiazepines may impair recovery from psychomotor and cognitive impairments from alcohol.&lt;ref name="Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide"/&gt; Cigarette smoking may slow down or interfere with recovery of brain pathways in recovering alcoholics.&lt;ref name="Neurobiological and neurocognitive effects of chronic cigarette smoking and alcoholism"/&gt;

'''Anandwan''' literally, ''Forest of happiness'', located around 5 kilometers from [[Warora]] in [[Chandrapur district]] in the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], is an [[ashram]] and a community rehabilitation centre which was mainly started for [[leprosy]] patients and the disabled from downtrodden sections of society. It was founded in 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandwan.in/about_us.html Anandwan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325222015/http://www.anandwan.in/about_us.html |date=25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted social activist [[Baba Amte]]. The project is run by the organisation Maharogi Seva Samiti. Two of its other projects are [[Lok Biradari Prakalp]] and Somnath, a village for cured leprosy patients.

Baba Amte developed Anandwan to be a self-contained ashram (which could be described as "a [[kibbutz]] for the sick"). Today residents are self-sufficient in terms of basic subsistence.
In addition the ashram has various home-based, small-scale industry units run by the residents that generate income to cover additional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.schweitzershospitalfund.org.uk/anandwan.html |title=Dr. Schweitzer's Hospital Fund (UK) - Anandwan |access-date=10 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221063228/http://schweitzershospitalfund.org.uk/anandwan.html |archive-date=21 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba Amte also shaped Anandwan as an environmentally aware community to practice energy utilization, waste recycling and minimizing use of natural resources that might otherwise lead to their depletion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chanda.nic.in/htmldocs/anandwan.htm The Miracle Worker Baba Amte - Collector's office, Chandrapur district] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126105610/http://chanda.nic.in/htmldocs/anandwan.htm |date=26 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anandwan today has two hospitals, a college, an orphanage, a school for the blind, a school for the deaf and a technical wing. 
[[Dr. Vikas Amte]], Baba Amte's elder son, is the chief functionary at Anandwan. He undertook various experiments in Anandwan regarding rehabilitation which have been mentioned in a book titled 'Anandwan Prayogwan'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">'''Angitia''' was a [[List of Roman deities|goddess]] among the [[Marsi]], the [[Paeligni]] and other [[Oscan]]-[[Umbrian]] peoples of central [[Italy]]. She was associated in antiquity with [[snake-charmer]]s who claimed her as their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emma Dench]], ''From Barbarians to New Men: Greek, Roman, and Modern Perceptions of Peoples from the Central Apennines'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 24, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman mythology|Roman interpretations]] probably obscure her Marsian significance.&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angitia's myths vary. According to [[Gnaeus Gellius]] (late 2nd century BC),&lt;ref&gt;As recorded by [[Solinus]] 2.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Angitia was one of the three daughters of [[Ae√´tes]], along with [[Medea]] and [[Circe]], two of the most famed sorceresses of [[Greek myth]]. Circe, as widely known from the ''[[Odyssey]]'', practiced transforming spells; Medea ended up in Italy, where her son ruled over the Marsi. Angitia lived in the area around the [[Fucine lake]] and specialized in curing [[snake bites]].&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angitia is attested by [[inscription]]s in the territory of the Marsi and elsewhere in the [[Apennines#Central Apennines|Central Apennines]]. She is named in three inscriptions from [[Luco dei Marsi]], in antiquity known as ''[[Lucus Angitiae]]'', "Sacred Grove of Angitia." The earliest is a dedication to the goddess "on behalf of the Marsic [[Roman legion|legions]],"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.5 = ''[[ILLRP]]'' 7 = Ve. 228a (Marsic Latin).&lt;/ref&gt; dating to the late 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The name also appears on a dedicatory [[cippus]] from [[Civita d'Antino]], in the [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] [[Iguvine Tables|Iguvine Tablets]], and in inscriptions in the territories of the [[Paeligni]], [[Vestini]], and [[Sabines]].&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', pp. 159‚Äì160.&lt;/ref&gt; She is mentioned along with [[Angerona]] in one inscription,&lt;ref&gt;Orelli, p. 87, no. 116; p. 335, no. 1846&lt;/ref&gt; and in another her name appears in the plural.&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Another indicates that she had a temple and a treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Orelli, p.87, no. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans derived her name from ''anguis'', "serpent," hence the form ''Anguitia''.&lt;ref&gt;Dench, ''From Barbarians to New Men'', p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

As snakes were often associated with the healing arts in antiquity (see, for instance, [[rod of Asclepius]]), Angitia is believed to have been mainly a goddess of healing.  She had powers of witchcraft, magic and medicine being regarded as complementary in the ancient world, and was a master in the art of miraculous and herbal healing, especially when it came to snakebites. She was also attributed with a wide range of powers over snakes, including the power to kill snakes with a touch.

According to the account given by [[Servius]], Angitia was of Greek origin, for Arigitia was the name given by the Marrubians to [[Medea]], who after having left [[Colchis]] came to Italy with [[Jason]] and taught the people the above-mentioned remedies. [[Silius Italicus]] identifies her as Medea.

'''Boris Vladimirovich Morukov''' ({{lang-ru|–ë–æ—Ä–∏ÃÅ—Å –í–ª–∞–¥–∏ÃÅ–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ú–æ—Ä—É–∫–æ–≤}}; 1 October 1950 ‚Äì 1 January 2015) was a Russian [[physician]] at the State Research Center RF-Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP). He trained with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] as a research-cosmonaut and flew aboard [[NASA]] Space Shuttle mission [[STS-106]] as a [[mission specialist]].

==Biography==
Morukov graduated from high school in 1967 and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the 2nd Moscow Medical Institute (now [[Russian State Medical University]]) in 1973. He joined the professorate in [[outer space|space]], [[aviation]] and naval medicine at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in 1978 and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in these disciplines in 1979. As a cosmonaut-physician, Morukov completed [[medical]] training in [[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[otolaryngology]], [[stomatology]], [[ophthalmology]], and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] between 1989-91. In 1995, he took an advanced course in emergency medical care. In 1996, he completed a medical training course in [[endocrinology]] and [[hematology]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

From October 1990 to February 1992, Morukov attended a basic space-training course at [[Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]]. For more than two decades he was involved in providing medical operations support for manned space flights. From 1979-80 he provided medical support for the prolonged space missions on the space station "[[Salyut 6]]" as a member of the staff in [[Mission Control Center]]. From 1982-87, Morukov coordinated scientific projects dedicated to the development of countermeasures to the negative metabolic changes that occur during [[hypokinesia]] and [[microgravity]]. His specific scientific interest in this area is [[calcium metabolism correction]]. He organized a series of experiments with prolonged head-down tilt, including a 370-day experiment dedicated to the experimental testing of a countermeasure complex for prolonged space flights. He participated in a joint American-Russian medical experiment on [[STS-60]], [[STS-71|Mir 18/STS-71]] and all other Mir-[[NASA]] Project Missions. From 1995-98 he served as the Human Life-Sciences Experiments Coordinator for the NASA-Mir scientific program. He published more than 100 scientific papers and has [[patents]] for four inventions. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Spaceflight experience==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Morukov was first selected for medical-cosmonaut service in 1976. Based on his qualifications, he was continually offered medical-cosmonaut selection and was chosen as a cosmonaut-researcher in 1989. Upon completion of his basic cosmonaut-training in 1992, he became a cosmonaut-researcher in the Institute for Biomedical Problems. From January to July 1993, Morukov completed a technical, medical and scientific training course as a cosmonaut-researcher of the cosmonaut-physician flight on-board [[Mir]] Station Project (during Mir 15-17 Missions). From November 1997 to February 1998, he completed a regularly scheduled technical training course, which included ISS Russian-segment systems. From August 1998 to January 1999, Morukov attended the Flight-Surgeon Training Course at [[Johnson Space Center]].

Morukov served on the crew of [[STS-106]] (8‚Äì20, 2000). The STS-106 crew successfully prepared the [[International Space Station]] for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], power converters, a [[toilet]] and a treadmill on the Space Station. Two crew members performed a space walk in order to connect power, data and communications cables to the newly arrived [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda Service Module]] and the Space Station. Morukov logged 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes in space.

==Death==
Morukov died on 1 January 2015, aged 64, from undisclosed causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2245507 Profile], vesti.ru; accessed 15 February 2015.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-010115a-obituary-boris-morukov-cosmonaut.html Russian cosmonaut Boris Morukov, space station visitor and Mars sim leader, dies], collectspace.com; accessed 15 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife, Nina, son Ivan, daughter Olga, and mother, Lidia F. Khromova.

[[File:US Navy 090611-N-3271W-003 Local area children test their fitness skills during a Junior Seal Fitness.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of school children doing sit-ups|School children perform [[Sit-up (exercise)|sit-ups]], a common type of calisthenic, during a school [[Physical fitness|fitness]] day.]]

'''Calisthenics''' is a form of [[exercise]] consisting of a variety of [[Gross motor skill|gross motor]] movements‚Äîrunning, standing, grasping, pushing, etc.‚Äîoften performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, so essentially, [[bodyweight exercises]]. They are intended to increase body strength, body fitness, and flexibility, through movements such as pulling or pushing oneself up, bending, jumping, or swinging, using only one's body weight for resistance; usually conducted in concert with  [[stretching|stretches]]. When performed vigorously and with variety, calisthenics can provide the benefits of [[anaerobic exercise|muscular]] and [[aerobic conditioning]], in addition to improving [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor skills]] such as balance, agility and coordination. Many consider calisthenics as "movement through space", meaning you can move freely without any restriction blocking your full strength.

Urban calisthenics are a form of [[street workout]]; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban areas. Individuals and groups train to be able to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as [[muscle-up]]s, levers, and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.

[[Team sports|Sports teams]] and [[military units]] often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of [[synchronization|synchronized]] [[physical training]] (often including a customized "[[call and response]]" routine) to increase [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] and [[discipline]]. Calisthenics are also popular as a component of [[phys ed|physical education]] in primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.

In addition to general fitness, calisthenic exercises are often used as baseline physical evaluations for military organizations around the world. Two examples are the [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|U.S. Army Physical Fitness Test]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test|U.S.M.C. Physical Fitness Test]].

==History==

The word ''callisthenics'' comes from the ancient Greek words ''kallos'' (Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøœÇ), which means "beauty" or "beautiful" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and ''sthenos'' (œÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ), meaning "strength" (great mental strength, courage, strength and determination). It is the art of using one's bodyweight as resistance in order to develop physique.

Disciples of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] brought their version of [[gymnastics]] to the United States, while Catherine Beecher and Dio Lewis set up [[physical education]] programs for women in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |title=calisthenics (exercise) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-08-04 |url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/calisthenics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized systems of calisthenics in America took a back seat to competitive sports after the [[Battle of the Systems]], when the states mandated physical education systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]'s calisthenics program published in the 1960s helped to launch modern [[fitness culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/22/health/he-62349|title=Going Back to the Basics With Calisthenics|last=KRUCOFF|first=CAROL|date=1998-06-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadas-fitness-movement-5-basic-exercises|title=Five basic exercises for fitness in 1961|last=|first=|date=|work=CBC Archives|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calisthenics is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called [[street workout]]. Street workout as a sport consists of athletes competing against one other by each showing their body-weight strength and control in timed routines to impress a panel of judges. The World Street Workout &amp; Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF) based in Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships in up to 50 different countries ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}) and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition. The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO) based in Los Angeles, CA. promotes a series of  competitions known globally as, Battle of the Bars(R). The WCO created the first ever set of rules for  true 1 vs 1 competitions, including weight classes, timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving the increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these worldwide competitions.

==Common exercises==
In addition to the various stretches, some of the more common calisthenic exercises include:
* [[Muscle-up]]s
:One of the basic calisthenics routines. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pullup bars or rings.
*[[Preflexes|Squat jumps (box jumps)]]
:Performed by entering a [[squatting position]], then using a [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] jumping movement to jump as high as possible. 
* [[Front lever]]
:A front lever is performed by performing a lat pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. May be done on rings or pull-up bar.
[[File:Marine Pull-ups.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a US Marine performing a pull-up.|A [[US Marine]] performs a [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]], a common calisthenic exercise.]]
* [[Push-up]]s
:Performed face down on the floor, palms against floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position, while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.
* [[Pull-up (exercise)|Pull-ups]]
:An overhead bar (sometimes called a [[chin-up bar]]) is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]] or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms. An underhand grip variation or [[chin-up]] trains both the back and biceps.
* [[Chin-up]]s
:Much like the [[pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]], except that the hand placement is reversed. The hands are facing the person as he pulls his body up using the [[chin-up bar]]. The chin-up focuses on the [[biceps]] muscles, rather than the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle]] which is the focus of the pull up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/main/popup/name/chin-up|title=Chin-Up Exercise Guide and Video|website=Bodybuilding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Squat (exercise)|Squats]]
:Standing with feet shoulder width apart, the subject squats down as far as possible, bringing the arms forward parallel to the floor. The subject then returns to standing position. Squats train the [[quadriceps]], [[hamstring]]s, calves, and [[gluteal muscles]].
* [[Back lever]]
:A back lever is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.
* [[Handstand]]
:A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.

[[File:Liegestuetz02 ani fcm.gif|thumb|Animation of a push-up]]
* [[Dip (exercise)|Dips]]
:Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoids]], especially the anterior portion.
* [[Hyperextension (exercise)|Hyperextensions]]
: Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.
* [[Leg raise]]s
:Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.
* [[Plank (exercise)|Planks]]
:This is the name for holding the 'top' position of a [[press-up|push-up]] for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis.
[[File:Plank with medicine ball.JPG|thumb|Plank on medicine balls]]
* [[Multi-stage fitness test|Shuttle runs]]
:This is running back and forth between two points (or cones) typically separated by 5-40 meters, as fast as possible, with a touchdown. The emphasis should be on stopping, turning back and accelerate back to a sprint as quickly as possible.
*[[Burpee (exercise)|Burpees]]
: A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and some parts of the back.

* [[L-sit]] 

:The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable "L" shape, hence the name "L-sit". The L sit requires you to keep your core tensed and hold your legs horizontal so your body sits in a perfect 'L' position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calisthenics-101.co.uk/blogs/a-complete-list-of-calisthenics-exercises|title=A complete list of Calisthenics exercises|last=|first=|date=|website=www.calisthenics-101.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calisthenics parks==
[[File:Calisthenics in Osdorp.jpg|thumb|Park in [[Osdorp]], Amsterdam, nl where one can practice calisthenics.]]
An increasing number of [[outdoor fitness]] training areas and [[Outdoor gym|outdoor gyms]] are being built around the world. Some are designed especially for calisthenics training and most are free to use by the public. Calisthenics parks have equipment like pull-up bars, monkey bars, parallel bars and box jumps at one location. Freely accessible online maps exist that show the location and sample photos of calisthenics parks around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calisthenics-parks.com|title=Calisthenics Parks - Spots Map|website=calisthenics-parks.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''Capital punishment in Austria''' was abolished in 1787, although restored in 1795. Unlike other countries with a minimum age of 18, the minimum age for execution in Austria was 20.

The method of [[execution]] in Austria was [[hanging]] until the [[anschluss|annexation]] by [[Nazi Germany]] (1938-1945) when it was replaced by the [[guillotine]]. After World War II, hanging was re-introduced by the British. The last person to be executed in Austria was Johann Trnka. He was hanged on March 24, 1950 for the crime of [[murder]]. Capital punishment for murder was abolished on June 30 that year; for all crimes in February 1968. Austria is a state party to the Second Optional Protocol to [[ICCPR]] (ratified 1993), Protocol No. 6 to [[ECHR]] (1984), and Protocol No. 13 to [[ECHR]] (2004).

'''Cetacean stranding''', commonly known as '''beaching''', is a phenomenon in which [[cetacean|whales and dolphins]] strand themselves on land, usually on a [[beach]]. Beached whales often die due to [[dehydration]], collapsing under their own weight, or drowning when high tide covers the [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Blood| first=Matt D. | title=Beached Whales: A Personal Encounter| year=2012|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations for why cetaceans strand themselves have been proposed, but none have so far been universally accepted as a definitive reason for the peculiar behavior.

==Species==
{{See also|List of sperm whale strandings}}
[[File:1986 beached whales in Flinders Bay (2).JPG|thumb|left|Beached [[false killer whale]]s at [[Flinders Bay, Western Australia]], 1986.]]
Every year, up to 2,000 animals beach themselves.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;
{{cite book| last=Martin| first=Anthony R. | title=Whales and Dolphins| year=1991| publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London| isbn=0-8160-3922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of strandings result in death, they pose no threat to any species as a whole. Only about ten [[cetacea]]n species frequently display mass beachings, with ten more rarely doing so.

All frequently involved species are [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), rather than [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti). These species share some characteristics which may explain why they beach.

Body size does not normally affect the frequency, but both the animals' normal habitat and social organization do appear to influence their chances of coming ashore in large numbers. Odontocetes that normally inhabit deep waters and live in large, tightly knit groups are the most susceptible. This includes the [[sperm whale]], oceanic dolphins, usually [[pilot whale|pilot]] and [[killer whale]]s, and a few [[beaked whale]] species.

Solitary species naturally do not strand en masse. Cetaceans that spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters almost never mass strand.

==Causes==
[[File:Three Beached Whales, 1577.jpg|thumb|right|''Three Beached Whales'', a 1577 engraving by the Flemish artist [[Jan Wierix]], depicts stranded Sperm Whales.  Note the incorrectly recorded "nostril" and correctly extruded penis.]]
Strandings can be grouped into several types. The most obvious distinctions are between single and multiple strandings. The carcasses of deceased cetaceans are likely to float to the surface at some point; during this time, [[Ocean current|current]]s or [[wind]]s may carry them to  a [[coastline]]. Since thousands of cetaceans die every year, many become stranded posthumously. Most carcasses never reach the coast and are [[Scavenger|scavenged]] or [[Decomposition|decomposed]] enough to sink to the ocean bottom, where the carcass forms the basis of a unique local ecosystem called [[whale fall]]. Single live strandings are often the result of illness or injury, which almost inevitably end in death in the absence of human intervention.
Multiple strandings in one place are rare and often attract media coverage as well as rescue efforts. Even multiple offshore deaths are unlikely to lead to multiple strandings due to variable winds and currents.

A key factor in many of these cases appears to be the strong social cohesion of toothed whales. If one gets into trouble, its distress calls may prompt the rest of the pod to follow and beach themselves alongside.&lt;ref name="abc-mystery"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theories, some of them controversial, have been proposed to explain beaching, but the question remains unresolved.

===Environmental===
[[File:The-whale-beached-1617.jpg|thumb|"The Whale Beached between [[Scheveningen]] and [[Katwijk]], with Elegant Sightseers," by [[Esaias van den Velde]], c.1617]]
[[Whale]]s have beached throughout human history,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} so many strandings can be attributed to natural and environmental factors, such as rough weather, weakness due to old age or infection, difficulty giving birth,&lt;ref name="abc-mystery" /&gt; hunting too close to shore, or navigation errors.

In 2004, scientists at the [[University of Tasmania]] linked whale strandings and weather, hypothesizing that when cool [[Antarctic]] waters rich in [[squid]] and [[fish]] flow north, whales follow their prey closer towards land.&lt;ref name="abc-climate"&gt;{{cite web|author1=R. Gales|author2=K. Evans|author3=M. Hindell|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1255082.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|format=TV transcript|title=Whale strandings no surprise to climatologists|work=7:30 report|date=2004-11-30|accessdate=2006-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215052022/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1255082.htm#|archive-date=2007-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases predators (such as killer whales) have been known to panic other whales, herding them towards the shoreline.&lt;ref name="abc-climate" /&gt;

Their [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] system can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines.&lt;ref name="fatal shore"&gt;
{{cite web|author=B. Montgomery|title=The fatal shore

|work=The Weekend Australian Magazine
|date=1998-05-02
|accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory accounts for mass beaching hot spots such as [[Ocean Beach, Tasmania]] and [[Geographe Bay, Western Australia]] where the slope is about half a degree (approximately {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr =on}} deep {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr =on}} out to sea). The [[University of Western Australia]] [[Bioacoustics]] group proposes that repeated reflections between the surface and ocean bottom in gently-sloping shallow water may [[attenuate]] sound so much that the echo is inaudible to the whales.&lt;ref name="uwa-acoustics"&gt;

|format=PDF|date=9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stirred up sand as well as long-lived microbubbles formed by rain may further exacerbate the effect.

A 2017 study by scientists from [[Germany]]'s [[University of Kiel]] suggests that large geomagnetic disruptions of the [[Earth's magnetic field]], brought on through [[solar flare|solar storms]], could be another cause for whale beachings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41110082|title=Northern lights linked to North Sea whale strandings|last=McGrath|first=Matt|date=2017-09-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors hypothesize that whales [[Navigation|navigate]] using the Earth's magnetic field by detecting differences in the field's strength to find their way. The solar storms cause [[Magnetic anomaly|anomalies]] in the field, which may disturb the whales' ability to navigate, sending them into shallow waters where they get trapped.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study is based on the mass beachings of 29 [[sperm whale]]s along the coasts of Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== "Follow-me" strandings ===
Some strandings may be caused by larger cetaceans following [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]] into shallow coastal waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The larger animals may habituate to following faster-moving dolphins. If they encounter an adverse combination of [[tidal flow]] and [[seabed topography]], the larger species may become trapped.

Sometimes following a dolphin can help a whale escape danger. In 2008, a local dolphin was followed out to open water by two [[Pygmy sperm whale]]s that had become lost behind a sandbar at [[Mahia Beach]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolphin rescues stranded whales |work=CNN |publisher=The Associated Press |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/nz.whales.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313191401/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/nz.whales.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible to train dolphins to lead trapped whales out to sea.

Pods of [[killer whale]]s, predators of dolphins and porpoises, very rarely strand. It may be that heading for shallow waters protects the smaller animals from predators and that killer whales have learned to stay away. Alternatively, killer whales have learned how to operate in shallow waters, particularly in their pursuit of seals. The latter  is certainly the case in [[Pen√≠nsula Vald√©s]], Argentina, and the [[Crozet Islands]] of the Indian Ocean, where killer whales pursue seals up shelving gravel beaches to the edge of the littoral zone. The pursuing whales are occasionally partially thrust out of the sea by a combination of their own impetus and retreating water and have to wait for the next wave to carry them back to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Robin W.: ''Killer Whales of the World'' Voyageur Press, Stillwater, MN, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional===
[[File:Orcas in Punta Norte Valdes Peninsula - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A [[killer whale]] hunting sea lions at [[Valdes Peninsula]], Argentina by standing itself]]
In Argentina, killer whales are known to hunt on the shore by intentionally beaching themselves and then lunging at nearby seals before riding the next wave safely back into deeper waters. This was first observed in the early 1970s, then hundreds times more since within this pod. This behavior seems to be taught from one generation to the next, evidenced by older individuals nudging juveniles towards the shore, and can sometimes also be a play activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=C.|last=Guinet|year=1991|title=Intentional stranding apprenticeship and social play in killer whales (''Orcinus orca'')|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=69|issue=1|pages=2712‚Äì2716|doi=10.1139/z91-383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Kaplan|year=2007|title=Unique orca hunting technique documented|journal=Nature News|url=https://www.nature.com/news/2007/071214/full/news.2007.380.html|doi=10.1038/news.2007.380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonar===
{{see also|Noise pollution|Marine mammals and sonar}}
[[File:Whales on beach, Farewell Split, South Island, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|right|Volunteers attempt to keep body temperatures of beached pilot whales from rising at [[Farewell Spit]], [[New Zealand]].]]
There is evidence that [[active sonar]] leads to beaching. On some occasions cetaceans have stranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area, suggesting a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last=US Dept of Commerce |author2=Secretary of the Navy |title=Joint Interim Report ‚Äì Bahamas Marine Mammal Stranding Event of 15‚Äì16 March 2000 |date=December 2001|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/acoustics/bahamas_stranding.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories describing how sonar may cause whale deaths have also been advanced after [[necropsies]] found internal injuries in stranded cetaceans. In contrast, some who strand themselves due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy prior to beaching:

{{quote|The low frequency active sonar (LFA sonar) used by the military to detect submarines is the loudest sound ever put into the seas. Yet the U.S. Navy is planning to deploy LFA sonar across 80 percent of the world ocean. At an amplitude of two hundred forty decibels, it is loud enough to kill whales and dolphins and has already caused mass strandings and deaths in areas where U.S. and/or NATO forces have conducted exercises.|Julia Whitty|The Fragile Edge&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/whitty/ ''The Fragile Edge: Diving and Other Adventures in the South Pacific'', Julia Whitty. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 50; see also [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002V1GZN2 page 50 at Amazon.com].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The large and rapid pressure changes made by loud sonar can cause [[hemorrhaging]]. Evidence emerged after 17 cetaceans hauled out in the [[Bahamas]] in March 2000 following a [[United States Navy]] sonar exercise. The Navy accepted blame agreeing that the dead whales experienced acoustically-induced hemorrhages around the ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/stranding_bahamas2000.pdf |title=Joint Interim Report Bahamas Marine Mammal Stranding Event of 15‚Äì16 March 2000 |date=December 2001 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting disorientation probably led to the stranding.

Another means by which sonar could be hurting cetaceans is a form of [[decompression sickness]]. This was first raised by necrological examinations of 14 [[beaked whale]]s stranded in the [[Canary Islands]]. The stranding happened on 24 September 2002, close to the operating area of [[Neo Tapon]] (an international naval exercise) about four hours after the activation of mid-frequency sonar.&lt;ref name="jepson-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. D. Jepson |title=Gas-bubble lesions in stranded cetaceans |journal=Nature |date=9 October 2003 |issue= 6958 |pages=575‚Äì6 |volume=425 |doi=10.1038/425575a |pmid=14534575|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team of scientists found acute tissue damage from gas-bubble lesions, which are indicative of decompression sickness.&lt;ref name="jepson-2003" /&gt; The precise mechanism of how sonar causes bubble formation is not known. It could be due to cetaceans panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt to escape the sonar pulses. There is also a theoretical basis by which sonar vibrations can cause supersaturated gas to [[nucleate]], forming bubbles (cavitation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. S. Houser |author2=R. Howards |author3=S. Ridgway |title=Can Diving-induced Tissue Nitrogen Supersaturation Increase the Chance of Acoustically Driven Bubble Growth in Marine Mammals? |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=21 November 2001 |issue=2 |volume=213 |pages=183‚Äì195 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2415 |pmid=11894990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of the cetaceans involved in sonar-associated beachings are [[Cuvier's beaked whale]]s (''Ziphius cavirostrus''). This species strands frequently, but mass strandings are rare. They are so difficult to study in the wild that prior to the interest raised by the sonar controversy, most of the information about them came from stranded animals. The first to publish research linking beachings with naval activity were Simmonds and Lopez-Jurado in 1991. They noted that over the past decade there had been a number of mass strandings of beaked whales in the Canary Islands, and each time the [[Spanish Navy]] was conducting exercises. Conversely, there were no mass strandings at other times. They did not propose a theory for the strandings. A letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Fern√°ndez ''et al.'' in 2013 reported that there had been no further mass strandings in that area following a 2004 ban by the Spanish government on military exercises in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fern√°ndez | first1 = A. | last2 = Arbelo | first2 = M. | last3 = Mart√≠n | first3 = V. | doi = 10.1038/497317d | title = Whales: No mass strandings since sonar ban | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7449 | pages = 317 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23676745| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1996, there was another mass stranding in West [[Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. At the time, it was noted as "atypical" both because mass strandings of beaked whales are rare, and also because the stranded whales were spread over such a long stretch of coast with each individual whale spatially separated from the next stranding. At the time of the incident, there was no connection made with active sonar; the marine biologist investigating the incident, Dr. Frantzis, made the connection to sonar because he discovered a notice to Mariners about the test. His scientific correspondence in "Nature" titled "Does acoustic testing strand whales?" was published in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pelagosinstitute.gr/en/pelagos/index3.html |title=Does acoustic testing strand whales? |last=Frantzis |first=A |journal=Nature |date=1988-03-05 |volume=392 |pages=29 |doi=10.1038/32068 |pmid=9510243 |issue=6671 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050734/http://www.pelagosinstitute.gr/en/pelagos/index3.html |archivedate=2009-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Peter Tyack, of [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], has been researching noise's effects on marine mammals since the 1970s. He has led much of the recent research on beaked whales (Cuvier's beaked whales in particular). Data tags have shown that Cuvier's dive considerably deeper than previously thought, and are in fact the deepest diving species of marine mammal. Their surfacing behavior is highly unusual because they exert considerable physical effort to surface in a controlled ascent, rather than simply floating to the surface like sperm whales. Deep dives are followed by three or four shallow dives. Vocalization stops at shallow depths, because of fear of predators or because they don't need vocalization to stay together at depths where there is sufficient light to see each other. The elaborate dive patterns are assumed to be necessary to control the diffusion of gases in the bloodstream. No data show a beaked whale making an uncontrolled ascent or failing to do successive shallow dives.

If a whale is beached near an inhabited locality, the rotting carcass can pose a nuisance as well as a health risk. Such very large [[Dead body|corpse]]s are difficult to move. The whales are often towed back out to sea away from shipping lanes, allowing them to decompose naturally, or they are towed out to sea and blown up with explosives. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in [[South Africa]], [[Iceland]], [[Australia]] and [[Exploding whale|Oregon, United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6lTSxJvR4w|title=Exploding Whale - Whale Of A Tale|first=|last=implosionworld|date=29 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbl"&gt;{{cite news | title=Hvalhr√¶ dregi√∞ √∫t √° haf og s√≠√∞an aftur upp √≠ fj√∂ru  |trans-title=Whale pulled out to sea and then back up the beach | work=[[Morgunbla√∞i√∞|mbl.is]] | language=Icelandic | url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/frett.html?nid=1142126 | date=June 5, 2005 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-02/explosive-end-for-sick-whale/2246266 | title=Explosive end for sick whale | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | date=September 2, 2010 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the carcass is older, it is buried.

In New Zealand, which is the site of many whale strandings, treaties with the indigenous [[MƒÅori people]] allow the tribal gathering and customary (that is, traditional) use of whalebone from any animal which has died as a result of stranding. Whales are regarded as ''[[taonga]]'' (spiritual treasure), descendants of the ocean god, [[Tangaroa]], and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as ''[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' sites, that is, they are regarded as sacred ground.&lt;ref&gt;Te Karaka, "[http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/our_stories/science-strandings/ The science of strandings]', Te R≈´nanga o [[NgƒÅi Tahu]], 21 December 2014.

== Health risks ==
A beached whale carcass should not be consumed. In 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate ''[[muktuk]]'' (whale blubber) from a beached whale, resulting in eight of them developing [[botulism]], with two of the affected requiring [[mechanical ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Large strandings==
In 1918, approximately 1000 [[pilot whale]]s were stranded on the [[Chatham Islands]], the largest whale stranding ever recorded.

In 1985 about 450 pilot whales were stranded in [[Auckland, New Zealand]].

On June 23, 2015, 337 dead whales were discovered in a remote [[fiord|fjord]] in [[Patagonia]], southern [[Chile]], the largest stranding of [[baleen whale]]s to date. 305 bodies and 32 skeletons were identified by aerial and satellite photography between the [[Gulf of Penas]] and [[Puerto Natales]], near the southern tip of [[South America]].  They may have been [[sei whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 337 Whales Beached in Largest Stranding Ever|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151120-worlds-largest-whale-stranding-sei-chile-animals/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-21|first = Brian Clark|last = Howard|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED November|last2 = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of only two or three such baleen mass stranding events in the last hundred years. It is highly unusual for baleens to strand other than singly, and the Patagonia baleen strandings are tentatively attributed to an unusual cause such as ingestion of poisonous algae.

On the morning of February 10, 2017, more than 416 pilot whales were discovered on a crescent of land on New Zealand‚Äôs South Island called [[Farewell Spit]] in Golden Bay at the top of the South Island, with more than 70% dead by dawn.  An additional 240 whales stranded themselves late on February 11. This brought the total number of stranded pilot whales to 656, making this the second-largest whale stranding event ever recorded. About 335 of the whales were declared dead out of which 20 had to be euthanized, 200 re-floated themselves at high tide and a few were brought back to sea through human effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/11/514677975/as-200-more-whales-are-stranded-in-new-zealand-heroics-turn-to-heartbreak|title=As 200 More Whales Are Stranded In New Zealand, Heroics Turn To Heartbreak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/more-than-330-pilot-whales-die-in-new-zealand-mass-stranding|title=Hope for end to New Zealand whale strandings after 350 die|first1=Melissa|last1=Davey|first2=|last2=agencies|date=11 February 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38942763|title=New Zealand whales: Hundreds refloat on high tide at Farewell Spit|date=12 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6086">'''Childbirth Connection''', formerly known as the '''Maternity Center Association''', is an American national nonprofit organization that works to improve the quality of maternity care through research, education, advocacy, and policy.  Childbirth Connection promotes safe, effective evidence-based maternity care and is a voice for the interests of childbearing women and families.

==Founding==
The Maternity Center Association (MCA) was founded in 1918 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=rocks3739&gt;{{cite book |title=Midwifery and Childbirth in America |last=Rocks |first=Judith |authorlink= |author2=Charles S. Mahan |year=1999 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |isbn=1-56639-711-1 |page= |pages=37‚Äì39 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, [[Frances Perkins]] became the group's executive secretary.&lt;ref name=cc90year&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/90-year-timeline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815210025/http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/90-year-timeline.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization grew out of an effort by the [[Women's City Club of New York City]], an organization of 2000 influential women, to reduce the extreme maternal and infant mortality rates in New York City and the United States at that time.&lt;ref name=davis-floyd&gt;{{cite book |title=Mainstreaming Midwives |last=Davis-Floyd |first=Robbie |authorlink= |author2=Christine Barbara Johnson |year=2006 |publisher=CRC Press |location= |isbn=0-415-93151-7 |page= |pages=90‚Äì91 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A New York City commission recommended the establishment of maternity centers, and the Women's City Club of New York responded by creating the Maternity Center Association, which ran a center for medical and nursing care.

==Growth and opposition==
By the 1920s, the organization was running thirty neighborhood centers throughout New York City.  It soon concluded that midwives were not sufficiently well prepared.  The group refocused its efforts on a single demonstration center, and worked to establish a training program or school for nurse-midwifery.&lt;ref name=rocks3739 /&gt;  

These efforts ran into opposition from some physicians, several of whom resigned from the group's board.  But in 1931, in an effort spearheaded by [[Mary Carson Breckinridge|Mary Breckinridge]], the group created the first school of nurse-midwifery in the United States.  The curriculum was based on the British nurse-midwifery curriculum.&lt;ref name=rocks3739 /&gt;  The school achieved significant improvements in midwifery care.  From 1932 to 1958, the school's years of operation, its graduates attended 7099 births, most of them in the mother's home; the maternal death rate was 0.9 per 1000 live births, more than 10 times better than the national average during this period of 10.4 per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name=rocks3739 /&gt;  The MCA promoted its care and education ideas through a handbook, conferences, and institutes.

==Birth centers==
In 1975, concerned about "do-it-yourself" home births, the Association created the first urban birth center, in a modified townhouse in downtown Manhattan, for women to give birth outside hospitals.  Nurse-midwives provided most of the care at the center.  The center was integrated into the existing health care system, although costs were far lower than at a hospital.&lt;ref name=rocks7475&gt;{{cite book |title=Midwifery and Childbirth in America |last=Rocks |first=Judith |authorlink= |author2=Charles S. Mahan |year=1999 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |isbn=1-56639-711-1 |page= |pages=74‚Äì75 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MCA helped develop a quality assurance system for out-of-hospital birth centers, and offered its center as a prototype.  The group's efforts led to an association now known as the American Association of Birth Centers.&lt;ref name=cc90year /&gt;

The group received funding through New York charity events; [[Brooke Astor]] was a board member.

==Change in purpose==
Starting in the 1990s, the group moved away from providing direct services and instead expanded its policy research agenda and its public education and outreach programs.&lt;ref name=cc90year /&gt;  The group transferred ownership of its main childbirth center to [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in New York City in 1996.  In 2005, the group changed its name to Childbirth Connection, and adopted the tagline "helping women and health professionals make informed maternity care decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childbirthconnection.org/article.asp?ck%3D10252 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010170840/http://www.childbirthconnection.org/article.asp?ck=10252 |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, its education website, www.childbirthconnection.org, won a World Wide Web Health Award in the "Patient Education Information" category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthawards.com/wwwha/ss2006winners.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The group continues to sponsor conferences and research programs to improve maternity care in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://transform.childbirthconnection.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has never taken any position on abortion, because it "deals exclusively with women who want to carry their pregnancies to term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/28/AR2009052803937_2.html?nav=hcmodule&amp;sid=ST2009052803991 | work=The Washington Post | title=White House Tries to Quell Abortion Rights Supporters' Fears About Sotomayor | first1=Robert | last1=Barnes | first2=Michael D. | last2=Shear | date=2009-05-29 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Godward Idleness 1900.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''[[Idleness]]'', by [[John William Godward]], ca 1900]]

'''Conspicuous leisure''' is a concept introduced by the American economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]], in ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]] (1899)''.  Conspicuous or visible leisure is engaged in for the sake of displaying and attaining [[social status]]. The concept comprises those forms of leisure that seem to be fully motivated by social factors, such as taking long vacations to exotic places and bringing souvenirs back.  Conspicuous leisure is observed in all societies where [[Social stratification|stratification]] exists.  Conspicuous leisure contributes to the glorification of non-productivity, thus validating the behavior of the most powerful classes and leading the lower classes to admire rather than revile the leisure class. This aids the leisure class in retaining their status and material position. Veblen's more well-known concept of "[[conspicuous consumption]]" is employed when non-productivity can be more effectively demonstrated through lavish spending.

Veblen argued that conspicuous leisure had deep historical roots reaching back into prehistory, and that it "evolved" into different forms as time passed. One example he gave was how, during the [[Middle Ages]], the [[nobility]] was exempted from manual labor, which was reserved for [[serfs]]. Like owning land, abstaining from labor is a typical display of wealth and one that becomes more problematic as society develops into an industrial one. With the emergence of individual ownership, the leisure class completely stops contributing to the well being of their community. They no longer perform honor-positions, thus totally negating their usefulness to the society. And as society moves away from hunting and agriculture, and towards industrialization, the leisure class can no longer simply take resources from others. This is where Veblen offers us an image of the decaying Lord or Lady who has lost his or her fortune but is unable to engage in labor in order to live. These [[wealthy]] [[elite]] see [[Manual labour|labor]] as menial and vulgar, yet once they can no longer live their worthy life of leisure they suffer from an inability to preserve themselves.

Veblen defines leisure as the non-productive consumption of time. The wealthy consume time unproductively due to a disgust of menial labor but also as evidence of their pecuniary ability to live idle lives. But there are moments when even the noble is not viewed publicly and then he must give a satisfactory account of his use of time. Often his account will manifest through the appearance of servants or some sort of craftsmen. A material proof of leisure is another way that the noble demonstrates his wealth even when he is out of the public's eye. Objects or trophies or knowledge that has no real-world application are all examples of the things that the wealthy use to demonstrate their wealth and their leisure. Displaying rules of etiquette and breeding, and formal and ceremonial observances are other demonstrations of unproductive (and therefore leisurely) uses of time.

It is also not enough for the leisure class to live a life of [[idleness]]; their servants must also engage in the performance of leisure despite their position as hired help. They are given uniforms, spacious quarters and other material items that signal the wealth of their employer: the more lavish the servants' dress and quarters, the more money the master has to spend freely. This is an example of "[[conspicuous consumption]]," a form of conspicuous leisure. House servants give the illusion of "pecuniary decency" to the household, despite the physical discomfort that the leisure class feels at the sight of servants, who produce labor.

'''Death with Dignity National Center''' ('''DDNC''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonpartisan]] [[nonprofit organization]], headquartered in [[Portland, Oregon]], that has led the legal defense of and education about [[medical aid in dying|Death with Dignity]] laws throughout the [[United States]] for 20 years. The Death with Dignity National Center helped write and defend the nation's first successful Death with Dignity law, in Oregon, protecting the right of persons with terminal illness to control their own deaths. The Death with Dignity National Center is affiliated with the Death with Dignity Political Fund, a distinct and separately incorporated [[501(c)(4)]] organization responsible for the political defense of Death with Dignity laws and the promotion of these initiatives in other states around the U.S.

== Mission ==
"The mission of the Death with Dignity National Center is to promote Death with Dignity laws based on our model legislation, the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, both to provide an option for dying individuals and to stimulate nationwide improvements in end-of-life care.&lt;ref name= About&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathwithdignity.org/about/ |title=About Death with Dignity National Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1993 Oregon Right to Die, a political action committee, was founded to draft and pass [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Oregon's Death with Dignity ballot measure 16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalexit.org/ORlawframe.html |title=The Physician-Assisted Suicide Oregon Trail|publisher=[[Final Exit]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Oregon Right to Die PAC (ORDPAC) campaigned successfully for the passage of Measure 16 in Oregon; 51% of Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity ballot initiative which created the Oregon Death With Dignity Law (DWD) allowing those who are terminally ill to hasten death in consultation with their physician and under strict safeguards, making Oregon the first U.S. state and one of the first jurisdictions in the world to officially do so. Subsequently, the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center (ODLDEC), the forerunner to the Death with Dignity National Center, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded to defend the voter-approved law. In 1997, Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee successfully defeated Measure 51, an attempt to ban Death with Dignity in Oregon, by a margin of 60% to 40%.

After the successful collaboration of the Death with Dignity Alliance starting in 1997 three of the organizations in the alliance‚ÄîOregon Death with Dignity, Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center, and Death with Dignity National Center‚Äîmerged and became Death with Dignity National Center and Oregon Death with Dignity Political Action Fund in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalexit.org/more-chronology.html |title=Death with Dignity movement history|publisher=Euthanasia Research &amp; Guidance Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathwithdignity.org/whatwedo/otherorganizations.asp |title=Death with Dignity National Center chronology |publisher=Death with Dignity National Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094844/http://www.deathwithdignity.org/whatwedo/otherorganizations.asp |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alliance member, Compassion in Dying, later merged with End-of-Life Choices (formerly the [[Hemlock Society]]) and became [[Compassion and Choices]].

In 2000 DDNC led the effort on Question 1, the Death with Dignity campaign in Maine. The measure lost by a narrow margin, 51% to 49%, with only a 6,000 vote difference statewide. In 2001 DDNC partnered with activists in Vermont to establish Death with Dignity Vermont, and in 2002 DDNC launched an effort in Hawaii to pass Death with Dignity legislation through the legislative process. In 2003 ODLDEC is renamed the Death with Dignity National Center (DDNC).

From 2001‚Äì2006 DDNC defended Oregon‚Äôs Death with Dignity Law against U.S. Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] and his successor [[Alberto Gonzales]] who attempted to block DWD by authorizing federal drug agents to prosecute doctors who help terminally ill patients die. In January 2006, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3  in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]'', that former Attorney General John Ashcroft overstepped his authority in attempting to prosecute Oregon‚Äôs physicians and pharmacists.

In 2008 DDNC successfully led the coalition for Yes on I-1000, Washington State‚Äôs Death with Dignity campaign, to a 58%-42% win. Washington‚Äôs Death with Dignity law went into effect in March 2009.

In 2011, DDNC partnered with Patient Choices Vermont to help pass Death with Dignity legislation through their legislature. Vermont Governor Shumlin signed the Vermont Death with Dignity bill into law in 2013. In the meantime, DDNC established Dignity 2012 to pass Death with Dignity legislation in Massachusetts. The issue made it on the November ballot and was narrowly (51% to 49%) defeated.

== Organization ==

Death with Dignity is a 501(c)(3) organization governed by a Board of Directors. Current members include:

* [[George Eighmey]], JD, President, was an Oregon state legislator in 1997 when opponents to the Death with Dignity Act were working to dismantle the citizen's initiative passed in 1994 and was instrumental in blocking the opponents in the legislature. After the law was implemented, George took up a leadership role as the executive director of Compassion in Dying of Oregon which later became Compassion &amp; Choices of Oregon. After 12 years helping terminally ill patients navigate Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, George retired in 2010.
* Carol Pratt, PhD, JD, Treasurer, is a practicing attorney in the Portland office of an international law firm, K&amp;L Gates LLP. Carol‚Äôs legal practice focuses on FDA law, health law and bioethics. Before becoming a lawyer, Carol was a neuroscientist and conducted research focusing on spinal cord function for about 20 years at the National Institutes of Health, Purdue University and the Dow Neurological Sciences Institute. Carol was living in Portland, OR in 1994 when Oregon passed by ballot initiative the nation‚Äôs first, pioneering Death With Dignity law. The Death with Dignity campaign and subsequent legal challenges to Oregon‚Äôs law inspired her to become a lawyer, which she did in 1998. Carol is the author of the article, Efforts to Legalize Physician Assisted Suicide in New York, Washington, and Oregon: A Contrast Between Judicial and Initiative Approaches ‚Äî Who Should Decide? 77 (4), Oregon Law Review, 1027-1124 (1998). She joined the board of the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center in 2000 and has continued since then as a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center.

He co-authored the Oregon Death with Dignity Act in 1993 and served as the lead political and legal strategist during the 1994 campaign to pass the law and again during the 1997 campaign to defeat its repeal by the State Legislature. Stutsman successfully defended the Death with Dignity law in the first federal court challenge spanning 1994 to 1997. See Lee v. State of Oregon,107 F.3d 1382 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 927 (1997). He later prevailed against the United States Attorney General and the Drug Enforcement Administration in a second round of federal court litigation spanning 2001-2006, in which he won an injunction against the United States Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/23/politics/23scotus.html |last=Greenhouse | first=Linda|title=Justices Accept Oregon Case Weighing Assisted Suicide|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathwithdignity.org/media/documents/Gonzales%20v%20Oregon%20(Eli%20Stutsman).pdf |title=Supreme Court of the United States Brief for the Respondents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914030548/http://www.deathwithdignity.org/media/documents/Gonzales%20v%20Oregon%20%28Eli%20Stutsman%29.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of a physician and a pharmacist, both threatened with criminal sanctions. On January 17, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of the physician, pharmacist, and the State of Oregon. See Oregon v. Ashcroft, 192 F.Supp.2d 1077 (D.Or. 2002), 368 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2004), Gonzales v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 904 (2006). Stutsman co-founded Oregon Right to Die in 1993, the political action committee that passed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act into law. He was the founding president of the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center in 1995 (which later merged with the Death with Dignity National Center), as well as the Oregon Death with Dignity Political Action Fund, founded in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12473">'''Dissolvable tobacco''' is a [[tobacco]] product. Unlike ordinary [[chewing tobacco]], it dissolves in the mouth. Major tobacco manufacturers that sell dissolvable tobacco products include [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] ([[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]-branded "Orbs," "Strips," and "Sticks," 2009) and [[Star Scientific]] ("Ariva," 2001 and "Stonewall," 2003). The move of the major players into the smokeless tobacco market is attributed to [[smoking ban|smoke-free laws]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-12-23-dissolve_N.htm "Tobacco 'orbs' melt in mouth"], ''[[USA Today]]'', December 26, 2008 (retrieved November 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
Research into health effects of this and other new tobacco products was among the reasons of the establishment of the [[Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee]] of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm "Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Camel Dissolvables ==
Camel Dissolvables is a new line of products manufactured by R.J. Reynolds. The Camel Dissolvables line includes Camel Orbs, Camel Strips, and Camel Sticks which are currently in test markets in Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis, and Portland, Oregon. The Camel Dissolvables brands are marketed as "a convenient alternative to cigarettes, and [[moist snuff]] for adult tobacco consumers."&lt;ref name="goodhealth"&gt;[http://goodhealth.freeservers.com/RJR_Camel_dissolvables_10_2008.jpg R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Products at a Glance: Camel Sticks, Strips, and Orbs]&lt;/ref&gt; Camel Dissolvables "will not be positioned as a smoking cessation or reduced risk product," and are evolutions from the loose and pouched smokeless tobacco options.&lt;ref name="brandweek"&gt;Beirne, Mike. [http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/esearch/e3i3a362ca17e5cae63154356af5abae6d R.J. Reynolds Preps Dissolvable Tobacco]. Brandweek. 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With marketing still being developed, R.J. Reynolds has announced that "print ads, [[direct marketing]], sampling at bars and nightclubs and point of purchase" advertising will support the campaign.&lt;ref name="brandweek" /&gt;

Each pellet contains 1 milligram of [[nicotine]], dissolving in the mouth in 10‚Äì15 minutes.&lt;ref name="goodhealth" /&gt; The Camel Sticks product is a twisted stick the size of a toothpick that lasts in the mouth about 20‚Äì30 minutes, and contains 3.1 milligrams of nicotine. The Camel Sticks are for insertion between the upper lip and gum, and come in one style, Mellow. The Camel Strips contain 0.6 milligrams of nicotine per strip and come in one style, Fresh.&lt;ref name="goodhealth" /&gt; The Camel Strips last 2‚Äì3 minutes on the tongue, administering nicotine through [[thin film drug delivery]] technology as used in Listerine PocketPacks breath freshening strips. A specific ingredient list naming all additives has not been made public for any of the Camel Dissolvables brands.

== Ariva and Stonewall dissolvables ==
Currently, Star Scientific manufactures two brands of dissolvable tobacco, Ariva and Stonewall. Both brands contain Virginia StarCured flue-cured powdered Virginia tobacco compressed into smoke-free, spit-free, flavored dissolvable tobacco pieces packaged in blister packages and cardboard carton.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;Star Scientific. [http://www.dissolvabletobacco.com/main-w.html Frequently Asked Questions]. 2007. Accessed 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ariva and Stonewall brands are marketed as a means of "reducing toxins in tobacco so that adult consumers can have access to products that expose them to sharply reduced toxin levels" while still providing consumers with tobacco and nicotine. The product is not marketed as a smoking cessation product, but an "alternative tobacco product" that is "not combusted."&lt;ref name="ariva"&gt;Star Scientific. [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/DOCKETS/dailys/02/May02/050202/80045036.pdf Questions and Answers about Ariva Toxin Levels]&lt;/ref&gt; Star Scientific recommends the Ariva brand for smokers whereas, the Stonewall brand is recommended for heavy smokers, defined as smokers who consume more than one pack a day, and users of other smokeless tobacco products such as snuff.&lt;ref name="star" /&gt; The Ariva brand has been shown to have significantly reduced levels of tobacco-specific lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-butanone ([[NNK]]) although "exposures to other [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] (i.e., [[N-Nitrosonornicotine|NNN]]), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene), and metals" have not been assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgart, et al. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a787696595&amp;fulltext=713240928 "Pilot study on lower nitrosamine smokeless tobacco products compared with medicinal nicotine."] Nicotine and Tobacco Research. 12 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Star Scientific notes, "there is currently no proof that lowering nitrosamines will decrease health risk."&lt;ref name="ariva" /&gt;

=== Product constituents ===
The Ariva brand, introduced in 2001, contains 1.5 milligrams of nicotine in each piece and dissolves in the mouth in 10‚Äì30 minutes.&lt;ref name="star" /&gt; The Stonewall brand, introduced in 2003, have more surface area than the Ariva pieces and contain four milligrams of nicotine per piece, with each piece dissolving in 10‚Äì30 minutes.&lt;ref name="star" /&gt; The Ariva brand is offered in Wintergreen flavor and the Stonewall brand is offered in Natural, Wintergreen, and Java flavors. Other than the Virginia StarCured Tobacco and "other natural and artificial flavorings" including the non-sugar sweetener [[sucralose]], Star Scientific has not made a specific ingredient list public because it claims to "seek to protect proprietary product information" because Stonewall and Ariva are "the only dissolvable smokeless tobacco products in the marketplace."&lt;ref&gt;Starconsumerctr. [http://www.dissolvabletobacco.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=40&amp;PN=1 "Other Ingredients?" General Discussion.] 17 Jul 2009. Accessed 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demise of the Ariva and Stonewall brands ===

On December 18, 2012, Star Scientific announced its intention to discontinue the production of its dissolvable tobacco products, citing lagging sales and marketing difficulties due to regulations contained in the Tobacco Control Act.&lt;ref&gt;CSP Daily News [http://www.cspnet.com/news/tobacco/articles/star-scientific-exiting-tobacco-business "Star Scientific Exiting Tobacco Business"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health reactions ==
=== Underage consumption ===
From the introduction of Ariva in 2001 there have been several public health claims that the dissolvable tobacco products pose a serious risk for unintentional poisonings in children and adolescents. Petitions from the American Cancer Society, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Attorneys General from 39 states, and multiple public health organizations were sent to the FDA asking for regulation of the Ariva brand and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;Citizen Petitions for Regulation of Ariva. [http://www.iowaattorneygeneral.org/latest_news/releases/july_2002/Ariva_regulation.pdf Comments In Support of the Citizen Petitions for Regulation of Ariva.] In the Food and Drug Administration. 17 July 2002: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, these dissolvable products, including Ariva and Camel Orbs, remain unregulated by the FDA. 

A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control on unintentional child poisonings from ingestion of tobacco products also assessed the toxicity of the new Camel Orbs, which "are of concern due to their discreet form, candy-like appearance, and added flavorings that may be attractive to young children."&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;Connolly, Gregory N. et al. [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-2835v1 "Unintentional Child Poisonings Through Ingestion of Conventional and Novel Tobacco Products"]. Pediatrics. 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The study examined two flavors of Camel Orbs to find that 42% of the nicotine was in the un-ionized form, "compared with averages of 28‚Äì30% for moist snuff and &lt;10% for cigarettes."&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt; The danger of un-ionized nicotine is its more rapid absorption in the mouth, which could increase the nicotine‚Äôs toxicity.&lt;ref name="nicotine"&gt;Salomon ME. "Nicotine and tobacco preparations." In: Goldfrank LR, Nelson LS, Howland MA, Lewin NA, Flumenbaum NE, Hoffman RS, eds. Goldfrank‚Äôs Toxicologic Emergencies. 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2006: 1221‚Äì1230&lt;/ref&gt; The lead researcher, Gregory Connolly, notes that "a small pellet with a rapid release of nicotine and a young child with a low body weight can be a very serious problem,"&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Denise. [http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/19/candy.tobacco.poison/ "Tobacco in candy-like form can poison kids."] CNN Health. 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by creating potential for [[nicotine poisoning]], for example, which manifests as abdominal cramps, drooling, tremors, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and in more extreme cases, seizures, coma, and death.&lt;ref name="nicotine" /&gt;

The study also assessed the burden of child poisonings from tobacco products across the country, finding that 13,705 tobacco product ingestion cases were reported in the two-year period, with &gt;70% occurring in infants less than one year of age.&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt;

=== Harm reduction ===
Public Health researchers are now showing that the consumption of low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco (LN-SLT) as an alternative to cigarettes may have mortality and morbidity risks for oral cancer and heart disease, but "The risks of using LN-SLT products...should not be portrayed as comparable with those of smoking cigarettes as has been the practice of some governmental and public health authorities in the past."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, David.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Dwarfism''', also known as '''short stature''', occurs when an organism is extremely small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dwarfism|title=Definition of DWARFISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, it is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than {{convert|4|ft|10|in|cm|disp=flip}}, regardless of sex, although some individuals with dwarfism are slightly taller.&lt;ref name=NLM2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dwarfism.html |title=MedlinePlus: Dwarfism |date=2008-08-04|publisher=National Institute of Health|work=MedlinePlus |accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpaonline.org/faq-#Definition|title=FAQ|website=www.lpaonline.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by either short limbs or a short torso. In cases of proportionate dwarfism, both the limbs and torso are unusually small. Normal intelligence and lifespan are usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/restricted-growth/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Restricted growth (dwarfism) - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Those with [[bone growth]] disorders can sometimes be treated with surgery, or physical therapy. Hormone disorders can also be treated with hormone replacement therapy before the child's [[growth plate]]s fuse. Individual accommodations, such as specialized furniture, are often used by people with dwarfism.&lt;ref name="pmid14671400"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagen√§s L, Hertel T |title=Skeletal dysplasia, growth hormone treatment and body proportion: comparison with other syndromic and non-syndromic short children |journal=Horm.

&lt;!-- History, society, and culture --&gt;
In addition to the medical aspect of the condition, there are also social aspects. For a person with dwarfism, [[height discrimination]] can lead to ridicule in childhood and discrimination in adulthood.&lt;ref name="UPenn"&gt;[http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~persico/research/Papers/short.pdf University of Pennsylvania, Arts and Sciences: "The Effect of Adolescent Experience on Labor Market Outcomes: The Case of Height"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710052009/http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~persico/research/Papers/short.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceBlog"&gt;[http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2000/A/200000988.html Science Blog: "Short children more likely to be bullied at school"].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and other [[English-speaking countries]], some people with dwarfism prefer to be called dwarfs, little people, or persons of short stature.&lt;ref name="LPA"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Dwarfism Resources: Frequently Asked Questions  | publisher = Little People of America  | date = 2006-07-09  | url = http://www.lpaonline.org/resources_faq.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060516011550/http://www.lpaonline.org/resources_faq.html | archivedate=2006-05-16| accessdate = 2006-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LittlePeople UK|url=http://www.littlepeopleuk.org/|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the term "[[midget]]" was used to describe proportionate dwarfs; however, this term is now regarded as offensive by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/midget|title=Definition of MIDGET|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Dackelpferd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Dwarfism occurs in animals as well as humans; horses can have [[achondroplastic]] symptoms, as shown here next to a person with dwarfism]]
A defining characteristic of dwarfism is an adult height less than the 2.3rd percentile of the CDC standard growth charts. There is a wide range of physical characteristics. Variations in individuals are identified by diagnosing and monitoring the underlying disorders. There may not be any complications outside adapting to their size.

Short stature is a common replacement of the term 'dwarfism', especially in a medical context. Short stature is clinically defined as a height within the lowest 2.3% of those in the general population. However, those with mild skeletal [[dysplasia]]s may not be affected by dwarfism. In some cases of untreated [[hypochondroplasia]], males grow up to 5 feet 5 inches. Though that is short in a relative context, it does not fall into the extreme ranges of the growth charts.

Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by shortened limbs or a shortened torso. In [[achondroplasia]] one has an average-sized trunk with short limbs and a larger forehead.&lt;ref name="dwarfism-pbshome"/&gt; Facial features are often affected and individual body parts may have problems associated with them. [[Spinal stenosis]], ear infection, and [[hydrocephalus]] are common. In case of spinal [[dysostosis]], one has a small trunk, with average-sized limbs.

Proportionate dwarfism is marked by a short torso with short limbs,&lt;ref name="mayo-symptoms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dwarfism/DS01012/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Dwarfism: Symptoms |accessdate=2009-01-29 |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus leading to a height that is significantly below average. There may be long periods without any significant growth. Sexual development is often delayed or impaired into adulthood. This dwarfism type is caused by an [[endocrine disorder]] and not a skeletal dysplasia.

Physical effects of malformed bones vary according to the specific disease. Many involve joint pain caused by abnormal bone alignment, or from [[nerve]] compression.&lt;ref name="LPA"/&gt; Early degenerative joint disease, exaggerated [[lordosis]] or [[scoliosis]], and constriction of [[spinal cord]] or nerve roots can cause pain and disability.&lt;ref name="seattle-dysplasia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orthopedics.seattlechildrens.org/conditions_treated/dwarfism_and_bone_dysplasias.asp |title=Dwarfism and Bone Dysplasias |accessdate=2008-11-18 |publisher=Seattle Children's Hospital, Research &amp; Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504091309/http://orthopedics.seattlechildrens.org/conditions_treated/dwarfism_and_bone_dysplasias.asp |archivedate=2007-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced [[thorax|thoracic]] size can restrict lung growth and reduce pulmonary function. Some forms of dwarfism are associated with disordered function of other organs, such as the [[brain]] or [[liver]], sometimes severely enough to be more of an impairment than the unusual bone growth.&lt;ref name="mayo-complications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dwarfism/DS01012/DSECTION=complications |title=Dwarfism: Complications |accessdate=2008-11-18 |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5946547"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escamilla RF, Hutchings JJ, Li CH, Forsham P |title=Achondroplastic dwarfism. Effects of treatment with human growth hormone |journal=Calif Med |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=104‚Äì10 |date=August 1966 |pmid=5946547 |pmc=1516352 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental effects also vary according to the specific underlying syndrome. In most cases of skeletal dysplasia, such as achondroplasia, mental function is not impaired.&lt;ref name="mayo-symptoms"/&gt; However, there are syndromes which can affect the cranial structure and growth of the brain, severely impairing mental capacity. Unless the brain is directly affected by the underlying disorder, there is little to no chance of mental impairment that can be attributed to dwarfism.&lt;ref name="urlThe Pituitary Gland &amp; Growth Disorders: An Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hormone.org/Growth/overview.cfm |title=The Pituitary Gland &amp; Growth Disorders: An Overview |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psycho-social limitations of society may be more disabling than the physical symptoms, especially in childhood and adolescence, but people with dwarfism vary greatly in the degree to which social participation and emotional health are affected.
* Social prejudice against extreme shortness may reduce social and marital opportunities.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|0-8018-8121-8}}"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hall, Judith A. |author2=Adelson, Betty M. |title=Dwarfism: medical and psychosocial aspects of profound short stature |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-8121-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12884421"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gollust SE, Thompson RE, Gooding HC, Biesecker BB |title=Living with achondroplasia in an average-sized world: an assessment of quality of life |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=120A |issue=4 |pages=447‚Äì58 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12884421 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20127}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|heightism}}
* Numerous studies have demonstrated reduced employment opportunities. Severe shortness is associated with lower income.&lt;ref name="pmid12884421" /&gt;
* [[Self-esteem]] may suffer and family relationships may be affected.
* Extreme shortness (in the low 2‚Äì3-foot [60‚Äì90&amp;nbsp;cm] range) can, if not accommodated for, interfere with [[activities of daily living]], like driving or using countertops built for taller people. Other common attributes of dwarfism such as bowed knees and unusually short fingers can lead to back problems, and difficulty in walking and handling objects.
* Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates. Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers.&lt;ref name="mayo-complications"/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Seneb and wife statue.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Seneb]], court official and priest for the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian rulers [[Khufu]] and [[Djedefre]], with his wife Senetites and their children.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Egypt: Kingdom of the Pharaohs'', R. Hamilton, p. 47, Paragon, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4054-8288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dwarfism can result from many medical conditions, each with its own separate symptoms and causes. Extreme shortness in humans with proportional body parts usually has a hormonal cause, such as [[Growth hormone deficiency|growth-hormone deficiency]], once called ''pituitary dwarfism''.&lt;ref name="LPA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarfism-pbshome"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_dwarfism_ety.html |title=P.O.V. ‚Äì Big Enough. What is Dwarfism? |accessdate=2008-11-18 |last=Kennedy |first=Dan |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two disorders, achondroplasia and growth hormone deficiency, are responsible for the majority of human dwarfism cases.&lt;ref name="urlDwarfism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/growth/dwarfism.html|title=Dwarfism|publisher=[[KidsHealth]]|accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achondroplasia===
{{further|Achondroplasia}}
The most recognizable and most common form of dwarfism in humans is [[achondroplasia]], which accounts for 70% of dwarfism cases, and occurs in 4 to 15 out of 100,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meja.aub.edu.lb/downloads/20_6/907.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It produces rhizomelic short limbs, increased spinal curvature, and distortion of skull growth. In achondroplasia the body's limbs are proportionately shorter than the trunk (abdominal area), with a larger head than average and characteristic facial features. Achondroplasia is an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder caused by the presence of a faulty [[allele]] in the genome. If a pair of achondroplasia alleles are present, the result is fatal. Achondroplasia is a mutation in the [[fibroblast growth factor receptor 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gene|FGFR3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of achondroplasia, this mutation causes FGFR3 to become constitutively active, inhibiting bone growth.&lt;ref name="urlAchondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=achondroplasia |title=Achondroplasia ‚Äì Genetics Home Reference |date=2008-09-26|format= |work=Genetics Home Reference|publisher=National Institute of Health |accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital indicates that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age: specifically males reproducing after 35.&lt;ref name="Fisch2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Fisch|title=The Male Biological Clock: The Startling News About Aging, Sexuality, and Fertility in Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxqFgFunQ18C&amp;pg=PT11|date=24 September 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-4082-9|pages=11‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth hormone deficiency===
{{further|Growth hormone deficiency}}
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition in which the body produces insufficient [[growth hormone]]. Growth hormone, also called [[somatotropin]], is a [[polypeptide]] [[hormone]] which stimulates [[Human development (biology)|growth]] and cell reproduction. If this hormone is lacking, stunted or even halted growth may become apparent. Children with this disorder may grow slowly and puberty may be delayed by several years or indefinitely. Growth hormone deficiency has no single definite cause. It can be caused by mutations of specific genes, damage to the pituitary gland, [[Turner's syndrome]], poor nutrition,&lt;ref name="ghdeficiency"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = UK Child Growth Foundation | title=Growth Hormone Deficiency |url=http://www.childgrowthfoundation.org/ghd.htm | accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even stress (leading to [[psychogenic dwarfism]]). [[Laron syndrome]] (growth hormone insensitivity) is another cause. Those with growth hormone issues tend to be proportionate.

===Other===
Other causes of dwarfism are [[spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita]], [[diastrophic dysplasia]], [[pseudoachondroplasia]], [[hypochondroplasia]], [[Noonan syndrome]], [[primordial dwarfism]], [[Turner syndrome]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI), and [[hypothyroidism]]. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs in several of the [[Mucopolysaccharidosis|Mucopolysaccharidoses]] and other [[lysosomal storage disease|storage disorders]].&lt;ref name="urlCauses of Dwarfism - WrongDiagnosis.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dwarfism/causes.htm |title=Causes of Dwarfism |website=WrongDiagnosis.com |work= |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may cause proportionate, yet temporary, dwarfism.

Serious chronic illnesses may produce dwarfism as a side effect. Harsh environmental conditions, such as malnutrition, may also produce dwarfism. These types of dwarfism are indirect consequences of the generally unhealthy or malnourished condition of the individual, and not of any specific disease. The dwarfism often takes the form of simple short stature, without any deformities, thus leading to proportionate dwarfism. In societies where poor nutrition is widespread, the average height of the population may be reduced below its genetic potential by the lack of proper nutrition. Sometimes there is no definitive cause of short stature.

==Diagnosis==
Dwarfism is often diagnosed in childhood on the basis of visible symptoms. A physical examination can usually suffice to diagnose certain types of dwarfism, but [[genetic testing]] and diagnostic imaging may be used to determine the exact condition.&lt;ref name="urlDWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dwarfism/book-diseases-1a.htm |title=DWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com |work= |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a person's youth, growth charts that track height can be used to diagnose subtle forms of dwarfism that have no other striking physical characteristics.&lt;ref name="urlDwarfism"/&gt;

Short stature or stunted growth during youth is usually what brings the condition to medical attention. Skeletal [[dysplasia]] is usually suspected because of obvious physical features (e.g., unusual configuration of face or shape of skull), because of an obviously affected parent, or because body measurements (arm span, upper to lower segment ratio) indicate disproportion.&lt;ref name="urlDWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com"/&gt; Bone X-rays are often key to diagnosing a specific skeletal dysplasia, but are not the sole diagnostic tool. Most children with suspected skeletal dysplasias are referred to a genetics clinic for diagnostic confirmation and [[genetic counseling]]. Since about the year 2000, genetic tests for some of the specific disorders have become available.&lt;ref name="mayo-diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dwarfism/DS01012/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Dwarfism: Tests and diagnosis |accessdate=2008-11-18 |date=2007-08-27 |work=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an initial medical evaluation of shortness, the absence of disproportion and other clues listed above usually indicates causes other than bone dysplasias.

===Classification===
[[File:Lavinia Warren - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|[[Lavinia Warren]], an actress with pituitary dwarfism ([[growth hormone deficiency]]).]]
In men and women, the sole requirement for being considered a dwarf is having an adult height under {{convert|147|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and it is almost always classified with respect to the underlying condition that is the cause of the short stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic variant; [[achondroplasia]] is caused by a mutation on [[chromosome 4]]. If dwarfism is caused by a medical disorder, the person is referred to by the underlying diagnosed disorder. Disorders causing dwarfism are often classified by proportionality. Disproportionate dwarfism describes disorders that cause unusual proportions of the body parts, while proportionate dwarfism results in a generally uniform stunting of the body.

Disorders that cause dwarfism may be classified according to one of hundreds of names, which are usually permutations of the following roots:
* location
** [[Rhizomelia|rhizomelic]] = root, i.e., bones of the upper arm or thigh
** mesomelic = middle, i.e., bones of the forearm or lower leg
** acromelic = end, i.e., bones of hands and feet.
** micromelic = entire limbs are shortened
* source
** chondro = of cartilage
** osteo = of bone
** spondylo = of the vertebrae
** plasia = form
** trophy = growth

Examples include [[achondroplasia]] and [[chondrodystrophy]].

==Prevention==
Many types of dwarfism are currently impossible to prevent because they are genetically caused. Genetic conditions that cause dwarfism may be identified with [[genetic testing]], by screening for the specific variations that result in the condition. However, due to the number of causes of dwarfism, it may be impossible to determine definitively if a child will be born with dwarfism.

Dwarfism resulting from malnutrition or a hormonal abnormality may be treated with an appropriate diet or hormonal therapy. Growth hormone deficiency may be remedied via injections of [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone (HGH)]] during early life.

==Management==
Genetic mutations of most forms of dwarfism caused by bone dysplasia cannot be altered yet, so therapeutic interventions are typically aimed at preventing or reducing pain or physical disability, increasing adult height, or mitigating psychosocial stresses and enhancing social adaptation.&lt;ref name="mayo-treatment"/&gt;

Forms of dwarfism associated with the endocrine system may be treated using [[hormonal therapy]]. If the cause is prepubescent hyposecretion of growth hormone, supplemental growth hormone may correct the abnormality. If the receptor for growth hormone is itself affected, the condition may prove harder to treat. [[Hypothyroidism]] is another possible cause of dwarfism that can be treated through hormonal therapy. Injections of thyroid hormone can mitigate the effects of the condition, but lack of proportion may be permanent.

Pain and disability may be ameliorated by physical therapy, braces or other orthotic devices, or by surgical procedures.&lt;ref name="mayo-treatment"/&gt; The only simple interventions that increase perceived adult height are dress enhancements, such as shoe lifts or hairstyle. Growth hormone is rarely used for shortness caused by bone dysplasias, since the height benefit is typically small (less than {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on||disp=sqbr}}) and the cost high.&lt;ref name="pmid14671400"/&gt; The most effective means of increasing adult height by several inches is [[distraction osteogenesis]], though availability is limited and the cost is high in terms of money, discomfort, and disruption of life. Most people with dwarfism do not choose this option, and it remains controversial.&lt;ref name="LPA"/&gt; For other types of dwarfism, surgical treatment is not possible.

==Society and culture==

===Terminology===
[[File:Two V√∂lusp√° Dwarves by Fr√∏lich.jpg|thumb|Two [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] as depicted in a 19th-century edition of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poem ''[[V√∂lusp√°]]'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr√∏lich]]]]
The appropriate term for describing a person of particularly short stature (or with the genetic condition achondroplasia) has historically been ambiguous, and has developed euphemistically over the past few centuries.

The noun ''dwarf'' stems from [[Old English]] ''dweorg'', originally referring to a being from [[Germanic mythology]]‚Äîa [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]]‚Äîthat dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. The [[etymology]] of the word ''dwarf'' is contested, and scholars have proposed varying theories about the origins of the being, including that dwarfs may have originated as nature spirits or as beings associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. Competing etymologies include a basis in the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European]] root ''*dheur-'' (meaning 'damage'), the Indo-European root ''*dhreugh'' (whence modern German ''Traum'' 'dream' and ''Trug'' 'deception'), and comparisons have been made with the [[Old Indian]] ''[[Dharavi|dhvaras]]'' (a type of demonic being). The being may not have gained associations with small stature until a later period.&lt;ref name="SIMEK67-68"&gt;[[Rudolf Simek|Simek, Rudolf]] (2007) translated by Angela Hall. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zni8GwAACAAJ Dictionary of Northern Mythology]'', pp. 67‚Äì68. [[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D.S. Brewer]] {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "dwarf", "little person", "LP", and "person of short stature" are now generally considered acceptable by most people affected by these disorders.&lt;ref name="dwarfism-pbshome"/&gt; However, the plural "dwarfs" as opposed to "dwarves" is generally preferred in the medical context, possibly because the plural "dwarves" was popularized by author [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], describing a race of characters in his ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' books resembling [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolkien|first=John Ronald Reuel|title=The Return of the King|year=1955|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|pages=Appendix F|url=http://valarguild.org/varda/Tolkien/encyc/articles/d/dwarves/dwarfpluralof.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Midget]]", whose etymology indicates a "tiny biting insect",&lt;ref name="midget-def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midget |title=midget |accessdate=2008-11-18 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; came into prominence in the mid-19th century after [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] used it in her novels ''Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands'' and ''[[Old Town Folks]]'' where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively.&lt;ref name="dwarfism-pbshome"/&gt;  Later some people of short stature considered the word to be offensive because it was the descriptive term applied to [[P. T. Barnum]]'s dwarfs used for public amusement during the [[freak show]] era.&lt;ref name="LPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adelson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelson|first=Betty M.|title=The Lives Of Dwarfs: Their Journey From Public Curiosity Toward Social Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym5x3mq2p7EC&amp;pg=PA295|accessdate=8 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813535487|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not considered accurate as it is not a medical term or diagnosis, though it is sometimes used as a slang term to describe those who are particularly short, whether or not they have dwarfism.&lt;ref name="midget-med"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22596 |title=Midget definition |accessdate=2008-11-18 |date=9 March 2003 |work=MedicineNet |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dwarf sports===
Dwarfs are supported to compete in sport by a number of organisations nationally and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of dwarfism organisations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dwarf Athletic Association of America]] and the [[Dwarf Sports Association UK]] provide opportunities for dwarfs to compete nationally and internationally in the Americas and Europe respectively.

The Dwarf Sports Association UK organises between 5 and 20 events per month for athletes with restricted growth conditions in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.dsauk.org/events/?daterange=2&amp;region_ID=0| title = DSAuk Events| website = www.dsauk.org| access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, swimming and bicycling are often recommended for people with skeletal dysplasias, since those activities put minimal pressure on the spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/skeletal-dysplasias|title=Skeletal Dysplasias|first=The Children's Hospital of|last=Philadelphia|date=25 March 2014|website=www.chop.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and media depictions===
{{See also|List of Dwarfism media depictions|List of people with dwarfism|Dwarfs and pygmies in Ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Ivory statuette of a woman with dwarfism-IMG 4539-white.jpg|thumb|upright|Ivory statuette of a female with dwarfism, [[Gerzeh culture]] (Naqada II), [[Prehistoric Egypt]].]]
[[File:Vel√°zquez ‚Äì Buf√≥n don Sebasti√°n de Morra (Museo del Prado, c. 1645).jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Portrait of Sebasti√°n de Morra|The Dwarf Don Sebasti√°n de Morra]]'', by [[Diego Vel√°zquez|Vel√°zquez]].]]
In art, literature, and movies, dwarfs are rarely depicted as ordinary people who are very short but rather as a species apart. [[Novelist]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[filmmaking|moviemakers]] may attach special moral or aesthetic significance to their "apartness" or misshapenness.

Artistic representations of dwarfism can be found on [[ancient Greece|Greek]] vases and other ancient artifacts, including [[ancient Egypt]]ian art in which dwarfs are likely to have been seen as a divine manifestation, with records indicating they could reach high positions in society.&lt;ref name="nunn"&gt;''Ancient Egyptian Medicine'', John F. Nunn, University of Oklahoma Press, 2002, pp. 78‚Äì79, {{ISBN|0-8061-3504-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051227102614.htm  ''Dwarfs Commanded Respect In Ancient Egypt'', ScienceDaily, 27 Dec 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavat Purana]] [[Hindu]] text devotes nine chapters to the adventures of [[Vamana]], a dwarf avatar of Lord Vishnu.

Depictions of dwarfism are also found in European paintings and many illustrations. Many European paintings (especially [[Spain|Spanish]]) of the 16th‚Äì19th centuries depict dwarfs by themselves or with others. In the [[Talmud]], it is said that the second born son of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Bible]] was a dwarf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/pol/pol09.htm The Talmud ‚Äì Chapter VI. Death Of Jacob And His Sons ‚Äì Moses ‚Äì The Deliverance From Egypt.] URL accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship has suggested that ancient Egyptians held dwarfs in high esteem.&lt;ref name="dwarfism-egypt"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dwarfs in ancient Egypt|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|date=2005-12-27|first=Chahira|last=Kozma|volume=140A|issue=4|pages=303‚Äì11|doi= 10.1002/ajmg.a.31068|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112222883/abstract|format=|accessdate=2008-11-12|pmid=16380966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several important mythological figures of the North American [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] nation are portrayed as dwarfs.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce G., ''The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660'' McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987 {{ISBN|0-7735-0627-6}}, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

As popular media have become more widespread, the number of works depicting dwarfs have increased dramatically. Dwarfism is depicted in many books, films, and TV series such as ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (and later parodied in'' [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]''), ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts'', Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21). The quote has been misattributed to [[Alexander Pope]], who wrote to Swift in praise of the book just a day earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Bad Santa]]'', ''[[A Son of the Circus]]'', ''[[Little People Big World]]'', ''[[The Little Couple]]'', ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' (and its TV adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''), ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[The Orator]]'', ''[[In Bruges]]'', ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' by [[G√ºnter Grass]], the short-lived reality show ''[[The Littlest Groom]]'', and the film ''[[The Station Agent]]''.

The [[Animal Planet]] TV series ''[[Pit Boss (TV series)|Pit Boss]]'' features dwarf actor [[Shorty Rossi]] and his talent agency, "Shortywood Productions", which Rossi uses to provide funding for his pit bull rescue operation, "Shorty's Rescue". Rossi's three full-time employees, featured in the series, are all little people and aspiring actors.

In September 2014, Creative Business House, along with Donnons Leur Une Chance, created the [[International Dwarf Fashion Show]] to raise awareness and boost self-confidence of people living with dwarfism.&lt;ref name=GLAM&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stark|first1=Stephanie|title=The Dwarf Fashion Show Debuts in New York City|url=http://www.glammonitor.com/2015/dwarf-fashion-show-debut-2580/|accessdate=22 July 2015|publisher=Glammonitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Everyday life''', '''daily life''' or '''routine life''' comprises the ways in which people typically act, think, and feel on a daily basis.  Everyday life may be described as mundane, routine, natural, habitual, or [[Normality (behavior)|normal]].

Human [[diurnality]] means most people sleep at least part of the night and are active in daytime. Most eat two or three meals in a day.  [[Working time]] (apart from [[shift work]]) mostly involves a daily schedule, beginning in the [[morning]].  This produces the daily [[rush hour]]s experienced by many millions, and the [[drive time]] focused on by radio broadcasters.  [[Evening]] is often [[leisure]] time. [[Bathing]] every day is a custom for many.

Beyond these broad similarities, lifestyles vary and different people spend their days differently. [[Nomad]]ic life differs from [[sedentism]], and among the sedentary, [[Urban area|urban]] people live differently from [[Rural area|rural]] folk. Differences in the lives of the [[wealth|rich]] and the [[poverty|poor]], or between [[factory worker]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[intellectual]]s, may go beyond their [[working hours]]. Many women spend their day in activities greatly different from those of men, and everywhere [[children]] do different things than adults.

==Sociological perspectives==
[[File:The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.jpg|thumb|''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'']]

Everyday life is a key concept in [[cultural studies]] and is a specialized subject in the field of [[sociology]].  Some argue that, motivated by [[capitalism]] and [[industrialism]]'s degrading effects on human existence and perception, writers and artists of the 19th century turned more towards [[self-reflection]] and the portrayal of everyday life represented in their writings and art to a noticeably greater degree than in past works, for example [[Renaissance literature]]'s interest in [[hagiography]] and politics.&lt;ref name="felski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Felski|first1=Rita|title=The Invention of Everyday Life|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London|isbn=9780853159018|pages=15‚Äì31|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rf6d/felski.the-invention-of-everyday-life.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--page 16--&gt;  Other theorists dispute this argument based on a long history of writings about daily life which can be seen in works from [[Ancient Greece]], [[Medieval art|medieval Christianity]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="lefebvre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefebvre|first1=Henri|title=Everyday life in the modern world|date=1984|publisher=Transaction Books|location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A.|isbn=978-0878559725|accessdate=15 November 2014|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coser|first1=[edited by] Lewis A.|title=The idea of social structure : papers in honor of Robert K. Merton|date=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-1412847414|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of everyday life gender has been an important factor in its conceptions.  Some theorists regard [[women]] as the quintessential representatives and victims of everyday life.&lt;ref name="lefebvre"/&gt;&lt;!--page73--&gt;  

The connotation of everyday life is often negative and is distinctively separated from exceptional moments by its lack of [[distinction (sociology)|distinction]] and differentiation, ultimately defined as the essential, taken-for-granted continuum of [[mundane]] activity that outlines forays into more [[esoteric]] experiences.  It is the non-negotiable [[reality]] that exists amongst all social groupings without discrimination and is an unavoidable basis for which all human endeavor exists.&lt;ref name="felski" /&gt;

Much of everyday life is automatic in that it is driven by current environmental features as mediated by automatic [[cognitive processing]] of those features, and without any mediation by conscious choice, according to social psychologist [[John Bargh|John A. Bargh]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyer/Bargh 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Daily life is also studied by sociologists to investigate how it is organised and given meaning. A sociological journal called the ''[[Journal of Mundane Behavior]]'', published 2000 - 2004, studied these everyday actions.

== Leisure ==
{{Main|Leisure}}

Daily [[entertainment]] once consisted mainly of telling stories in the evening. This [[Convention (norm)|custom]] developed into the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] and other professional entertainments. [[Reading (process)|Reading]] later became less a mysterious specialty of [[scholar]]s, and more a common pleasure for people who could afford books. During the 20th century [[mass media]] became prevalent in rich countries, creating among other things a daily [[prime time]] to consume [[fiction]] and other professionally produced works.

Different media forms serve different purposes in different individuals' everyday lives‚Äîwhich give people the opportunities to make [[choice]]s about what media form(s)--watching [[television]], using the [[Internet]], listening to the [[radio]], or reading newspapers or magazines‚Äîmost effectively help them to accomplish their tasks.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;Baym, N. (2010), ‚ÄòMaking New Media Make Sense‚Äô in Personal Connections in the Digital Age, Polity Press, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people have steadily increased their daily use of the Internet, over all other media forms.   Fearing changes promoted by mass entertainment, [[social conservative]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have long censored books and films, called television a [[vast wasteland]], and predicted that [[social media]] and other Internet sites would distract people from good [[personal relationship]]s or valuable interactions.  These concerns did not prevent the progressively wider popularity of these innovations.

==Language==
People's everyday lives are shaped through [[language]] and [[communication]]. They choose what to do with their time based on opinions and ideals formed through the [[discourse]] they are exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Silverstone (1994), Television and Everyday Life, p. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the dialogue people are subject to comes from the [[mass media]], which is an important factor in what shapes [[human experience]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie Gillepsie and Eugene McLaughlin (2008), Media and the Shaping of Public Attitudes, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The media uses language to make an impact on one‚Äôs everyday life, whether that be as small as helping to decide where to eat or as big as choosing a [[Representative democracy|representative]] in government.

To improve people's everyday life, Phaedra Pezzullo, professor in the Department of Communication and Culture at [[Indiana University Bloomington]], says people should seek to understand the [[rhetoric]] that so often and unnoticeably changes their lives. She writes that ‚Äú...rhetoric enables us to make connections... It's about understanding how we engage with the world.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rosdeitcher (2006), "[http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v29n1/rhetoric.shtml The Rhetoric of Everyday Life]", ''Humanities, Then and Now'' 29, no. 1 (Fall).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities of Daily Living==

[[Activities of daily living]] (ADL) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily [[self care]] activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. [[Health professional]]s routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regard to people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and the [[Old age|elderly]].&lt;ref name=EN&gt;"Activities of Daily Living Evaluation." ''Encyclopedia of Nursing &amp; Allied Health''. ed. Kristine Krapp. Gale Group, Inc., 2002. eNotes.com. 2006.[http://www.enotes.com/nursing-encyclopedia/activities-daily-living-evaluation Enotes Nursing Encyclopedia] Accessed on: 11 Oct, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ADLs are defined as "the things we normally do...such as [[Meal|feeding ourselves]], bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure."&lt;ref name =MN&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2152 MedicineNet.com Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability and the extent to which the elderly can perform these activities is at the focus of [[gerontology]] and understandings of later life.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Stephen. [http://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2013/SOC570/um/Katz_Busy_Bodies_2000.pdf ''Busy bodies: Activities, aging, and the management of everyday life'']. - Journal of aging studies, Elsevier, 2000. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 'active society' which sees mobility as an important norm, constant physical activity has replaced the striving towards personal growth in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Stephen. [http://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2013/SOC570/um/Katz_Busy_Bodies_2000.pdf ''Busy bodies: Activities, aging, and the management of everyday life'']. - Journal of aging studies, Elsevier, 2000. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Prosper Manget''' (21 January 1880 ‚Äì 21 January 1979)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74494462|title=Fred Prosper Manget|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a doctor, public servant, and medical missionary. He served for forty years in China from 1909 until the end of [[World War II]]. In 1909 Manget left the U.S. for [[China]] to pursue missionary work. He received recognition from state and local organizations for his service to the poor, and elderly, and for his Christian humanitarian efforts abroad. Manget is most notable for founding the Huzhou General Hospital in China. Huzhou General Hospital is specifically noted for its role in spreading western medical practices to northern China. He ran several clinics and dispensaries in his mission work as well as at home in the state of Georgia.

== Early life ==
Manget was born on 21 January 1880 to Elizabeth DePass and Victor Eugene Manget of Marietta, Georgia. His parents inspired Manget and his sister Jennie to devote their lives to the missionary work.  At the age of 12, Manget decided to become a medical missionary.

== Education ==
Fred Manget received his medical degree from the [[Emory University School of Medicine|Atlanta College of Physicians and Surgeons]] (now Emory University School of Medicine) in 1906. He then took on an internship position at [[Grady Hospital]] in Atlanta. He later concluded his postgraduate work at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pitts.emory.edu/archives/text/mss362.html|title=Fred Prosper Manget Papers, 1860-1980|last=|first=|date=June 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Pitts Theology Library|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missionary career ==

=== Early years in China ===
In 1909 Manget left for China to pursue missionary work. During his first year, he was stationed in [[Suzhou]], a major city in the southeastern [[Jiangsu]] province of East China. He later went to Huzhou, located within the very small province of [[Zhejiang]], China, where he opened a dispensary in a rented property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Story of Dr. Fred Prosper Manget: For the Woman's Auxiliary of the Bibb County Medical Society, Georgia April 4, 1963 Meeting by Nona B. (Mrs. Robert S.) McMichael (Author)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dispensary became the first hospital established in Huzhou, China. He served as superintendent at this dispensary until 1941. After receiving aid from the Chinese, Manget was able to open up 200-bed hospital in May 1924. Manget served as superintendent of the hospital until 1941. During 1918, he served with the [[American Red Cross]] as Head Medical Officer in Siberia. There he evacuated sick and wounded Czech soldier prisoners. As a result of his service, in Russia, he was adorned by [[Alexander Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak's government]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Fred Manget in Kunming, China.tif|thumb|Fred Prosper Manget in Kunming, China]]

=== World War II ===
Manget was asked to serve in the [https://www.usphs.gov/ United States Public Health Commission] as Senior Surgeon on Field Duty, during World War II. During his time as commissioner, he served in [[Burma]] and West China as a missionary aide to people with malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Missionary Volume 62|last=|first=|publisher=American Missionary Association|year=2012|isbn=978-1130072013|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he was asked to treat patients with malaria at the request of [[Chiang Kaishek]], the Former President of the Republic of China. After Burma fell to the Japanese, he was later transferred to an area in southwest China called Kunming. In Kunming, Manget worked alongside General Claire Lee Chennault and the [[American Volunteer Group|First American Volunteer Group]] of the Chinese Air Force also known as the [[Flying Tigers]]. While working with the ‚ÄúFlying Tigers‚Äù, Manget met [[Robert Lee Scott Jr.]],a brigadier general in the U.S. air force during the war. It was with Colonel Robert Lee Scott Jr., that Manget coined the term "God is my co-pilot". This term later became the title of Scott's autobiography, which discussed his journeys as a pilot during World War II with the Flying Tigers and U.S. Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is My Co-Pilot|last=Robert L.|first=Scott|publisher=Andesite Press|year=1943|isbn=978-1297490996|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HuzHou General Hospital ===
At the end of World War I, Dr. Manget returned to [[Shanghai]] and discussed with the representative of [[The Rockefeller Foundation]] in China about the Foundation‚Äôs intention to spread the practice of Western medicine in China. After much negotiation, the Chinese Government agreed to provide 9 acres of land, while the Foundation provided US$30,000 to build a hospital in Huzhou. The remaining needed funds for the project were provided by the [[Southern Methodist Church]] and the [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptist Church]] in the USA.
Huzhou General Hospital was a small hospital in a small rented building. It was first established with  Dr. Manget as the only physician; later encompassing 9 acres of land, and with a staff of over 100 nurses and 100 other personnel. At its time it was noted for being the most modern medical facilities in China. The facilities of the hospital included a chemistry laboratory, an X-ray facility and a nursing school. Japanese troops later occupied the hospital from Manget. During this time the family of Dr. Manget left China. However, Dr. Manget was not willing to leave China because of the harsh treatment of the Japanese to the Chinese people. As a result of pointing out these injustices, he was arrested by the Japanese troops, who wrongly accused him of espionage. Manget was later released by the Japanese and was able to work under the strict control of the Japanese troops at Huzhou General Hospital for an addition three and a half years.

=== Manget Foundation ===
After returning to home to Georgia in the 1950s, Manget accepted the presidency of the Manget Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Oscar M.|year=1960|title=Security Transactions Annual Survey of Georgia Law: June 1959 - April 1960|url=|journal=Annual Survey of Georgia Law|volume=|pages=182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manget Foundation in Newnan, Georgia was founded in 1949 by Fred Prosper Manget's brother, Dan Manget.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1909|title=The Atlanta Constitution from Atlanta, Georgia,  Published October 3, 1909|url=|journal=The Atlanta Constitution|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Manget Foundation, Fred Prosper Manget operated a clinic and provided free medical care to those unable to afford it. In 1952, Manget received an honorary degree from LaGrange College for his Christian humanitarian work.

===Christian Youth Church===
During the time from 1953 to 1961, Manget ran a clinic out of the Christian Youth Church on Capitol Avenue in Atlanta where he provided medical care every Saturday to patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Manget's first wife was Louise Anderson. Fred and Louise had four daughters during their time in China, Elizabeth DePasse Manget in 1910, Jean Logan Manget in 1912, Louise and Mildred Bomar Manget in 1920. Anderson later died in 1957. He later remarried Jennie Loyall Anderson of Macon, Georgia in 1959. His second wife died in 1976.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dr.Manget was later admitted to Wesley Woods Health Center in Atlanta in 1978. Manget died on 21 January 1979.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">The '''Gradus Gravis affair''' (in English: ''Serious Degree'') was a scheme of people operating in [[Tallinn]] providing prescriptions of controlled [[psychotropic drug]]s to people, mostly of Finnish origin, for a fee.

== Scheme ==

Gradus Gravis O√ú, once a fully licensed [[psychiatric clinic]], opened an office near the [[Tallinn Passenger Port]] &amp;mdash; thus, being easily accessible to people of [[Helsinki]] &amp;mdash;, offering prescriptions of certain controlled psychotropic drugs (most notably [[Subutex]]) to everybody who would pay a fee.

According to the [[Estonian Office of Healthcare]], [[Milvi Koplus]] issued about 7000 prescriptions for [[Subutex]] within four months of 2003.

In connection with the affair, [[Estonian Medical Association]] cancelled membership of [[Rostislav Vassiljev]] and [[Milvi Koplus]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[√ïhtuleht]] 19 April 2007: [https://archive.is/20130213041503/http://www.ohtuleht.ee/index.aspx?id=225801 Arstide liit l√µi kahele tohtrile sule sappa] by [[Eve Heinla]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first case of the association cancelling membership for ethical issues.

Due to the scheme becoming public, as well as reporting irregularities, the [[Estonian Office of Healthcare]] revoked the clinic's license in 2008.  However, according to enquiries to four [[apothecaries]] operating near the premises, the clinic issued at least 259 prescriptions for strong psychotropic medicine in the month after the revocation, 221 of them to citizens of [[Finland]].

'''''Hermaphrodites with Attitude''''' was a newsletter edited by [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] and published by the [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) between 1994 and 2005.&lt;ref name="isnahwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude|url=http://www.isna.org/library/hwa|publisher=[[Intersex Society of North America]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full archives are available online. In 2008, ISNA transferred its remaining funds, assets, and copyrights to [[Accord Alliance]] and then closed.

==History==
''Hermaphrodites with Attitude'' was published on thirteen occasions over an eleven-year period. The first issue appeared in Winter 1994, comprising 6 pages of articles, analysis and case studies, including articles by people with lived experience, activists, physicianss, and academics. It was distributed to subscribers in five countries and 14 States of the United States.&lt;ref name="hwa1"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Hermaphrodites with Attitude |title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1994 |url = http://www.isna.org/files/hwa/winter1995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newsletter provided a voice for intersex activists for the first time, becoming a resource for intersex people and academics.&lt;ref name=QS2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valocchi |first1=Stephen |title=Queer studies : an interdisciplinary reader |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0631229167 |last2=Corber |first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drege1999r&gt;{{cite book |last=Dreger |first=Alice Domurat |title=Intersex in the age of ethics |year=1999 |publisher=Univ.

In the early part of the 21st-century, [[Intersex Society of North America|Intersex Society of North America (ISNA)]] took on staff for the first time and began to engage closely with the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, establishing a North American Task Force on Intersex.&lt;ref name="isnafeb2001" /&gt; These developments were stated in the newsletter's first issue of the 21st-century, in February 2001, which also marked a change in name to "ISNA News".&lt;ref name="isnafeb2001"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = ISNA News | title = ISNA News | date = February 2001 | url = http://www.isna.org/files/hwa/feb2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shifting attitudes==
This shift in name of the newsletter reflected a significant shift in the goals of ISNA. Initially, Emi Koyama states that "not only did intersex activists appropriate the medical label "intersex" as part of their identities, they also liberally used the word "hermaphrodite", which is now considered offensive, for example by naming the newsletter of Intersex Society of North America "Hermaphrodites With Attitude" and demonstrating under that name." Koyama argues that the intersex movement could not succeed with that label in addressing peer support needs, while identity politics drew in a different set of goals and interests.&lt;ref name="koyama2006"&gt;{{Cite paper| last = Koyama| first = Emi| title = From "Intersex" to "DSD": Toward a Queer Disability Politics of Gender| location = University of Vermont| date = February 2006| url = http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/intersextodsd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISNA goals shifted to eradicate nomenclature based on [[hermaphroditism]] that was stated to be stigmatizing&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children.

The suggested solution put forth by ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words 'hermaphrodite', 'hermaphroditism', 'sex reversal', or other similar terms.&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/node/979 |title=Getting Rid of "Hermaphroditism" Once and For All |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "standard division of many intersex types into true hermaphroditism, male pseudohermaphroditism, and female pseudohermaphroditism" was described by ISNA and its advocates as confusing and clinically problematic,&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"/&gt; and a replacement term, [[disorders of sex development]] was proposed by [[Alice Dreger]], [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] and others in 2005.&lt;ref name="Dreger2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dreger | first1 = AD | last2 = Chase | first2 = C | last3 = Sousa | first3 = A | last4 = Gruppuso | first4 = PA | last5 = Frader | first5 =J |title=Changing the nomenclature/taxonomy for intersex: a scientific and clinical rationale |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=729‚Äì33 |date=August 2005  |pmid=16200837 |doi=10.1515/jpem.2005.18.8.729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISNA itself folded in 2008, following publication of a clinical paper and new clinical standards that adopted the term [[disorders of sex development]] to replace not only hermaphroditism and associated terms, but also the term intersex, in medical settings. ISNA gave a statement saying that "at present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim[s]" to fulfill its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/farewell_message |title=Dear ISNA Friends and Supporters |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISNA decided its best course of action was to "support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated, comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons [who are intersex] and their families." The ISNA transferred all of its remaining funds, assets, and copyrights to [[Accord Alliance]] and then closed.

ISNA has been survived or succeeded by several [[intersex civil society organizations]], including the [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome|AIS]] Support Group USA (now called AISDSD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aisdsd.org/who-we-are/history/brief-history/ |title=A Brief History |work=AISDSD |accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Intersex Initiative,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; Bodies Like Ours,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8223-4318-9 |last=Karkazis |first=Katrina |title=[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] |date=2008 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International]],&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; (now the [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]]) and Advocates for Informed Choice (now [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]).

'''Howard Clayton Eberline''' (15 October 1917 ‚Äì 26 May 1981) pioneer in the field of instrumentation for detecting [[ionizing radiation]], [[inventor]] and [[entrepreneur]]. Eberline started his career at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and began a long career of designing and developing radiation detection instrumentation that lead to the formation of a company that would bear his name and become a key player in the industry.

==Life and Times==

Eberline was born on 15 October 1917 in [[Soap Creek Township, Davis County, Iowa|Soap Creek]], [[Davis County, Iowa|Davis County]], [[Iowa]]. His parents were Alva Rollo and Perl Alvira Hawkins Eberline from Iowa. In 1920 the family moved to [[Grand River, Iowa|Grand River]], [[Wayne County, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Census, 1920.

==Los Alamos and Eberline Instruments==

In 1953, Eberline left the steady employment he had at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] and started his company Eberline Instruments, established to develop, produce and market [[Radiation detector|radiation detection]] devices and instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (12 January 2003). Santa Fe, N.M., Firm Sees More Demand for Its Radiation-Detection Equipment. The Santa Fe New Mexican Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. Santa Fe, New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eberline formed the Eberline Instrument Division in 1953 as a subsidiary of Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECO). He had been with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory as a group leader in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) Division where he developed the [[alpha radiation]] "poppy" detector.&lt;ref&gt;Eberline, Howard C.

(1): 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eberline Instrument Company was established in 1958. In 1979, Eberline Instrument Company was bought by Thermo Electron Corporation that became [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radmeasurementtech.com/History_instrument.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eberline Instrument Company was the first company to have their laboratory certified under the [[Health Physics Society]] Laboratory Accreditation Program.&lt;ref&gt;Boerner, Alex J. &amp; Kathren, Ronald L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22531">'''Infant Nutrition''' is the description of the dietary needs of infants. A diet lacking essential calories, minerals, vitamins, or fluids is considered inadequate. Breast milk provides the best nutrition for these vital first months of growth when compared to formula. For example, breastfeeding aids in preventing anemia, obesity, and sudden infant death syndrome; and it promotes digestive health, immunity, and intelligence. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively feeding an infant breast milk, or iron fortified formula, for the first twelve months of life. Infants are usually not introduced to solid foods until four to six months of age.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maternity &amp; women's health care|others=Lowdermilk, Deitra Leonard,, Perry, Shannon E.,, Cashion, Kitty,, Alden, Kathryn Rhodes,, Olshansky, Ellen Frances, 1949-|isbn=9780323169189|edition=11th|location=St. Louis, MO|oclc=896806709|last1 = Lowdermilk|first1 = Deitra Leonard|last2=Perry|first2=Shannon E.|last3=Cashion|first3=Mary Catherine|last4=Alden|first4=Kathryn Rhodes|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, breastfeeding infants was the only option for nutrition otherwise the infant would parish. Breastfeeding is rarely contraindicated, but is not recommended for mothers being treated for cancer, those with active tuberculosis, HIV, substance abuse, or leukemia&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Clinicians can be consulted to determine what is best for each baby.  

== Infant nutrition requirements ==
[[File:Formula and breastmilk.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Formula (left bottle) and pumped breastmilk (right bottle)]]
Proper infant nutrition demands providing essential substances that support normal growth, functioning, development, and resistance to infections and diseases. Optimal nutrition can be achieved by deciding to breastfeed or bottle-feed the infant before birth and preparing for either decision&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

=== Birth to six months ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Pan American Health Organization]] currently recommend feeding infants only breast milk for the first six months of life&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milankov|first=Olgica|date=2018|title=Breastfeeding through the centuries|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0025-81051806151M|journal=Medicinski Pregled|volume=71|issue=5‚Äì6|pages=151‚Äì156|doi=10.2298/mpns1806151m}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If the infant is being fed formula, it must be iron-enriched. An infant that receives exclusively breast milk for the first six months rarely needs additional vitamins or minerals. However, vitamins D and B12 may be needed if the breastfeeding mother does not have a proper intake of these vitamins. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests all infants, breastfed or not, take a vitamin D supplement within the first days of life to prevent a deficiency or [[rickets]]. Exclusively breastfed infants will also require an iron supplement after four months, because the iron is depleted at this point from the breast milk&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

It is important to know that some foods are restricted for infants. For example, whether breast- or bottle-fed, infants do not need additional fluids during the first four months of life&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Excessive intake of extra fluids or supplements can have harmful effects. Fluids besides human breast milk or iron-enriched formula are not recommended. These substitutes, such as milk, juice, and water do not require what the infant needs to grow and develop, cannot be digested correctly, and have a high risk of being contaminated. Water is acceptable only for mixing formula. Honey also must be avoided because there is a high risk of [[botulism]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Breast milk is the safest thing to give, unless the mother is advised against it by a health care professional.  

The frequency of breastfeeding varies amongst each mother-infant pair. Contributing factors are the age, weight, maturity, stomach capacity, and gastric emptying of the infant; as well as the storage capacity the mother has of breast milk. Typically, feedings occur eight to twelve times per day for breastfed infants. Early on, infants may not signal when they are hungry, so parents are taught to feed the infant every three hours during the day and every four hours during the night, even if waking the infant is required. The feedings will last 30-40 minutes in the beginning, or 15-20 minutes per breast if breastfeeding. As the infant matures, the feeding times shorten&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Feeding often is important to promote normal growth, development, and milk production in mothers who are breastfeeding.  

Solid foods should not be introduced until four to six months of age. This is delayed because the infant is not able to digest solid foods properly. Infants are born with a reflex to suck milk in, they do not have the ability to push food away. So, if solids are given, it is considered forced feeding&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Giving solid foods prematurely can lead to weight gain and obesity, this is why breast milk or formula is preferred.  

=== Six to twelve months ===
[[File:First rice.jpg|thumb|272x272px|Baby girl getting her first spoonful of rice]]
Solid foods should be introduced from six months onward. Salt, sugar, processed meat, juices, and canned foods should be avoided. Breast milk or formula continues to be the primary source of  nutrition during these months, in addition to solid foods&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Solid food can be introduced during this age because the gastrointestinal tract has matured. Solids can be digested more easily, and allergic responses are less likely. The infant has begun teething by now, which will aid in chewing of solid food. Another milestone that the infant has hit by now is properly supporting and turning their head. They may do this to express a dislike in certain foods. The infant has also developed enough to participate in feedings by grasping bottles and pieces of food to feed themselves&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. When all of these developmental milestones are considered, it is easy to understand why introducing solid foods before six months is not recommended.   

When choosing which solid to introduce first, it is important to understand what the infant actually needs. Iron-fortified infant cereal is typically the first solid introduced due to its high iron content. Cereals can be made of rice, barley, or oatmeal. Foods must be introduced one a time over a five- to seven-day period, to be able to detect any allergic responses. Orange juice is the best thing to mix with the cereal, because the vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron. Juices like apple, pear, prune, peach, and grape need to be avoided because of the risk of gastric upset&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Overall, solids can be introduced in any order after the cereal is introduced. It is important to know that solids cannot completely replace formula or breast milk until after twelve months of age.  

== Health benefits of breast milk ==

Each year in the U.S. roughly 27% of infants and children are affected by disease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.focusforhealth.org/chronic-illnesses-and-the-state-of-our-childrens-health/|title=Focus for Health {{!}} Chronic Illness and our Children's Health|date=2015-07-17|work=Focus for Health|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Breastfeeding can lower the risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other potentially life-threatening diseases. It offers protection against obesity and diabetes later in life, too&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milankov|first=Olgica|date=2018|title=Breastfeeding through the centuries|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0025-81051806151M|journal=Medicinski Pregled|volume=71|issue=5‚Äì6|pages=151‚Äì156|doi=10.2298/mpns1806151m}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Breast milk is proven to be chemically different for each mother and infant pair. For example, a premature infant's mother will have different milk than a mature infant's mother. Breast milk can also change if an infection is detected in the infant&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wong's nursing care of infants and children|last1=Hockenberry|first1=Marilyn J.|last2=Wilson|first2=David|others=Hockenberry, Marilyn J.,, Wilson, David, 1950 August 25-2015|year=2015|isbn=9780323222419|edition=10th|location=St. Louis, Missouri|oclc=844724099}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This natural prevention is tailored to each infant. ¬† 
=== Preventing anemia ===
Breastfed infants are at a lower risk for acquiring iron-deficiency anemia. Infants that only consume cow‚Äôs milk become deficient in iron and are 50% more likely to lose blood in their stool. If the infant is allergic to cow‚Äôs milk, it causes inflammation of the digestive system, resulting in chronic blood loss and decreased absorption of iron. This is why formula must be iron-enriched if breastfeeding is not possible&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wong's nursing care of infants and children|others=Hockenberry, Marilyn J.,, Wilson, David, 1950 August 25-2015|isbn=9780323222419|edition=10th|location=St. Louis, Missouri|oclc=844724099|last1 = Hockenberry|first1 = Marilyn J.|last2=Wilson|first2=David|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Breast milk naturally contains [[lactoferrin]], an iron binding protein that allows better iron absorption and digestion&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hegar|first=Badriul|last2=Vandenplas|first2=Yvan|date=2018|title=Breastfeeding for Gut Infant Health|url=|journal=Indonesian Journal of Gastroenterology, Hepatology &amp; Digestive Endoscopy|volume=19|pages=42‚Äì46|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Allowing the baby to absorb more iron leads to a better gut health of the infant.  

=== Preventing obesity ===
Breastfed infants tend to have lower incidences of obesity later in life. Breast milk leads to a slower weight gain in early infancy, and is protective against obesity and development of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Diabetes is a serious health problem where the body does not use insulin correctly. This diagnosis can cause many complications of the skin, eyes, feet, nervous system, heart, and kidneys&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/|title=Complications|website=American Diabetes Association|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, it is important to prevent diabetes when possible, because it goes hand-in-hand with obesity.   

When an infant is breastfed, they are exposed to a variety of flavors due to the mother‚Äôs changing diet and breast milk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Specht|first=Ina Olmer|last2=Rohde|first2=Jeanett Friis|last3=Olsen|first3=Nanna Julie|last4=Heitmann|first4=Berit Lilienthal|date=2018-07-11|title=Duration of exclusive breastfeeding may be related to eating behaviour and dietary intake in obesity prone normal weight young children|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200388|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200388|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6040730|pmid=29995949}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study showed that later in life breastfed children are more likely to eat a variety of healthy foods; this happens because food preferences are ingrained early in life. So, when an infant is exposed to a variety of flavors early on, they are less likely to be picky later. Another study confirmed a decrease in obesity at ages two and four if the infant is exclusively breastfed for at least four months&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=Brian G.|last2=Yeaton|first2=William H.|date=2013-09-22|title=Early Childhood Healthy and Obese Weight Status: Potentially Protective Benefits of Breastfeeding and Delaying Solid Foods|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-013-1357-z|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=1224‚Äì1232|doi=10.1007/s10995-013-1357-z|issn=1092-7875}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, breast milk is proven again to be the best nutrition without causing obesity.   

=== Preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) ===
[[File:Baby sleeping2.jpg|thumb|Infant sleeping|207x207px]]
SIDS is an unexplained death occurring in an infant who is one year of age or younger. Most deaths occur when the infant is sleeping&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/sids.html|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)|website=kidshealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Breastfeeding will help reduce the risk of SIDS when done exclusively for any length of time &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. It is recommended to breastfeed the infant from birth to 6 months exclusively to decrease the risk of SIDS by 50%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vennemann|first=M.M.|last2=Bajanowski|first2=T.|last3=Brinkmann|first3=B.|last4=Jorch|first4=G.|last5=Yucesan|first5=K.|last6=Sauerland|first6=C.|last7=Mitchell|first7=E.A.|date=2009-03-01|title=Does Breastfeeding Reduce the Risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome?|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/3/e406|journal=PEDIATRICS|language=en|volume=123|issue=3|pages=e406‚Äìe410|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-2145|issn=0031-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Diarrhea and upper respiratory illnesses, both linked to a higher risk of SIDS, occur less frequently for infants who are breastfed when compared to babies that are not breastfed, thus reducing the risk. Also, breast milk provides necessary nutrition for the infant's brain to develop. This allows the brain of the baby to mature quickly enough so that he or she will have the response to gasp for air when needed. Lastly, breastfed babies tend to sleep for shorter periods at a time and awaken more easily. Research has shown that babies who sleep shorter and awaken from their sleep easily tend to have a lower risk of SIDS&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lactationlink.com/blog/how-can-breastfeeding-reduce-sids/|title=What is SIDS and how can breastfeeding reduce my baby's risk?|date=2017-05-29|work=Lactation Link|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conclusively, most incidences happen when the infant is asleep, so it is important to exclusively breastfeed in order to reduce the incidence of SIDS. 
=== Promoting digestive health ===
Breast milk is important for the infant‚Äôs digestive system. It is the best substance to give, especially over cow's milk. Infants cannot properly digest fats, which cow's milk is full of. Breast milk contains a lot of fat, too, but it also contains [[Lipase a, lysosomal acid type|lipase]], a substance to help break down fat to aid in digestion. This leads to infants passing softer stools, so constipation is rare in breastfed infants&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Human milk also allows beneficial bacteria to grow in the infant‚Äôs intestines, which protects the mucosal barrier of the infant's stomach. This prevents harmful [[Pathogen|pathogens]] from harming the infant‚Äôs intestinal lining. The infant‚Äôs digestive mucosa is unable to produce antibodies until they are about four to six months old, which makes the infant susceptible to many infections. However, breast milk provides the antibodies needed for the infant to stay protected until they are able to produce their own antibodies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Breast milk also stimulates a [[Microbiota|microbiota,]] which results in the production of IgA. IgA is an [[Antibody|immunoglobulin]] that is a first line of defense to protect the digestive tract of the infant. This immunoglobulin is much higher in infants that are breastfed than in infants that were formula-fed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

=== Promoting immunity ===
[[File:From Colostrum to Breastmilk - 4241.jpg|thumb|332x332px|From Colostrum to Breastmilk. (Days after birth)]]
[[Colostrum]] is a great source of nutrition for a newborn baby, it is a thick yellow fluid that a mother first produces after birth. It has valuable nutrition that aids the baby with building immunity because it helps destroy disease-causing viruses. Other benefits of colostrum include: prevention of jaundice, aiding the baby in passing their first stool, building a strong immune system, providing a great number of vitamins and protein, and prevents low blood sugar in babies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/breastfeeding/colostrum-the-superfood-for-your-newborn/|title=Colostrum: Superfood for Your Newborn Baby|date=2015-09-11|work=American Pregnancy Association|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Overall, the sticky, thick, yellow liquid called colostrum has many benefits for a newborn baby which can be only provided to the baby through breastfeeding. 

Breast milk also contains much more protein than cow's milk. It contains 60% protein whereas cow‚Äôs milk contains only 40% protein&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Protein is very important for infants because they need more protein per pound than adults do. For the first few months of their life, this protein must come from breast milk or formula, it cannot come from cow's milk &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/importance-protein-infants-toddlers-6325.html|title=The Importance of Protein in Infants &amp; Toddlers|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One specific protein that breast milk has is lactoferrin, which is [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, meaning it prevents the growth of harmful bacteria. Without protein, the baby cannot produce the immunity that its body desperately needs, resulting in a higher risk of disease and malnutrition. Breast milk provides the best source of protein for an infant.

Another immunoglobulin breast milk provides to the infant is known as IgG. IgG provides [[passive immunity]] from the mother to the infant. This means that antibodies for common childhood diseases like diphtheria, measles, poliomyelitis, and rubella are passed onto the infant naturally, if the mother was vaccinated for this in her lifetime. The infant is then protected for about 3 months, just enough time to protect them until they receive their first immunizations at 2 months&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Promoting intelligence ===
Parents generally want their child to be as smart as possible and to exceed in school. Breastfeeding an infant can increase their intelligence throughout life. Mothers who exclusively breastfed their child have a higher chance of increasing their child‚Äôs intelligence. Studies have shown that infants that are breastfed for six months versus infants who were only breasted for one month have a higher intelligence score. Those children tend to have a higher intelligence score in the third and fifth grade. Their intelligence scores are also higher at the age of 15&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Breastfeeding aids in the development of cognitive maturity which leads to a higher intelligence&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Breastfeeding|date=2018-11-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breastfeeding&amp;oldid=868354507|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this only correlated to those children which were exclusively breastfed by their mothers as infants &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tn9w3|title=On the Positive Relationship between Breastfeeding &amp;amp; Intelligence|last=Boutwell|first=Brian|date=2017-05-22|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==History of breastfeeding==
[[File:Louis-Roland Trinquesse Young woman breastfeeding her child 1777.jpg|thumb|Louis-Roland Trinquesse Young woman breastfeeding her child 1777]]
Breastfeeding, prehistorically, was the only way infants were nourished, there was no acceptable substitute for human milk for a long time. In 1 AD, philosophers were discovering the importance of breast milk versus any substitute. It was concluded that breastfeeding helped the mother and infant establish an emotional connection&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The nutritional value was still not fully understood, but it was believed that through suckling, the infant gained not only energy, but also the characteristics and personality of whoever they fed from. It was suggested that infants be breastfed as long as possible, and many were until two to three years of age. 

It was not until 16 centuries later that the importance of breast milk was truly understood. In 1748, in the book ‚ÄúAn Essay upon Nursing, and the Management of Children, from Their Birth to Three Years of Age‚Äù by Cadogan, [[colostrum]] was recognized as a substance responsible for the elimination of [[meconium]], and prevention of illnesses of mothers and children. Also, it was believed that a bond was established if the mother breastfed her child from the hour it was born. [[Wet nurse|Wet-nurses]] and introducing solid food before the baby turned six months were now opposed, and mortality rates decreased once accepting the value of breastfeeding. Those that continued to feed their infants substitutes like cereals, cow‚Äôs milk, and broths too early, led to the infant's development of scurvy, rickets, gastrointestinal problems, and kidney stones&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Continuing on into the 19th century, scientists were relating high rates of mortality and malnourishment to the lack of infants being breastfed. At last, breastfeeding was seen as the best and only option for infant nutrition before six months. However, in 1847, when the first commercial formula was made, it promoted the use of bottles, partly due to breasts receiving a sexual connotation during this time. With the promotion of formula, the long fight for breastfeeding took a dive. Organizations that took notice came together to promote breastfeeding once again, they included Natural Childbirth Movement, Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative launched by WHO, and [[UNICEF|United Nations International Children‚Äôs Emergency Fund]] (UNICEF). In 1990, these organizations pushed to protect and promote ‚Äúbreast milk is the best food for infants&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.‚Äù This value still holds true today. Factors leading to increased breastfeeding rates recently include facilities encouraging mothers to have skin-to-skin contact with the infant after birth, cultivating the initiation of breastfeeding; and facilities encouraging rooming-in, where the mother can watch for feeding cues with the infant staying in her room&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''Law of 1794''', derived from the Fourcroy Report of 1794, was enacted by the [[National Convention]] in December, 1794 in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The law, stemming from a report from [[Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy]], proposed the reorganization of the structure of medical education in post-revolution France and sought to lay the ground work for the institution of Hospital Medicine in France.

== Background ==
Following the [[French Revolution]], France was in need of a new wave of new medical and healthcare professionals. Doctors and surgeons, primarily military-based physicians, were killed in large numbers during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|wars]] and were in short supply to staff medical facilities after the fighting ended.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter B.|title=Mending bodies, saving souls : a history of hospitals|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195055233|pages=309‚Äì326|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, it was estimated that over 600 surgeons were lost during the course of the conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coulter|first1=Harris L.|title=The origins of modern western medicine : J.B. Van Helmont to Claude Bernard|date=2001|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=1556433719|page=435|edition=Volume: 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Convention|Revolutionary Government]] instituted after the war wanted a major overhaul of the French Healthcare System. With this in mind, the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly of 1792]] disbanded most of the medical education resources in the country.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; [[Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Francois comte De Fourcroy]], a French Chemist who was a former member of the Ancien R√©gime Academy of Sciences, was called upon by the National Convention. They assigned him the role of planning out a new medical education system that would provide a new way of teaching medical students.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; It was the goal of the Revolutionary Government to establish new "ecole de sante" (medical schools) more in line with the principles of the new government and to reorganized the disarrayed and fractured healthcare education system.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; After the revolution, doctors and surgeons in hospitals around France had an unprecedented number of corpses at their disposal and relatively lax oversight in terms of their dissection. This provided them with a strong opportunity to pathologize and classify new diseases and abnormalities from the plethora of dead bodies that occupied the hospitals.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; Fourcroy sought to take advantage of these newly accessible corpses for the purpose of educating new medical students with a more hands-on experience. He was convinced that an interaction between medical students and actual human bodies was essential to the medical education experience, stating that, in his new proposed system, students would "read little, see much, do much".&lt;ref name="renamed_from_3_on_20170515225837"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W.F.|title=Science and the practice of medicine in the nineteenth century|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|pages=26‚Äì28|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing the work proposed by several of his contemparies, such as [[Philippe Pinel|Phillipe Pinel]], [[Marie Fran√ßois Xavier Bichat|Marie Francois Xavier Bichat]] and [[Rene Laennec]], who sought to combine information gathered from surgery and medical practice together, Fourcroy proposed a report that encouraged the combination of medical education and surgical education as one comprehensive teaching model to give medical students a more complete education.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; Formerly, medical practitioners would only gain surgical license and education through formal surgical apprenticeships that did not exist within the tradition medical school.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; Following Fourcroy's proposal and incorporating the readily available hospital corpses, the medical education would be moved into the hospital, so that students could learn both medical techniques and surgical techniques simultaneously.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20170515225837"/&gt; Fourcroy wished to "eradicate the ancient separation between two estates (surgery and medicine) that has caused so much trouble", stating that "Medicine and surgery are two branches of the same science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maulitz|first1=Russell C.|title=Morbid appearances : the anatomy of pathology in the early nineteenth century|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521524539|page=39|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The report by Fourcroy, assisted in part by [[Francois Chaussier]], was delivered to the National Convention in December 1794. Parts of the report were eventually integrated into the Law of 1794, which had several effects on the medical education system in France:
* Lead to the establishment of 3 new medical schools located in [[Paris]], [[Montpellier]], and [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="renamed_from_3_on_20170515225837"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W.F.|title=Science and the practice of medicine in the nineteenth century|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|pages=26‚Äì28|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Luxembourg Red Cross''' ({{lang-fr|Croix-Rouge Luxembourgeoise}}, {{lang-de|Luxemburgische Rote Kreuz}}) is the [[Luxembourg]]-based [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|National Society]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].  The society was established on 8 August 1914 by Emile and Aline Mayrisch.  They persuaded the mayor of [[Luxembourg City]], the commander-in-chief of the army and representatives of the three churches to sign the founding certificate. Its President is currently [[Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Maria Teresa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/europe/luxembourg-red-cross/|title=Luxembourg Red Cross - IFRC|website=www.ifrc.org|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michel Simonis is the managing director.&lt;ref name="Wort2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Luxembourg Red Cross director has died|url=http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/remembering-jacques-hansen-former-luxembourg-red-cross-director-has-died-5795bcb2ac730ff4e7f6405f|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Luxemburger Wort|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercy Hospital''' is a  private not-for-profit [[Roman Catholic]] [[hospital]] located in [[Iowa City, Iowa]].  It is one of three hospitals in the city - the others being the [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]] and the Iowa City [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] Medical Center. Mercy Hospital is sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy West Midwest Community of Omaha.

== History ==
Mercy Hospital traces its history to 1873 when the Superior of the Davenport house of the [[Sisters of Mercy]] entered into an agreement with the [[University of Iowa]] to operate a small hospital in the community.  At the request of [[Davenport, Iowa]] physician Washington Freeman Peck the Superior sent a group of nuns to Iowa City to help staff the hospital.  Dr. Peck and other physicians raised $5,000 to renovate a vacant school building known as Mechanics Academy into a 20-bed hospital.  This arrangement lasted until 1885, when the Sisters moved to a nearby vacant mission.  In 1886, the sisters established Mercy Hospital as an independent hospital.

The '''NWCS''' was the '''NHS-wide Clearing Service''' for [[NHS England]] and [[NHS Wales]]. It was a method of [[data exchange]] between NHS organisations, for non-clinical purposes such as statistical analysis set up in 1996. Previously [[Hospital Episode Statistics]] were collected by [[Regional health authority (UK)|Regional Health Authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Episode Statistics|url=http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes|website=Health &amp; Social Care Information Service|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was operated by McKesson, who supplied the ClearNET IT system and was superseded in 2007 by the [[National Programme for IT#The Spine .28including PDS .26 PSIS.29|Secondary Uses Service]] (SUS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4636">'''NHS Direct Wales''' is a 24-hour telephone and internet health advice service provided by [[NHS Wales]] to enable people to obtain advice when use of the national [[emergency telephone number]] ('''999''' or '''112''') does not seem to be appropriate but there is some degree of urgency; it also functions as a confidential advice service for some medical matters which a patient might be reluctant to discuss with their own [[General Practitioner]] (GP) and has subsidiary helplines for specific health matters such as [[human papillomavirus|human papillomavirus (HPV)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/health/protection/immunisation/vaccine/?lang=en |title=Beating Cervical Cancer |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not replace any of the existing emergency or non-emergency medical services but complements those already existing and enables callers who might not be fully able to diagnose themselves to be directed to care of an appropriate level of urgency, including transport to hospital if the diagnosis merits that action.

==Organisation and history==
This service was originally provided as part of [[NHS Direct]] covering both England and Wales until it was transferred to Welsh control in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/healthpress/healthpress2002/752212/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government - News - 2002 - Call Centre provides vital service, says Jane Hutt]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2007 management of NHS Direct Wales was transferred from [[Swansea NHS Trust]] to the [[Welsh Ambulance Service|Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newydd.cymru.gov.uk/dhss/publications/health/strategies/1971764/decsstrategye.pdf?lang=en |title=Delivering Emergency Care Services, An Integrated Approach for Delivering Unscheduled Care in Wales |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government |date=February 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact methods==
===Telephone===
The telephone number for NHS Direct Wales is 0845 46 47.

NHS Direct Wales also has integrated services with many of the [[Emergency department|A&amp;E departments]] in Wales where symptomatic callers phoning their A&amp;E department will be transferred to NHS Direct for clinical triage. The service also fronts many of the helplines on behalf of Public Health dealing with issues such as the [[Cryptosporidiosis|cryptosporidia]] outbreak in North Wales, HPV, smoking etc.

The [[textphone|textphone service]] is on 0845 606 4647.

Access via [[RNID]] Typetalk&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typetalk.org/ RNID Typetalk]&lt;/ref&gt; is on 18001 0845 4647.

Callers receive a recorded announcement describing the services available and when appropriate will be transferred to a call handler with an option for Welsh language who will take their details and pass them on to another person with relevant skills or will arrange for them to be called back within three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/aboutus/callnhsdirectwales/ |title=About us: What happens when I call NHS Direct Wales? |publisher=NHS Direct Wales |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a problem appears serious enough then an ambulance will be sent. Callers can stay anonymous if they wish.

===Internet===
The NHS Direct Wales website provides a gateway to a number of resources in English, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and other languages including a health encyclopaedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia |title=Encyclopaedia| publisher=NHS Direct Wales |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the locations of GP surgeries, dentists, pharmacists, opticians, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/localservices/ |title=Local Services | publisher=NHS Direct Wales |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website does not provide an online diagnosis for current symptoms, but you can use the online enquiry service to ask a non-symptomatic question about anything else related to health, e.g. questions about health costs, questions about how to make a complaint, questions about what travel vaccinations are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/onlineenquiry/ |title=Ask us your Health Question| publisher=NHS Direct Wales |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:REM-s√∏vn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's imaginary depiction of a dream.]]
'''Oneirology''' ({{IPAc-en|…í|n|·µª|Àà|r|…í|l|…ô|d í|i}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:·ΩÑŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒøŒΩ|''·ΩÑŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒøŒΩ'']], ''oneiron'', "dream"; and [[wikt:-ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±|-''ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±'']], [[wikt:-logia|-''logia'']], "the study of") is the scientific study of [[dream]]s.  Current research seeks correlations between dreaming and current knowledge about the functions of the brain, as well as understanding of how the brain works during dreaming as pertains to memory formation and mental disorders. The study of oneirology can be distinguished from [[dream interpretation]] in that the aim is to quantitatively study the process of dreams instead of analyzing the meaning behind them.

==History==
In the 19th century two advocates of this discipline were the French [[sinologist]]s Marquis d'[[Hervey de Saint Denys]] and [[Alfred Maury]]. The field gained momentum in 1952, when [[Nathaniel Kleitman]] and his student [[Eugene Aserinsky]] discovered regular [[Frequency|cycles]]. A further experiment by Kleitman and [[William C. Dement]], then another medical student, demonstrated the particular period of sleep during which electrical brain activity, as measured by an [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG), closely resembled that of waking, in which the eyes dart about actively. This kind of sleep became known as rapid eye movement ([[REM sleep|REM]]) sleep, and Kleitman and Dement's experiment found a correlation of 0.80 between REM sleep and [[dream]]ing.

==Field of work==
Research into dreams includes exploration of the mechanisms of dreaming, the influences on dreaming, and disorders linked to dreaming. Work in oneirology overlaps with neurology and can vary from quantifying dreams, to analyzing brain waves during dreaming, to studying the effects of drugs and neurotransmitters on sleeping or dreaming. Though debate continues about the purpose and origins of dreams, there could be great gains from studying dreams as a function of brain activity. For example, knowledge gained in this area could have implications in the treatment of certain mental illnesses. 

==Mechanisms of dreaming==
Dreaming occurs mainly during [[REM sleep]], and brain scans recording brain activity have witnessed heavy activity in the [[limbic system]] and the [[amygdala]] during this period. Though current research has reversed the myth that dreaming occurs only during REM sleep, it has also shown that the dreams reported in non-rapid eye movement ([[NREM]]) and REM differ qualitatively and quantitatively, suggesting that the mechanisms that control each are different.&lt;ref name=TAKEUCHI2000&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00237.x |author1=Takeuchi, T. |author2=Miyasita, A. |author3=Inugami, M. |author4=Yamamoto, Y. |year=2001 |title=Intrinsic dreams are not produced without REM sleep mechanisms: evidence through elicitation of sleep onset REM periods |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=43‚Äì52 |pmid=11285054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During REM sleep, researchers theorize that the brain goes through a process known as synaptic efficacy refreshment. This is observed as brain waves self-firing during sleep, in slow cycles at a rate of around 14&amp;nbsp;Hz, and is believed to serve the purpose of consolidating recent memories and reinforcing old memories. In this type of brain stimulation, the dreaming that occurs is a by-product of the process.&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kavanau, J.L. |year=2000 |title=Sleep, memory maintenance, and mental disorders |journal= Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=199‚Äì208 |pmid=11001598 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of sleep===
During normal sleep cycles, humans alternate between normal, NREM sleep and REM sleep. The brain waves characteristic of dreaming that are observed during REM sleep are the most commonly studied in dream research because most dreaming occurs during REM sleep.&lt;ref name=TAKEUCHI2000/&gt;

===REM sleep===
{{Main|REM sleep}}
[[File:Sleep EEG REM.png|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showing brainwaves during REM sleep|thumb|200px]]
In 1952, [[Eugene Aserinsky]] discovered REM sleep while working in the surgery of his [[PhD]] advisor. Aserinsky noticed that the sleepers' eyes fluttered beneath their closed eyelids, later using a [[polygraph]] machine to record their [[EEG|brain waves]] during these periods. In one session, he awakened a subject who was wailing and crying out during REM and confirmed his suspicion that dreaming was occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dement |first=William |title=The Sleepwatchers |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=1996 |isbn= 0-9649338-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Aserinsky and his advisor published the ground-breaking study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name="as-science"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Aserinsky |first1= E. |last2= Kleitman| first2= N. |date=September 1953 |title=Regularly occurring periods of eye motility and concomitant phenomena, during sleep |journal=Science |volume=118 |issue=3062 |pages=273‚Äì274 |doi=10.1126/science.118.3062.273 |pmid=13089671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulated observation shows that dreams are strongly associated with [[REM sleep]], during which an [[electroencephalogram]] shows brain activity to be most like wakefulness. Participant-nonremembered dreams during NREM are normally more mundane in comparison.&lt;ref name=Dement1957&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Dement| first1= W. |last2= Kleitman| first2= N. |year=1957 |title= The Relation of Eye Movements during Sleep to Dream Activity |journal= Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=53 |pages=89‚Äì97 |doi=10.1037/h0048189 |pmid=13428941 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a typical lifespan, a human spends a total of about six years dreaming&lt;ref name="HSWDream"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |title=How Dreams Work| first= Lee Ann| last= Obringer| website= How Stuff Works |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/dream3.htm |accessdate= July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is about two hours each night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |title= Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm |accessdate=2009-11-16 |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dreams last only 5 to 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="HSWDream"/&gt; It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams, if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.

During REM sleep, the release of certain neurotransmitters is completely suppressed. As a result, [[motor neuron]]s are not stimulated, a condition known as [[Rapid eye movement sleep#Physiology of REM sleep|REM atonia]]. This prevents dreams from resulting in dangerous movements of the body.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/rem-sleep-behavior-disorder/|title=REM Sleep Behavior Disorder |website= mayoclinic.org| publisher= [[Mayo Clinic]]| accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schutte-Rodin|first=Sharon|title=REM Sleep Behavior Disorder |url= http://yoursleep.aasmnet.org/disorder.aspx?id=29|work= yoursleep.aasmnet.org| publisher= American Academy of Sleep Medicine| accessdate= 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery that dreams take place primarily during a distinctive electrophysiological state of sleep (REM), which can be identified by objective criteria, led to rebirth of interest in this phenomenon. When REM sleep episodes were timed for their duration and subjects awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting could take place, it was determined that subjects accurately matched the length of time they judged the dream narrative to occupy with the length of REM sleep that preceded the awakening. This close correlation of REM sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly occurrence, rather than an occasional phenomenon, and that it is a high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60‚Äì90 minutes in all humans throughout the life span.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

REM sleep episodes and the dreams that accompany them lengthen progressively across the night, with the first episode the shortest, of approximately 10‚Äì12 minutes duration, and the second and third episodes increasing to 15‚Äì20 minutes. Dreams at the end of the night may last typically 15 minutes, although these may be experienced as several distinct stories due to momentary arousals interrupting sleep as the night ends.{{citation needed |date= March 2012}}

Dream reports can normally be made 50% of the time when an awakening occurs prior to the end of the first REM period. This rate of retrieval is increased to about 99% when awakenings occur during the last REM period of the night. This increase in the ability to recall appears to be related to intensification across the night in the vividness of dream imagery, colors and emotions. The dream story itself in the last REM period is farthest from reality, containing more bizarre elements, and it is these properties, coupled with the increased likelihood of morning waking review to take place, that heighten the chance of recall of the last dream.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Definition of a dream==
The definition of dream used in quantitative research is defined through four base components: 1) a form of thinking that occurs under minimal brain direction, external stimuli are blocked, and the part of the brain that recognizes self shuts down; 2) a form of experience that we believed we experience through our senses; 3) something memorable; 4) have some interpretation of experience by self. In summary, a dream, as defined by Bill Domhoff and Adam Schneider, is "a report of a memory of a cognitive experience that happens under the kinds of conditions that are most frequently produced in a state called 'sleep.' "&lt;ref name="The Quantitative Study of Dreams"&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |title=The Quantitative Study of Dreams |first= Adam | last= Schneider |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] |url=http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/ |accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonplace bizarreness in dreaming===

Certain kinds of bizarre cognitions, such as disjunctive cognitions and interobjects, are common in dreams.  

===Interobject===

Interobjects, like disjunctive cognitions, are a commonplace bizarreness of dreamlife.  Interobjects are a kind of dream condensation that creates a new object that could not occur in waking life. It may have a vague structure that is described as "something between an X and a y".  [[Allan Hobson|Hobson]]&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. (1988) ''The Dreaming Brain''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; dreamt of "a piece of hardware, something like the lock of a door or perhaps a pair of paint-frozen hinges." 

===Authentic dreaming===
Authentic dreams are defined by their tendency to occur "within the realm of experience"&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000/&gt; and reflect actual memories or experiences the dreamer can relate to. Authentic dreams are believed to be the side effect of synaptic efficacy refreshment that occurs without errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Antrobus |first=J |year=1991 |title=Dreaming: cognitive processes during cortical activation and high afferent thresholds |publisher=Psychol Rev |edition=98 |pages=96‚Äì120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the brain stimulation that occurs during dreaming authentic dreams is significant in reinforcing neurological pathways, serving as a method for the mind to "rehearse" certain things during sleep.

===Illusory dreaming===
Illusory dreams are defined as dreams that contain impossible, incongruent, or bizarre content and are  hypothesized to stem from memory circuits accumulating efficacy errors. In theory, old memories having undergone synaptic efficacy refreshment multiple times throughout one's lifetime result in accumulating errors that manifest as illusory dreams when stimulated. Qualities of illusory dreaming have been linked to [[delusions]] observed in mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000/&gt; Illusory dreams are believed to most likely stem from older memories that experience this accumulation of errors in contrast to authentic dreams that stem from more recent experiences.

==Influences on dreaming==
One aspect of dreaming studied is the capability to externally influence the contents of dreams with various stimuli. One such successful connection was made to the [[olfactory]], influencing the emotions of dreams through a smell stimulus. Their research has shown that the introduction of a positive smelling stimulus (roses) induced positive dreams while negative smelling stimulus (rotten eggs) induced negative dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2009.00737.x |author=Schredl, M., Atanasova, D., Hormann, K., Maurer, J.T., Hummel, T., &amp; Stuck, B.A. |year= 2009 |title=Information processing during sleep: the effect of olfactory stimuli on dream content and dream emotions |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages= 285‚Äì290 |pmid=19552703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memories and experience===
Though there is much debate within the field about the purpose of dreaming, a leading theory involves the consolidation of [[memories]] and experiences that occurs during [[REM sleep]]. The electric involuntary stimulus the brain undergoes during sleep is believed to be a basis for a majority of dreaming.

The link between memory, sleep, and dreams becomes more significant in studies analyzing memory consolidation during sleep. Research has shown that [[NREM sleep]] is responsible for the consolidation of facts and episodes in contrast to [[REM sleep]] that consolidates more emotionally related aspects of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10253890701408822 |author1=Wagner, U.  |author2=Born, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008 |title=Memory consolidation during sleep: Interactive effects of sleep stages and HPA regulation |journal=Stress-the International Journal on the Biology of Stress |volume =11 |issue=1 |pages=28‚Äì41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between REM and emotional consolidation could be interpreted as the reason why dreams are of such an emotional nature and produce strong reactions from humans.

====Interpersonal attachment====
In addition to the conscious role people are aware of memory and experience playing in dreaming, unconscious effects such as health of relationships factor into the types of dreams the brain produces. Of the people analyzed, those suffering from "insecure attachments" were found to dream with more frequency and more vividly than those who were evaluated to have "secure attachments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00244.x |author1=McNamara, P. |author2=Andresen, J. |author3=Clark, J. |author4=Zborowski, M. |author5=Duffy, C.A. |year=2001 |title=Impact of attachment styles on dream recall and dream content: a test of the attachment hypothesis of REM sleep |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=117‚Äì127 |pmid=11422726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs affecting dreaming===
Correlations between the usage of drugs and dreaming have been documented, particularly the use of drugs, such as sedatives, and the suppression of dreaming because of drugging effects on the cycles and stages of sleep while not allowing the user to reach [[REM sleep|REM]]. Drugs used for their stimulating properties ([[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[MDMA|ecstasy]]) have shown to also decrease the restorative properties of REM sleep and its duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2007.12.004  |vauthors=Schierenbeck T, Riemann D, Berger M, etal |year=2008 |title=Effect of illicit recreational drugs upon sleep: Cocaine, ecstasy and methamphetamine |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=381‚Äì389 |pmid=18313952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dreaming disorders==
Dreaming disorders are difficult to quantify due to the ambiguous nature of dreaming. However, dreaming disorders can be linked to psychological disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] expressed as [[nightmares]]. Research into dreaming also suggests similarity and links in illusory dreaming and [[delusions]].&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000/&gt;

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Diagnostic symptoms include re-experiencing original trauma(s), by means of flashbacks or nightmares; avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma; and increased arousal, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, anger, and [[hypervigilance]].

Links to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and dreaming have been made in studying the [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] or nightmares the victims would suffer. Measurement of the brain waves exhibited by the subjects experiencing these episodes showed great similarity between those of dreaming. The drugs used to treat those suffering from these symptoms of flashbacks and nightmares would suppress not only these traumatic episodes but also any other sort of dreaming function.&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000/&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
The symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] involve abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality primarily focused on [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]].

The delusions experienced by those with schizophrenia have been likened to the experience of illusory dreams that have come to be interpreted by the subject as actual experiences.&lt;ref name=Kavanau2000/&gt; Additional research into medication to suppress symptoms of schizophrenia have also shown to influence the [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] cycle of those taking the medication and as a result influence the patterns of sleep and dreaming in the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2009.03.032 |author=Lusignan, F., Zadra, A., Dubuc, M.J., Daoust, A.M., Mottard, J.P., Godbout, R. |year=2009 |title=Dream content in chronically-treated persons with schizophrenia |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=164‚Äì173 |pmid=19409757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">The '''Qasr Al-Eini Museum''' is a historical [[medical]] [[museum]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. 

The museum covers the history of medicine in the Arabic [[Mashriq]] region of the [[Levant]], and the historical role played by the Qasr Al-Eini School of Medicine as a linkage between medicine in pharaonic Egypt and modern medicine.&lt;ref name="touregypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/qasraleinimuseum.htm|title=Qasr Al-Eini Museum|last=Dunn | first=Jimmy|publisher=InterCity Oz, Inc|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surgeon gynecologist and obstetrician named Dr. Mohammed Almenawi was the general secretary of the Faculty of Medicine. He came up with the idea of the Qasr Al-Eini Museum in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/qasraleinimuseum.htm|title=Egypt: Qasr Al-Eini Museum, the First Museum of An Arab Faculty of Medicine in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The library of the Museum holds the following artifacts:
* rare books, references, documents, manuscripts, photographic pictures, and statues
* an encyclopedia on ''The Wise Men of Qasr Al-Eini'' or the biographies of 154 professors who lectured in Qasr Al-Eini
* an original copy of the book ''Description de l'Egypte''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/qasraleinimuseum.htm|title=Egypt: Qasr Al-Eini Museum, the First Museum of An Arab Faculty of Medicine in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first museum of an Arab University of Medicine, the [[Kasr El Aini Hospital]], and represents the oldest University of Medicine in the Orient, the Qasr Al-Eini School of Medicine. The Qasr Al-Eini Museum's first phase of building opened in 1998, and a further section opened in 1999.&lt;ref name="touregypt"/&gt;

'''Radiation-induced lumbar plexopathy (RILP)''' or '''radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy (RILSP)''' is nerve damage in the pelvis and lower spine area occurring as a late side effect of [[external beam radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delanian|first1=S|last2=Lefaix|first2=JL|last3=Pradat|first3=PF|title=Radiation-induced neuropathy in cancer survivors.|journal=Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology|date=December 2012|volume=105|issue=3|pages=273‚Äì82|doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2012.10.012|pmid=23245644}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yadav|first1=Rajesh R|title=Radiation-Induced Lumbosacral Plexopathy: Background, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/316604-overview#a6|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref6"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dyck P, Thaisetthawatkul P|title=Lumbosacral Plexopathy|journal=CONTINUUM: Lifelong Learning in Neurology|volume=20|issue=5| year = 2014 | pages=1343‚Äì58|doi=10.1212/01.CON.0000455877.60932.d3| pmid = 25299286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, such nerve damage may present in stages, earlier as [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and later as complications of [[Radiation therapy#Side effects|chronic radiation fibrosis]]. RILP occurs as a result of [[radiation therapy]] administered to treat [[lymphoma]] or cancers within the abdomen or pelvic area such as cervical, ovarian, bladder, colon, kidney, pancreatic, prostate, testicular, colorectal, colon, rectal or anal [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref18"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Americo|first1=J.|last2=Filho|first2=M.

==Signs and symptoms==
Lumbosacral plexopathy is characterized by any of the following symptoms; usually bi-lateral and symmetrical, though unilateral is known.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt; 
*Lower limb [[Dysesthesia|dysaesthesia]], abnormal sensations of touch or feeling
*Lower limb weakness
*Lower limb numbness
*Lower limb paresthesia, e.g., [[foot drop]], [[muscle atrophy]]
*Lower limb [[Neuropathic pain|pain]]

Symptoms are typically a step-wise progression with periods of stability in between,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref6" /&gt; weakness often appearing years later.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt;  Weakness frequently presents in the lower leg muscle groups.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt;  Symptoms are usually irreversible.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christian Custodio|author2=Cody Christian Andrews|title=Radiation Plexopathy|url=https://now.aapmr.org/radiation-plexopathy/|publisher=American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|date=August 1, 2017|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial onset of symptoms may occur as early as 2&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt; to 3&lt;ref name="pmid:597799" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt; months after radiotherapy.  The median onset is approximately 5 years,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt; but can be highly variable, 2-3 decades after radiation therapy.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref19" /&gt; One case study recorded the initial onset occurring 31 years post treatment.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;

==Cause==
The treatment's ionizing radiation is an activation mechanism for [[Apoptosis|apoptosis (cell death)]] within the targeted cancer,&lt;ref name="pmid:10826314"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Rosen EM, Fan S, Goldberg ID, Rockwell S | year = 2000 | title=Biological Basis of Radiation Sensitivity| journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)| volume=14|issue=5| pages = 543‚Äì50 | pmid = 10826314| url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/ovarian-cancer/biological-basis-radiation-sensitivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can also impact nearby healthy radiosensitive tissues, like the [[Lumbar plexus|lumbosacral plexus]]. The occurrence and severity of RILP is related to the magnitude of [[ionizing radiation]]&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; and the [[radiosensitivity]] of peripheral nerves may be further aggravated when combined with chemotherapy, like taxanes and platinum drugs, during treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid:8966224"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Frykholm GJ, Sintorn K, Montelius A, Jung B, P√•hlman L, Glimelius B | year = 1996 | title=Acute lumbosacral plexopathy during and after preoperative radiotherapy of rectal adenocarcinoma | journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology: Journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology| volume=38|issue=2| pages= 121‚Äì30| pmid = 8966224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The [[Pathophysiology|pathophysiological process]] behind radiation's RILP nerve damage has been discussed and posited since the 1960s&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; and still is without precise definition.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid:10826314" /&gt;  Consensus exists on a progression of symptoms, with a stepping (a time delay) between initial inflammation and subsequent retractile fibrosis. Proposed mechanisms of nerve damage include microvascular damage ([[ischemia]]) supplying the myelin,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt; radiation damage of the myelin,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrell|first1=R.|editor1-last=Ehrenpreis|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Marsh|editor2-first=R|editor3-last=Small Jr|editor3-first=W (eds)|title=Radiation Therapy for Pelvic Malignancy and its Consequences |date=2015|publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4939-2217-8|pages=181‚Äì90|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2217-8_13|chapter=Radiation-Induced Lumbosacral Plexopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; oxygen free radical cell damage,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt; [[Nerve compression syndrome|nerve compression neuropathy]] &lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt; and a late fibro-atrophic poorly vascularised (ischemic) phase with retractile fibrosis.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The more common source of lumbar [[plexopathy]] is a direct or secondary&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt; tumor involvement of the plexus with [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] being the typical confirmation tool.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt; Tumors typically present with enhancement of nerve roots and T2-weighted hyperintensity.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt; The differential consideration of RILP requires taking a [[medical history]] and neurologic examination.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

RILP's neurological symptoms can mimic other nerve disorders. People may present with pure lower motor neuron syndrome, a symptom of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=A.|last2=Drory|first2=V. E.|title=Postradiation lower motor neuron syndrome: case series and literature review|journal=Journal of Neurology| date=July 2013|volume=260|issue=7|pages=1802‚Äì1806| doi=10.1007/s00415-013-6881-7|pmid=23463367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RILP may also be misdiagnosed as  [[Leptomeningeal cancer|leptomeningeal metastasis]] often showing nodular [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] enhancement of the [[Cauda equina#Clinical significance|cauda equina nerve roots]] or having increased [[Cerebrospinal fluid#Structure|CSF protein content]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref15" /&gt;

Other differential diagnoses to consider are [[Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy|Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy]], [[Neoplasm|neoplastic lumbosacral]]  plexopathy, [[Paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic neuronopathy]], [[Proximal diabetic neuropathy|diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy]], [[Degenerative disc disease#Signs and symptoms|degenerative disk disease]] ([[Osteoporosis|osteoporosis of the spine]]), [[Osteoarthritis|Osteoarthritis of the spine]], [[Lumbar spinal stenosis|Lumbar Spinal Stenosis]], post-infectious plexopathy, [[Neoplastic meningitis|carcinomatous meningitis (CM)]], [[Peripheral neuropathy#Classification#Mononeuritis multiplex|mononeuritis multiplex]], and [[Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy|chemotherapy-induced plexopathy]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;

The testing to resolve a RILP diagnosis involves [[Blood Serum|blood serum analysis]], [[X-ray]]s, [[Electromyography|EMG]], MRI and [[Lumbar puncture|Cerebrospinal Fluid analysis]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

==Prevention==
Since RILP's neurological changes are typically irreversible and a curative strategy has yet to be defined, prevention is the best approach.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt; Treating the primary cancer remains an obvious requirement, but lower levels of lumbar plexus radiation dosing will minimize or eliminate RILP.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

One method to reduce the lumbosacral plexus' dosing is to include it with other at-risk organs that get spared from radiation.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref20"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yadav|first1=Rajesh R|last2=Talavera|first2=Francisco|last3=Andary|first3=Michael T|last4=Meier III|first4=Robert H|title=Radiation-Induced Lumbosacral Plexopathy Treatment &amp; Management- Other Treatment |url= https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/316604-treatment#d12| website=emedicine.medscape.com |date=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref10"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Min M, Roos D, Keating E, Kerr L, Mukherjee R, Potter A, Shakeshaft J, Baxi S | date = February 2014| title=External validation of the lumbosacral plexus-contouring protocol developed by Yi et al.

Key to prevention is resolving the lack of clinical evidence between dosing the lumbar plexus and the late onset of neurological problems, a relationship confounded by low toxicity rates and the lack of an adequate population size, the lack of aggregate data pooling across multiple institutions.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid:29296303"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkpatric|first1=John P.|last2=Marks|first2=Lawrence B.|last3=Mayo|first3=Charles S.|last4=Lawrence|first4=Yaacov R.|last5=Bhandare|first5=Niranjan|last6=Ryu|first6=Samuel| title=Estimating normal tissue toxicity in radiosurgery of the CNS: application and limitations of QUANTEC| journal=Journal of Radiosurgery and SBRT|date=2011|volume=1|issue=2| pmid=29296303|pmc=5675466|at= p. 95-107, ISSUES &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS: #3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatment of RILP is primarily supportive&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt; with mental,&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; physiological&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt; and social aspects&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; and consideration of any aggravating (synergistic) neurological factors.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;

To prevent compounding existing RILP symptoms and to minimize further progression
*Remove co-morbidity factors&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;
**control diabetes and hypertension&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;
**avoid alcohol abuse&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;
**avoiding any local trauma in the irradiated volume&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;
**controlling acute edema&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;
*control acute inflammation.  Pharmaceuticals that may be effective are corticosteroids (Dexamethasone)&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*avoid stretching a plexus immobilized by fibrosis, e.g., carrying  heavy loads or extensive movements, which may cause sudden [[Decompensation|neurological decompensation]].&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;

The effect on the person with the condition, depends upon the type of impairment. Handicaps may include physical challenges, bowel and/or bladder dysfunction and may occur in multiple settings of work and home.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; [[Physical therapy|Physical]] and [[occupational therapy]] are important elements in maintaining mobility and use of the lower extremities, along with assistive aides such as [[Orthotics|Ankle-Foot-Orthotics (AFOs)]], cane, walkers, etc.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt; Sensory reeducation techniques may be necessary for balance&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt; and [[lymphedema]] management may be required.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;

Pharmaceuticals that may be effective for RILP's [[neuropathic pain]] are
*tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (amitriptyline)&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*Antiepileptics or anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, valproic acid)&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors(SSRIs) (duloxetine) to preserve normal norepinephrine and serotonin levels&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*Analgesic drugs (pregabalin, methadone)&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;
*Opiates may used singularly or to potentate the concomitant use of TCAs.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;
*Antiarrhythmics (mexilitine) for muscle stiffness&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;

Non-pharmaceutical RILP considerations are
*acupuncture for pain&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*massage for pain&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;
*transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt;
*Benzodiazepines may be used for paraesthesia&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;
*quinine may be used for cramps&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;

Functional impairment and residual pain can lead to social isolation.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt; Cancer support groups are valuable resources to learn about the syndrome and therapeutic options, and are a means to voice emotions related to having cancer and surviving it.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

==Outcomes==
With increasing cancer treatment survival rates, the quality of life for its survivors has become a public health priority.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;  The effects of RILP can be debilitating.  With no effective treatment to control radiation damage's progressive nature, limb dysfunction is the likely result.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;

Radiation damage's outcome is related to its initial onset time.
* Acute symptoms, occurring in the first few days, have the most favorable outcomes, likely diminishing within a few weeks.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref21"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patchell|first1=Roy A.|title=Damage to the Nervous System Due to Radiation Therapy|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/tumors-of-the-nervous-system/damage-to-the-nervous-system-due-to-radiation-therapy|website=www.merckmanuals.com|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early-delayed symptoms, occurring within the first months, typically include [[Myelopathy#Presentation|myelopathy]]. These issues frequently resolve without treatment.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref21" /&gt;
* Late-delayed symptoms, occurring several months or years after treatment, may also include myelopathy, but its severity level is more likely to worsen, resulting in permanent paralysis.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref21" /&gt;  Significant neurologic morbidity is typical, with a very slow neurologic recovery.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref8" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
An exact occurrence rate has  not  been established.  Literature  on  the topic  is  sparse.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref17"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasiƒá|first1=Ljiljana| title=Radiation-induced peripheral neuropathies: etiopathogenesis, risk factors, differential diagnostics, symptoms and treatment| journal=Archive of Oncolology|date=2007|volume=15|issue=3-4|pages=81‚Äì84| doi=10.2298/AOO0704081V| url=http://www.onk.ns.ac.rs/Archive/Vol15/PDFVol15/v15n34p81.pdf}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical occurrences of RILP are rare, affecting between 0.3-1.3% of those treated with abdominal or pelvic radiation.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref1" /&gt; The incidence rate is  variable, dependent upon the irradiated zone, dosage level and method of delivery. For example when alternate dosing levels were compared, higher rates were observed, from 12 to 23%, the higher RILP rates occurring with higher dosages.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref17" /&gt;

==History==
As of 1977 cases of lumbosacral neuropathy arising from [[radiation therapy]] had been rarely reported; one of the earliest cases was from 1948.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid:597799"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ashenhurst EM, Quartey G, Starreveld A| year = 1977 | title= Lumbo-Sacral Radiculopathy Induced by Radiation| journal= The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences | volume=4|issue=4| pages=259‚Äì63| pmid = 597799| doi= 10.1017/S0317167100025087}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid:18895006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Greenfield MM, Stark FM | year = 1948 | title= Post-irradiation neuropathy| journal=The American Journal of Roentgenology and Radium Therapy | volume=60|issue=5|pages=617‚Äì22| pmid = 18895006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy has been demonstrated to decrease when lower therapeutic radiation dosing levels are used.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;  [[Plexopathy|Radiation-induced Brachial Plexopathy (RIBP)]] may occur secondary to breast radiation therapy.&lt;ref name="pmid:23661957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khadilkar|first1=S V|last2=Khade|first2=S S|title=Brachial plexopathy|journal=Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology|date=January 2013|volume=16 |issue=1| pages=12‚Äì18|doi=10.4103/0972-2327.107675|pmid=23661957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies on RIBP have observed the [[Brachial plexus|brachial plexus']] radiosensitivity.  Injury was observed after dosages of 40 Gy in 20 fractions and RIBP significantly increased with doses greater than 2 Gy per fraction.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref17" /&gt;  RIBP is more common than lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pradat|first1=PF| last2=Delanian|first2=S|title=Late radiation injury to peripheral nerves.|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2013| volume=115| pages=743‚Äì58| doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52902-2.00043-6| pmid=23931813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a clinical history with reduced dosing levels.  RIBP occurrence rates were in the 60% range in the 1960s when 60 Gray treatments were applied in 5 Gray [[Dose fractionation|fractions]]; RIBP occurrences in the 2010s approach 1% with 50 Gray treatments applied in 3 Gy fractions.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref3" /&gt;

RILP occurrence rates are estimated at 0.3% to 1.3%, though the actual rate is likely higher. The soft tissue damage leading to RILP is more commonly seen with exposure levels over 50 Gy, though has occurred with as little as 30 Gy.&lt;ref name="pmid:29489193"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buboltz|first1=Jerome B|last2=Cooper|first2=Jeffrey S|title=Hyperbaric, Soft Tissue Radionecrosis |date=January 25, 2018 |publisher=StatPearls Publishing|location=Treasure Island, FL| page=Introduction | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482261/| pmid=29489193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major step toward reducing RILP occurrences is by limiting the lumbosacral plexus' dosing level when treating pelvic malignancies, limiting the mean dose to &lt; 45 Gy.  One approach to reduced levels, the plexus' mapping  with other [[Organs at Risk|organs at risk]], was clinically evaluated during the 2010s.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref10" /&gt;

Clinical evidence of the cause-and-effect of prevention and the management of radiation induced polyneuropathy is limited.&lt;ref name="RILP-Ref4" /&gt;

In 2011 the National Radiation Oncology Registry (NROR) was announced by the Radiation Oncology Institute (ROI). ROI and Massachusetts General Hospital would collect efficacy and side effect information (like radiation induced neuropathy) from people who had undergone radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palta|first1=JR|last2=Efstathiou|first2=JA| last3=Bekelman|first3=JE|last4=Mutic| first4=S|last5=Bogardus|first5=CR|last6=McNutt| first6=TR|last7=Gabriel| first7=PE|last8=Lawton|first8=CA|last9=Zietman|first9=AL|last10=Rose|first10=CM|title=Developing a national radiation oncology registry: From acorns to oaks.|journal=Practical radiation oncology|date=2012|volume=2|issue=1| pages=10‚Äì7|doi=10.1016/j.prro.2011.06.002|pmid=24674031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the American Society for Radiation Oncology joined the effort.&lt;ref name="pmid:23942508"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Efstathiou JA, Nassif DS, McNutt TR, Bogardus CB, Bosch W, Carlin J, Chen RC, Chou H, Eggert D, Fraass BA, Goldwein J, Hoffman KE, Hotz K, Hunt M, Kessler M, Lawton CA, Mayo C, Michalski JM, Mutic S, Potters L, Rose CM, Sandler HM, Sharp G, Tom√© W, Tran PT, Wall T, Zietman AL, Gabriel PE, Bekelman JE | year = 2013 | title= Practice-based evidence to evidence-based practice: building the National Radiation Oncology Registry | journal=Journal of Oncology Practice| volume=9|issue=3| pages = e90‚Äì5| pmid = 23942508 | pmc = 3651578 | doi=10.1200/JOP.2013.001003|display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">'''Ragnar Berg''' (1873-1956) was a Swedish-born [[biochemist]] and [[nutritionist]] who worked most of his adult life in Germany. He is best known for promoting the importance of acid-base balance and inorganic minerals like calcium in the diet; later in life he endorsed vegetarianism and ways to prolong the human life span. He also invented the alkaline dietary supplement Basica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basica.de/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719034535/http://www.basica.de/en |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Volkmar Klopfer manufactured and marketed from 1925.

==Life==
Ragnar Berg was the son of the respected Swedish historian and archaeologist [[Wilhelm Berg]] (1839-1915) and his first wife, Ulrika Charlotta Emerentia "Emy" Gumaelius (1846-1902). He married Ella Buscher in 1902, and they had two sons, Gunnar Wilhelm Emil (1907-1974) and Alf Ragnar Wilhelm (1912-1994).&lt;ref&gt;Christian Rummel, "Ragnar Berg: Leben und Werk des schwedischen Ern√§hrungsforschers und Begr√ºnders der basischen Kost", Peter Land, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berg was recruited by [[Karl Lingner]] to the Dresden Center for Dental Hygiene (''Zentralstelle f√ºr Zahnhygiene'') in 1902, where he met dentist Carl R√∂se (1864‚Äì1947), his long-time experimental partner. From 1909 to 1921 Berg headed the physiology lab at the homeopathic sanatorium founded by [[Heinrich Lahmann]] at Weisser Hirsch near [[Dresden]],&lt;ref&gt;William Shurtleff, Akiko Aoyagi, ''History of Soybeans and Soyfoods in Africa (1857-2009): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook'', Soyinfo Center, 2009, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; researching [[vitamins]], [[trace elements]] and the [[metabolism]] of [[minerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Kirchfeld, Wade Boyle, ''Nature doctors: pioneers in naturopathic medicine'', Medicina Biol√≥gica, 1994, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; A fire damaged the laboratory at the end of December 1914.

In 1921, he was dismissed from Lahmann's Sanatorium, since business had dried up during World War One, and its new directors wanted to focus on the more lucrative fields of psychoanalysis and gynecology. Berg, personally stung, felt that "the directors did not value his scientific approach to nutrition."&lt;ref&gt;David F. Smith, Jim Phillips, ''Food, science, policy and regulation in the twentieth century: international and comparative perspectives'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued conducting experiments on himself and analyzing foodstuffs from a home laboratory. From 1927 to 1932, he headed his own nutrition department at the Dresden-Friedrichstadt Hospital; in 1934 he was invited to the "Rudolf Hess Hospital in Dresden-Johannstadt.&lt;ref&gt;Eike Reichardt, ''Health, 'Race' and Empire: Popular-Scientific Spectacles and National Identity in Imperial Germany, 1871-1914'', 2008, pp.126-7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his funding ran out two years later. Only during the 1940s was he able to get federal funds for his "war-related" work.

In March 1945, Berg and his wife, Ella, fled bombed-out Dresden for Berlin and then to Stockholm, Sweden. (Neither their house nor his lab in the hospital had been damaged, however.) They lived in his native Sweden until her death from a heart attack at the end of 1954. Berg was very lonely, his health deteriorated, and he spent many months in the hospital before moving to his son's home north of Hamburg, where he died a few months later of old age and metastatic prostate cancer. He was nearly blind by this time.

==Theories==
Berg and R√∂se developed a theory of acid-base balance in the body that is affected by diet.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ann Ehrenberger, "The Politics of the Table: Nutrition and the Telescopic Body in Saxon Germany, 1890-1935," (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: Dissertation 2014), https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/49722.&lt;/ref&gt; They relied on the work of [[Ernst Leopold Salkowski]], who published results in the 1870s that suggested inorganic acids could only be excreted by the kidneys if neutralized by inorganic bases. If the acids remained in the body, they would accumulate in areas of low blood flow (like joints), thereby obstructing normal physiological function. The model disease was [[gout]], but Berg traced many other "diseases of civilization" to acid-base imbalance, including obesity, arthritis, and diabetes.

Because the body produces more acids than bases, concluded Berg, the best source of bases was the diet. If the diet was too acidic, then the body would break down proteins for the ammonia. This prevented the body from getting the full caloric and nitrogen value of the protein and produced abnormal intermediate metabolites. Moreover, a more basic diet reduced the need for protein. The following chart classifies foods according to Berg's theory and analyses.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Acidic foods !! Basic foods
|-
| meat, eggs, grains, bread, butter and other fats, beer, nuts, seeds || milk, potatoes, most fruits, most vegetables, coffee, tea, cocoa, soy
|}

When Berg made little headway among medical and scientific experts, after World War I he turned his attention to popularizing his theory directly. He was quite popular in the 1920s and 1930s, especially in alternative medicine and vegetarian circles. In the 1930s and 1940s, he teamed up with Are Waerland to promote vegetarianism and ways to prolong life.

[[File:Roccurves.png|thumb|right|ROC curve of three predictors of peptide cleaving in the [[proteasome]].]]
A '''receiver operating characteristic curve''', i.e., '''ROC curve''', is a [[graph of a function|graphical plot]] that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a [[binary classifier]] system as its discrimination threshold is varied. 

The ROC curve is created by plotting the [[true positive rate]] (TPR) against the [[false positive rate]] (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]], [[Precision and recall#Definition (classification context)|recall]] or ''probability of detection''&lt;ref name=matlab&gt;{{cite web|title=Detector Performance Analysis Using ROC Curves - MATLAB &amp; Simulink Example|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/examples/detector-performance-analysis-using-roc-curves.html|website=www.mathworks.com|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[machine learning]]. The false-positive rate is also known as the [[Information retrieval#Fall-out|fall-out]] or ''probability of false alarm''&lt;ref name=matlab/&gt; and can be calculated as (1 ‚àí [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]). It can also be thought of as a plot of the [[Statistical power|Power]] as a function of the [[Type I Error]] of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of [[Information retrieval#Fall-out|fall-out]]. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the [[cumulative distribution function]] (area under the probability distribution from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.

ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic [[decision making]].

The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to [[psychology]] to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in [[medicine]], [[radiology]], [[biometrics]], [[forecasting]] of [[natural hazard]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peres|first=D.

The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.&lt;ref name="Swets1996"&gt;Swets, John A.; [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91082370 ''Signal detection theory and ROC analysis in psychology and diagnostics : collected papers''], Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept==

{{See also|Type I and type II errors|Sensitivity and specificity}}
A classification model ([[Classifier (mathematics)|classifier]] or [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]) is a [[Mapping (mathematics)|mapping]] of instances between certain classes/groups. The classifier or diagnosis result can be a [[Real number|real value]] (continuous output), in which case the classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has [[hypertension]] based on a [[blood pressure]] measure). Or it can be a [[Countable set|discrete]] class label, indicating one of the classes.

Let us consider a two-class prediction problem ([[binary classification]]), in which the outcomes are labeled either as positive (''p'') or negative (''n''). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is ''p'' and the actual value is also ''p'', then it is called a ''true positive'' (TP); however if the actual value is ''n'' then it is said to be a ''false positive'' (FP). Conversely, a ''true negative'' (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are ''n'', and ''false negative'' (FN) is when the prediction outcome is ''n'' while the actual value is ''p''.

To get an appropriate example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test that seeks to determine whether a person has a certain disease. A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually have the disease. A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease.

Let us define an experiment from '''P''' positive instances and '''N''' negative instances for some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2√ó2 ''[[contingency table]]'' or ''[[confusion matrix]]'', as follows:

==ROC space==
[[Image:ROC space-2.png|thumb|right|250px|The ROC space and plots of the four prediction examples.]]
The contingency table can derive several evaluation "metrics" (see infobox). To draw an ROC curve, only the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are needed (as functions of some classifier parameter). The TPR defines how many correct positive results occur among all positive samples available during the test. FPR, on the other hand, defines how many incorrect positive results occur among all negative samples available during the test.

An ROC space is defined by FPR and TPR as ''x'' and ''y'' axes, respectively, which depicts relative trade-offs between true positive (benefits) and false positive (costs). Since TPR is equivalent to sensitivity and FPR is equal to 1 ‚àí specificity, the ROC graph is sometimes called the sensitivity vs (1 ‚àí specificity) plot. Each prediction result or instance of a [[confusion matrix]] represents one point in the ROC space.

The best possible prediction method would yield a point in the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a ''perfect classification''. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called ''line of no-discrimination'') from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative [[base rate]]s). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point tends towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will tend to the point (0.5, 0.5).

The diagonal divides the ROC space. Points above the diagonal represent good classification results (better than random); points below the line represent bad results (worse than random). Note that the output of a consistently bad predictor could simply be inverted to obtain a good predictor.

Let us look into four prediction results from 100 positive and 100 negative instances:

|}

Plots of the four results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method '''A''' clearly shows the best predictive power among '''A''', '''B''', and '''C'''. The result of '''B''' lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), and it can be seen in the table that the accuracy of '''B''' is 50%. However, when '''C''' is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method '''C‚Ä≤''' is even better than '''A'''. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the '''C''' contingency table. Although the original '''C''' method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method '''C‚Ä≤''' which has positive predictive power. When the '''C''' method predicts '''p''' or '''n''', the '''C‚Ä≤''' method would predict '''n''' or '''p''', respectively. In this manner, the '''C‚Ä≤''' test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.

==Curves in ROC space==
[[File:ROC curves.svg|thumb|right|300px]]
In binary classification, the class prediction for each instance is often made based on a [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous random variable]] &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, which is a "score" computed for the instance (e.g. the estimated probability in logistic regression). Given a threshold parameter &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;, the instance is classified as "positive" if &lt;math&gt; X&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;, and "negative" otherwise. &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; follows a probability density &lt;math&gt; f_1 (x) &lt;/math&gt; if the instance actually belongs to class "positive", and &lt;math&gt; f_0 (x) &lt;/math&gt; if otherwise. Therefore, the true positive rate is given by &lt;math&gt; \mbox{TPR}(T)= \int_{T}^\infty f_1(x) \, dx &lt;/math&gt; and the false positive rate is given by &lt;math&gt; \mbox{FPR}(T)= \int_{T}^\infty f_0(x) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;. 
The ROC curve plots parametrically TPR(T) versus FPR(T) with T as the varying parameter.

For example, imagine that the blood protein levels in diseased people and healthy people are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with means of 2 [[gram|g]]/[[decilitre|dL]] and 1 g/dL respectively. A medical test might measure the level of a certain protein in a blood sample and classify any number above a certain threshold as indicating disease. The experimenter can adjust the threshold (black vertical line in the figure), which will in turn change the false positive rate. Increasing the threshold would result in fewer false positives (and more false negatives), corresponding to a leftward movement on the curve. The actual shape of the curve is determined by how much overlap the two distributions have.  These concepts are demonstrated in the [https://kennis-research.shinyapps.io/ROC-Curves/ Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves Applet.]

==Further interpretations==

Sometimes, the ROC is used to generate a summary statistic. Common versions are:
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the line at 45 degrees orthogonal to the no-discrimination line - the balance point where [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] = 1 - [[Specificity (statistics)|Specificity]] 
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the tangent at 45 degrees parallel to the no-discrimination line that is closest to the error-free point (0,1) - also called [[Youden's J statistic]] and generalized as Informedness&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;
* the area between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line multiplied by two - [[Gini Coefficient]]
* the area between the full ROC curve and the triangular ROC curve including only (0,0), (1,1) and one selected operating point (tpr,fpr) - Consistency&lt;ref name="Powers2012a"&gt;{{cite conference |title=ROC-ConCert: ROC-Based Measurement of Consistency and Certainty|first=David MW |last=Powers|year=2012|booktitle=Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology (SCET)|volume=2|pages=238‚Äì241|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the area under the ROC curve, or "AUC" ("Area Under Curve"), or A' (pronounced "a-prime"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=James |last1=Fogarty |first2=Ryan S. |last2=Baker |first3=Scott E. |last3=Hudson |year=2005 |title=Case studies in the use of ROC curve analysis for sensor-based estimates in human computer interaction |booktitle=ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Proceedings of Graphics Interface 2005 |publisher=Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society |location=Waterloo, ON |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1089530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "c-statistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Trevor |last1=Hastie|authorlink1=Trevor Hastie|first2=Robert |last2=Tibshirani |authorlink2=Robert Tibshirani|first3=Jerome H. |last3=Friedman |year=2009 |title=The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[sensitivity index|sensitivity index ''d''']] (pronounced "d-prime"), the distance between the mean of the distribution of activity in the system under noise-alone conditions and its distribution under signal-alone conditions, divided by their [[standard deviation]], under the assumption that both these distributions are [[normal distribution|normal]] with the same standard deviation. Under these assumptions, the shape of the ROC is entirely determined by ''d'''.

However, any attempt to summarize the ROC curve into a single number loses information about the pattern of tradeoffs of the particular discriminator algorithm.

===Area under the curve===
When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Tom (2006); ''An introduction to ROC analysis'', Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 861‚Äì874.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as follows: the area under the curve is given by (the integral boundaries are reversed as large T has
a lower value on the x-axis)
:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_{\infty}^{-\infty} \mbox{TPR}(T) \mbox{FPR}'(T) \, dT = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} I(T'&gt;T)f_1(T') f_0(T) \, dT' \, dT = P(X_1 &gt; X_0) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the score for a positive instance and &lt;math&gt; X_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the score for a negative instance, and &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; are probability densities as defined in previous section.

It can further be shown that the AUC is closely related to the [[Mann‚ÄìWhitney U]],&lt;ref name="Hanley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=James A. |last2=McNeil |first2=Barbara J. |journal=Radiology |number=1 |pages=29‚Äì36 |title=The Meaning and Use of the Area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve |volume=143 |year=1982 |pmid=7063747 |doi=10.1148/radiology.143.1.7063747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=Simon J. |last2=Graham |first2=Nicholas E. |year=2002 |title=Areas beneath the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and relative operating levels (ROL) curves: Statistical significance and interpretation |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=128 |pages=2145‚Äì2166 |url=http://www.inmet.gov.br/documentos/cursoI_INMET_IRI/Climate_Information_Course/References/Mason+Graham_2002.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120134338/http://www.inmet.gov.br/documentos/cursoI_INMET_IRI/Climate_Information_Course/References/Mason%2BGraham_2002.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-20 |doi=10.1256/003590002320603584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which tests whether positives are ranked higher than negatives. It is also equivalent to the [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test|Wilcoxon test of ranks]].&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; The AUC is related to the [[Gini coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;) by the formula &lt;math&gt;G_1 = 2 \mbox{AUC} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where:

:&lt;math&gt;G_1 = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^n (X_{k} - X_{k-1}) (Y_k + Y_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hand, David J.; and Till, Robert J. (2001); ''A simple generalization of the area under the ROC curve for multiple class classification problems'', Machine Learning, 45, 171‚Äì186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, it is possible to calculate the AUC by using an average of a number of trapezoidal approximations.

It is also common to calculate the Area Under the ROC Convex Hull (ROC AUCH = ROCH AUC) as any point on the line segment between two prediction results can be achieved by randomly using one or other system with probabilities proportional to the relative length of the opposite component of the segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=F. |last1=Provost |first2=T. |last2=Fawcett |title=Robust classification for imprecise environments. |journal=Machine Learning |volume=42 |pages=203‚Äì231 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/a:1007601015854 |arxiv=cs/0009007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to invert concavities ‚Äì just as in the figure the worse solution can be reflected to become a better solution; concavities can be reflected in any line segment, but this more extreme form of fusion is much more likely to overfit the data.&lt;ref name="FlachWu2005"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=P.A. |last1=Flach |first2=S. |last2=Wu |year=2005 |title= Repairing concavities in ROC curves. |booktitle= 19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'05) |pages= 702‚Äì707 |url=http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/385_icmlpaper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[machine learning]] community most often uses the ROC AUC statistic for model comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |issue=3 |pages=839‚Äì843 |last1=Hanley |first1=James A.| last2=McNeil |first2=Barbara J. |title=A method of comparing the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves derived from the same cases |journal=Radiology |accessdate=2008-12-03 |date=1983-09-01 |volume=148 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/abstract/148/3/839 |pmid=6878708 |doi=10.1148/radiology.148.3.6878708}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has recently been questioned because AUC estimates are quite noisy and suffers from other problemns.&lt;ref name="Hanczar2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanczar | first1 = Blaise | last2 = Hua | first2 = Jianping | last3 = Sima | first3 = Chao | last4 = Weinstein | first4 = John | last5 = Bittner | first5 = Michael | last6 = Dougherty | first6 = Edward R | year = 2010 | title = Small-sample precision of ROC-related estimates | url = | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 822‚Äì830 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq037}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Lobo2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lobo | first1 = Jorge M. | last2 = Jim√©nez-Valverde | first2 = Alberto | last3 = Real | first3 = Raimundo | year = 2008 | title = AUC: a misleading measure of the performance of predictive distribution models | url = | journal = Global Ecology and Biogeography | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 145‚Äì151 | doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hand2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hand | first1 = David J | year = 2009 | title = Measuring classifier performance: A coherent alternative to the area under the ROC curve | url = | journal = Machine Learning | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 103‚Äì123 | doi=10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nonetheless, the coherence of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance has been vindicated, in terms of a uniform rate distribution,&lt;ref name="Flachetal2011"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=P.A. |last1=Flach |first2=J. |last2=Hernandez-Orallo | first3=C. | last3=Ferri |year=2011 |title=A coherent interpretation of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance. |booktitle=Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-11) |pages=657‚Äì664|url=http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/385_icmlpaper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AUC has been linked to a number of other performance metrics such as the [[Brier score]].&lt;ref name="hernandez2012unified "&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1= Hernandez-Orallo| first2=P.A.| last2=Flach | first3=C. | last3=Ferri |year=2012 |title=A unified view of performance metrics: translating threshold choice into expected classification loss|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=13 |pages=2813‚Äì2869 |url=http://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/hernandez-orallo12a/hernandez-orallo12a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with ROC AUC is that reducing the ROC Curve to a single number ignores the fact that it is about the tradeoffs between the different systems or performance points plotted and not the performance of an individual system, as well as ignoring the possibility of concavity repair, so that related alternative measures such as Informedness&lt;ref name="Powers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=David M W|year=2011|origyear=2007|title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Measure  to ROC, Informedness, Markedness &amp; Correlation|url=http://www.bioinfopublication.org/files/articles/2_1_1_JMLT.pdf|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies|volume=2|issue=1|pages=37‚Äì63}} [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27743223/201101-Evaluation_JMLT_Postprint-Colour.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or DeltaP are recommended.&lt;ref name="Powers2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers2012b"&gt;{{cite conference |first=David M.W. |last=Powers |title=The Problem of Area Under the Curve |booktitle=International Conference on Information Science and Technology |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are essentially equivalent to the Gini for a single prediction point with DeltaP' = Informedness = 2AUC-1, whilst DeltaP = Markedness represents the dual (viz. predicting the prediction from the real class) and their geometric mean is the [[Matthews correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;

Whereas ROC AUC varies between 0 and 1 ‚Äî with an uninformative classifier yielding 0.5 ‚Äî the alternative measures known as [[Informedness]]&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;, Certainty &lt;ref name="Powers2012a"/&gt; and [[Gini Coefficient]] (in the single parameterization or single system case)&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt; all have the advantage that 0 represents chance performance whilst 1 represents perfect performance, and ‚àí1 represents the "perverse" case of full informedness always giving the wrong response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=David M.

Sometimes it can be more useful to look at a specific region of the ROC Curve rather than at the whole curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0272989X8900900307 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=190‚Äì195 |last=McClish |first=Donna Katzman |title=Analyzing a Portion of the ROC Curve |journal=Medical Decision Making |accessdate=2008-09-29 |date=1989-08-01 |url=http://mdm.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/190 |pmid=2668680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1541-0420.00071 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=614‚Äì623 |last1=Dodd |first1=Lori E. | first2=Margaret S. |last2=Pepe |title=Partial AUC Estimation and Regression |journal=Biometrics |accessdate=2007-12-18 |year=2003 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-0420.00071 |pmid=14601762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common approach for classification problems in which P ‚â™ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.&lt;ref&gt;Karplus, Kevin (2011); [http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/papers/better-than-chance-sep-07.pdf ''Better than Chance: the importance of null models''], University of California, Santa Cruz, in Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Proteomics, Structural Biology and Bioinformatics (PR PS BB 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===
The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) also characterizes diagnostic ability while revealing more information than the ROC. For each threshold, ROC reveals two ratios, TP/(TP + FN) and FP/(FP + TN). In other words, ROC reveals hits/(hits + misses)and false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections). On the other hand, TOC shows the total information in the contingency table for each threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Parmentier|first2=Benoit|title=Recommendations for using the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC)|journal=Landscape Ecology|date=2014|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold. TOC also provides the popular AUC of the ROC. 
[[File:TOC.png|thumb|left|TOC Curve]]
[[File:ROC.png|thumb|left|ROC Curve]]
These figures are the TOC and ROC curves using the same data and thresholds.
Consider the point that corresponds to a threshold of 74. The TOC curve shows the number of hits, which is 3, and hence the number of misses, which is 7. Additionally, the TOC curve shows that the number of false alarms is 4 and the number of correct rejections is 16. At any given point in the ROC curve, it is possible to glean values for the ratios of false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections) and hits/(hits + misses). For example, at threshold 74, it is evident that the x coordinate is 0.3 and the y coordinate is 0.2. However, these two values are insufficient to construct all entries of the underlying two-by-two contingency table.

==Detection error tradeoff graph==
[[File:Example of DET curves.png|thumb|Example DET graph]]
An alternative to the ROC curve is the [[detection error tradeoff]] (DET) graph, which plots the false negative rate (missed detections) vs. the false positive rate (false alarms) on non-linearly transformed x- and y-axes. The transformation function is the quantile function of the normal distribution, i.e., the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution. It is, in fact, the same transformation as zROC, below, except that the complement of the hit rate, the miss rate or false negative rate, is used. This alternative spends more graph area on the region of interest. Most of the ROC area is of little interest; one primarily cares about the region tight against the y-axis and the top left corner ‚Äì which, because of using miss rate instead of its complement, the hit rate, is the lower left corner in a DET plot. Furthermore, DET graphs have the useful property of linearity and a linear threshold behavior for normal distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Navractil|first=J.|last2=Klusacek|first2=D.|date=2007-04-01|title=On Linear DETs|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4218079/|journal=2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07|volume=4|pages=IV‚Äì229-IV-232|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.2007.367205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DET plot is used extensively in the automatic speaker recognition community, where the name DET was first used. The analysis of the ROC performance in graphs with this warping of the axes was used by psychologists in perception studies halfway through the 20th century, where this was dubbed "double probability paper".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Z-score==

If a [[standard score]] is applied to the ROC curve, the curve will be transformed into a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Neil A. |last1=MacMillan |first2=C. Douglas |last2=Creelman |edition=2nd |year=2005 |title=Detection Theory: A User's Guide |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, NJ | isbn=1-4106-1114-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This z-score is based on a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In memory [[strength theory]], one must assume that the zROC is not only linear, but has a slope of 1.0. The normal distributions of targets (studied objects that the subjects need to recall) and lures (non studied objects that the subjects attempt to recall) is the factor causing the zROC to be linear.

The linearity of the zROC curve depends on the standard deviations of the target and lure strength distributions. If the standard deviations are equal, the slope will be 1.0. If the standard deviation of the target strength distribution is larger than the standard deviation of the lure strength distribution, then the slope will be smaller than 1.0. In most studies, it has been found that the zROC curve slopes constantly fall below 1, usually between 0.5 and 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glanzer |first=Murray |first2=Kim |last2=Kisok |last3=Hilford |first3=Andy |last4=Adams |first4=John K. |title=Slope of the receiver-operating characteristic in recognition memory |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |year=1999 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=500‚Äì513 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.2.500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments yielded a zROC slope of 0.8. A slope of 0.8 implies that the variability of the target strength distribution is 25% larger than the variability of the lure strength distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratcliff |first1=Roger |last2=McCoon |first2=Gail |last3=Tindall |first3=Michael |title=Empirical generality of data from recognition memory ROC functions and implications for GMMs |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |year=1994 |volume=20 |pages=763‚Äì785 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variable used is&amp;nbsp;[[D prime|''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (d prime)]] (discussed above in "Other measures"), which can easily be expressed in terms of z-values. Although ''d''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a commonly used parameter, it must be recognized that it is only relevant when strictly adhering to the very strong assumptions of strength theory made above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jun |last2=Mueller |first2=Shane T. |title=A note on ROC analysis and non-parametric estimate of sensitivity |journal=Psychometrika |year=2005 |volume=70 |issue=|doi=10.1007/s11336-003-1119-8 |pages=203‚Äì212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The z-score of an ROC curve is always linear, as assumed, except in special situations. The Yonelinas familiarity-recollection model is a two-dimensional account of recognition memory. Instead of the subject simply answering yes or no to a specific input, the subject gives the input a feeling of familiarity, which operates like the original ROC curve. What changes, though, is a parameter for Recollection (R). Recollection is assumed to be all-or-none, and it trumps familiarity. If there were no recollection component, zROC would have a predicted slope of 1. However, when adding the recollection component, the zROC curve will be concave up, with a decreased slope. This difference in shape and slope result from an added element of variability due to some items being recollected. Patients with anterograde amnesia are unable to recollect, so their Yonelinas zROC curve would have a slope close to 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonelinas |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kroll |first2=Neal E. A. |last3=Dobbins |first3=Ian G. |last4=Lazzara |first4=Michele |last5=Knight |first5=Robert T. |title=Recollection and familiarity deficits in amnesia: Convergence of remember-know, process dissociation, and receiver operating characteristic data |journal=Neuropsychology |year=1998 |volume=12 |pages=323‚Äì339 |doi=10.1037/0894-4105.12.3.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ROC curve was first used during [[World War II]] for the analysis of [[radar|radar signals]] before it was employed in [[signal detection theory]].&lt;ref name="green66"&gt;{{cite book |first1=David M. |last1=Green |first2=John A. |last2=Swets |title=Signal detection theory and psychophysics |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc. |year=1966 |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-471-32420-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States army began new research to increase the prediction of correctly detected Japanese aircraft from their radar signals. For these purposes they measured the ability of a radar receiver operator to make these important distinctions, which was called the Receiver Operating Characteristic.&lt;ref name="roc etymology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~gamez/files/ROC-Curves.pdf |title=Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to analyze a classification model: A final note of historical interest |last= |first= |publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah |date= |website=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah |access-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, ROC curves were employed in [[psychophysics]] to assess human (and occasionally non-human animal) detection of weak signals.&lt;ref name="green66" /&gt; In [[medicine]], ROC analysis has been extensively used in the evaluation of [[diagnostic test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mark H. |last1=Zweig |first2=Gregory |last2=Campbell |journal=Clinical Chemistry |pmid=8472349 |title=Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots: a fundamental evaluation tool in clinical medicine |volume=39 |issue=8 |year=1993 |pages=561‚Äì577 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/39/4/561.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Margaret S. |last=Pepe |title=The statistical evaluation of medical tests for classification and prediction |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-856582-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ROC curves are also used extensively in [[epidemiology]] and [[medical research]] and are frequently mentioned in conjunction with [[evidence-based medicine]]. In [[radiology]], ROC analysis is a common technique to evaluate new radiology techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nancy A. |last=Obuchowski |title=Receiver operating characteristic curves and their use in radiology |pmid=14519861 |journal=Radiology |volume=229 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=3‚Äì8 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2291010898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social sciences, ROC analysis is often called the ROC Accuracy Ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models.
ROC curves are widely used in laboratory medicine to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a test, to choose the optimal cut-off of a test and to compare diagnostic accuracy of several tests.

ROC curves also proved useful for the evaluation of [[machine learning]] techniques. The first application of ROC in machine learning was by Spackman who demonstrated the value of ROC curves in comparing and evaluating different classification [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Spackman |first=Kent A. |year=1989 |title=Signal detection theory: Valuable tools for evaluating inductive learning |booktitle=Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Machine Learning |location=San Mateo, CA |pages=160‚Äì163 |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROC curves are also used in verification of forecasts in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |first=Viatcheslav |last=Kharin| title=On the ROC score of probability forecasts| journal=Journal of Climate| volume=16|number=24|  pages=4145-4150|year=2003|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;4145:OTRSOP&gt;2.0.CO;2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ROC curves beyond binary classification==
The extension of ROC curves for classification problems with more than two classes has always been cumbersome, as the degrees of freedom increase quadratically with the number of classes, and the ROC space has &lt;math&gt;c(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of classes.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan99"&gt;{{cite conference |first=A.|last=Srinivasan|year=1999 |title=Note on the Location of Optimal Classifiers in N-dimensional ROC Space|booktitle=Technical Report PRG-TR-2-99, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approaches have been made for the particular case with three classes (three-way ROC).&lt;ref name="Mossman99"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.| last= Mossman |year=1999 |title=Three-way ROCs |journal=Medical Decision Making |volume=19 |pages=78‚Äì89 |doi=10.1177/0272989x9901900110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of the volume under the ROC surface (VUS) has been analyzed and studied as a performance metric for multi-class problems.&lt;ref name="Ferri03"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=C. | last1=Ferri |first2=J.|last2=Hernandez-Orallo | first3=M.A.| last3=Salido |year=2003 |title=Volume under the ROC Surface for Multi-class Problems|booktitle=Machine Learning: ECML 2003|pages=108‚Äì120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the complexity of approximating the true VUS, some other approaches &lt;ref name="HandTill01"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D.J.| last1= Till| first2=R.J.| last2=Hand |year=2001 |title=A Simple Generalisation of the Area Under the ROC Curve for Multiple Class Classification Problems|journal=Machine Learning|volume=45|pages=171‚Äì186 | doi=10.1023/A:1010920819831}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an extension of AUC are more popular as an evaluation metric.

Given the success of ROC curves for the assessment of classification models, the extension of ROC curves for other supervised tasks has also been investigated. Notable proposals for regression problems are the so-called regression error characteristic (REC) Curves &lt;ref name="bij2003regression"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=J.|last1=Bi | first2=K.P.| last2=Bennett |year=2003 |title=Regression error characteristic curves |booktitle=Twentieth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-2003). Washington, DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Regression ROC (RROC) curves.&lt;ref name="hernandez2013rroc "&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.| last= Hernandez-Orallo |year=2013 |title=ROC curves for regression|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=46 |issue=12|pages=3395‚Äì3411 . |doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2013.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, RROC curves become extremely similar to ROC curves for classification, with the notions of asymmetry, dominance and convex hull. Also, the area under RROC curves is proportional to the error variance of the regression model.

'''Rice burner''' is a [[pejorative]], used as early as the 1960s, originally describing Japanese motorcycles,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 17 November 1966 pp.674-675 ''You Say This. "Won't last. ...Many a rice burner will be clapped out within four or five years, but the Tiger 90 would last about 12 years. Paul Ayres, Woking, Surrey''". Accessed 4 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 1 December 1966 pp.740-742 ''You Say This. "Challenge on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6022">'''Richard Plain''' (born 1939 or 1940) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] politician.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=b0beb45e-a70c-44ae-a8db-7492afedcbd6&amp;sponsor=&lt;/ref&gt; Plain is the former [[mayor]] of [[St. Albert, Alberta]], having served from 1974 to 1977 and again from 2001 to 2004.  In February 2007, he announced that he would seek a third term as mayor in the 2007 election.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.stalbertgazette.com/news/2007/0228/top2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By profession, Plain is a [[Health economics|health economist]]; he retired from the [[University of Alberta]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/economics/pdfs/newsletter2001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In this capacity, he has been critical of several health care initiatives of the [[Alberta]] government headed by [[Ralph Klein]].  These have included Bill 11 (the 1997 government bill to expand the private sector's role in delivering publicly insured health services),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ab.ca/Quick+Links/Publications/ATA+News/Volume+34/Number+17/In+the+News/Majority+oppose+Bill+11.htm Alberta Teachers' Association - In the News - Majority oppose Bill 11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the 2002 report by former Canadian [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Don Mazankowski]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/print.cfm?id=1681 Critics wary of health care recommendations - ExpressNews - University of Alberta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the abortive "third way" plan to change the mix of public and private health care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=10504931-35e5-465a-b312-d83fc34c51be canada.com | Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain was elected mayor in 1974, defeating incumbent [[Ray Gibbon]] in an election that was fought primarily on issues of development, with Plain favouring stricter limits than Gibbons.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton Journal, 17 October 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  He was defeated three years later by [[Ronald Harvey (Alberta politician)|Ronald Harvey]].  Plain blamed his defeat on Harvey's friendship with then-[[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] [[Ernie Jamison]], who also owned the [[St. Albert Gazette]], and called his defeat "a plague on our house".&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton Journal, 20 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1979 and 1981, as chair of the St. Albert Citizens Committee, Plain led the fight against a proposal from [[Edmonton]] to annex St. Albert, which he called "one of the greatest things this community will ever see".&lt;ref&gt;St. Albert Gazette (1999).  St. Albert 1861-1999: Our Story, St. Albert: Gazette Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Plain, newly retired from academia, announced his intention to challenge incumbent mayor [[Paul Chalifoux]].  The ensuing election was fought largely on the issue of the [[Ray Gibbon Drive|West Regional Road]], with Chalifoux favouring the recently proposed [[Ray Gibbon Drive]] alignment.  Plain preferred the previously proposed alignment, which bypassed the developed portion of the city but crossed the [[Sturgeon River (Alberta)|Sturgeon River]] close to the mouth of [[Big Lake, Alberta|Big Lake]], and proposed a plebiscite on the subject.  An aggressive public relations campaign by the [[Riel Park Business Association]], which did not like the way the proposed road would pass through [[Riel Business Park]], and a group calling itself S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice, attacked the alignment.  Plain received the endorsement from S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice and he, along with the five aldermanic candidates the group endorsed, was elected.

Plain's second term as mayor was dominated by four issues.  Plain's favoured plebiscite on the road was rejected by a majority of Council in favour of proceeding immediately with the original alignment.  Plain quickly fell into step with this majority view, and was criticized for it by many citizens who continued to favour the rejected Ray Gibbon Drive alignment.  In addition, Plain opposed the agreement made by the Chalifoux Council to split tax revenues from land recently annexed from [[Sturgeon County]] with the County, claiming that St. Albert would require all of the tax revenues in order to service the land.  This position put him at odds with Sturgeon County mayor [[Lawrence Kluthe]], and a feud developed between the two.  Third, Plain oversaw preliminary plans for the development of the multi-purpose leisure centre that would eventually become [[Servus Credit Union Place]].  Fourth and finally, Plain's Council brought in a bylaw prohibiting smoking in all places of business, including those open only to adults.

Chalifoux ran again in 2004 and, in an election dominated by a bitter dispute over how to deal with Sturgeon County, narrowly defeated Plain.  Since his defeat, Plain has continued to comment publicly on issues including St. Albert's annexation of land from Sturgeon County&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stalbertgazette.com/news/2005/0119/top3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and municipal budgeting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://richard.plainhome.com/index.html Richard H. M. Plain (Phd Econ)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and has announced that he intends to run for mayor again in 2007.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Plain was named St. Albert's 1981 Citizen of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;St. Albert Historical Society (1985). The Black Robe's Vision, St. Albert: St. Albert Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SambhavnaEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.]]
[[File:Bhopal Sambhavna Trust 05 (14037592191).jpg|thumb|right|Sambhavna Trust]]
The '''Sambhavna Trust Clinic''', or '''Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic''', is a charitable trust run by a group of doctors, scientists, writers and social workers who have been involved with various aspects of the Union Carbide disaster ([[Bhopal disaster]]) in Bhopal, India, ever since its occurrence in December 1984.

The Clinic in Bhopal, run by the Sambhavna Trust and initiated by [[Satinath Sarangi]], opened its doors on 2 September 1996 as an independent, community based, non governmental medical initiative concerned with the long-term welfare of the survivors. It offers an innovative blend of modern and traditional therapies free of cost to the disaster affected victims.

==Meaning of Sambhavna==

Taken from a poster found at the Clinic's entrance: "Sambhavna is a Hindi word that literally means possibilities. If read as 'Sama' (equal) + 'Bhavna' (feelings), it means equal feelings or passion. [In this sense], we are characterizing both meanings of creating possibilities for the survivors of the world's worst industrial disaster."

==Location==

The Sambhavna Clinic is located in the middle of communities that were most severely affected by the Bhopal Disaster as it is 400 meters south of the former Union Carbide plant. The Clinic is also in proximity to communities affected by contamination of the ground water through chemical wastes. Built on a 2-acre plot, along with the complex, the Clinic contains an herbal garden for Aryuvedic Care. With the principles of environmental sustainability, the facilities incorporate rain water harvesting, solar panels for energy, waste water recycling, non-toxic construction material, and other eco-sensitive features.

==Patient profile==

Patients with a history of gas exposure from the disaster and those who have proved exposure to contaminated ground water are eligible for treatment at the Clinic free of charge. In addition, children born to gas affected parents before December 1986 are also registered for care at the Clinic since research conducted at Sambhavna has shown these children also exhibit symptoms of exposure related health problems. 
As of 2006, the Sambhavna Trust Clinic remains the only institution to provide free health care to gas affected victims. Furthermore, the Clinic is the only health care provider in Bhopal to have a special classification for those who are suffering from ongoing contamination of the ground water and provide care to these persons at no cost as well.

==Allopathic care==

Sambhavna's allopathic care team consists of general physicians, a pediatrician, a gynecologist, and a consultant in pathology. Their work is supported by an in-house pathology laboratory with facilities for biochemical, endocrinological, cytological, and microbiological investigation and diagnosis.

Careful records are kept of each patient's ailments, treatment, and outcome in detail for an investigatory database to establish the efficacy of different treatment protocols. These records are stored both in paper and pen format and an in-house electronic health record system on over 15 networked computers; this system is developed, programmed, and maintained by staff within the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.

==Ayurveda care==

In conjunction with allopathic treatment, the Sambhavna Clinic provides [[Ayurveda]] care: a Hindu system of traditional medicine native to India. Two Ayurveda physicians and two [[Panchakarma]] therapists provide treatment through herbal medicines and through procedures of detoxification such as medicated oil massage, steam bath, medicinal oil stream, and medicinal enema.

===Herbal medicine growth and production===

[[File:SambhavnaGarden.jpg|thumb|right|The lower area of the sloping herbal garden found at Sambhavna.]]More than 150 species of medicinal plants are grown on a 1-acre garden next to the Clinic building. Instead of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, Sambhavna utilizes [[vermicompost]] and bio pesticides for cultivation. More than eighty different kinds of Ayurvedic powders, oils, [[decoction]], and pills are manufactured at the medicine making unit in Sambhavna using tools such as a pulverizer, pill press, and granulator. Significant features of the Ayurvedic health care at Sambhavna include predominant use of herbal drugs over mineral preparations ([[Rasa Shastra]]) and use of modern investigative facilities and techniques for objective assessment of efficacy.

===Yoga===

[[Yoga]] therapy has been found to be particularly useful for treatment of common gas exposure related health problems including breathlessness, backache, joint pains, menstrual irregularities, anxiety, and insomnia. Some of the research efforts at Sambhavna focus on demonstrating the efficacy of yoga therapy in management of gas exposure symptoms. Four objective studies have been conducted on the positive effects of yoga therapy within the patient population at the Clinic.

==Community outreach==

Sambhavna community health workers fulfill many roles in the surrounding gas affected and water contaminated areas of Bhopal. First, the community health workers identify over a thousand patients in need of follow-up care at the Clinic each month and continue to visit these patients to monitor their health and adherence to treatment protocols.
 
Furthermore, they educate communities about common health issues and their treatments and preventions, run comprehensive TB, malaria, anemia control programs, and also organize community based screenings for cervical cancer. In addition, the health workers also collect data on various health markers in the communities they serve for research and health monitoring purposes (see Documentation and Research).
 
The community health workers also have formed voluntary health committees in different neighborhoods around Bhopal. To run these committees, the health workers have inspired, trained, and equipped health volunteers from each community to carry out some biochemical investigations of blood and urine and also prepare slides for examination for the malaria parasite. Starting in 2008, the health workers began to train people to grow and use various medicinal plants in their own neighborhoods. Six small but flourishing herbal gardens have been established in two communities.

==Documentation and research==

Sambhavna maintains what is probably the most comprehensive collection of original source material related to the Bhopal disaster. The Clinic's library materials include newspaper clippings from December 1984 onwards, medical and scientific research papers, legal transcripts, government publications, corporate documents, pamphlets and posters from local and international campaigns, as well as books on a variety of health related subjects. The library is frequently used by researchers, journalists, activists, survivors, and Sambhavna staff.

===Research===

Research on the health consequences of exposure to toxic gases was terminated in 1994 by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and much of their findings remain unpublished to date. With limited staff and financial resources, Sambhavna has made significant contributions to the understanding of long-term health consequences of the disaster and the medical interventions which are effective in ameliorating these problems.

Over 8000 families affected by the gas disaster and control families matched for socio-economic status are currently used to establish cohorts for further investigation of specific health problems. Over the course of the conducted research at Sambhavna, several studies have been published in national and international journals.

===Clinical data===

Since 1996, Sambhavna has registered over 23,000 chronically ill patients from affected communities. Data collected from the field and patient record system is electronically catalogued daily, providing important information to guide future research and provide better care to survivors. Currently, Sambhavna has a networked system of informed consent, registration, and follow-up with continual updates of clinical data.

==Organization and funding==
 
The Sambhavna Clinic is run by an 8-member board of trustees composed of scientists, doctors, editors, and activists who for many years have been involved with medical and other aspects of the disaster. A steering committee, elected by the staff, and two coordinators, look after the day-to-day running of the Clinic. Decision making, evaluation, planning, and review of clinic activities are based on equality, full participation, and consensus at the weekly staff meetings.
 
Sambhavna does not accept money from corporations, governments, or large funding agencies. All funds required to run the Sambhavna Trust Clinic come from individual donations and from the royalties of the book "It Was [[Five Past Midnight in Bhopal]]", by Dominique Lapierre and Javier Moro. A large portion of Sambhavna's funds come from over 15000 individuals in the UK who respond to advertisements placed by the Bhopal Medical Appeal in British newspapers. Contributions are from a variety of people from different backgrounds and socioeconomic levels. For example, the herbal medicine making facilities was built with funds donated by litter pickers at a music festival in the UK. Accounts of the Sambhavna Trust are audited annually and are open to public scrutiny.

==Volunteering==

[[File:SambhavnaDormitories.jpg|thumb|right|One of the dormitories for volunteers at the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.]]Each year, more than two dozen volunteers from India and abroad extend services to Sambhavna during their stay, ranging from one week to two months. Volunteers have come from Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, UK, USA, and other countries. These volunteers have offered a variety of services in their respective fields and applied their skills in medical work, social work, writing, research, gardening, photography, information systems, and more.

==No More Bhopal==

Taken from a pamphlet at the Sambhavna Clinic, the "No More Bhopal" effort is described as follows:
 
"Through its involvement with the gas affected communities and with the global community, Sambhavna is working to stop the medical disaster in Bhopal and to prevent such tragedies from happening again. We organize health camps and workshops in the communities. We work with survivors' organizations fighting for better healthcare, and build links with doctors and researchers in Bhopal and all over the world. So far, we have organized three local, one national, and two international conferences in Bhopal and participated in several."

As such, it can be applied to the attitude of a person based on his or her educational background, personal experience and psyche, or to the general position of collective entities like religious groups, institutions or states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Richard |date=2004 |title=(Re)constructing Cultures of Violence and Peace |url= https://books.google.fr/books?id=DiO2BgL0fJsC | location= |publisher=Rodopi  |page= 96 |isbn=9789042011496 |access-date= | quote = Sexophobia is the social and personal stigma associated with anything related to the physical and psychological aspects of sex and sexuality.

== Health ==

Sexophobia in clinical talk has an effect on the way patients speak to their doctors, as it manifests itself in the communication strategies that are employed to speak about private health problems.&lt;ref name="venereology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minichiello |first=V |last2=Browne |first2=J | year=1998 |title=Issues in clinical care of people being tested/treated for sexually transmissible infections |trans-title= |url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=559461629831610;res=IELAPA |language=English |journal=Venereology |volume=11 |issue=4 |page=27 |doi= |access-date=11 February 2017 |quote=Other researchers provide evidence of the impact of sexophobia on clinical talk through the identification of the strategies which are used to deal with embarrassing issues.

Otherwise, historian and sociologist [[Cindy Patton]] has identified sexophobia as one of the main trends that characterised the development of the second phase of the HIV epidemics in Great Britain, along with homophobia and germophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aggleton |first1=Peter |last2=Parker |first2=Richard |date= |year=2002 |title=Culture, Society And Sexuality: A Reader |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=PCSPAgAAQBAJ |access-date=11 February 2017|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=337 |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote=On the other hand, there was widespread and continuing fear and prejudice about AIDS which found expression both unofficial circles (for example in media coverage) and in official indifference at a policy level.

'''St. Vincent Charity Medical Center''' is a medical facility in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. It was founded in 1865 under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland]]. It has been administered for much of its history by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine]].

==History==
In 1851, the first [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland|Roman Catholic Bishop of Cleveland]], [[Louis Amadeus Rappe]], brought from his native France a small group of members of a monastery of  [[Augustinian]] [[canoness regular|canonesses regular]] dedicated to nursing to care for the sick of his [[diocese]]. By August of the following year, they were able to open St. Joseph Hospital, the first in the city. When the senior canonesses returned to France the following month, Rappe established the two young women from the group who had chosen to remain as the new [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] of Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine, under the leadership of an American woman, Mother Ursula Bissonette. The Sisters continued to operate the hospital until 1856, when they closed it to focus on their work of caring for orphans.&lt;ref name=CSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srsofcharity.org/archives/history/|work=Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine|title=History: Hospitals and Orphanages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having no hospital, Cleveland found itself in a poor position to deal with the illness and large numbers of riverboat accidents resulting from its position as a hub to the [[American West]]. The outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] presented the additional dilemma of treating returning soldiers who had been wounded in battle, needing immediate medical attention and long term nursing care. After discussion between Rappe and Bissonette, along with Gustave E. Weber, a prominent retired Army surgeon, it was felt that the time was opportune to open another hospital. The bishop approached the City Council in May 1863, proposing that the city build a hospital to care for returning veterans, which the Sisters of Charity would staff. After vocal opposition to the proposal by the press, which urged a non-sectarian facility, the majority Protestant council rejected the offer.&lt;ref name=ASV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stvincentcharity.com/about-st-vincent-charity-medical-center/|work=St. Vincent Charity Medical Center|title=About St. Vincent Charity Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappe then returned with a second proposal that he build the hospital and provide [[Religious Sister]]s to staff it, on the condition that the city provide adequate financial support. This proposal was accepted. The bishop then undertook the task of building the hospital. Land was acquired at a cost of $10,000, and the hospital was erected at a cost of $72,000, of which $42,000 came from public funds. '''St. Vincent Charity Hospital''' began operations on October 10, 1865.&lt;ref name=ASV /&gt;

==Growth==
Under Weber, who became the hospital's first chief of staff, it soon opened a medical school, which became a founding member of [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1881. A nursing school was opened to help staff the hospital's work in 1898, and two of the Sisters of Charity became among the first women in Ohio to be certified by the State Board of Pharmacy.&lt;ref name=CSA /&gt;

In 1952 a new building was opened for the hospital. This included Rosary Hall Solarium, dedicated to the care of alcoholics, a service pioneered through the work of [[Sister Ignatia]], C.S.A., a co-worker with the founders of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=ASV /&gt;

In 2010, the hospital was renamed to the one it now has.&lt;ref name=ASV /&gt;

'''Stamford and Rutland Hospital''' is an elective care hospital in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] administered by [[North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust]].

==History==
[[File:Greyfriars' Gate - geograph.org.uk - 1044190.jpg|thumb|left|The medieval gate]]
The hospital was built on a site previously occupied by [[Greyfriars, Stamford]] and donated by the [[Henry Cecil, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]]. It was funded by a bequest from the will of surgeon Henry Fryer, designed by [[John Peter Gandy]] and opened in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/services-skills/education/educational-images/stamford-and-rutland-general-infirmary-deeping-road-stamford-8931|title=Stamford and Rutland General Infirmary, Deeping Road, Stamford, Lincolnshire|accessdate=13 October 2017|publisher=[[Historic England]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1876 and 1879 the hospital was expanded with the addition of three fever ward blocks, under architect [[Edward Browning]] with input from surgeon Dr William Newman. The wards incorporated a number of features such as centralised ward interiors and glazed internal walling, and were cited as an exemplar of single-block planning for small hospitals, particular by [[Henry Burdett]]. The fever wards are [[Listed building#Categories of listed_buildings|Grade II listed]] and are a testament to how voluntary hospitals dealt with nineteenth century epidemics of contagious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/new_reports/AAAA0596.pdf|title=The Fever Wards, Stanford Hospital, Lincolnshire|publisher=[[Historic England]]|author=Kathryn A Morrison|ISSN=2059-4453|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial redevelopment of the hospital was completed in July 2017, which included new imaging facilities, including a permanent MRI scanning suite, and cancer treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwangliaft.nhs.uk/our-hospitals/stamford-and-rutland-hospital/ |title=Stamford and Rutland Hospital |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust]] |access-date=14 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The hospital provides a minor injuries unit, large scale outpatient services and day-case surgery, with the largest pain management centre in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/Services/DefaultView.aspx?id=1818 |title=Stamford and Rutland Hospital ‚Äì Departments and services |last= |first= |date= |website=NHS Choices |publisher=Department of Health |access-date=6 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a medicine for the elderly ward with 22 intermediate care beds.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt; The trust's largest hospital, [[Peterborough City Hospital]], provides the majority of emergency and inpatient services in the area; the two together thus provide a comprehensive suite of services in a predominantly "hot" and "cold" split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Candace |last1=Imison |first2=Lara |last2=Sonola |first3=Matthew |last3=Honeyman | first4=Shilpa |last4=Ross |date=25 November 2014 |title=The reconfiguration of clinical services: What is the evidence? |url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/reconfiguration-clinical-services |location= |publisher=[[The King's Fund]] |page= |isbn=9781909029439 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rated "good" by the [[Care Quality Commission]] in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/location/RGN49 |title=Stamford and Rutland Hospital |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Care Quality Commission]] |access-date=14 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Vermont]] state government enacted a law functionally establishing the first state-level [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States.  Green Mountain Care, established by the passage of H.202, creates a system in the state where Vermonters receive [[Universal healthcare coverage|universal health care coverage]] as well as technological improvements to the existing system.

On December 17, 2014, Vermont abandoned its plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/governor-abandons-single-payer-health-care-plan-225042240.html Governor abandons single-payer health care plan], yahoo.com, December 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
In 2010, the [[Vermont General Assembly|State Legislature]] passed S 88 (which included provisions from Act 128), which enabled the state of Vermont to establish a commission to study different forms of health care delivery in the state.&lt;ref name="S88"&gt;[http://hcr.vermont.gov/sites/hcr/files/Act_128__S_88__AS_PASSED__2_.pdf S 88] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019165718/http://hcr.vermont.gov/sites/hcr/files/Act_128__S_88__AS_PASSED__2_.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }}: An act relating to health care financing and universal access to health care in Vermont. As passed by House and Senate, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[William Hsiao]], a [[Harvard University]] professor of economics who was an advisor during [[Taiwan]]'s transition to single-payer health care,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health-care-abroad-taiwan/ Health Care Abroad: Taiwan]. November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was enlisted to design three possible options to reform Vermont's health care.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Public Radio: [http://www.vpr.net/episode/50325/dr-william-hsiao-on-health-care-system-reform/ Dr. William Hsaio on health care system reform.] January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hsaio, along with [[Steven Kappel]] and [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]], presented the proposal to the legislature of Vermont on June 21, 2010.&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/jfo/healthcare/Hsiao%20Proposal%20-%20public.pdf The Vermont Option: Achieving Affordable Universal Health Care]. Dr. William Hsaio, Steven Kappel, Jonathan Gruber, and a team of health policy analysts, June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three options were laid out as follows:

* '''Option 1''': As laid out by the requirements of Act 128, the first option would create "a government-administered and publicly financed single-payer health benefit system decoupled from employment which prohibits insurance coverage for the health services provided by this system and allows for private insurance coverage only of supplemental health services."&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt; The proposal considered this option to be the easiest path to single-payer, but was critical of the "complex and inefficient process" of proof of residency needs.&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt;
* '''Option 2''': As laid out by the requirements of S 88, the second option would create "a public health benefit option administered by state government, which allows individuals to choose between the public option and private insurance coverage and allows for fair and robust competition among public and private plans."&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt; The commission noted that this option did not provide universal coverage on its own or the enforcement mechanism in place for any possible mandates put in place to achieve more coverage.&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt; 
* '''Option 3''': Act 128 allowed the commission to design a system that met the various principles outlined in Section 2 of the Act.&lt;ref name="S88"/&gt; The commission's design ultimately sought out an "approach to Option 3... by combining three studies to ascertain what type of universal health insurance, what methods of financing, and what type of single payer system is most likely to be politically and practically viable for Vermont."&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt;

The commission's proposal ultimately considered the third option to be "the most politically and practically viable single payer system for Vermont," noting that Vermont, "a small state with [[communitarian]] 
values," with its existing network of non-profit hospitals and {{clarify|date=February 2017|text=a medical structure that had shown previous support in state intervention}}, would be "uniquely poised to pass universal health reform."&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt;

==Legislation==
Following the proposal, [[Vermont Democratic Party|Democratic]] state senator Mark Larson introduced H 202 on February 8, 2011, titled Single-Payer and Unified Health System.&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"&gt;[http://votesmart.org/bill/13005/35106 Project VoteSmart]: H 202 - SINGLE-PAYER AND UNIFIED HEALTH SYSTEM - KEY VOTE.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the [[Vermont House of Representatives|House]] on March 24, 2011, with 94 votes in favor and 49 against.&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://votesmart.org/static/billtext/34283.pdf H. 202]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill then passed the [[Vermont Senate|Senate]] on April 26, 2011, with 21 votes in favor and 9 against.&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcax.com/story/14518224/vt-senate-approves-single-payer-plan|title=Vt.

===Green Mountain Care===
The signing of H. 202 led to the creation of Green Mountain Care, described by Kaiser Health News as "a state-funded-and-managed insurance pool that would provide near-universal coverage to residents with the expectation that it would reduce health care spending."&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Health News: [http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2011/october/02/vermont-single-payer-health-care.aspx Vermont Edges Toward Single Payer].  October 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Shumlin, in a [[blog]] post at ''[[Huffington Post]]'', described the plan as "a single payer system" that he believed "will control [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]], not just by cutting fees to doctors and hospitals, but by fundamentally changing the state's health care system."&lt;ref&gt;''Huffington Post'': [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gov-peter-shumlin/health-care-reform-shumlin_b_919900.html The Economic Urgency of Health Care Reform.] August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program.  Dr. Hsiao, for example, had proposed an 11% payroll tax on employers, and the administration was required under Act 48 to provide a financing system in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''Vermont Business Magazine'': [http://www.vermontbiz.com/news/january/health-care-committee-look-insurance-subsidies-financing-single-payer-role-green-mounta Health care committee to look at insurance subsidies, financing for single payer, role of Green Mountain Care Board].  January 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The state also had to align Green Mountain Care with provisions in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], passed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]] in 2010, which required the creation of a health care exchange in individual states.  To launch fully, Green Mountain Care would have had to gain approval from the federal government to use federal health finances to fund the state program.

As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system,&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomberg'': [http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-11/vermont-s-single-payer-dream-is-taxpayer-nightmare Vermont's Single-Payer Dream is Taxpayer Nightmare.]  April 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vox: [https://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5557696/forget-obamacare-vermont-wants-to-bring-single-payer-to-america Forget Obamacare: Vermont wants to bring single-payer to America.]  April 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt;

==Popular opinion and reactions==
Dr. Hsiao, in his proposal, noted that "a two-thirds majority of Vermonters said that all Vermonters should be able to get the health care they need when they need it, regardless of their ability to pay even if this means that they would have to pay higher taxes and higher insurance premiums themselves."&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt; The bill was passed in the Vermont legislature on party line votes, with Democrats and [[Vermont Progressive Party|Progressives]] in favor and [[Vermont Republican Party|Republicans]] against. The bill is considered the first single-payer bill to be passed on the state level, but private insurers can continue to operate in the state. Representative Larson has described Green Mountain Care's provisions as "as close as we can get [to single-payer] at the state level."&lt;ref name="AMN"&gt;American Medical News: [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/05/16/gvsa0516.htm Vermont approves universal health program.]  May 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leigh Tofferi, the director of government, public and community relations for [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of Vermont, the lack of initial specifics was causing "anxiety" to many providers. The [[Vermont Medical Society]] had no position on the bill or on single-payer in general. David Himmelstein, the founder of [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a single-payer advocacy group, was critical of the plan due to the ability of private insurers to operate in the state, arguing that the plan "give[s] up a significant part of the administrative savings by doing that," but agreeing that Green Mountain Care "lays the foundation" for single-payer.&lt;ref name="AMN"/&gt;

In the [[Vermont gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial election]], Governor Shumlin was heavily favored for re-election but only received a plurality of the vote, 46.4%, to Republican [[Scott Milne|Scott Milne's]] 45.1%. The election was decided by the [[Vermont General Assembly]] on January 8, 2015; Shumlin defeated Milne by a vote of 110 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/08/vermont-legislature-vote/21394309/|title=Shumlin defeats Milne in Legislature governor vote|author=Free Press Staff|date=January 8, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Burlington Free Press]]'' ascribed the result, in part, to voters' dissatisfaction with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/11/05/two-term-incumbent-governor-nearly-lost/18563053/ |title=How a two-term incumbent governor nearly lost |publisher=Burlington Free Press |date=November 6, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One of the problems found since the abandonment of the Vermont Health Care initiatives is questionable billing from [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]], who according to CNBC, has come under more scrutiny because of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102450966 |title=Obamacare guru Gruber had 'questionable' billing: Audit |publisher=CNBC |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a Vermont State report filed by Doug Hoffer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.mychamplainvalley.com/media/lib/210/b/1/8/b182784c-2ef5-4bb1-b3b3-ba18ac6adbcc/gruber_memo_final.pdf |title=Gruber contract memo final |publisher=STATE OF VERMONT OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR |date=February 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an invoice sent by Gruber to Vermont on December 30, 2014 for $40,000 increased the amount of scrutiny on the billing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/story/d/story/report-gruber-may-have-overbilled-vt/27088/KkrBI7coM0WETqoFRcdjVg |title=Report: Gruber May Have Overbilled VT |publisher=Local 22 |date=February 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WWT Martin Mere''' is a [[wetland]] [[nature reserve]] managed by the [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]] at [[Tarlscough]], [[Burscough]], [[Lancashire]], England, on the [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]], {{convert|6|mi|0}} from [[Ormskirk]] and {{convert|10|mi|0}} from [[Southport]] ([[Merseyside]]). It is one of ten reserves managed by the [[Charitable organization|charity]], and it is designated an [[SSSI]] (Site of Special Scientific Interest), an [[Special Protection Area|SPA]] (Special Protection Area) and a [[Ramsar Site]].

The name of the centre comes from [[Martin Mere|the mere]] on the west side of the reserve which is ringed by 11 observation hides. On the east side of the reserve there are a number of pens providing [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for birds from [[Africa]], [[Australasia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Siberia]], and [[Asia]].

Martin Mere has its own "[[Domesday Book]]", listing (for 2002) 517 [[species]] of [[plant]], 287 species of [[fungus]] and 1,368 species of [[invertebrate]]. 284 species of [[bird]] have passed through the reserve, as well as 28 species of [[mammal]] and 19 species of [[fish]].

This reserve is at its best in winter, attracting huge flocks of [[pink-footed goose|pink-footed geese]] and [[wigeon]], many [[whooper swan]]s and occasional rarer [[bird]]s such as the [[snow goose]].

It is also excellent for wintering [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as [[hen harrier]], [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] and [[merlin (bird)|merlin]].

The BBC television programme [[Autumnwatch with Bill Oddie|Autumnwatch]] was broadcast live from Martin Mere in 2006 and 2007.

==History==
{{main|Martin Mere}}
The first {{convert|363|acre|ha|0}}, known as Holcroft's Farm, were purchased in 1972 through local fundraising. The first curator of the site was [[Peter Gladstone]], great grandson of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. The site was opened to the public in 1975 by Sir [[Peter Scott]].

The '''World Organisation for Animal Health''' ('''OIE''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] coordinating, supporting and promoting animal disease control.

== Mission and status ==
[[File:P1050398 Paris XVII rue de Prony n¬∞12 rwk.JPG|thumb|200px|World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Headquarters building in [[Paris]]]]
The main objective of the OIE is to control [[epizootic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://protectanimalsansave.webs.com/apps/blog/ Protect animals] Pets&lt;/ref&gt; diseases and thus to prevent their spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/en/about-us/our-missions/ Missions of the OIE] at OIE official website&lt;/ref&gt; Other objectives consist of: transparency, scientific information, international solidarity, sanitary safety, the promotion of Veterinary Services, food safety and animal welfare. It is recognized as a reference organisation by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and in 2018 had a total of [[Member states of the World Organization for Animal Health|182 member states]]. Its newest member state is Saint Lucia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opening of the 86th OIE General Session |url=http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/opening-of-the-86th-oie-general-session/ |website=World Organization for Animal Health |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIE maintains permanent relations with 45 other international and regional organisations and has Regional and sub-regional Offices on every continent. The OIE does not depend on the UN system; its autonomy is both institutional and financial and its activities are governed by its own constitutional texts. Since its first General Session held in Paris, the Office carries out its work under the authority of a Committee consisting of delegates of the contracting Governments.

== History ==
The need to fight animal diseases at a global level led to the creation of the '''''Office International des Epizooties''''' through the international Agreement signed on January 25, 1924. In May 2003 the Office became the World Organisation for Animal Health but kept its historical acronym OIE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/en/about-us/history/ History of the OIE] at OIE official website&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the outgoing Obama administration designated the OIE as an organization entitled to benefits of the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order -- Designating the World Organisation for Animal Health as a Public International Organization Entitled to Enjoy Certain Privileges, Exemptions, and Immunities|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/12/executive-order-designating-world-organisation-animal-health-public|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=20 January 2017|language=en|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Headquarters ==
The OIE's headquarters are located in Paris, in the 17th arrondisment. It was in 1939 that the OIE moved to the aristocratic district of Parc Monceau, after having occupied premises since 1927 near the [[Champs de Mars]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], that had been provided by the French Higher Public Health Council. In May 1938, the OIE Members gave Dr Emmanuel Leclainche, founder and first General Director of the OIE, full powers to buy a townhouse in Paris, using the reserve fund. Dr Lecleinche chose the mansion from four properties selected by a Commission comprising the President of the OIE, H.C.L.E. Berger (Netherlands), the Vice-President, Carlo Bisanti (Italy), and the accountant, Gotlieb Fl√ºckiger (Switzerland). On 22 February 1939, the OIE, represented by E. Leclainche bought the mansion from the Marquise de Montebello, at a cost of 700,000 francs.
The 13th General Session of the OIE was held from May 30 to June 5, 1939 at 12 rue de Prony after rebuilding work had been completed. Due to the Second World War, the following General Session did not take place until 1946, from 2 to 5 October. Following their entry into Paris in June 1940, the German occupying forces temporarily closed and sealed the OIE headquarters. The efforts of the President, Gotlieb Fl√ºckiger, elected in 1939, resulted in its re-opening.
12 rue de Prony was built in 1879, in the Neo-Renaissance style, by the celebrated architect [[Jean-Louis Pascal]] for the Austrian Baron, Jonas K√∂nigswater, a former banker and railway owner. A succession of major works to renovate and modernise the headquarters were undertaken by the Directors General elected after E.Leclainche: Gaston Ramon, Ren√© Vittoz, Louis Blajan, Jean Blancou and Bernard Vallat. Due to the headlong development of the organisation (tripling of the staff and the budget since 2001), additional premises have been rented at 14 rue de Prony since 2004. On 16 March 2009, the OIE purchased a large part of the building at 14 rue de Prony, adjoining its headquarters.

== World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) Interface ==
Timely dissemination of information is crucial to containing [[outbreak]]s. The WAHID Interface provides access to all data held within OIE's new World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). It replaces and significantly extends the former web interface named Handistatus II System.

A comprehensive range of information is available from:
* Immediate notifications and follow-up reports submitted by Member Countries in response to exceptional disease events occurring in these countries as well as follow-up reports about these events,
* Six-monthly reports describing the OIE-listed disease situations in each country
* Annual reports providing further background information on animal health, on [[laboratory]] and [[vaccine]] production facilities.

'''√Ångel Canaveris''' (1847-1897) was an Argentine [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], who had a preponderant role in the beginnings of Uruguayan Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revista, Volume 2, Issues 9-20 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100466733|year=1884 |publisher=Sociedad Universitaria, Montevideo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Hospital Vilardeb√≥]] and [[Hospital Maciel]], both located in [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sesiones de la Sociedad Uruguaya de Historia de la Medicina, Volume 6|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=gulfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=angel+canaveris+Hospital+Vilardeb%C3%B3&amp;dq=angel+canaveris+Hospital+Vilardeb%C3%B3&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJjqGR3IzLAhWFD3IKHXMiBv8Q6AEIITAC|year= |publisher=La Sociedad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

√Ångel Canaveris was born in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Argentina, National Census, 1869 |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-68TS-MYK?mode=g&amp;i=716&amp;cc=1462401|year= |publisher=Rep√∫blica Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably in the city of [[Genoa]], on one of the trips made in [[Europe]], by his parents [[Juan Manuel Canaveris]] and Carmen Guti√©rrez. His mother was the daughter of [[Juan Guti√©rrez Moreno, physician|Juan Guti√©rrez Moreno]], a distinguished doctor of medicine, born in [[M√°laga]], and Lorenza Moxica y L√≥pez de Castilla, belonging to a Uruguayan family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revista del Instituto de Estudios Geneal√≥gicos del Uruguay, Issues 13-17 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/101488523|year=1991 |publisher=El Instituto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their paternal ancestors belonged to Piedmontese families, established in the areas of [[Turin]], [[Cuneo]], [[Liguria]] and some regions of the [[South of France]].

After completing his secondary education in the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], Canaveris entered as a student in the Facultad de Medicina of the [[University of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia de la Facultad de Medicina y sus escuelas|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=hXsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=angel+canaveri&amp;dq=angel+canaveri&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj92dOG0JjTAhWGC5AKHcbWBVI4FBDoAQg4MAU|year= |publisher=Eliseo Cant√≥n}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he graduated in 1875 with a thesis entitled "Consideraciones sobre la lactancia" (Considerations about breastfeeding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nomina de graduaoos|url=http://www.uba.ar/historia/archivos/1nomina.pdf|year= |publisher=Universidad de Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the year 1875, the recent graduate Dr. Canaveris was settled in [[Montevideo]], city where his mother was a native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Psiquiatr√≠a en Am√©rica Latina |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=fBdgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=angel+canaveris&amp;dq=angel+canaveris&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2VaKVJTaB8zGsQSJ24CABQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg |year= |publisher=Javier Mari√°tegui}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was appointed by the Council of Public Hygiene, to serve in the Hospitals of [[Hospital Vilardeb√≥|Vilardeb√≥]] and [[Hospital Maciel|Maciel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sesiones de la Sociedad Uruguaya de Historia de la Medicina, Volume 6|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=gulfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C3%81ngel+Canaveris+hospital+vilardeb%C3%B3&amp;dq=%C3%81ngel+Canaveris+hospital+vilardeb%C3%B3&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9kLbLgKfaAhVF1lMKHdsjCIQQ6AEILjAC|year= |publisher=La Sociedad, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first psychiatrists in the [[Psychiatric hospital|Mental Hospital]] of Uruguay. In 1878, Canaveris was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[:es:Pedro Visca|Pedro Visca]], director of the Asylum between 1877 and 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Visca: fundador de la cl√≠nica m√©dica en el Uruguay |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006203926|year= |publisher=Fernando Ma√±√© Garz√≥n}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dedicated himself to teaching, serving in the [[:es:Internato Normal de Se√±oritas|Internato Normal de Se√±oritas]], since its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Memoria|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=olgyAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=angel+canaveris&amp;dq=angel+canaveris&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTiZ7rmZTTAhUBEpAKHYC6BB84FBDoAQhDMAk|year= |publisher=Uruguay.

In 1879 the Dr. √Ångel Canaveris, had promoted a resolution where the foreman should monitor that [[nurse|nurses]] do not give mistreatment of psychiatric patients. Canaveris reported that for an efficient mental treatment the patients should be contained with good treatment by their [[caregivers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medicina y sociedad en el Uruguay del novecientos: La ortopedia de los pobres |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/101571975|year= |publisher=Jos√© Pedro Barr√°n}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, he resigned as Head of the Mental Hospital of Montevideo, being replaced by Dr. Alejo Mart√≠nez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Psiquiatr√≠a en Am√©rica Latina|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=fBdgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=angel+canaveris&amp;dq=angel+canaveris&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc2qXMnafaAhWDv1MKHU-9COI4FBDoAQhRMAg|year= |publisher=Javier Mari√°tegui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''«ÉXu''' is possibly the main god of the [[San people|San]] of southern [[Africa]]. He is considered a benevolent and omnipotent [[God|supreme being]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Katz, Megan Biesele, Verna St. Denis. {{google books|id=z63kSi61TSwC|title=Healing Makes Our Hearts Happy: Spirituality and Cultural Transformation Among the Kalahari Ju\'hoansi|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the sky god to whom the souls of the dead go. He is said to "Summon the magicians to their profession, and gives them supernatural powers." The San add that he provides the rain and is invoked in illness, before hunting and before traveling.

The deity is also known as !Xuba, !Xo or !Xoba.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothea Bleek|Dorothea F. Bleek]], {{Google books|id=l3UTAwAAQBAJ|title=Bushman Dictionary|page=502}}. {{ISBN|9785882327261}}&lt;/ref&gt;
