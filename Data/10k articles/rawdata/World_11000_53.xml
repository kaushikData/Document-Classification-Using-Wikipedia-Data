The '''1956 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] [[motor race]] held on 13 May 1956 at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]]. It was race 2 of  8 in the [[1956 World Championship of Drivers]].

The Owen's B.R.M. made their first appearance but after qualifying both cars were withdrawn due to engine valve problems. The other two non-starters were also teammates: the too slow Scarlatti and Chiron due to his engine blowing up in practice.

Moss, starting from the middle of the front row, took the lead at Gasworks on the first lap and led every lap. Fangio was not having a good day. He hit the straw bales on lap 2, causing Schell and Musso to retire when trying to avoid him, and on lap 32 he hit the harbour wall, bending a rear wheel. He turned the car over to Castellotti after the pit stop to fix the wheel. On lap 54 while second, Collins came in the pit and turned his car over to Fangio. He resumed in third and passed Behra for second on lap 70 but he was 47 seconds behind Moss. On lap 86 Perdisa's brakes locked when being lapped by Moss, the resulting contact caused Moss's bonnet to lift allowing Fangio to close the gap by two seconds each lap but Moss won with a 6-second cushion.

The '''Ahoko''' is a traditional [[percussion instrument]] originating from the central part of [[Ivory Coast]] (Côte d'Ivoire) in [[Africa]].

The ahoko is a wooden rod with [[Nut (fruit)|nutshells]], each containing loose seeds, tied to strings which are then tightly wound around the end of the rod. The percussive sound can range from quiet to very loud.

In the [[Hornbostel–Sachs]] system it is categorised as 112.13 as a [[vessel rattle]], a type of [[indirectly struck idiophone]].

* https://web.archive.org/web/20100706201440/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/List_of_musical_instruments_-_Percussion_instruments/id/1689127 lists the ''ahoko'' as an ''other percussion instrument'', i.e. not a drum.
* http://www.hellotrade.com/african-treasures-com/juju-seed-rattle.html ''Juju Seed Rattle. Description: Also called Ahoko. Nutshells are attached at the end of a wooden handle to make a full resonant rattle sound. Effects range from a very loud tone when shaken strongly, to a quiet rattle when the handle is barely turned.''

'''''Anomalías eléctricas ''''' is a [[2010 in film|2010]] Equatoguinean [[short film|short]] [[animated comedy]].

==Synopsis==
The main character is studying in his house in [[Malabo]] when, suddenly, the power is cut. He tries to look for a [[candle]], but he falls down because of the darkness. The light comes back and he can start to study again, but this does not last long. The power goes off again, the character tries to fix it, but he has an [[electric shock|electric accident]]. When the light comes back on, he appears with "[[Rastafari movement|Rasta]]" hair and, a few seconds later, the power is cut for the third time.

[[File:Berones_y_celtiberos.svg|thumb|right|200px|The extent of the Berones people is shown in green. In other colours, the extent of the Celtiberians.]] 
The '''Berones''' were a pre-Roman [[Celtic people]] of ancient Spain, although they not were part of the [[Celtiberians]], they lived north of the Celtiberians and close to the [[Cantabri]]an [[Conisci]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geographikon'', III, 4, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle [[Ebro]] region between the [[Tirón]] and [[Alhama (river)|Alhama]] rivers.

== Origins ==
The ancestors of the Berones were [[Celts]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geographikon'', III, 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; who migrated from [[Gaul]] to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] around the 4th century BC&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Naturalis Historia'', III, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geographikon'', III, 4, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to settle in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and the southern parts of the [[Soria]], [[Alava]] and [[Navarra]] provinces.

== Culture ==
A stock-raising people that practiced [[transhumance]], their capital was ''Varia'' or ''Vareia'' ([[Custodia de Viana]]; Celtiberian-type mint: ''Uaracos Auta''?), situated near [[Logroño]] at the middle [[Ebro]] in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and controlled the towns of ''Libia'' ([[Herramélluri]] or [[Leiva, La Rioja|Leiva]] – [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]), ''Tritium Megallum'' ([[Tricio]]), ''Bilibium'' ([[Bilibio]], near [[Conchas de Haro]]) and ''Contrebia Leukade'' ([[Aguillar del Rio Alhama]] – [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).

== History ==

Allies of the [[Autrigones]], the Berones appear to have kept themselves out of the [[Celtiberian confederacy]] throughout the 3rd-2nd centuries BC but later came under pressure of the [[Vascones]]. Their earliest contact with Rome might have occurred during the early 2nd century BC, when they allegedly fought as allies of the [[Celtiberians]] at the [[battle of Calagurris]] in 186 BC, being defeated by the [[Praetor]] of [[Hispania Citerior]] [[Lucius Manlius Adicinus Fulvianus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', 39: 21, 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Roman ephigraphic source, the [[Ascoli-Picenum bronze]] (now at the [[Museo Capitolino]], Rome),&lt;ref&gt;Criniti, N., ''L'Epigrape di Asculum di Gn. Pompeo Strabone'', Milan 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Beronian mercenary cavalrymen later entered Roman service at the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]], fighting alongside other Spaniards in the ''[[Turma Saluitana]]''&lt;ref&gt;Fatás-Cabeza, G., ''La Sedetania - Las Tierras Zaragozanas hasta la fundación de Caesaraugusta'', Zaragoza 1973a, pp.8.&lt;/ref&gt; as auxiliary cavalry in Italy though they subsequently aided their Autrigones' allies in the defence of their respective territories in northern [[Celtiberia]] against [[Sertorius]]' invasion attempt in 76 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Frag. Lib.'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the English translation of Danish author Peter Høeg's novel, De måske egnede|the Norwegian crime drama television series|Borderliner||Borderline (disambiguation){{!}}Borderline}}
'''Borderliners''' is the English translation of ''De måske egnede'', a novel written by Danish author [[Peter Høeg]] in 1993. It is about three children - Peter, Katerina, and August - who attend a private school in [[Copenhagen]] in the mid 1970s. It is not long before the children realise they are part of an experiment initiated by the school. The objective is to show how damaged children can be saved and converted into fine citizens. The children choose to fight the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/e2node/Borderliners |title=Borderliners |website=Everything2.com|accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
Peter is a student at Biehl's after spending all of his life in children's homes and reform schools. He is a borderline case, along with Katarina, whose parents both died in the past year, and August, who is severely disturbed after killing his abusive parents. Although allowed no social interaction, the children conspire to conduct their own experiment to discover what plan is being carried out at Biehl's. Høeg touches on some of the same themes as in his acclaimed ''[[Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow]]'' - [[Child neglect|neglected children]], scientific experiments, and technology - but ''Borderliners'' is not a thriller and may not appeal to the same audience. It is instead a fascinating intellectual puzzle that explores the themes of social control, child assessment, family, and the concept of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Amazon.com|url=https://www.amazon.com/Borderliners-Peter-Hoeg/dp/0385315082|asin=0385315082|title=Description: ''Borderliners'' by Peter Høeg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book is also somewhat autobiographical, as it reflects Høeg's own schooldays at a Copenhagen private school.{{CN|date=June 2015}}

'''Canadian–Turkish relations''' are foreign relations between [[Canada]] and [[Turkey]]. Canada has an embassy in [[Ankara]]. Turkey has an embassy in [[Ottawa]]. Both countries are full members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]] and the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization (WTO)]]. Also Turkey is a full member of the [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe (CoE)]] and Canada is an observer member of it. The recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] by the Canadian parliament has soured relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-parliament-recognizes-armenian-genocide-1.509866&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada refused to participate in a proposed invasion of Turkey during the [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922, Canada's first independent foreign policy decision.

According to a 2013 [[BBC]] World Service Poll, 43% of Turks view Canada's influence positively, with 34% expressing a negative view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2013_country_ratings/2013_country_rating_poll_bbc_globescan.pdf 2013 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trade ==
Canada-Turkey bilateral merchandise stood at $2.3 billion in 2012. Turkey is Canada's 34th largest trade partner. Canadian merchandise exports to Turkey were $850 million in 2012, and consisted mainly of oils (not crude), minerals, [[iron]]/[[steel]] and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/turkey-turquie/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/canada-turkey-turquie.aspx?lang=eng|title=Canada-Turkey relations|date=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[coat of arms]] of [[San Marino]]''' probably originated in the fourteenth century. The official establishment took place on 6 April 1862 by a Decree of the Supreme Council; the same act introduced the crown on top of the shield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esteri.sm/contents/instance2/files/document/RSMSCHEDAPAESE.pdf About the Republic of San Marino], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence regarding the official design until the mid-20th century. "[[The Flag Bulletin]]" vol. III, no. 2 from the winter of 1963–64 is reproducing on page 31 an ''"official plate showing the [[Flag of San Marino|flag]] and arms of San Marino, [which] was a gift of the [[Congress of State|Sammarinese government]], through its Consul in [[New York City]]."'' This plate was previously published in an official guide of the republic, from March 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Rossi et al., ''Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino - Guida Ufficiale'', Editrice VOGARTE, San Marino, March 1963&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a new ''Law on the flag and coat of arms of San Marino'' presented a slightly simplified design, the main changes being that the branches have no more ramifications, the towers are square instead of round, and the gates are oriented now towards ''sinister''.

The coat of arms of San Marino adorns among other things the [[flag of San Marino|flag of the country]] and the logo of the [[San Marino Football Federation]].

==Description==

The official description of the coat of arms is:

{{quote|"The official coat of arms of the Republic is surmounted by a closed [[crown (heraldry)|crown]], the symbol of sovereignty

The shield is azure, three mountains vert, towers argent, windowed, embattled and masoned sable, surmounted by [[ostrich]] plumes argent. The shield is surrounded by two branches vert, overlapped in [[saltire]] below the shield, one of [[Laurel wreath|laurel]], the other of [[oak]], fructed or. On a ribbon argent the [[motto]] ''LIBERTAS'' in capital letters sable."}}

The components of the coat of arms are in detail:

*In the blue shield there are three green mountains with three silver towers, each decorated with a [[weather vane]] consisting of a silver ostrich feather. The towers symbolize the three citadels of San Marino ([[Guaita|La Guaita]], [[La Cesta]] and [[Montale (San Marino)|La Montale]]), while the hills represent the three summits of [[Monte Titano]].
*The motto "LIBERTAS" ([[Latin|Lat.]] ''freedom''). It possibly refers to the taking in of victims of political persecution in the earlier years of San Marino, and to the amazing maintenance of independence in the midst of many larger states.  The motto could also have developed from the alleged last words of the founder Marinus: "''Relinquo vos liberos ab utroque homine''" (Lat. "I leave you free from both men").&lt;ref&gt;This somewhat mysterious phrase is most likely to refer to the two "men" from whose oppressive power Saint Marinus had decided to separate himself, becoming a hermit on Mount Titano: respectively, the Emperor and the Pope. This affirmation of freedom (first and foremost fiscal franchise) from both the State and the Church, however legendary, has always been the inspiration of the tiny republic. (source: "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834173 The Republic of San Marino]", William Miller, The American Historical Review, Vol. 6, No. 4 (Jul., 1901), pp. 633-649)&lt;/ref&gt;
*An oak and laurel branch, which surrounds the coat of arms are symbols for the stability of the republic and the defense of the liberty.
*A [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]], which serves as symbol of sovereignty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">The '''Czech-Slovak Protective Society''' (CSPS), which became the '''Czecho Slovakian Association''', was an organization supporting the welfare of [[Czech American|Czech]] and [[Slovak American|Slovak]] immigrants to the [[United States]].

==History==
The CSPS was founded in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in 1854, and, like other immigrant societies, began by offering a kind of insurance program, which provided for members when they were ill and covered funeral expenses.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc-saint-paul&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=77000763}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: C.S.P.S.

The Czecho-Slovak Protective Society, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, joined in organizing the '''Czechoslovak Society of America''' in 1933.  That organization, based in [[Berwyn, Illinois]] changed its name to [[CSA Fraternal Life]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfcanet.org/pdf/mergers_changes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215125057/http://www.nfcanet.org/pdf/mergers_changes.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--- following needs editing to provide quoting or rewording ---&gt;
Č.S.P.S. stands for "Česko-Slovenský Podporující Spolek" (Czech-Slovak Protective Society). These lodges were the forerunner of the (Západní Česko-Bratrská Jednota, or Western Bohemian Fraternal Association). Both associations offered a type of insurance for the Czech people. The association later became known as the [[Western Fraternal Life Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unl.edu/Czechheritage/Margie_sobotka.shtml Our Czech Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dai li dou''', or alternatively '''Dai-li-dou''' as it is listed in the official Eurovision website, was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Gemini (Portuguese band)|Gemini]].

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with the band describing the freedom of a kite flying above them. They sing about their own desires for freedom, which they describe as being reflected in the kite.

The song was performed fifth on the night, following [[Finland]]'s [[Seija Simola]] with "[[Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[Joël Prévost]] with "[[Il y aura toujours des violons]]". At the close of voting, it had received 5 points, placing 17th in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 contest]] by [[Manuela Bravo]] with "[[Sobe, sobe, balão sobe]]".

The '''economic liberalisation in India''' refers to the [[economic liberalisation|changes and reforms]], initiated in 1991, of the country's economic policies, with the goal of making the economy more market- and service-oriented, and expanding the role of private and foreign investment.&lt;ref name="originalreport"&gt;{{cite web |title=India - Structural Adjustment Credit Project (English) - Presidents report |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999451468260069468/India-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-Project |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these changes were made as part of the conditions laid out by the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] as a condition for a $500 million bail out to the Indian government in December 1991.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |title=Structural adjustments in India - a reportof the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) |url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/0586CC45A28A2749852567F5005D8C89 |website=www.lnweb90.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. Its opponents have blamed it for increased inequality and economic degradation. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet solved a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing [[subsidies in India|agricultural subsidies]].&lt;ref name="Gandhi-1"&gt;{{cite news |title=That old Gandhi magic |date=27 November 1997 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/node/107076}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists a lively debate in India as to whether the economic reforms were sustainable and beneficial to the people of India as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of the existing explanations and a comprehensive alternative explanation see: Sharma, Chanchal Kumar (2011) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14736489.2011.574550 A Discursive Dominance Theory of Economic Reforms Sustainability]." ''India Review'' (Routledge, UK) 126–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WB2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Project proposal - Structured adjustment of India |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999451468260069468/India-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-Project |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian government coalitions have been advised by the IMF and World Bank to continue liberalisation. Before 2015, India grew at a slower pace than [[People's Republic of China|China]], which had been [[Chinese economic reform|liberalising its economy]] since 1978.&lt;ref name="holdingback"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10808493 |title=India's economy: What's holding India back? |date=6 March 2008 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, India's GDP growth outpaced that of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35519671|title=India outpaces China in 2015 economic growth |publisher= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The McKinsey Quarterly'' stated that removing major obstacles "would free India's economy to grow as fast as China's, at 10% a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.indian-network.de/artikel/The%20McKinsey%20Quarterly-%20India-From%20emerging%20to%20surging.pdf |title=The McKinsey Quarterly: India – From emerging to surging |publisher=The McKinsey Quarterly |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been significant debate, however, around liberalisation as an inclusive economic growth strategy. Income inequality has deepened in India since 1992, with consumption among the poorest staying stable while the wealthiest generate consumption growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-income-inequality-has-doubled-in-20-years/articleshow/11012855.cms |title=India's income inequality has doubled in 20 years |publisher= The Times of India |website=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth rate in 2012–13 was the lowest for a decade, at just 5.1%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/gdp-growth-slumps-to-5-a-decades-low/article4768550.ece GDP growth slumps to 5%, a decade’s low], Hindu Business Line 31 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; at which time more criticism of India's economic reforms surfaced; it apparently failed to address employment growth, nutritional values in terms of food intake in calories, and also export growth—and thereby was leading to a worsening [[current account deficit]] compared to the period prior to reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/06/04/indias-ponzi-styled-economic-reforms-run-out-of-steam/ India’s Ponzi-styled economic reforms run out of steam], East Asia Forum 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The country continues to perform poorly in all developmental aspects, with high unemployment among the youth, poor women's security, rampant corruption, the highest number of malnourished children and poor sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=Josy |title=A feast of vultures |date=1 July 2016 |location=New Delhi |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-liberalisation policies==
{{History of modern India}}
{{Further|Economic history of India|Licence Raj}}

Indian [[economic policy]] after [[Indian independence movement|independence]] was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to [[Fabian socialism]]. Policy tended towards [[protectionist|protectionism]], with a strong emphasis on [[import substitution industrialization]] under state monitoring, [[state intervention]] at the micro level in all businesses especially in labour and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and [[central planning]].&lt;ref name="kirit-1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kelegama, Saman|author2=Parikh, Kirit|title=Political Economy of Growth and Reforms in South Asia|year=2000|version=Second Draft|url=http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC12473.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211121955/http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC12473.htm|archivedate=11 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five-Year Plans of India]] resembled central planning in the [[Soviet Union]]. Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name="staley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/36682.html|title=The Rise and Fall of Indian Socialism: Why India embraced economic reform|author=Sam Staley|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying [[red tape]], commonly referred to as [[Licence Raj]], were required to set up business in [[India]] between 1947 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm Street Hawking Promise Jobs in Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329023451/http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm |date=29 March 2008 }}, [[The Times of India]], 25 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Before the process of reform began in 1991, the government attempted to close the Indian economy to the outside world. The Indian currency, the [[Indian rupee|rupee]], was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India: 1991 country economic memorandum |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962181468033534646/pdf/multi0page.pdf |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India also operated a system of [[central planning]] for the economy, in which firms required licences to invest and develop. The labyrinthine bureaucracy often led to absurd restrictions—up to 80 agencies had to be satisfied before a firm could be granted a licence to produce and the state would decide what was produced, how much, at what price and what sources of capital were used. The government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories. The central pillar of the policy was [[import substitution]], the belief that India needed to rely on internal markets for development, not international trade—a belief generated by a mixture of socialism and the experience of colonial exploitation. Planning and the state, rather than markets, would determine how much investment was needed in which sectors.|[[BBC]]&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt;}}

===Pre-1991 liberalisation attempts===
Attempts were made to liberalise the economy in 1966 and 1985. The first attempt was reversed in 1967. Thereafter, a stronger version of socialism was adopted. The second major attempt was in 1985 by prime minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. The process came to a halt in 1987, though a 1967 style reversal did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete history &amp; analysis of liberalisation episodes in India, see: Sharma, Chanchal Kumar (2011) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14736489.2011.574550 A Discursive Dominance Theory of Economic Reforms Sustainability]." ''India Review'' (Routledge, UK) 126–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 80s, the government led by [[Rajiv Gandhi]] started light reforms. The government slightly reduced Licence Raj and also promoted the growth of the telecommunications and software industries.&lt;ref&gt;History of Computing in India: 1955–2010, Rajaraman, V.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chandra Shekhar Singh]] government (1990–1991) took several significant steps towards the much needed reforms and laid its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epaper.newindianexpress.com/c/8158805 | title=New Indian Express | accessdate=18 January 2016 | website=New Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevailing situation during 1980s===
* The low annual growth rate of the [[economy of India]] before 1980, which stagnated around 3.5% from 1950s to 1980s, while per capita income averaged 1.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/redefining-the-hindu-rate-of-growth/104268/|title=Redefining The Hindu Rate of Growth|work=The Financial Express }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Pakistan]] grew by 5%, [[Indonesia]] by 9%, [[Thailand]] by 9%, [[South Korea]] by 10% and [[Taiwan]] by 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/50yrs/kapur.htm|title=Industry passing through phase of transition|publisher=The Tribune India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Only four or five licences would be given for steel, electrical power and communications. Licence owners built up huge powerful empires.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/55427.stm|title=India: the economy|publisher=BBC  | date=12 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A huge private sector emerged. State-owned enterprises made large losses.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt;
* Income Tax Department and Customs Department became inefficient in checking tax evasion.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2016}}
* Infrastructure investment was poor because of the public sector monopoly.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt;
* Licence Raj established the "irresponsible, self-perpetuating bureaucracy that still exists throughout much of the country"&lt;ref name="makar"&gt;{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corruption flourished under this system.&lt;ref name="astaire"/&gt;

The fruits of liberalisation reached their peak in 2006, when India recorded its highest GDP growth rate of 9.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html#Econ |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, India became the second fastest growing major economy in the world, next only to China.&lt;ref name="astaire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |title=The India Report |publisher=Astaire Research |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114195859/http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth rate has slowed significantly in the first half of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18275858 |title=India growth rate slows to 5.3% in first quarter |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report states that the average growth rate 7.5% will double the average income in a decade, and more reforms would speed up the pace.&lt;ref name="oecdindia2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf|title=Economic survey of India 2007: Policy Brief|publisher=OECD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606000000/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy then rebounded to 7.3% growth in 2014–15.

===Crisis===
{{Main|1991 India economic crisis}}
By 1991, India still had a fixed [[exchange rate]] system, where the rupee was pegged to the value of a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having [[balance of payments]] problems since 1985, and by the end of 1990, the state of India was in a serious [[economic crisis]]. The government was close to default,&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/Ghosh%20-%20India.pdf India's Pathway through Financial Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112080531/http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/Ghosh%20-%20India.pdf |date=12 November 2011 }}.

It had to pledge 20 tonnes of gold to Union Bank of Switzerland and 47 tonnes to Bank of England as part of a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Most of the economic reforms were forced upon India as a part of the IMF bailout.&lt;ref name = "reform"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/29/world/economic-crisis-forcing-once-self-reliant-india-to-seek-aid.html Economic Crisis Forcing Once Self-Reliant India to Seek Aid], New York Times, 29 June 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|A Balance of Payments crisis in 1991 pushed the country to near bankruptcy. In return for an IMF bailout, gold was transferred to London as collateral, the rupee devalued and economic reforms were forced upon India. That low point was the catalyst required to transform the economy through badly needed reforms to unshackle the economy. Controls started to be dismantled, tariffs, duties and taxes progressively lowered, state monopolies broken, the economy was opened to trade and investment, [[private sector enterprise]] and competition were encouraged and [[globalisation]] was slowly embraced. The reforms process continues today and is accepted by all political parties, but the speed is often held hostage by coalition politics and vested interests.|India Report, Astaire Research&lt;ref name="astaire"/&gt;}}

==Liberalisation of 1991 and World Bank loan==

In response, Prime Minister [[Narasimha Rao]], along with his finance minister [[Manmohan Singh]], initiated the [[Economic reforms in India|economic liberalisation of 1991]]. The reforms did away with the [[Licence Raj]], reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of [[foreign direct investment]] in many sectors.{{sfn|Task Force Report|2006|pp=7–8}} Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained the same, although no government has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers, on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]].&lt;ref name="Gandhi-2"&gt;{{cite news|title=That old Gandhi magic|date= 27 November 1997|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=107076|accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, India had progressed towards a free-market economy, with a substantial reduction in state control of the economy and increased financial liberalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|p=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents.{{sfn|Task Force Report|2006|pp=17–20}} 

On 12 November 1991, based on an application from the Government of India, World Bank sanctioned a structural adjustment loan / credit that consisted of two components - an IBRD loan of $250 million to be paid over 20 years, and an IDA credit of SDR 183.8 million (equivalent to $250 million) with 35 years maturity, through India's ministry of finance, with the President of India as the borrower. The loan was meant primarily to support the government's program of stabilization and economic reform. This specified deregulation, increased foreign direct investment, liberalization of the trade regime, reforming domestic interest rates, strengthening capital markets (stock exchanges), and initiating public enterprise reform (selling off public enterprises).&lt;ref name="1991wbreport"&gt;{{cite web |title=World bank report P-5678-IN - report of the IBRD and IDA on a proposed structural adjustment loan to India |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999451468260069468/pdf/multi0page.pdf |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank official website |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later reforms==
{{Expand list|date=April 2009}}
* The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP)–[[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] administration surprised many by continuing reforms, when it was at the helm of affairs of India for six years, from 1998–99 and from 1999–2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ_Articles/India/India_Rodrik_DeLong.PDF|title=India Since Independence: An Analytic Growth Narrative|author=J. Bradford DeLong|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The BJP-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] Coalition began privatising under-performing government owned business including hotels, [[VSNL]], [[Maruti Suzuki]], and airports, and began reduction of taxes, an overall [[fiscal policy]] aimed at reducing deficits and debts and increased initiatives for public works.
* The [[United Front (India)|United Front]] government attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and [[political instability]] created [[economic stagnation]].
* Towards the end of 2011, the Congress-led UPA-2 Coalition Government initiated the introduction of 51% [[Foreign Direct Investment]] in retail sector. But due to pressure from fellow coalition parties and the opposition, the decision was rolled back. However, it was approved in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/govt-approves-51-fdi-in-multi-brand-retail_60309.html |title=End of policy paralysis: Govt approves 51% FDI in multi-brand retail |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the early months of 2015, the second BJP-led NDA Government under [[Narendra Modi]] further opened up the insurance sector by allowing up to 49% FDI. This came seven years after the previous government attempted and failed to push through the same reforms and 16 years after the sector was first opened to foreign investors up to 26% under the first BJP-led NDA Government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/p78kNkYr1XPA92LXLUwoBP/Insurance-Bill-passed-in-Rajya-Sabha.html |title= Parliament passes insurance bill in a major boost to Modi's reforms agenda|publisher=livemint.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second BJP-led NDA Government also opened up the coal industry through the passing of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill of 2015. It effectively ended the Indian central government's monopoly over the mining of coal, which existed since nationalization in 1973 through socialist controls. It has opened up the path for private, foreign investments in the sector, since Indian arms of foreign companies are entitled to bid for coal blocks and licences, as well as for commercial mining of coal. This could result in billions of dollars investments by domestic and foreign miners. The move is also beneficial to the state-owned Coal India Limited, which may now get the elbow room to bring in some much needed technology and best practices, while opening up prospects of a better future for millions of mine workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rajya-sabha-passes-coal-mining-bill-coal-mines-bill-2015-budget-session-of-parliament/1/424931.html |title= Parliament boost to Modi's plans: Coal, mining bills passed by Rajya Sabha|publisher=indiatoday.intotoday.in |date= |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2016 budget session of Parliament, the Narendra Modi led BJP Government pushed through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The Code creates time-bound processes for insolvency resolution of companies and individuals.  These processes will be completed within 180 days.  If insolvency cannot be resolved, the assets of the borrowers may be sold to repay creditors. This law drastically eases the process of doing business, according to experts and is considered by many to be the second most important reform in India since 1991 next to the proposed GST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/bankruptcy-code-biggest-economic-reform-after-gst-finance-ministry/articleshow/52228931.cms|title=Bankruptcy code biggest economic reform after GST: Finance Ministry|date=|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 1st 2017, the BJP-led NDA Government under Narendra Modi launched the [[Goods and Services Tax (India)]]. This came years after the previous government attempted and failed to push through the same reform and 17 years after the legislation was proposed under the first BJP-led NDA Government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's administration in 2000. Touted to be India's biggest tax reform in 70 years of independence and the most important overall reform in terms of ease of doing business since 1991. GST replaces a slew of indirect taxes with a unified tax structure and is therefore set to dramatically reshape the country's 2.5 trillion dollar economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-launch-times-when-the-parliament-convened-for-a-session-at-midnight/story-c55g94ewrOMefUvQJVFSEO.html |title= GST Launch Time Midnight Parliament Session|publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:HSBC GLT PUNE.jpg|thumb|right|HSBC GLT, [[Pune]]]]
The economic liberalization of India had a multitude of impacts, some of which were positive and others negative for its people. The foreign investment in the country (including [[foreign direct investment]], [[portfolio investment]], and investment raised on international capital markets]) increased from a minuscule US$132&amp;nbsp;million in 1991–92 to $5.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 1995–96.&lt;ref name="Asiaweek"&gt;[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/96/0412/nat1.html Local industrialists against multinationals]. Ajay Singh and Arjuna Ranawana. ''[[Asiaweek]]''. Retrieved on 2 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it also enabled a number of companies like [[Enron]] to [[Dabhol Power Company|invest]] more easily in India, in over expensive projects.&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roy|first1=Sandip|title=Enron in India - The giant's first fall|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/12375/enron_in_india%3A_the_giant%27s_first_fall|accessdate=25 October 2016|agency=Pacific news Service|issue=March 2002|publisher=Outlook|date=7 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the US Senate, the largest share of foreign direct investment in India since 1992 came from Enron (more than 10%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=118High-Stakes Showdown; Enron’s Fight Over Power Plant Reverberates Beyond India |url=http://www.finance-mba.com/Dabhol_fact_sheet.pdf |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=20 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, financial institutions applauded it:

{{quotation| Its annual growth in [[GDP per capita]] accelerated from just 1¼ per cent in the three decades after Independence to 7½ per cent currently, a rate of growth that will double average income in a decade.... In service sectors where government regulation has been eased significantly or is less burdensome—such as communications, insurance, asset management and information technology—output has grown rapidly, with exports of [[information technology enabled services]] particularly strong. In those infrastructure sectors which have been opened to competition, such as [[telecoms]] and [[civil aviation]], the private sector has proven to be extremely effective and growth has been phenomenal.|[[OECD]]&lt;ref name="oecdindia2007"/&gt;}}

Election of AB Vajpayee as Prime Minister of India in 1998 and his agenda was seen as a welcome change by some. His prescription to speed up economic progress included solution of all outstanding problems with the West (Cold War related) and then opening gates for FDI investment. In three years, the West was developing a bit of a fascination to India's brainpower, powered by IT and BPO.  By 2004, the West would consider investment in India, should the conditions permit. By the end of Vajpayee's term as prime minister, a framework for the foreign investment had been established. The new incoming government of Dr. Manmohan Singh in 2004 further strengthened the required infrastructure to welcome the FDI.

Today, fascination with India is translating into active consideration of India as a destination for FDI. A study by A T Kearney named India as the second most likely destination for FDI in 2005 after China. It has displaced US to the third position. This is a great leap forward. India was at the 15th position, only a few years back. To quote the A T Kearney Study, "India's strong performance among manufacturing and telecom &amp; utility firms was driven largely by their desire to make productivity-enhancing investments in IT, business process outsourcing, research and development, and knowledge management activities".

[[OECD]] summarised the key reforms that are needed:
{{quotation|In labour markets, employment growth has been concentrated in firms that operate in sectors not covered by India's highly restrictive labour laws. In the formal sector, where these labour laws apply, employment has been falling and firms are becoming more [[capital intensive]] despite abundant low-cost labour. [[Labour market reform]] is essential to achieve a broader-based development and provide sufficient and higher productivity jobs for the growing labour force. In product markets, inefficient government procedures, particularly in some of the states, acts as a barrier to entrepreneurship and need to be improved. Public companies are generally less productive than private firms and the privatisation programme should be revitalised. A number of barriers to competition in financial markets and some of the infrastructure sectors, which are other constraints on growth, also need to be addressed. The [[indirect tax]] system needs to be simplified to create a true national market, while for direct taxes, the taxable base should be broadened and rates lowered. Public expenditure should be re-oriented towards  infrastructure investment by reducing subsidies. Furthermore, social policies should be improved to better reach the poor and—given the importance of human capital—the education system also needs to be made more efficient.|OECD&lt;ref name="oecdindia2007"/&gt;}}

{{See also|Economic disparities in India}}
According to an OECD survey of the Indian economy &lt;ref name="oecdindia2007"/&gt; states that had more liberal regulatory regimes had better economic performance. The survey also concluded that were complementary measures for better delivery of infrastructure, education and basic services implemented, they would boost employment creation and poverty reduction.

"'''Feggari Kalokerino'''" ([[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]: "'''Φεγγάρι καλοκαιρινό'''", [[English language|English]] translation: "Summer Moon") was the [[Greece|Greek]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]], performed in [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Yiannis Dimitras]].

The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Emly Starr]] with "[[Samson (song)|Samson]]" and preceding [[Cyprus]]' [[Island (band)|Island]] with "[[Monika (song)|Monika]]"). At the close of voting, the song had received 55 points, placing 8th in a field of 20.

The song is a ballad, with Dimitras telling the summer moon about how it makes him feel. He pledges, for example, to build a church "for the crazy children of love". He was accompanied on the piano by actress and pianist Sofia Houndra, who was not credited on-screen.

Greece elected not to enter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982 Contest]]. Thus, the song was succeeded as [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greek representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983 Contest]] by [[Kristi Stassinopoulou]] with [[Mou Les]].

'''Rouen-Rive-Droite''' is a large [[railway station]] serving the city of [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]], [[France]]. The station is on Rue Verte in the north of the city. Services are mainly [[Inter-city rail|intercity]] but many services are [[TER Haute Normandie|local]]. There are also [[TGV]] from [[Gare du Havre|Le Havre]] to [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille-Saint-Charles]] and to [[Gare de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]].

== History ==
The station opened its doors in 1847 when the Rouen–Le Havre section of the [[Paris–Le Havre railway]] opened to service. The line previously had its terminus at [[Gare de Rouen Saint-Sever|Rouen Rive-Gauche]]. With the increase in traffic, the construction of the new station on the North bank of the [[Seine River|River Seine]] started.  The station building was designed in [[Art Nouveau]] style by architect [[Adolphe Dervaux]], with commissioned sculpture by [[Camille Lefèvre]].  The station was inaugurated on 4 July 1928 by French President [[Gaston Doumergue]]. At first named Rue Verte, the station then changed name to Rive-Droite. In 1994 an interchange was built to serve [[Tramway de Rouen|Rouen métro]].

== Services ==
With the high-speed rail network [[TGV]], Rouen is connected to the following stations:
* [[Gare du Havre|Le Havre]] - Rouen-Rive-Droite - [[Gare de Mantes-la-Jolie|Mantes-la-Jolie]] - [[Gare de Versailles-Chantiers|Versailles-Chantiers]] - [[Gare de Massy TGV|Massy]] - [[Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu|Lyon-Part-Dieu]] - [[Gare de Valence TGV|Valence TGV]] - [[Gare d'Avignon TGV|Avignon TGV]] - [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille-Saint-Charles]]

[[File:Cratons West Gondwana.svg|thumb|right|Approximate location of [[Mesoproterozoic]] (older than 1.3&amp;nbsp;Ga) cratons in South America and Africa.]]
The '''Kalahari Craton''' is a [[craton]], an old and stable part of the [[continental lithosphere]], that occupies large portions of [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. It consists of two cratons separated by the [[Limpopo Belt]]: the larger [[Kaapvaal Craton]] to the south and the smaller [[Zimbabwe Craton]] to the north.  The [[Namaqua Belt]] is the southern margin of the Kaapvaal Craton.&lt;ref name="Zeh-etal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeh|Gerdes|Barton Jr|2009|loc=Kalahari Craton, pp. 934–935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the Kalahari Craton are now located in East (the [[Grunehogna Craton]]) and West Antarctica ([[Haag Nunataks]]) and the Falkland Islands.&lt;ref name="Jac-etal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|Pisarevsky|Thomas|Becker|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name was first introduced by {{Harvnb|Clifford|1970}}.&lt;ref name="Jac-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|Pisarevsky|Thomas|Becker|2008|loc=Introduction, pp. 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
Following a terminology introduced in 2008,&lt;ref name="Jac-intro" /&gt; the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic core of the craton is called the Proto-Kalahari Craton.  This core plus [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] Mesoproterozoic crust and dispersed non-African fragments compose the Kalahari Craton.  Before the [[Pan-African Orogeny]], the Kalahari Craton was much larger than it is today, but its [[Suture (geology)|sutures]] and therefore its extent are difficult to locate due to later [[Overprinting (geology)|overprinting]].&lt;ref name="Jac-intro" /&gt;

The Kaapvaal Craton, Zimbabwe Craton, and Limpopo Belt are made of Archaean [[terrane]]s and contain crust at least 3.2&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ga|billion year old}} and are underlain by a thick ({{Convert|250|km|abbr=on}}) layer of buoyant mantle that is producing garnets and diamonds.&lt;ref name="Zeh-etal" /&gt;

During the Palaeoproterozoic the northwest margin of the Archaean core grew by accretion and had formed a Proto-Kalahari Craton by 1.75&amp;nbsp;Ga.
During the period 1.4–1.0&amp;nbsp;Ga subduction occurred along the northwest margin followed by continental collisions along the eastern and southern margins.  By this time enough Mesoproterozoic crust had accreted to transform the Kalahari Craton.  At 1.11&amp;nbsp;Ga, during the assembly of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]], the Kalahari Craton was affected by the [[Umkondo-Borg Large Igneous Province]].&lt;ref name="Jac-etal" /&gt;
At {{Circa}} 1.15–.98&amp;nbsp;Ga the Kalahari Craton collided with the eastern margin of [[Laurentia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalziel|Mosher|Gahagan|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4719">'''Kekri''', also known as ''Keyri'', ''Köyri'', ''Köyry'' (in [[Torne Valley]]) and ''Kööri'', is an old annual Finnish society-fashioned [[harvest festival]], celebrated in the fall. The recognition and celebrations of Kekri were stronger when [[Finland]] was still an agricultural society, and prior to the modern Christmas culture and traditions being embedded in the Finnish society. Historically, Kekri has also referred to a god. 

Originally, the celebration of Kekri was not tied to a permanent calendar date, but – instead – was determined by the ongoing year's agricultural autumn activities. However, by the early 1800s its date stabilized at the [[All Saints' Day]], i.e. in the beginning of November.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716232314/http://www.nba.fi/fi/kansallismuseo/tapahtumat/kekri ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

In various Finnish dialects and in vernacular language, the term kekri and its cognates have been used to refer to the last thing left, residue, remnant and/or end of something, most commonly – and possibly originally – the harvest season. Historically, Kekri was a god that protected cattle. The term has also been used in reference to leprechaun/fairy, scare and scarecrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20120716232314/http://www.nba.fi/fi/kansallismuseo/tapahtumat/kekri]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his listing of Finnish gods in 1551, the Finnish author [[Mikael Agricola]] defined Kekri as a god that enhances the growth of livestock: ''"Käkri se liseis Carjan casvon"''. In his study 'Mythologica fennica' in 1789, [[Cristfried Ganander]] stated the same about Kekri, and added that the term Kekri also refers to the celebration of the end of the harvest season.&lt;ref&gt;''Otavan Suuri Ensyklopedia, Part 4'', Juusten-Kreikka, p. 2854, Otava, 1978, {{ISBN|951-1-02232-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remembrance of the dead is a similarity between the traditional celebrations of Kekri and [[Halloween]]. In the Finnic tradition of the past, each family invited their dead to their Kekri feasts, making a part of Kekri formal and serious. The second day of Kekri – however – has traditionally been more relaxed, similar in this respect to [[Boxing Day]] in the widespread modern Western Christmas tradition. In the second day of Kekri, especially in the old times, people have visited family and friends, dressed up as various types of Kekri characters. These Kekri characters of the past are commonly viewed as predecessors of the modern-day Santa Claus.

Traditionally, the end of the harvest season in Kekri has been celebrated with abundant feasts, which often have included lamb roast as one of the courses served. Various kinds of magic, spells, beliefs and myths too have also been an important part of old Kekri traditions, as well as bonfires, especially in certain parts of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20120716232314/http://www.nba.fi/fi/kansallismuseo/tapahtumat/kekri]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kekri today==

Kekri traditions began to disappear in [[Finland]] with the industrialization and urbanization of the Finnish society. Many customs and traditions associated with Kekri have since been transferred to the modern Christmas and New Year celebrations. 

Some ancient Kekri traditions have remained the longest in Eastern Finland. Today, Kekri is celebrated annually in the Eastern Finnish city of [[Kajaani]] by the burning of the so-called ''Kekri goat'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Kekripukki), built in the recent times normally by local actors and other players. The incineration of the Kekri goat is usually linked to other program and activities, such as dance and musical performances, street market, feast, etc. 

Kekri is celebrated also in other parts of Finland, for instance in the Southern Finnish island of [[Suomenlinna]], where various events are prepared annually in honor of Kekri. The celebrations typically have included abundant feasts, with lamb roast traditionally being part of the menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kekri o el primo finlandés del Halloween|url=http://michanenfinlandia.com/2016/10/29/kekri-el-primo-finlandes-del-halloween/|website=Michan en Finlandia|accessdate=30 October 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Celtic-originated [[Halloween]] has gradually begun to penetrate into the Finnish autumn feast traditions from the [[United States]], Kekri has held its ground. In part due to the celebrations of Halloween having become increasingly commercial, many Finns prefer not to have it associated with Kekri or the [[All Saints' Day]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Pyhäinpäivä).

[[Ruth Wodak]] stresses that the rise of populist parties across Europe has different reasons in different countries. In a March 2014 article she divided these parties into four groups: "parties [that] gain support via an ambivalent relationship with fascist and Nazi pasts" (e.g., in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and France), parties that "focus primarily on a perceived threat from Islam" (e.g., in the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland), parties that "restrict their propaganda to a perceived threat to their national identities from ethnic minorities" (e.g., in Hungary, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom) and parties that "endorse a fundamentalist Christian conservative-reactionary agenda" (e.g., in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wodak|first=Ruth|title=Right wing populist parties on the rise|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/03/04/right-wing-populist-parties-on-the-rise/|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]]|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[the Economist]]'', the main attraction of far-right parties in the [[Scandinavian countries]] is the national culture is under threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Culture matters more|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560294|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Different parts of Europe have nationalist parties with different ideologies and goals. Most nationalist parties in Central and Western Europe are described as "[[Right-wing populism|right-wing populists]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Continent of Fear: The Rise of Europe's Right-Wing Populists|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/continent-of-fear-the-rise-of-europe-s-right-wing-populists-a-719842.html|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]]|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations "as antisemitism was a unifying factor for far-right parties in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, Islamophobia has become the unifying factor in the early decades of the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Far right on rise in Europe, says report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/06/far-right-rise-europe-report|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 November 2011|author=Walker, Peter|author2=Taylor, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are Left Wing or Civic Nationalist Parties, which often advocate regionalism.

Nationalist parties are the ruling party in the Republic of Macedonia the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity|VMRO-DPMNE]] is one of the two major parties in the country. [[Switzerland]] is also ruled by a nationalist party by the [[Swiss People's Party]].

In all other countries, nationalist parties are in opposition. In some countries, nationalist parties are major players in politics, such as [[France]]'s [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]], [[Finland]]'s [[True Finns]], [[Estonia]]'s [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Conservative People's Party]], [[Italy]]'s [[Lega Nord]], [[Austria]]'s [[Freedom Party of Austria]] [[Hungary]]'s [[Jobbik]], [[Turkey]]'s [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], [[Greece]]'s [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] , [[Armenia]]'s [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[UK Independence Party]], [[Poland]]'s [[Law and Justice]], [[Slovakia]]'s [[Slovak National Party]], [[Denmark]]'s [[Danish People's Party]] etc.

Most, if not all, nationalist parties represented in the European Parliament are in the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] group.

===Eastern Europe and the Caucasus ===
Nationalist parties in the Eastern European states differ from the ones in Western Europe mostly by the fact that there is virtually no immigration into these countries.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Governments in Belarus and Azerbaijan are often considered totalitarian and elections in these countries have been described unfair and not free and thus the parliaments are effectively controlled by the ruling party.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==Recent Developments==

=== Slovenian Parliamentary Elections, 3 June 2018 ===
Slovenia held its [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2018|Parliamentary Elections]] to the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]] on the 3rd June, 2018, where 90 members were elected. The [[Slovenian National Party]] and [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] are the country's two nationalist, far-rightist parties and both gained seats under this election. The Slovenian Democratic Party is the largest party by seats in the National Assembly with 25, while the Slovenian National Party is the smallest party with 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volitve.gov.si/dz2018/#/rezultati|title=http://volitve.gov.si/dz2018/#/rezultati|last=d.o.o.|first=SRC|website=volitve.gov.si|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 29 seats are held by nationalist parties, up 8 seats from the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2014|last elections in 2014]]. A new Government has yet to be formed, though in any case there will be a strong nationalist sentiment in the Assembly.                          

=== United Kingdom Local Elections, 3 May 2018 ===
The United Kingdom held [[United Kingdom local elections, 2018|Local Elections]] on the 3rd of May for around a quarter of [[Local government in England|local government]] seats in England. The [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] lost 103 seats during this round of elections, showing a decline in support for local government-level nationalism in the country after the [[Brexit]] referendum of 2016.

=== Hungarian Parliamentary Elections, 8 April 2018 ===
Hungary held its [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|General Parliamentary Elections]] on the 8th April 2018, where 199 seats in the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly of Hungary]] were filled. Two nationalist parties, all far-right, emerged with seats in the new Assembly, with the new Prime Minister, [[Viktor Orbán|Viktor Orban]], being from the [[Fidesz]]-[[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]]. His party gained 133 seats, while the [[Jobbik|Jobbik-Movement for a Better Hungary Party]] gained 26 seats. This put 159 out of 199 seats in the Hungarian National Assembly under the control of nationalist parties, up 3 seats from the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|last election in 2014]].

===Italian General Elections, 4 March 2018===
Italy held its [[Italian general election, 2018|General Elections on the 4th March, 2018]], where 630 Deputies were elected to the Lower House and 315 Senators to the Upper House of the Italian Parliament. Italy's largest far-right party, the [[Lega Nord]] or "League" secured 125 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] ([[Lower house|Lower House]]) and 58 seats in the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] ([[Upper house|Upper House]]). The [[Brothers of Italy]], another nationalist party, gained 32 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 18 seats in the Senate. Italy's [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S) have also been labelled as being in the far-right. Gaining 222 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 109 seats in the Senate, that would make M5S the largest far-right group in Italy, though arguably, they are not officially a far-right group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi|title=Italian elections 2018 - full results|last=Henley|first=Jon|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-04|last2=Voce|first2=Antonio|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180206/political-election-understanding-italys-five-star-movement-m5s-di-maio-grillo|title=Political cheat sheet: Understanding Italy's Five Star Movement|date=2018-02-06|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current government, formed with Prime Minister [[Giuseppe Conte]] as its head, supported by parties including the League, the Brothers of Italy and M5S, which together contribute 379 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 185 seats in the Senate. A large portion of the Italian Government is therefore far-rightist and/or nationalist. Between them, the three parties went up by 140 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and by 20 seats in the Senate compared to the [[Italian general election, 2013|last election in 2013]].

'''Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA)''' or '''Ocean Dumping Act''' is one of several key [[environmental law]]s passed by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, {{USStatute|92|532|86|1052|1972|10|23}}. Full statute is at 86 Stat. 1052 and 1061. Titles I and II are codified at {{USC|33|1401-1445}}. Title III is codified at {{USC|16|1431-1445}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate. {{cite journal|title=Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 |url=http://epw.senate.gov/mprsa72.pdf}} (Full text)&lt;/ref&gt; The Act has two essential aims:  to regulate intentional ocean disposal of materials, and to authorize any related research.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"&gt;Claudia Copeland. Cong. Bill. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, 1999.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the MPRSA regulates the ocean dumping of waste and provides for a research program on ocean dumping, it also provides for the designation and regulation of marine sanctuaries.&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"&gt;The Office of Health, Safety and Security - Home. Web. 09 Nov. 2011.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act regulates the ocean dumping of all material beyond the territorial limit ({{convert|3|mi|km}} from shore) and prevents or strictly limits dumping material that "would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities".&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"/&gt; The MPRSA authorized the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to regulate ocean dumping of materials including, but not limited to, [[industrial waste]], [[sewage sludge]], [[biological agents]], [[Radionuclide|radioactive agents]], NBC ([[nuclear warfare|nuclear]], [[biological warfare|biological]], and [[chemical warfare|chemical]]), garbage, chemicals, and biological and laboratory, as well as other wastes, into the territorial waters of the United States through a permit program. The EPA can issue permits for dumping of materials other than dredge spoils if the agency determines, through a full public notice and process, that the discharge will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment.&lt;ref name="Other Laws to Protect Your Watershed"&gt;Other Laws to Protect Your Watershed.

==Responsible agencies==
There are four federal agencies that share responsibilities under the Ocean Dumping Act:&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt;

*[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]]
*[[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]
*[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA)]]
*[[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the primary agency that is in charge of regulating the disposal of all substances that are disposed in the ocean; this agency also authorize the research and demonstration of activities that have to do with phasing out sewage and industrial waste disposing.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agency is in charge of dredged spoils.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is in charge of the research on the changes of the marine environment that are caused by humans.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt; The U.S. Coast Guard is in charge of the surveillance of ocean dumping.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt;

The NOAA National Marine Sanctuary program manages a network of underwater areas that are protected by the US. These special bodies of water, like oceans and lakes, are protected by Congress to keep natural and cultural resources while allowing people to enjoy the waters. The Marine Protection, Research, Sanctuaries Act gives way for a national network of marine sanctuaries that are administered by NOAA. The NOAA was created in 1970 after an oil spill 30 miles of the coast of California released 235,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean. As time passes and technology advances, the NOAA has added sanctuaries all over the US. Three sites followed from 1992, with Congress designating [[Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary]] in Massachusetts and [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]] in California.

==Title I - Permit Program==

Title I of the MPRSA prohibits all ocean dumping, except that allowed by permits issued by the EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 102 of the MPRSA, in any ocean waters under U.S. jurisdiction, by any U.S. vessel, or by any vessel sailing from a U.S. port.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"&gt;Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States. Encyclopedia of Earth. Web. 09 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA designates sites for ocean dumping and specifies in each permit where the material is to be disposed.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt;

In 1973, the EPA permitted two interim chemical disposal sites in the Gulf of Mexico, as described in the report, Assessing Potential Ocean Pollutants, published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1975) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Assessing_Potential_Ocean_Pollutants.html?id=eicQOgkswusC https://books.google.com/books/about/Assessing_Potential_Ocean_Pollutants.html?id=eicQOgkswusC].  At Site A, uncontained wastes were discharged through a submerged pipe into the turbulent wake of a barge.  At Site B, waste materials were placed in barrels before discharge.  Chemical wastes discharged at these sites reportedly had various concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons, calcium and sodium metals, formaldehyde, cyanide and other metals (i.e. antimony, mercury, arsenic, zinc, manganese, and iron).  Seven permits issued by the EPA in 1973 for the period of May 1 to November 1 allowed for the disposal of 84,500 tons of uncontained waste at Site A and 208,500 waste barrels at Site B, of which 55,000 barrels contained chlorinated hydrocarbons.  By July 1973, four companies with plants at 7 locations were using Sites A and B (NAS, 1975).

Nearly all of the ocean dumping that takes place today is dredged materials at the hands of the Corps of Engineers and due to the fact that they are the entity primarily responsible for the dredging, they issue permits for ocean dumping of such materials.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; The dredged materials are sediments removed from the bottom of water bodies, but before they are dumped in the ocean, they must be evaluated to ensure that they are not harmful to human health or to the marine environment.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt;

The basic objective of the permit program is to "prevent or strictly limit the dumping into [[ocean]] waters of any material that would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the [[marine environment]], [[ecosystem]]s, or economic potentialities."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;MPRSA sec. 2(b), {{USC|33|1401(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] (through the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]]) is authorized to issue permits for dredged material disposal, and EPA is authorized to designate appropriate dump sites.

Dumping restrictions were enacted for both U.S. flag vessels and materials transported from a location outside the U.S. With respect to the latter category, dumping was prohibited within the U.S. territorial sea and the U.S. contiguous zone. A specific dumping prohibition was included for radiological, chemical and biological warfare agents, high-level [[radioactive waste]] and [[medical waste]]s. Restrictions have since been placed on dumping activities in the [[New York Bight]] Apex, and sewage sludge dumping at the "106-Mile Site" offshore of New Jersey ended in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Washington, DC (1995). [http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/mprsa/Monitoring,ResearchandSurveillanceofthe106MileDeepw.pdf "Monitoring, Research, and Surveillance of the 106-Mile Deepwater Municipal Dump Site and Environs.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205085512/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/mprsa/Monitoring%2CResearchandSurveillanceofthe106MileDeepw.pdf |date=2011-02-05 }} ''Report to Congress.'' Document no. EPA-842-R-95-001. p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for anyone to dump on US waters, they must follow certain laws. Public Law 97-424, enacted in 1983, placed a 2-year prohibition on ocean dumping of any low-level radioactive waste. Public Law 100-688 terminated the dumping of sewage sludge and waste from industrial companies (commencing with the 270th day after November 18, 1988) under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; After December 31, 1991, it was prohibited to dump any type of sewage sludge and industrial waste. This law gives EPA the authority to issue emergency permits for the dumping of industrial waste into ocean waters if an unacceptable human health risk exists and no other alternative is available.

&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Statutes authorizing appropriations to implement Title I were enacted annually through 1977 and, thereafter, in 1980, 1981, and 1988. The 1988 amendments authorized appropriations of $12 million for Title I for each of Fiscal Years 1989 through 1991.

==Title II - Research Programs==
Title II of the Act authorizes the [[Secretary of Commerce]] (through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)) to coordinate a research and monitoring program with the EPA and the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The NOAA conducts general research on ocean resources and is responsible for research on the effects of ocean dumping, pollution, overfishing, and other issues caused by humans that cause changes in the marine ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; The EPA's research is related to the phasing out of ocean disposal activities and its role includes conducting research, surveys, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, and studies to aid in their search for dumping alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;

&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; This program is designed as a long-term research program to study the "possible long-range effects of pollution, overfishing, and man-induced changes of [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s" and to conduct the research required to find dumping alternatives and to consider, in cooperation with other federal agencies, the feasibility of regional management plans for waste disposal in coastal areas. Congressional reports are required annually.

Statutes providing authority for appropriations were enacted in 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1986 and 1988. Public Law 100-627 authorized appropriations of $13.5 million for Title II for Fiscal Year 1989, and $14.5 million for Fiscal Year 1990.

==Title III - Marine Sanctuaries==

Title III allows the Secretary of Commerce to designate discrete areas as National Marine Sanctuaries after conferring with the heads of involved federal agencies and state and local governments, as appropriate.&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries"&gt;NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries: Oceans, Marine Life, Shipwrecks, Diving, Whales, Voyage to Discovery. Web. 09 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of these sanctuaries is important in helping to promote comprehensive management of their special conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational, or aesthetic resources.&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"/&gt; The importance and primary objective of a sanctuary is to protect its features and allow the ocean to be used in a natural and sustainable way.&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"/&gt; Sanctuaries provide a safe haven for endangered species, or those close to extinction, while also serving educational purposes for students and researchers alike to promote understanding and stewardship of our oceans.&lt;ref name="The Office of Health, Safety and Security"/&gt;

Public Law 96-332 provides that any marine sanctuary designation will not be effective if the Governor of an affected state finds it unacceptable, or if Congress form a concurrent of dissproval (must occur within 60 days). The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to withdraw the designation after any such State or Congressional disapproval. If the designation is not withdrawn, only the portion certified as acceptable can take effect.

==Title IV - Regional Marine Research Programs==

Title IV of the MPRSA established nine regional marine research boards for the purpose of developing comprehensive marine research plans, considering water quality and ecosystem conditions and research and monitoring priorities and objectives in each region.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt; The plans, after approval by the NOAA and EPA, are to guide NOAA in awarding research grants funds under this title of the act.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt; The Regional Marine Research Act was enacted in recognition of the value of the Nation's coastal marine waters and the need for regional research to safeguard their quality and health. The main focus of this program is to establish regional marine research programs around the country and to provide sustained federal funding for planned research within each region.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;
Five Major Sections of the [[Gulf of Maine Regional Marine Research Program]]:
1. An overview of marine environmental quality in the region.
2. An inventory of current research activities.
3. A statement of the research needs and priorities within the context of a 10-year goal.
4. An assessment of how the plan will incorporate existing research and management in the region
5. A description and schedule of the research objectives for the region during the 4-year period covered by the plan.

==Title V - National Coastal Monitoring System==

Title V launched a national coastal water quality monitoring program that directs the EPA and NOAA together to implement a long-term program to collect and analyze scientific data on the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems, including ambient water quality, health and quality of living resources, sources of environmental degradation, and data on trends.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt; Results of these actions are used to provide the information required to devise and execute effective programs under the Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Management Act.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;

==Amendments==

In 1977, Congress amended the Act to require that dumping of municipal sewage sludge or industrial wastes, which unreasonably degrade the environment, to cease by December 1981.&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; Because that deadline was not achieved, amendments were passed in 1988 that extended the deadline to December 1991.&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; In 1986 amendments, Congress directed that ocean disposal of all wastes end at the traditional 12-mile site off the New York/New Jersey coast and that they be moved to a new site 106 miles offshore.&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; Congress amended the Act again in 1992, giving permission to states to adopt ocean dumping standards more stringent than federal standards and to require that permits conform with long-term management plans for designated dumpsites.&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; This amendment was put into place to ensure that permitted activities are consistent with expected uses of the site.&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt;

==Enforcement==

The violation of a permit or permit requirement carries a civil penalty of not more than $75,000 per violation that is assessed by the EPA.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; The organization is also authorized to assess criminal penalties that carry fines up to $250,000, 5 years in prison, or both for violations of the act.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; Additionally, fines are assessed for ocean dumping of medical wastes that carry the same penalties previously listed.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt; Like many other federal environmental laws, the Ocean Dumping Act allows individuals to bring a citizen suit in U.S. district court against any person, including the United States, for violation of a permit or other prohibition, limitation, or criterion issued under title I of the Act.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act a Summary of the Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, United States"/&gt;

Under certain circumstances, each of the states is permitted to regulate ocean dumping in waters within their own jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt; The Ocean Dumping Act requires that the EPA Administrator applies the standards and criteria binding upon the United States that are stated in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt; During this convention, more than 85 countries agreed in the prohibition of dumping in the ocean the next elements: mercury, cadmium and other substances such as DDT and PCBs, solid wastes and persistent plastics, oil, high-level radioactive wastes, and chemical and biological warfare agents; and requires special permits for other heavy metals, cyanides and fluorides, and medium- and low-level radioactive wastes.&lt;ref name="Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law."/&gt;

'''NBC Europe''' (formerly '''Super Channel''' and '''NBC Super Channel''') was a [[satellite television]] [[Television channel|channel]] based in the [[United Kingdom]] that broadcast across [[Europe]]. It was picked up by various European [[cable television]] networks.

==Super Channel==
[[File:Superchannel1987.jpg|thumb|left|Super Channel 1987-1993]]

Launched on 30 January 1987, replacing 24-hour music channel [[Music Box (TV channel)|Music Box]], Super Channel was co-owned by all but one of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] companies at the time in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026144848/http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_uk/091205.html|title=Broadband TV News - UK - Archive December 9, 2005|date=26 October 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgin Group]] had a majority stake in Music Box (60%) and would own 15% of the equity with the rest being split between ITV franchise holders &lt;!-- Channel seems to be the only unlisted company from this period. --&gt;including [[ITV Granada|Granada]], [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire]], [[London Weekend Television|LWT]], [[ITV Central|Central]], [[ITV Anglia|Anglia]], [[ITV Tyne Tees|Tyne Tees]], [[UTV (TV channel)|Ulster]], [[Grampian Television|Grampian]], [[Scottish Television|Scottish]], and [[ITV Border|Border Television]]. [[Thames Television]] was the only one of the ITV contractors not to participate.&lt;ref name="Chalaby"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoUAAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;vq=Super%20Channel&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Transnational Television in Europe: Reconfiguring Global Communications Networks''], Jean K. Chalaby, I.B.Tauris, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;  It competed with Sky Channel, forerunner of [[Sky1]], which was the only other major pan-European satellite-channel around at the time. Unlike Sky Channel, Super Channel's [[television syndication|syndicated]] output was less [[United States|American]] and more [[Europe]]an. Many of the programmes were what it called the "Best of British", sourced from ITV or the [[BBC]], while [[ITN]] produced news bulletins (''see also [[ITN World News]]''). It also broadcast syndicated non-British European programmes such as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Zeg 'ns Aaa]]'' (with [[English language|English]] [[subtitles]]).

Super Channel fared poorly, due to UK programming seen as unsuitable for European audiences, such as drama being seen as "too violent" or "too realistic",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xv4cAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Super+Channel%22&amp;dq=%22Super+Channel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihroaI99LUAhUHAsAKHWooCOkQ6AEILDAB ''Media Information Australia''], Australian Film and Television School, 1990, age 80-, 83, 1990, Issues 55-58&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a dispute with the British actors unions who demanded additional fees for viewing by European audiences which meant that it could no longer offer the 'Best of British to a European audience'.&lt;ref name="Chalaby"/&gt; 

Within a year, the ITV companies sold the channel to the [[Italy|Italian]] Marcucci family, owners of [[Videomusic]], the first music channel in Italy, with a minority stake being held by [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin plc]], and the programming changed from British to pan-European, although it continued carrying ITN's World News bulletins.

At the beginning Super Channel was based in the heart of London, 19-22 Rathbone Place, London W1P 1DF, in the same building as [[Music Box (TV channel)|Music Box]]; the building would later become the home of [[CNN International]] until 2007. For a number of months the channel's transmission facilities were provided by Molinare at Fouberts Place, London W1 until the Marcucci family acquired Melrose House, 14 Lanark Square, in [[Limeharbour]] (London) where it set up a state of the art transmission facility.

In 1996 the channel (along with its sister channel [[CNBC Europe]]) was transmitted from the GE building in Hammersmith, London. The transmission suite used cutting edge (at the time) Pro-Bel COMPASS and MAPP automation, and Profile video servers for all commercials and promotions. Programmes continued to be played from tape, however.

==NBC steps in==
[[File:NBC Super Channel 1994.jpg|thumb|NBC Super Channel 1993-1996]]
In 1993, the station was having financial difficulties, and was taken over by the [[United States|American]] company [[General Electric]], then-parent of the [[NBC]] [[television network]], and became '''NBC Super Channel'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DE1238F931A35753C1A965958260|title=COMPANY NEWS; NBC to Control Super Channel|first=|last=Reuters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the channel was renamed '''NBC Europe''', but was, from then on, almost always referred to as simply "NBC" on the air.

Most of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe, but after 10 pm [[Central European Time]] on weekday evenings, the channel aired ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'', hence its slogan "Where the Stars Come Out at Night." Most [[NBC News]] programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', ''[[Time and Again (TV series)|Time and Again]]'' and ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', which was aired live. ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' was also initially shown live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast the following morning instead, by which time it was more than half a day old. That meant that all news portions had to be replaced with European updates produced by [[ITN]] in London. [[ITN]] also supplied the network with the main European newscasts before and after the [[General Electric|GE]] takeover. The European weather was produced by the [[BBC]] at first, but was later taken over by [[NBC]] in the U.S.

NBC Europe carried virtually no [[prime time]] fiction entertainment programs shown on [[NBC]] in the US, because they were usually owned and distributed by other studios under the [[fin-syn]] rules (which did not apply for Europe). [[NBC]] would have had to buy the rights for each country in order to show them on NBC Europe, which would have been too expensive. Even for shows that [[Universal Television|NBC Studios]] owned itself, it was generally more financially viable to sell the rights country by country either to broadcast or cable/satellite channels than to air them on NBC Europe. The most notable exceptions to this rule were brief runs of ''[[Profiler (TV series)|Profiler]]'' and ''[[The Pretender (TV series)|The Pretender]]'', as well as short-lived US sitcoms ''[[Union Square (television)|Union Square]]'' and ''[[Mr. Rhodes]]''. That is widely considered to be one of the main reasons why NBC Europe was ultimately not a success.

== NBC Europe as a German network ==
[[File:GIGA real.jpg|thumb|Studio of news programme "GIGA Real"]]

NBC Europe stopped broadcasting to most of Europe in 1998, when the DFA (Deutsche Fernsehnachrichten Agentur) took it over and moved it to [[Düsseldorf]]. Most of the satellite feeds of NBC Europe became either National Geographic or CNBC. NBC Europe continued to operate on the German cable TV, fed by one digital satellite link from Eutelsat II-F1 (later Hotbird 5). In November 1998 the first German programming started airing. Programming was assembled with content from [[GIGA Television|GIGA]] and [[CNBC Europe]], as well as other shows. In 2004, [[NBC Universal]] took over the DFA and consequently NBC Europe.

On 29 September 2005 NBC Europe was split into [[GIGA Television|GIGA]] and the new channel [[Das Vierte]]. NBC Europe was replaced by Das Vierte. In fact Das Vierte is still broadcasting with the licence of NBC Europe on [[Cable television|cable TV]]; on satellite, IPTV and digital cable it is a new channel. Das Vierte broadcasts a special version on cable TV, including [[CNBC Europe]], and from 29 September 2005 to 31 March 2006, also [[GIGA Television|GIGA]]. This is necessary to keep the licence and the cable channel.

==Programming==

Due to limitations on the amount of entertainment programming on the network, ''NBC Europe'' aired a number of original programming in tandem with [[United States|American]] programming that had not been aired in Europe beforehand. These programmes include:

'''OSIRIS''' ('''Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System''') is the main scientific imaging system on the orbiter of the [[ESA]] spacecraft [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]. It was built by a consortium led by the German [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]].

OSIRIS was approved as an instrument for the spacecraft in 1996.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/sci-fmi/35973-osiris/ Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System], Last Update: 06 September 2013, ESA Science &amp; Technology&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2004 on Rosetta and was used until that mission concluded with the deactivation of the Rosetta spacecraft on the comet 67/P in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://livestream.com/ESA/rosettagrandfinale |title=Rosetta Grand Finale |work=[[Livestream]] |time=01:02:19-01:13:35 |date=30 September 2016 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt;

The OSIRIS has two cameras with different fields of view, but each is a digital camera using a CCD.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt; Each camera has a resolution of 2048 by 2048 pixels and uses the same type of CCD.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt; The CCD's are supported by two Digital Signal Processors that use solid state memory.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt; The computer used the VIRTUOSO operating system.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt;

OSIRIS is two cameras in one instrument:&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt;
*Narrow angle camera with a [[field of view]] of  2.4 by 2.4 degrees
*Wide angle camera with a field of view of 12 by 12 degrees

It was launched on the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004, and first used in space in May 2004.&lt;ref name=sciesa35973 /&gt;

[[Image:Quartiers de Novi Sad - Sremska Kamenica.png|thumb|250px|Map of the urban area of Novi Sad with city quarters, showing the location of Paragovo within Sremska Kamenica]]
'''Paragovo''' ([[Cyrillic]]: Парагово) is a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the urban area of [[Novi Sad]] and one of the neighborhoods of [[Sremska Kamenica]], in [[Serbia]].

It is located between three hills, [[Popovica]] on the west and [[Glavica, Sremska Kamenica|Glavica]] and [[Čardak, Sremska Kamenica|Čardak]] on the east; at the entrance of Sremska Kamenica, from [[Ruma]] and [[Fruška Gora]]. Paragovo is connected to Sremska Kamenica and Novi Sad by bus line No.72.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, Paragovo has had a [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. This part of Novi Sad has seen rapid growth during the 1990s, when many people from [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] came into Novi Sad. Today, Paragovo has approximately 300 to 500 inhabitants.

The '''escudo''' was the currency of [[Portuguese Guinea]] between 1914 and 1975. It was equal to the [[Portuguese escudo]] and replaced the [[Portuguese Guinea real|real]] at a rate of 1000 réis = 1 escudo. The escudo was subdivided into 100 ''centavos''. [[Portugal]] issued banknotes (starting in 1914) and coins (starting in 1933) for use in Portuguese Guinea. Following independence, the [[Guinea Bissau peso|peso]] replaced the escudo at par.

==Coins==
In 1933, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 escudo. Coins of 2½, 10 and 20 escudos were added in 1952, with 5 escudos coins introduced in 1973.

==Banknotes==
In 1914, notes were issued by the [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 centavos. In 1921, larger denominations, from 1 escudo up to 100 escudos, were introduced. 500 escudos notes were first issued in 1945, with 1000 escudos notes introduced in 1964.

'''Rai Internazionale Radio''', formerly known as ''Rai Italia Radio'', ''Rai International Radio'', ''Rai Satelradio'' and ''Raitalia Radio'', was the official [[international broadcast]] radio service of Rai Internazionale, a subsidiary owned by [[RAI]], Italy's public broadcaster.

==History==
Rai Internazionale Radio has been broadcasting from [[Rome]] to the rest of the world for the past 72 years under various names.

In the 1930s Italy was one of the first countries to begin international [[shortwave]] broadcasts. [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the man who invented radio, oversaw the construction of the first short-wave transmitter at Prato Smeraldo outside Rome on July 1, 1930. Four years later two more transmitters were completed and broadcasts began in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] to North America. In 1935 broadcasting of programmes in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] began to South America.

In 1939, after the completion of six new transmitters, programmes in [[English language|English]] were beamed to the Far East, Europe and countries around the Mediterranean. It is from the short-wave radio centre at Rome-Prato Smeraldo that all Rai International's programmes are broadcast.

During the Second World War political and strategic motives were added to the original aim of linking Italy with the vast community of Italian migrants around the world. These new motives included international broadcasting common to all the Great Powers, beginning with the former colonial nations: [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. After Italy entered the war short-wave broadcasts were suspended following the armistice signed with the Allies on September 8, 1943, and were only resumed on September 3, 1946, with the broadcast of news bulletins in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

A 1962 law allocated management of international short-wave broadcasts, for which a special committee of the Cabinet Office is responsible, to state broadcaster Rai. As the years went by the programmes lost their character of official - sometimes even propaganda - broadcasts to become a news source that fully reflects the democratic nature of the Italian Republic. Up to the last broadcast, Radio Roma offered a comprehensive news service on Italian politics, society and culture, not least within the context of the European Union.

In 1975 the setting up of a special management section for foreign broadcasting and journalism laid the foundations for significant development of the sector. Subsequently the existing services for foreign broadcasting were expanded to include Rai International's new intercontinental television channels. In the near future Rai International is destined to be transformed into an autonomous company within state broadcaster Rai.

==Last broadcasts==
Each day Rai Internazionale's editorial team turned out ten editions of "''Italia chiama Italia News''" in [[Italian language|Italian]]: this 25-minute news programme was designed for Italian listeners throughout the world. 

The editorial team also produced ''Racconto Italiano'', ''Taccuino Italiano'', ''Tutto di Prima'' and ''Storia e Storie''.

In many countries it was possible to receive several Rai Internazionale programmes or the entire programme schedule of Rai Internazionale through local radio stations that re-transmit the signal in their own zone, on AM, FM, short wave or via cable.

On October 1, 2007, all broadcasts on short wave were discontinued and foreign language services were closed. On December 31, 2011 Rai Internazionale Radio closed down its operations.

English news items were transmitted as part of "Notturno Italiano" programme on medium wave until December 31, 2011.

==Rai Internazionale Radio==
Rai Internazionale Radio transmitted its channel online and on satellite, 24 hours a day. Thus the radio and news programmes produced by RAI were available worldwide without any special technical devices (apart from a computer and Internet connection).

Rai Internazionale Radio has broadcast the best of Rai International Radio and the three Radio Rai networks daily, 24 hours a day. This included music, information and entertainment programmes until it closed down on December 31, 2011.

The [[Roman Catholic]] '''Diocese of Sisak''' ({{lang-hr|Sisačka biskupija}}; {{lang-la|Dioecesis Sisciensis}}) is a [[Latin rite]] [[suffragan diocese]] in the [[Ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Zagreb]], in [[Sisak-Moslavina]] region, [[Croatia]].
 
Its [[cathedral]] episcopal see is Katedrala Uzvišenja sv. Križa, dedicated to [[Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], in the city of [[Sisak]], &lt;br&gt;which also has a [[Minor basilica]]: Bazilika Sv. Kvirina, dedicated to Saint martyr [[Quirinus of Sescia]] (the first bishop).

==History==
* Established in the 3rd century as '''Diocese of [[Siscia]]''' (the Roman Sisak). Although Siscia became the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia Savia]] (the southwestern quarter of Pannonia), it was not raised to Metropolitan status. Its history remains sketchy. 
* By the 7th century it may already have become extinct, its territory being taken over by the then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zagreb|Diocese of Zagreb]], its future Metropolitan (promoted 1852) around the 10th century, the Sisak see being formally suppressed no later than the 11th century. 
* In May 1999, the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Episcopal [[titular bishopric]] of Sisak (Curiate Italian) / Siscia (Latin) / 錫薩克 (正體中文) / Siscien(sis) (Latin adjective), but would only have a single incumbent, of the higher archiepiscopal rank. 
* On 5 December 2009 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] re-erected the residential '''Diocese of Sisak''', resurrecting the titular title and splitting (back) off its present territory from its Metropolitan, the [[Archdiocese of Zagreb]], an unusual instance of a titular diocese of the Catholic Church becoming a residential one again. On the same day the Pope erected the new [[Diocese of Bjelovar-Križevci]], also within the Ecclesiastical province of Zagreb in Croatia.

== Statistics ==
As per 2014, it pastorally served 163,844 Catholics (82.7% of 198,156 total) on 5,500&amp;nbsp;km² in 77 parishes with 63 priests (43 diocesan, 20 religious), 102 lay religious (20 brothers, 82 sisters) and 8 seminarians.

USA-50 was launched at 22:55:01 UTC on 24 January 1990, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D191, flying in the 6925 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-50 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2.htm|title=GPS-2 (Navstar-2)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1990, USA-50 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20087|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20275|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.92 minutes, and 54.6 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a mass of {{convert|840|kg}}, and generated 710 watts of power.&lt;ref name="NSSDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1990-008A|title=Navstar 2-06|publisher=US National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; and was retired from service on 18 August 2000.
