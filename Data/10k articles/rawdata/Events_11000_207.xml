[[File:Mersin Mediterranean Games 2013.jpg|thumb|320px|Poster of the Mediterranean Games in Mersin]]
The '''2013 Mediterranean Games''' ({{lang-tr|2013 Akdeniz Oyunları}}), officially known as the '''XVII Mediterranean Games''' (''XVII Akdeniz Oyunları''), was an international [[multi-sport event]] held in the tradition of the [[Mediterranean Games]], as governed by the [[International Committee of Mediterranean Games]] (ICMG) ({{lang-fr|Comité international des Jeux méditerranéens}}). The host city of the Games was [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]], as announced after an on-line poll conducted on 23 February 2011 by the ICMG. The games were held from 20 to 30 June 2013. Mersin is the second city in Turkey after [[İzmir]] to host the Mediterranean Games. All 24 member [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs) of the ICMG participated in the Games. The official programme for the Games is featuring events in 27 different sports.

==Background==
The Mediterranean Games is a multi-sport event, much like the [[Summer Olympics]] (albeit on a much smaller scale), with participation exclusively from countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] where Europe, Africa and Asia meet. The Games started in 1951 and are held every four years. The idea of holding the Mediterranean Games originated with [[Muhammed Taher Pasha]], who was the chairman of the [[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] and the vice-president of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), at a meeting during the [[1948 London Olympics]]. The Games "were designed specifically to bring together the Muslim and European countries surrounding the Mediterranean basin" to promote understanding through sporting competition.&lt;ref name="Background"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133501226.html | title=Where Muslim, European nations compete; The 21-nation Mediterranean Games open Friday night in Spain | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] via [[HighBeam Research]] | author=Abend, Lisa | author2=Pingree, Geoff  | date=24 June 2005 | accessdate=18 January 2013}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cijm.org.gr/en/history | title=History&amp;nbsp;– Les Jeux Mediterraneens | publisher=Cijm.org.gr.

The first edition of the Mediterranean Games was held in the Egyptian city of [[Alexandria]] in 1951 and attracted 734 competitors from 10 nations. Initially the female athletes were not allowed to compete. Beginning by the fifth (1976) game in Tunis female athletes were also allowed. Turkey hosted the Games for the first time in [[1971 Mediterranean Games|1971]] in Izmir—the sixth edition of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cijm.org.gr./en/mediteranean-games | title=Mediterranean Games | publisher=Cijm.org.gr.

Cities from three countries submitted their bids to host the 2013 Mediterranean Games. Two Greek cities, [[Volos]] and [[Larisa]], made a combined bid. This was the fourth attempt by the Croatian city of [[Rijeka]] to host the Mediterranean Games. Rijeka had lost its bids in 1995 for the [[1997 Mediterranean Games|1997 games]], in 1999 for the [[2001 Mediterranean Games|2001 games]] and in 2003 for the [[2009 Mediterranean Games]].&lt;ref name="APW1"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-85892752.html | title=Disappointment in Croatia as it loses 2009 Med Games bid | publisher=Associated Press Worldstream via [[HighBeam Research]] | date=18 October 2003 | accessdate=20 January 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting for the selection of the host of the 2013 Games was held in [[Pescara]], Italy, host of the [[2009 Mediterranean Games]], on 27 October 2007. The election was conducted by the Mediterranean Games Bid Committee. At the end of the first round of voting, only Volos-Larisa and Rijeka remained; Mersin was eliminated after having received only thirteen votes. In the first round, Volos-Larisa and Rijeka received 31 and 24 votes, respectively. In the second round, the Greek bid of Volos-Larisa received enough votes to be elected as the host. The final round was comparatively more competitive, which was demonstrated by a three-vote difference between the final two bids.&lt;ref name="GreekBid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=21943 |title=Greece to host 2013 Mediterranean Games |publisher=Greekembassy.org.

Greece was stripped of the hosting rights on 28 January 2011 because of its [[Greek government-debt crisis|financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Greece loses Games"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-68a54432452d48048ef3e274b2694dfd.html | title=Greece loses Mediterranean Games over budget cuts | agency=[[Associated Press|AP Worldstream]] via [[HighBeam Research]] | author=Nicholas, Paphitis  | date=28 January 2011 | accessdate=18 January 2013}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICMG cited Greece's inability to conform the organisational requirements as a reason for this action. [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Greece)|Culture and Tourism Minister of Greece]] [[Pavlos Geroulanos]] said that the initially proposed budget "would have wasted money on a big, spendthrift party, [and that] [t]here are much better things [they] could spend that money on in the current situation".&lt;ref name="Greece loses Games" /&gt; ICMG conducted an on-line poll on 23 February 2011 to decide the new host. Three cities—[[Tarragona]], [[Tripoli]] and Mersin—offered to host the 2013 Mediterranean Games. Citizens of the 21 member nations of the ICMG cast their votes to select the host. Mersin was selected after it received more than half of the total votes, and on 4 March 2011, ICMG president Amar Addad officially handed over the hosting rights of the 2013 Games to Mersin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-250125601.html | title=Mediterranean Games go to Mersin after Debt-Ridden Greece Loses | agency=[[Cihan News Agency]] via [[HighBeam Research]] | date= 24 February 2011 | accessdate=18 January 2013}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cijm.org.gr/en/news/173-jeux-mediterraneens-qmersin-2013q | title=Mediterranean Games "Mersin 2013" | accessdate=18 January 2013 | publisher=Cijm.org.gr.

===Organising committee===
The organising committee of the 2013 Mediterranean Games consists of eight members: president of the committee is Minister of Youth and Sports [[Suat Kılıç]], Hakan Hakyemez, Governor of Mersin [[Hasan Basri Güzeloğlu]], Mehmet Baykan, Mersin Metropolitan Municipality Mayor [[Macit Özcan]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Mersin University]] K. Aydin Süha, Hasan Albayrak and president of the [[Turkish Olympic Committee]] [[Uğur Erdener]]. It is in charge of "organising and controlling the essential preparations".&lt;ref name="Organising committee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersin2013.gov.tr/detay/5024/HAZIRLIK-VE-DUZENLEME-KURULU.html |title=Organizing Committee |publisher=Mersin2013.gov.tr.

===Costs===
After the success of the bid in February 2011, the Ministry of Youth and Sports spent {{Turkish lira}} 215 million on building the venues and infrastructure up to 31 December 2012. The Ministry has allocated a budget of {{Turkish lira}} 400 million to cover building the venues and infrastructure for the Games; at least {{Turkish lira}} 100 million would be spent on the development of the Games village and the main stadium, and {{Turkish lira}} 200 million is assigned for other venues.&lt;ref name="Cost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/digersporlar/22339767.asp |title=Mersin Akdeniz Oyunları'na hazır |work=[[Hürriyet]] |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2013 |location=[[Istanbul]] |quote=Mersin'de, 20–30 Haziran tarihlerinde düzenlenecek Akdeniz Oyunları için tesisler 13 ayda test kullanıma hazır hale gelecek |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DocX1JzM?url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/digersporlar/22339767.asp |archivedate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo and mascot===
[[File:Mascot of the 2013 Mediterranean Games.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Karetta, mascot of the Games]]
The official logo of this edition of the Mediterranean Games features a [[loggerhead sea turtle]] (''Caretta caretta'') getting out of sea, with water underneath it. An orange is shown above its back, which represents the dry summer subtropical [[Mediterranean climate|climate of Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="Logo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mersin2013.gov.tr/detay/5046/Kurumsal-Kimlik.html | title=Organization&amp;nbsp;– Corporate Identity | publisher=Mersin2013.gov.tr.

==Sports==
There are significant changes in the programme for the Mersin Games in comparison to that of the 2009 Mediterranean Games held in Pescara. Three new sports, [[archery]], [[badminton]] and [[taekwondo]], are the special additions. The programme for the Games will feature a total of 27 different sports. Two [[disabled sports]]—athletics and swimming—will also be contested by the athletes with [[physical disabilities]]. Even though it was planned, equestrian competitions will not be held.

Brower survived and was rescued by members of the public and taken to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://architecturenow.co.nz/articles/luck-played-no-part-in-this/#img=0 |title=Colombo Street's lone survivor has sparked policy change |work=Architecture Now |access-date=12 October 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in 2011, Brower testified at the [[Royal Commission#New Zealand|Royal Commission of Inquiry]] into building performance in the Canterbury earthquakes. She also made a submission and spoke to the Parliamentary Select Committee considering the Commission's recommendations twice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She also wrote a number of opinion pieces which explained her policy recommendations and were published in the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=11495333|title=Ann Brower: Earthquake risk?

In September 2015, [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], the Minister for Building and Housing, invited Brower to join him when he announced changes to the Building Act which were a result of Brower's advocacy: unreinforced buildings with façades and verandas that are in public spaces frequented by pedestrians and vehicles would be required to be assessed and repaired in half the normal time. Smith called Brower a "true New Zealand hero"; Mayor of Christchurch [[Lianne Dalziel]] also recognised Brower's bravery and persistence in pressing for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/71679073/government-halves-timeframe-to-fix-most-dangerous-buildings|title=Government halves timeframe to fix most dangerous buildings|website=Stuff|access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Williams fought hard for a new enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, her actions being prompted by the death of her own son Kevin at  Hillsborough, who had been crushed to death in the disaster.

The '''BOSS GP''' is a [[Motorsport#Motor racing|motor racing]] series in [[Europe]]. The category originated in 1995 as the BOSS series and evolved into the '''EuroBOSS Series'''.

'''BOSS''' is an [[acronym]] that stands for Big Open Single Seaters.

== History ==
[[File:Indy cars at Turn Eight at Road America.JPG|thumb|right|Group 9 BOSS cars racing at [[Road America]], 2007]]

The BOSS series was founded in 1995 under the regulations of the [[RAC Motor Sports Association]] and raced mainly in Great Britain. Later it was renamed to ''European BOSS'' (shortened by the competitors to EuroBOSS) following the involvement of [[Paul Stoddart]]'s European Aviation and their expansion into European circuits. It mainly saw grids of around 12–15 cars but on occasions dropped as few as five cars have competed. Common EuroBOSS entries include [[Formula One]] machines from [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]], [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], [[Minardi]] and on occasions a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] has appeared. Other frequent entrants are [[Lola Cars|Lola]] and [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]] chassis, the 1997-2002 [[Panoz, LLC|Panoz]] (aka G-Force) and [[Dallara]] [[IndyCar]] chassis, and from 2012, the 2003-2011 Dallara and Panoz [[Champ Car]] chassis after the new INDYCAR formula began. The Panoz Champ Car DP01 chassis from 2007 is also now legal.

After the 2009 season, drivers Marijn van Kalmthout, Klaas Zwart, Henk de Boer and Frits van Eerd decided to split off and organize their own race series. For 2010 EuroBOSS and BOSS GP both existed. EuroBOSS saw small fields and decided to cancel the last 3 rounds. BOSS GP, on the other hand, flourished with many drivers making the switch to the new series. Subsequently most of the entries have been recent secondary level single seaters such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]] cars and [[Renault World Series]] cars with a small number of Formula 1 cars. As of 2013 two rounds of the BOSS GP series form an official German championship sanctioned by the [[DMSB]].

==Similar series==
EuroBOSS is the European equivalent of USBOSS and OZBOSS. EuroBOSS tends to have mainly F1 Cars, while USBOSS mainly comprises Indy and [[Champ Car]]s and OZBOSS tends to have [[Formula Holden|Formula 4000]] or equivalent.

==Cars==

Over the years the classes have been updated. Nowadays relative new cars like the [[Dallara]] GP2/08 ([[GP2 Series|GP2]]), Dallara T08 ([[World Series by Renault|WSbR]]) and [[A1 Grand Prix car#Lola-Zytek car (2005–06 to 2007–08)|Lola B05/52]] (A1GP/Auto GP/FA1) are allowed in the series. For 2010 EuroBOSS allowed the [[Tatuus N.T07]] [[International Formula Master]] car to race in the series. The car was never allowed in the BOSS GP series.

'''B Street Theatre''' is a [[501(c) organization|501c3 non-profit]] theater located in [[Sacramento]], California. It was founded by actor [[Timothy Busfield]] in 1986 as Theatre for Children, Inc., the company’s first focus was a touring theatre company for children.&lt;ref&gt;http://23blast.com/1/timothy-busfield/&lt;/ref&gt;  The B Street Theatre School Tour (formerly known as Fantasy Theatre) was and continues to be extremely popular in the community— performing 12 times per week, 38 weeks a year. The School Tour has received critical acclaim by the media and educators.  It is estimated that 3.6 million California children (currently about 200,000 per year) have attend performances since B Street Theatre's inception. For many children, The B Street Theatre School Tour is their only exposure to the live theatre in Northern California.

In 1991, in an effort to broaden the success of B Street Theatre School Tour, Timothy Busfield and his brother Buck Busfield created B Street Theatre. Most of the plays produced each year are world, national, West Coast or regional premieres. B Street Theatre has been named Best Live Theatre (14 consecutive years) by The Sacramento News &amp; Review and Best Performing Arts Organization 13 times by Sacramento Magazine; B Street Theatre performs to approximately 70,000 adults annually.

In 2002, the company embarked on a third endeavor to allow families to experience live, professional theatre together. The B Street Theatre Family Series produces a four-show season of professional theatre presenting plays for school field trips during the week and the general public on weekends. Curriculum materials are developed for each Family Series production, and teachers are encouraged to develop classroom lessons based on themes from each play.

In addition to a professional touring theatre, B Street School Tour holds an annual playwriting festival and contest.&lt;ref&gt;http://fox40.com/2015/11/17/b-street-theatre-youth-writers-workshops/&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was created to provide a forum for the dramatic voice of youth and to conduct playwriting workshops that assist children in developing literary skills, problem- solving techniques, and a mode of artistic expression. This process stimulates the intellect and enhances self-esteem by providing validation of creative ideas and work support

'''''B Street Theatre School Tour''''' For more than 20 years the mission of the B Street School Tour has been to provide entertainment to children while encouraging in them a love for the theatre and a specific appreciation for the art of playwriting. In addition to a professional touring theatre, B Street School Tour offers playwriting workshops and a playwriting contest for children in public and private schools, hospitals, and other locations throughout Northern California.
An average of 450 children attend each performance, (with 12 performances a week, 37 weeks a year more than 200,000 children experience live theatre each year). A concerted outreach effort is made to ensure that the rich experience of theatre is provided to underserved communities. Children experience a variety of theatrical styles as well as a wide range of thematic ideas, from social commentary and family drama to satire and farce.

The playwriting contest was created to provide a forum for the dramatic voice of youth and playwriting workshops assist children in developing literary skills, problem-solving techniques, and increased artistic expression. This process stimulates the intellect and enhances self-esteem by providing validation of creative ideas and work efforts.

'''''B Street Theatre Mainstage''''' The B Street Theatre has been recognized as one of northern California’s top professional theatres. Seven new plays are presented each season to approximately 75,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://bstreettheatre.org/b-street-theatre-2/about-b-street/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B Street Theatre Family Series''''' The Family Series primarily serves children and their families through performances in the company’s “B2” 112-seat theater space. The Family Series is California’s only full-time, professional resident theater for children. Eight of The Family Series’ 12 weekly performances are designated for school field trips. The remaining four weekly performances are for the public. Four new plays are presented each season to approximately 25,000 school children and families.

'''''B3 Series''''' The newest series of the B Street Theatre has a more serious and dramatic focus and features new contemporary plays for the sophisticated theatregoer. The B3 Series opened with a Pulitzer Prize winning drama on September 25, 2007 and presents four to five new plays each season. The B3 Series currently operates in the B2 space at alternate times than the scheduled Family Series productions.

'''''B Street Conservatory and Studio for Young Actors''''' The B Street Conservatory provides classes in technique and scene study to adult actors discovering their unique talents. The Studio for Young Actors is a year-round theatre education program to foster creativity, confidence and team building for young people ages 7 to 17. Instructors are B Street company members who themselves have received rigorous training and have extensive regional and national acting credits.

'''''Intern Company''''' The B Street Theatre Acting Internship is an intensive 10-month program that immerses young actors in every aspect of professional theatre. Interns are recent college graduates seeking their first post-college, professional theatre experience. The Intern Company experience provides four to eight talented young people with their first real “break” in the world of professional performing arts. In exchange for training and professional performing experience, interns provide the company with much needed assistance in the areas of administration as well as back and front of house operations.

[[File:Ground Floor Schematic.jpg|thumb|Ground Floor B Street]]

After getting a land grant from [[Sutter Medical Center]], B Street Theatre started a Capital Campaign to build a new theater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2014/10/31/b-street-theatre-seeks-2-5m-grant-for-new-venues.html&lt;/ref&gt; The new theater is located at 27th and Capitol Avenue. The new Mainstage Theatre (Thrust Style) seats 250 patrons, and the Sutter Children’s Theatre (Proscenium Style) seats 365 - three times the past theatre's size, allowing the theater to bring art education to an additional 30,000 children the theatre presently cannot accommodate. The local economic impact is estimated to be at $40 million locally over first 5 years. Local architect, Ron Vrilakas, designed a "come as you are" theatre experience that resonates with the past theatre. Sutter Children’s Hospital is across the street in order to deepen the relationship between B Street and Sutter and further explore the restorative powers of theatre art for patients and their families. 

The new performing arts complex in midtown Sacramento, named in honor of one of its key supporters – The Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts, affectionately known as The Sofia - opened in February 2018. The Sofia is home to B Street Theatre’s Mainstage (naming opportunity still available) and the Sutter Theatre for Children – California’s first year-round, professional theatre for children. In the same spirit of community from which B Street Theatre was born, Sutter Theatre has opened its doors to host the performances and events of local artists, community organizations, and visiting acts. In effect, this landmark facility will become an entertainment hub for all of Sacramento, where locals and tourists alike can see theatre, comedy, dance, or musical acts in an intimate, professional space every night of the year. In addition, its large public lobby, classrooms, open-air courtyard, and on-site restaurant make The Sofia a true destination.

The '''Battle of Aradeti''' was fought between the armies of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the [[Samtskhe atabegate|Principality of Samtskhe]] at the place of Aradeti on August 1483.

The political split of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] was speeded up by the [[Eristavi|Eristavs]] of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]]. In 1483, Atabeg [[Qvarqvare II Jaqeli|Kvarkvare II]] routed the royal troops at Aradeti. These events signaled the end of the united Kingdom of Georgia, which disintegrated into several principalities. Kvarkvare gained his long sought independence in Samtskhe while Eristav [[Bagrat VI of Georgia|Bagrat]] seized the thrones of Imereti and Kartli and [[George VIII of Georgia|Giorgi VIII]] carved out his own realm in Kakheti.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze, A.

The '''Battle of Darayya (November 2012–February 2013)''' was fought from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2013 between the Syrian Army and the Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburbs of Darayya.

==Background==
Darayya is a suburb of Damascus where rebels have attempted to create a stronghold near Damascus center. In August 2012, the Syrian Army defeated the rebel forces and took control of the town. After the failed rebel offensive in late July 2012, the Syrian army started a campaign against rebels in Damascus suburb that led to a massacre in Darayya with an estimated 500 people were found executed, with rebels and government accusing each other of being responsible for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Janine di Giovanni|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/syria-daraya-massacre-ghost-town|title=Syria crisis: Daraya massacre leaves a ghost town still counting its dead |publisher=Guardian |date=7 September 2012|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The rebels again took control of the town in November 2012. Since, the city has been cut off, its electricity cut and has witnessed a continuous shelling. Most of the residents fled as soon as the battle started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/218228-top-syria-rebel-commander-killed-in-battle.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216225451/http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/218228-top-syria-rebel-commander-killed-in-battle.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |title=Top Syria rebel commander killed in battle |publisher=The Peninsula Qatar |date=2012-12-16 |accessdate=2013-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels were successful at preventing the Syrian Army from entering the town until mid-December when the Army started to intensify their attacks on the city and the nearby city of Moadmiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDqO03OCEny0lOkiaTdk2MAmj58A?docId=CNG.b2afd029d78665b2a372d7215c7a1646.401 |title=Syria troops press assault southwest of Damascus |publisher=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2012-12-15 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December, after 30 days of siege, the newspaper Al Watan, close to the government, reported an army progress into Daraya, where the army penetrated the city and isolated rebels fighters in the city center. Al Watan added that most of the fighters were foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islamicinvitationturkey.com/2012/12/20/syrian-forces-advance-in-daraya-local-newspaper/ |title=Syrian forces advance in Daraya – local newspaper |publisher=Islamicinvitationturkey.com |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 31 December, the Army launched its biggest attack on the city, with columns of armed vehicles trying to progress into the city. The rebels attempts to hit the presidential palace and Alawites neighbourhood with their homemade rockets were one of the reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=297908 |title=Assad's forces push to retake Damascus suburb|publisher=JPost |date=2012-12-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January, an opposition activist reported that the Syrian army was meeting a very strong resistance in Daraya, but that the Syrian soldiers managed to advance into the main street. The army was also firing from their artillery positions located in the Mount Qasioum on the orchards around Daraya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.channelone.com/ap/international/Syrian-warplanes-bomb-suburbs-of-the-capital-57785378-fm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215172202/http://news.channelone.com/ap/international/Syrian-warplanes-bomb-suburbs-of-the-capital-57785378-fm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-15|title=Syrian warplanes bomb suburbs of the capital|work=Channel One News|date=2013-01-04|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian Observatory, a rebel group, told that the army was sending more reinforcement to Daraya, while Al Watan newspaper wrote that the Army won the Daraya battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/67059-syria-jets-troops-wage-offensive-on-rebels-near-damascus |title=Syria Jets, Troops Wage Offensive on Rebels near Damascus|publisher=Naharnet|date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January, the Syrian Army arrested Mohamed Zawahiri, the brother of the supreme leader of Al Qaida in Daraya.&lt;ref name="mirror.co.uk"/&gt; Russian today Arabic correspondent was slightly injured when he fell on his hand while running to avoid being caught in crossfire.

On 6 January, the Syrian army killed a number of rebels near the Al Qasheia school in Daraya, and named the following rebels Odai al-Ward, Ahed Radwan, Moutez Mansour, Khaled al-khateeb, Omar Madwa, Tareq al-Dabbas, and Muhammed Tabow as being among the dead. Several other rebel groups were killed by the army in the other Damascus suburbs, including 12 who were named by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sana-syria.com/eng/337/2013/01/06/460576.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327105300/http://www.sana-syria.com/eng/337/2013/01/06/460576.htm |archivedate=2013-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that the Syrian Army had taken control of parts of Daraya and was sending more soldiers to push for the full conquest of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe?ref=stream |title=Syrian Observatory for Human Rights |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January, concording sources, from security officials to rebels groups revealed that the Syrian Army had taken much of Daraya, entering most of the neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

On 19 January, it was reported that the rebels were still in control of parts of Daraya in spite of fierce clashes and heavy shelling by government forces. Rebels also claimed that a MiG pilot in Daraya had defected and used his fighter jet to bombard three Army positions in the area, killing 15 soldiers of the 4th Syrian Army Brigade. Although this was not independently confirmed.&lt;ref name="itv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Syria Live Blog"/&gt;

The rebel commander Abu Ali was killed in the shelling of rebels positions.&lt;ref name="liberation.fr"/&gt;

On 24 January, the government was shelling Daraya from positions on the Qasioun mountain range west of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/france-sees-no-sign-syrias-assad-toppled-soon-155606330.html |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127005156/http://news.yahoo.com/france-sees-no-sign-syrias-assad-toppled-soon-155606330.html |archivedate=January 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February, the Syrian Army attempted to push further into Darayya, but rebels were able to repel the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/13/world/la-fg-syria-aleppo-20130214 |title=Syria rebels battle for airports in Aleppo region |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2013-02-13 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

In early August, state media reportedly showed that al-Assad visited his troops in Darayya, although SOHR was reporting the Syrian army shelling Darayya as recently as late June, and opposition activists report fighting as recently as mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20130801/API/1308010601?tc=ar|title=Article no longer available|work=heraldtribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/384575934984084|title=Reef Dimashq Province-SOHR: Regime... - Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://syrianewsdesk.com/en/news/violent-clashes-erupt-daraya&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Russia Today reported one of its journalist was wounded the same week in Darayya from rebels within the city firing mortars back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/rt-correspondent-wounded-syria-390/|title=RT correspondent wounded in Damascus suburb while filming in Syria|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2013, Syrian government helicopter gunship targeted Darayya with three barrel bombs. The barrel bombs landed near Al-Ansari and Al-Mustafa mosques, in the western part of the city, which has been under a tight siege by government forces for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://syrianewsdesk.com/en/2013/12/30/news-regime-helicopters-pound-daraya-barrel-bombs&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bocholt disaster''' refers to the collapse of Spinnerei Beckmann cotton mill, in [[Bocholt, Germany|Bocholt]], [[Germany]], shortly before its completion in 1895. Franz Beckmann, through the offices of [[Platt Brothers]] of [[Oldham]], had commissioned [[Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet|Sydney Stott]] to draw up plans for a [[mule spinning]] mill. The foundations were faulty and the mill collapsed on 18 October 1895. There were 22 men killed.

'''Bribery''' is the act of giving or receiving something of value in exchange for some kind of influence or action in return, that the recipient would otherwise not alter. Bribery is defined by ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' as the [[Offer and acceptance|offering]], [[Gift|giving]], [[Offer and acceptance|receiving]], or [[Solicitation|soliciting]] of any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in charge of a public or [[legal]] [[duty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = What is bribery? | publisher = Black's Law Dictionary | url = http://thelawdictionary.org/bribery/ | accessdate = September 30, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151001204535/http://thelawdictionary.org/bribery/ | archivedate = October 1, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, bribery is offering to do something for someone for the expressed purpose of receiving something in exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bribery|title=Bribery|first=LII|last=Staff|date=6 August 2007|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308103132/https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bribery|archivedate=8 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gifts of money or other items of value which are otherwise available to everyone on an equivalent basis, and not for dishonest purposes, is not bribery. Offering a discount or a refund to all purchasers is a legal [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] and is not bribery. For example, it is legal for an employee of a Public Utilities Commission involved in electric rate regulation to accept a rebate on electric service that reduces their cost for electricity, when the rebate is available to other residential electric customers. Giving the rebate to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility's rate increase applications, however, would be considered bribery.

A bribe is the gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct. It may be [[money]], [[Good (economics)|goods]], [[Chose (English law)|rights in action]], [[property]], [[Promotion (rank)|preferment]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], [[Remuneration|emolument]], objects of value, advantage, or merely a promise to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See generally T. Markus Funk, [http://www.perkinscoie.com/Dont-Pay-for-the-Misdeeds-of-Others-Avoiding-Foreign-Third-Party-FCPA-Liability-01-05-2011 "Don't Pay for the Misdeeds of Others:  Intro to Avoiding Third-Party FCPA Liability," 6 BNA White Collar Crime Report 33 (January 14, 2011)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316152342/http://www.perkinscoie.com/dont-pay-for-the-misdeeds-of-others-avoiding-foreign-third-party-fcpa-liability-01-05-2011/ |date=March 16, 2014 }} (discussing bribery in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
[[File:WilliamJeffersonFreezerPiecrusts 20-45C.jpg|thumb|Photo of cash found in Congressman [[William J. Jefferson]]'s freezer in the August 2005 raid was shown to jurors on 8 July 2009]]
Many types of payments or favors can constitute bribes: [[gratuity|tip]], [[gift]], [[sop]], [[Employee benefit|perk]], [[Price skimming|skim]], favor, [[discounts and allowances|discount]], [[waived]] fee/ticket, free food, free ad, free trip, free tickets, [[sweetheart deal]], [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback/payback]], [[funding]], inflated sale of an object or property, lucrative contract, [[donation]], [[campaign contribution]], [[fundraiser]], [[sponsorship]]/backing, higher paying job, [[stock options]], [[secret commission]], or [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] (rise of position/rank).

One must be careful of differing social and cultural norms when examining bribery. Expectations of when a monetary transaction is appropriate can differ from place to place. Political [[campaign contributions]] in the form of cash, for example, are considered criminal acts of bribery in some countries, while in the United States, provided they adhere to election law, are legal. [[Tip (gratuity)|Tipping]], for example, is considered bribery in some societies, while in others the two concepts may not be interchangeable.

In some Spanish-speaking countries, bribes are referred to as "mordida" (literally, "bite"). In Arab countries, bribes may be called [[baksheesh]] (a tip, gift, or gratuity) or "shay" (literally, "tea"). French-speaking countries often use the expressions "dessous-de-table" ("under-the-table" commissions), "pot-de-vin" (literally, "wine-pot"), or "commission occulte" ("secret commission" or "kickback"). While the last two expressions contain inherently a negative connotation, the expression "dessous-de-table" can be often understood as a commonly accepted business practice. In German, the common term is ''Schmiergeld'' ("smoothing money").

The offence may be divided into two great classes: the one, where a person invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other, where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can impart it. Likewise, the briber might hold a powerful role and control the transaction; or in other cases, a bribe may be effectively extracted from the person paying it, although this is better known as [[extortion]].

The forms that bribery take are numerous. For example, a motorist might bribe a [[police|police officer]] not to issue a ticket for speeding, a citizen seeking paperwork or utility line connections might bribe a functionary for faster service.

Bribery may also take the form of a [[secret commission]], a profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the knowledge of his principal. Euphemisms abound for this (commission, sweetener, kick-back etc.) Bribers and recipients of bribery are likewise numerous although bribers have one common denominator and that is the financial ability to bribe.

According to BBC news U.K, "bribery around the world is estimated at about $1 trillion (£494bn)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - African corruption 'on the wane'|work=bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422141310/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|archivedate=2009-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As indicated on the pages devoted to [[political corruption]], efforts have been made in recent years by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. From a legal point of view, active bribery can be defined for instance as ''the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage [to any public official], for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions.'' (article 2 of [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&amp;CL=ENG the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)] of the [[Council of Europe]]). Passive bribery can be defined as ''the request or receipt [by any public official], directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions'' (article 3 of [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&amp;CL=ENG the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)]).

The reason for this dissociation is to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal policy point of view) that bribery is not acceptable. Besides, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. Besides, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favourable decision.

==Government==
[[File:Article II, Section 4, United States Constitution v. SCOTUS Police, Outside the Third Guantanamo Hearing (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|Article II, Section 4 of the [[United States Constitution]]]]

A grey area may exist when payments to smooth transactions are made. United States law is particularly strict in limiting the ability of businesses to pay for the awarding of contracts by foreign governments; however, the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] contains an exception for "grease payments"; very basically, this allows payments to officials in order to obtain the performance of ministerial acts which they are legally required to do, but may delay in the absence of such payment. In some countries, this practice is the norm, often resulting from a developing nation not having the tax structure to pay civil servants an adequate salary. Nevertheless, most economists regard bribery as a bad thing because it encourages [[rent seeking]] behaviour. A state where bribery has become a way of life is a [[kleptocracy]].

Recent evidence suggests that the act of bribery can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country, region and/or tribal unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003707/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206005357/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax treatment===
The tax status of bribes is an issue for governments since the bribery of government officials impedes the democratic process and may interfere with good government. In some countries, such bribes are considered tax-deductible payments. However, in 1996, in an effort to discourage bribery, the [[OECD|OECD Council]] recommended that member countries cease to allow the tax-deductibility of bribes to foreign officials. This was followed by the signing of the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|Anti-Bribery Convention]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |title=OECD Anti Bribery Convention |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072104/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since that time, the majority of the OECD countries which are signatories of the convention have revised their tax policies according to this recommendation and some have extended the measures to bribes paid to any official, sending the message that bribery will no longer be tolerated in the operations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |title=OECD Anti-corruption and integrity in the public sector |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063422/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |archivedate=2018-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As any monetary benefit received from an illegal activity such as bribery is generally considered part of one’s taxable income, however, as its criminal, some governments may refuse to accept it as income as it may mean they are a party to the activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|title=Income from scams and bribes are also taxable|first=|last=PinoyMoneyTalk|date=8 January 2007|website=pinoymoneytalk.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214202759/https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|archivedate=14 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
[[Pharmaceutical corporation]]s may seek to entice [[physician|doctors]] to favor prescribing their [[medication|drugs]] over others of comparable effectiveness. If the medicine is prescribed heavily, they may seek to reward the individual through gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21572784-new-efforts-reveal-ties-between-doctors-and-drug-firms-let-sunshine "Let the Sunshine in."

Dentists often receive samples of home dental care products such as toothpaste, which are of negligible value; somewhat ironically, dentists in a television commercial will often state that they get these samples but pay to use the sponsor's product.

In countries offering state-subsidized or nationally funded healthcare where medical professionals are underpaid, [[patient]]s may use bribery to solicit the standard expected level of medical care. For example, in many formerly Communist countries from what used to be the [[Eastern Bloc]] it may be customary to offer expensive gifts to doctors and nurses for the delivery of service at any level of medical care in the non-private health sector.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Mauree. (2000). Who is paying for healthcare in Eastern Europe and Central Asia? World Bank Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bribes&gt;[http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=544&amp;catID=3 Bribes for basic care in Romania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118165406/http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial |date=2007-11-18 }}. [[The Guardian Weekly]] (March 26th 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Caution bribe coming through washington dc 1.jpg|thumb|[[Demonstration (people)|Demonstration]] in Washington, DC]]
[[Politician]]s receive [[campaign contributions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/governance/ethics/financing-democracy.htm |title=OECD work on Money in Politics &amp; Policy Capture |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314174708/http://www.oecd.org/governance/ethics/financing-democracy.htm |archivedate=2018-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[corporate donations|payoffs from powerful corporation]]s, organizations or individuals in return for making choices in the interests of those parties, or in anticipation of favorable [[policy]], also referred to as lobbying. This is not illegal in the United States and forms a major part of [[campaign finance]], though it is sometimes referred to as the [[Money trail|money loop]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. However, in many European countries, a politician accepting money from a corporation whose activities fall under the sector they currently (or are campaigning to be elected to) regulate would be considered a criminal offence, for instance the "[[Cash-for-questions affair]]" and "[[Cash for Honours]]" in the [[United Kingdom]]. A grey area in these democracies is the so-called "[[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]", whereby politicians are offered highly-paid, often consultancy jobs upon their retirement from politics by the corporations they regulate while in office, in return for enacting legislation favourable to the corporation whilst in office - a [[conflict of interest]]. Convictions for this form of bribery are easier to obtain with hard evidence, that is a specific amount of money linked to a specific action by the recipient of the bribe.  Such evidence is frequently obtained using undercover agents, since evidence of a [[quid pro quo]] relation can often be difficult to prove. See also [[influence peddling]] and [[political corruption]].
Recent evidence suggests that demands for bribes can adversely impact citizen level of trust and engagement with the political process.

==Business==
[[Image:Say no to bribes in Chipata, Zambia.jpg|thumb|A campaign to prevent bribes in [[Zambia]].]]
{{Main|Commercial bribery}}

Employees, managers, or salespeople of a business may offer money or gifts to a potential client in exchange for business.

For example, in 2006, German prosecutors conducted a wide-ranging investigation of [[Siemens AG]] to determine if Siemens employees paid bribes in exchange for business.

In some cases where the system of law is not well-implemented, bribes may be a way for companies to continue their businesses. In the case, for example, custom officials may harass a certain firm or production plant, officially stating they are checking for irregularities, halting production or stalling other normal activities of a firm. The disruption may cause losses to the firm that exceed the amount of money to pay off the official. Bribing the officials is a common way to deal with this issue in countries where there exists no firm system of reporting these semi-illegal activities. A third party, known as a White Glove, may be involved to act as a clean middleman.

Specialist consultancies have been set up to help multinational companies and [[small and medium enterprises]] with a commitment to anti-corruption to trade more ethically and benefit from compliance with the law.

Contracts based on or involving the payment or transfer of bribes ("corruption money", "secret commissions", "pots-de-vin", "kickbacks") are void.&lt;ref&gt;International principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/938000 Trans-Lex.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121234720/http://trans-lex.org/938000 |date=2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted:

{{quote|Bribery would be less of a problem if it wasn't also a solid investment. A new paper by [[Raghavendra Rau]] of [[Cambridge University]] and Yan Leung Cheung and Aris Stouraitis of the Hong Kong Baptist University examines 166 high-profile cases of bribery since 1971, covering payments made in 52 countries by firms listed on 20 different stockmarkets. Bribery offered an average return of 10 to 11 times the value of the bung paid out to win a contract, measured by the jump in stockmarket value when the contract was won. America's Department of Justice found similarly high returns in cases it has prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;

In addition, a survey conducted by auditing firm Ernst &amp; Young (EY) in 2012 found that 15 percent of top financial executives are willing to pay bribes in order to keep or win business. Another 4 percent said they would be willing to misstate financial performance. This alarming indifference represents a huge risk to their business, given their responsibility.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |title=OECD Anti-Bribery Convention |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072104/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport corruption==
{{main|Match fixing}}

[[Referee]]s and scoring judges may be offered money, gifts, or other compensation to guarantee a specific outcome in an athletic or other sports competition.  A well-known example of this manner of bribery in the sport would be the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal]], where the French judge in the pairs competition voted for the Russian skaters in order to secure an advantage for the French skaters in the ice dancing competition.

Additionally, bribes may be offered by cities in order to secure athletic franchises, or even competitions, as happened with the [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|2002 Winter Olympics]].  It is common practice for cities to "bid" against each other with stadiums, tax benefits, and licensing deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/sport-corruption-rbc.htm |title=OECD work on preventing corruption in sporting events and promoting responsible business conduct |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308231724/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/sport-corruption-rbc.htm |archivedate=2018-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
===Legislation===
The U.S. introduced the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] in 1977 to address bribery of foreign officials. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, was introduced to prevent the influencing of foreign officials by companies through rewards or payments. This legislation dominated international anti-corruption enforcement until around 2010 when other countries began introducing broader and more robust legislation, notably the United Kingdom [[Bribery Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/52195/differences-between-the-uk-bribery-act-and-the-us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act|title=Differences between the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309183105/http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/52195/differences-between-the-uk-bribery-act-and-the-us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act|archivedate=2018-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breslin|first=Brigid|author2=Doron Ezickson|author3=John Kocoras|year=2010|title=The Bribery Act 2010: raising the bar above the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|journal=Company Lawyer|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|volume=31|issue=11|issn=0144-1027|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Organization for Standardization introduced an international anti-bribery management system standard in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledge.freshfields.com/m/Global/r/1698/new_global_framework_for_anti-bribery_and_corruption|title=New global framework for anti-bribery and corruption compliance programs Freshfields knowledge|website=knowledge.freshfields.com|access-date=2018-03-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508010837/http://knowledge.freshfields.com/m/Global/r/1698/new_global_framework_for_anti-bribery_and_corruption|archivedate=2018-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, cooperation in enforcement action between countries has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfields.com/globalassets/services-page/global-investigations/publication-pdfs/gi-abc-guide-2017.pdf|title=Anti-bribery and corruption: global enforcement and legislative developments 2017|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=|publisher=Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905112405/https://www.freshfields.com/globalassets/services-page/global-investigations/publication-pdfs/gi-abc-guide-2017.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-05|dead-url=no|access-date=9 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 18 U.S. Code § 201 - Bribery of public officials and witnesses, the law strictly prohibits any type of promising, giving, or offering of value to a public official. A public official is further defined as anyone who holds public or elected office. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201] Another stipulation of the law in place condemns the same kind of offering, giving, or coercing a witness in a legal case to changing their story. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201] The minimum penalty for either of these offenses is 10 years, and a potential fine. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1503]

===Businesses===
Programs of prevention need to be properly designed and meet with international standards of best practice. To ensure respect for a program, whether it be on the part of employees or business partners, external verification is necessary. International best practices such as the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Annex 2;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; the [[ISO 26000]] norm (section 6.6.3) or TI Business Principles for Countering Bribery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgu.gov.br/conferenciabrocde/arquivos/English-Business-Principles-for-Countering-Bribery.pdf |title=TI Business Principles for Countering Bribery. Available Online. Accessed on May 23, 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602174301/http://www.cgu.gov.br/conferenciabrocde/arquivos/English-Business-Principles-for-Countering-Bribery.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are used in external verification processes to measure and ensure that a program of bribery prevention works and is consistent with international standards. Another reason for businesses to undergo external verification of their bribery prevention programs is that it means evidence can be provided to assert that all that was possible was done to prevent corruption. Companies are unable to guarantee corruption has never occurred; what they can do is provide evidence that they did their best to prevent it.

There is no federal statute under the U.S Law that prohibits or regulates any type of private or commercial bribery. There is a way for prosecutors to try people for bribery by using existing laws. Section 1346 of Title 18 can be used by prosecutors, to try people for ‘a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services,’ under the mail and wire fraud statutes. [https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-anti-bribery-and-anti-corruption-review-edition-6/1151869/united-states] Prosecutors have always successfully prosecuted private company employees for breaching a fiduciary duty and taking bribes, under Honest services fraud.

There are also cases of successful prosecution of bribery in the case of international business. The DOJ has used the Travel Act, 18 USC Section 1952 to prosecute bribery. Under the Travel Act, it is against the law, domestically and internationally, to utilize‘the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce’ with intent to ‘promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment or carrying on, of any unlawful activity’.

{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox|expanded=Treaty of Versailles}}
The '''Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties''' was a commission established at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], in 1919. Its role was to examine the background of the [[First World War]], and to investigate and recommend individuals for prosecution for committing [[war crimes]].

==Background==
During the First World War, the Allied governments had decided to try defeated leaders whom they considered responsible for violations of [[international law]] and the [[laws of war]]. For that purpose, it was decided to establish an expert committee to make recommendations to that effect. Following the conclusion of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice in November 1918]], preparations began. The defeated German government officially concurred with the initiative on grounds that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A complete truthful account of the world conditions and of the negotiations among the powers in July 1914 and of the steps taken at that time by the several governments could and would go far toward demolishing the walls of hatred and misconstruction erected by the long war to separate the peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the German government to the US government, December 2, 1918, ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919: The Paris Peace Conference'', vol. II, 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the German government proposed the establishment of a neutral committee of experts to study the matter. The Allied governments refused, claiming that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
they [the Allied governments] do not consider that the German proposal requires any reply as the responsibility of Germany for the war has been long ago incontestably proved.&lt;ref&gt;Acting US Secretary of State ([[Frank Lyon Polk]]) to the Commission to Negotiate Peace, January 6, 1919, ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919: The Paris Peace Conference'', vol. II, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Composition of the Commission==
The commission was established at the conference plenary session of 25 January 1919, and consisted of representatives of the five major Allied powers – the USA, the British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan – with the addition of Belgium, Greece, Poland, Romania and Serbia (later: [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]).

==Recommendations made by the Commission==

===Majority opinion===
The Commission submitted its report on 29 March 1919. It concluded that blame for the war lay in the first instance with the governments of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and secondly with those of Bulgaria and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Report, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended the establishment of an additional commission for a more exhaustive study of the alleged crimes of the defeated powers.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Report, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It further recommended the establishment of an international tribunal for the prosecution of suspected war criminals, with no immunity from prosecution even for defeated heads of state. It recommended that the tribunal should consist of 22 judges, three from each of the five major powers and an additional six from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;International Law Commission, ''Historical Survey of the Question of International Criminal Jurisdiction'' (UN Document: A/CN.4/7/Rev.1) p. 7 (hereafter: ILC Study).&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018|reason=maths is incorrect: (3 × 5) + 6 = 21, not 22}}

===Dissenting opinion by the US delegation===
The US delegates submitted their own opinion on 4 April 1919, expressing their reservations on the report. They suggested refraining from prosecuting heads of state, and focusing instead on lower levels of the government and military. They also suggested that defeated leaders or commanders should not be charged with acts not considered criminal at the time of their commission, i.e. that rules of conduct should not be imposed retroactively. They also argued that there should not be a permanent international tribunal for war crimes, but that, following any future war, such a tribunal should be established by the governments of the nations directly affected.&lt;ref&gt;ILC Study, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting opinion by the Japanese delegation===
On the same day the US delegation submitted its minority opinion, the Japanese delegation submitted its own reservations. The Japanese delegation's main reservation was about the demand to indict heads of state for violations.&lt;ref&gt;Text in "Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalities" ''American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan.-Apr., 1920), pp. 95-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy of the Commission==
The Commission's recommendations were not carried through at the time. The proposed international tribunal for war crimes was not established, because of the refusal of the German government to cooperate. Instead, a few German individuals accused of war crimes were tried in 1921 at the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials]] by the German authorities themselves. However, the recommendations did bear fruit in the longer term. Following the [[Second World War]], two international Allied tribunals were established in [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo]] to try German and Japanese leaders accused of war crimes. The demand for a permanent tribunal for [[crimes against humanity]] continued even after those tribunals had been dissolved, leading eventually to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002.

The '''Compromise'''&lt;ref&gt;The word "compromise" appears to be an overly-literal translation of the French word ''compromis'' by the 19th-century English-language historians who introduced the concept into anglophone historiography. A better translation might have been used, like "covenant". However, the phrase "Compromise of nobles" gained currency and has by now achieved the status of a proper name in English. For that reason many modern historians of the [[Dutch Revolt]] use the term, like [[Jonathan Israel]], Martin van Gelderen and H. G. Koenigsberger. For that reason the term is retained here.&lt;/ref&gt; '''of Nobles''' ({{lang-nl| '''Eedverbond der Edelen'''}}; {{lang-fr| '''Compromis des Nobles'''}}) was a [[Covenant (historical)|covenant]] of members of the lesser [[nobility]] in the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] who came together to submit a [[petition]] to the Regent [[Margaret of Parma]] on 5 April 1566, with the objective of obtaining a moderation of the ''placards'' against [[heresy]] in the Netherlands. This petition played a crucial role in the events leading up to the [[Dutch Revolt]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]].

== Background ==
The ruler of the Habsburg Netherlands, a conglomerate of duchies and counties and lesser [[fief]]s, was [[Philip II of Spain]]. He had appointed his half-sister Margaret of Parma as his Regent. She ruled with the assistance of a Council of State which included a number of the high nobility of the country, like the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]], [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Egmont]], [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn|Horne]], [[Philipe de Croÿ, Duke of Aerschot|Aerschot]] and [[Philip of Noircarmes|Noircarmes]]. From time to time (whenever she needed money){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} she convened the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] in which the several [[Estates of the realm|estates]] of the provinces were represented, such as the lesser nobility and the cities, but most of the time the States-General was not in session and the Regent ruled alone, together with her Council.

Like his father [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Philip was very much opposed to the Protestant teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and the [[Anabaptists]], which had gained many adherents in the Netherlands by the early 1560s. To suppress Protestantism he had promulgated extraordinary ordinances, called ''placards'', that outlawed them and made them [[Capital punishment|capital offenses]]. Because of their severity these ''placards'' caused growing opposition among the population, both Catholic and Protestant. Opposition, even among Catholics, was generated because the ''placards'' were seen as breaches of the constitutional privileges of the local authorities and the civil liberties of the people, like the ''[[Jus de non evocando]]'', as enshrined in the "[[Joyous Entry of 1356|Joyous Entry]]", the constitution of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], to mention a prominent example. For that reason local authorities regularly protested against the ''placards'' and the way they were implemented in 1564 and later years. That these protests were systematically ignored and the ''placards'' stringently enforced only helped intensify the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, pp. 111–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compromise ==
This unrest motivated the Brussels government to send [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]], to Spain to plead for relaxation of the ordinances. Philip replied negatively in his [[Letters from the Segovia Woods]] of October 1565. That led to a gathering of some members of the lesser nobility at the house of Floris, Count of [[Culemborg]], in December 1565. There, they drew up a petition containing a protest against the enforcement of the ''placards''. It was probably drafted by [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde]], and it was initially signed by [[Henry, Count of Bréderode]], [[Louis of Nassau]] and Count Charles of Mansfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Compromis des nobles en 1566-Edouard de Biefve-MBA Lyon-2014.jpeg|thumb|Compromise of nobles by [[Edouard de Bièfve]], 1841]]
The draft was widely circulated and gathered a large number of signatures. The magnates of the nobility at first kept aloof (though Orange must have been in the know through his brother Louis). On 24 January 1566, however, Orange addressed a letter to the Regent, as a member of the Council, in which he offered his unsolicited opinion that a moderation of the ''placards'' would be desirable, in view of the toleration now practiced in neighboring lands, like France. He also pointed to the social unrest caused by the famine that scourged the country in that year and remarked that the ''placards'' were bound to cause trouble in this context. For good measure he threatened to resign if something along these lines was not done.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, pp. 162–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the association that supported the draft petition met in [[Breda]] at the house of  [[Antoine II de Lalaing|Antoine II de Lalaing, Count of Hoogstraten]] (another member of the Council of State) to work out a way that was acceptable to the government to present the petition. Finally, on 5 April 1566, a long procession of 300 signers of the petition walked through [[Brussels]] to the Regent's court. There Brederode read the petition aloud to the Regent, who became very agitated. Afterwards, when the Regent met with the Council of State, Orange tried to calm her, and another member, [[Charles de Berlaymont]], allegedly remarked "N'ayez pas peur Madame, ce ne sont que des gueux" (fear not madam, they are nothing but [[Geuzen|beggars]]).&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the petition the nobles, who presented themselves as loyal subjects of the king, asked him to suspend the [[Inquisition]] and the enforcement of the ''placards'' against heresy. They also urged the convening of the States-General so that "better legislation" could be devised to address the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of the moderates in the Council, like Orange, the Regent replied to the petitioners that she would forward it to the king and that she would support its requests. Brederode handed over a supplementary petition on 8 April, in which the petitioners promised to keep the peace while the petition was being sent to Spain, a journey that could take weeks. He assumed that meanwhile the requested suspension of enforcement would be in effect. That evening the petitioners held a banquet at which they toasted the king and themselves as "beggars". Henceforth the ''Geuzen'' would be the name of their party.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}
The king took a long time to react to the petition, and when he finally did, he rejected its requests. Meanwhile a large number of Protestants had returned from exile, and other Protestants now dared come out into the open. Large numbers of Protestants, especially Calvinists, started holding prayer meetings outside the walls of many cities. These open-air sermons by Calvinist preachers, though initially peaceful, caused much anxiety for the local and central authorities. In August 1566, in the depressed industrial area around [[Steenvoorde]] a rash of attacks on Catholic church property started, in which religious statuary was destroyed by irate Calvinists, for whom those statues contravened the [[Ten Commandments|Second Commandment]] against graven images. Soon this [[Beeldenstorm]] or [[Iconoclastic Fury]] engulfed the entire country. Though the central authorities eventually suppressed this insurrection, it led to the severe repression by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] that would precipitate the Dutch Revolt and Eighty Years' War.

A '''concert T-shirt''' is a [[T-shirt]] that is associated with a [[concert]] or a [[concert tour]], often for a [[rock (music)|rock]] or [[metal (music)|metal]] band. [[Band (music)|Band]]s and musical groups often promote themselves by creating and selling or giving away T-shirts at their shows, tours, and events. A concert T-shirt typically contains [[Screen-printing|silk screened]] graphics of the name, logo, or image of a musical performer or group. One popular choice of graphics on the rear of the T-shirts is a listing of information about the band's current tour, including tour cities (sometimes specifying [[Music venue|venue]]s) and corresponding dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/entertainment/special_packages/stones_in_wichita/15658057.htm|title=Wichita Breaking News, Sports &amp; Crime {{!}} The Wichita Eagle|website=www.kansas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tshirtspotlight.com/history-of-the-t-Shirt/|title=History of the T-shirt. {{!}} Tee Fetch|work=Tee Fetch|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, rock producer [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] co-founded Winterland Productions, credited as "the first concert T-shirt manufacturing company".&lt;ref&gt;Alec Foege, ''Right of the Dial: The Rise of Clear Channel and the Fall of Commercial Radio'' (2009), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular colors for concert T-shirts is a flat [[black]].&lt;ref&gt;"Touring bands soaked up the cost of their lights and lasers with extensive merchandising, like tour programs, scarves, and the ever-present official black concert T-shirts with tour dates printed on the back," Ian Christe, ''Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal'' (Harper Collins, 2003), p71.The black concert T-shirt is a [[fashion trend]] of [[rock concert]] attendees originating in the 1970s{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and continuing today.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deena Weinstein, ''Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture'', (Da Capo Press, 2000) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Fans often purchase or obtain these shirts to wear to future concerts.

Wearing a concert T-shirt is a cultural signifier, with commentators identifying various reasons behind the choice to wear a particular one. For example, attending a band's concert while wearing a T-shirt from one of the band's tours long ago can give the wearer a certain prestige amongst other fans, it being indicative of the longevity of their support for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/04/ask-indie-professor-t-shirt|title=Ask the indie professor: What does your gig T-shirt say about you?|last=Fonarow|first=Wendy|date=2010-10-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screen printing==
{{main|Screen printing}}
Screen printing or silk screening is the method of printing designs on T-shirts. The process begins by stretching a fine mesh around a rigid frame. Afterwards, a template is attached to the screen. The template covers the portions not to be printed. The completed screen is placed over a T-shirt, and ink is then pressed through the screen, leaving a print. Multiple templates can be used on the same shirt to create a multicolored screen print. Screen printing is one of the most commonly used techniques for putting a design on a T-shirt.

Peter answered: "''The Christ of God''".&lt;ref name=Kingsbury &gt;''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R.

{{Saint Peter}}

In [[Christianity]], the '''Confession of Peter''' ([[anglicized]] from the Matthean [[Vulgate]] Latin section title: ''Confessio Petri'') refers to an episode in the [[New Testament]] in which the [[Apostle Peter]] proclaims [[Jesus]] to be the [[Christ]] ([[Jewish Messiah]]). The proclamation is described in the three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:13|Matthew 16:13-20]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:27|Mark 8:27–30]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:18|Luke 9:18–20]].&lt;ref name=Kingsbury /&gt;&lt;ref name=Karris &gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament'' by Robert J. Karris 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-2211-9}} pages 885-886&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Peter declares, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."&lt;ref name=Kingsbury /&gt;

The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to [[Christology]]; the Confession of Peter and Jesus' acceptance of the title "Messiah" form a definitive statement in the New Testament narrative regarding the person of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=Rudolf7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yueh /&gt; In this New Testament narrative, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and ''[[Son of God]]'', but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]] had revealed it to Peter, unequivocally declaring himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref name=Yueh /&gt;

In the same passage Jesus also selects Peter as the leader of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], and states: "Upon this rock I will build my church". Most [[Christian denominations]] agree that the statement applies to Peter, but they diverge on their interpretations of what happens after Peter.&lt;ref name=Boring69 /&gt;

The Confession of Peter is also the name of a liturgical feastday celebrated by several Christian churches, often as part of the [[Week of Prayer for Christian Unity]].&lt;ref name=Brett &gt;''Pocket Dictionary of Liturgy &amp; Worship'' by Brett Scott Provance 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2707-7}} page 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tristam &gt;''Exciting Holiness: Collects and Readings for the Festivals'' by B. Tristam {{ISBN|1-85311-479-0}} Canterbury Press 2003 pages 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel accounts==

===Background and setting===
In the New Testament, this [[pericope]] and the account of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] which follows it appear towards the middle of the Gospel narrative and jointly mark the beginnings of the gradual disclosure of the identity of Jesus to his disciples.&lt;ref name=KingsburyMark &gt;''The Christology of Mark's Gospel'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury 1983 {{ISBN|0-8006-2337-1}} pages 91-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barton132 &gt;''The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels'' by Stephen C. Barton {{ISBN|0-521-00261-3}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The setting is near [[Caesarea Philippi]] in northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and is at the beginning of the final journey to [[Jerusalem]] which ends in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt;

Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:13|Matthew 16:13]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:27|Mark 8:27]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:18|Luke 9:18]]. Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among "the multitudes", asking: "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt; The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time, ranging from [[John the Baptist]] to [[Elijah]], [[Jeremiah]],&lt;ref&gt;In Matthew's account only: {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; or one of the (other) [[prophet]]s.&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt; The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]], following Jewish medieval rabbi [[David Kimhi]] and theologican [[John Lightfoot]], suggests that Jeremiah "is mentioned as a representative of the Prophets, because in the [[Jewish canon|Jewish Canon]] the [[book of Jeremiah]] came first of the Prophets, following the [[books of Kings]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/16.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Matthew 16; [http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/jlc/matthew-16.html John Lightfoot's Commentary on the Gospels] on Matthew 16 and on [http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/jlc/matthew-27.html Matthew 27], all accessed 25 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the Gospel narrative, these hypotheses about Jesus' identity were provided in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:14|Mark 6:14-16]] by those in the court of [[Herod Antipas]] when he wondered if Jesus was John the Baptist restored to life.&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Mark, Volume 2'' by John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-5965-9}} page 336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation and acceptance===
In the three Gospel accounts, after asking about the views of "the multitudes", Jesus asks his disciples about their own opinion: "But who do you say that I am?" Only Simon Peter answers him: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God".&lt;ref name=Kingsbury /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christology and the New Testament'' by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22431-8}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:17|Matthew 16:17]] Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates this revelation is the foundational rock of the Church. This begins with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[Son of God]]'' which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]] had revealed it to Peter.&lt;ref name=Yueh &gt;''One Teacher: Jesus' Teaching Role in Matthew's Gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref name=Yueh /&gt;

The reference to "my Father" is distinguished in that in the New Testament, Jesus never includes other individuals in such references and only refers to ''his'' Father, however when addressing the disciples he uses ''your'' Father, excluding himself from the reference.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus God and Man'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 {{ISBN|0-664-24468-8}} pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of Peter===
[[File:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino.jpg|thumb|[[Pietro Perugino]]'s depiction of the "Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter" by Jesus, 1492]]
In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]] Jesus then continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "Peter" in this verse is, in Greek, "petros", while this "rock" is "petra". It is a play on words, but if the original language was Aramaic the word in both cases is simply "kepha". A distinction that petros meant a stone and petra a solid piece of rocky ground is sometimes suggested, but Greek use in antiquity seems to have been less precise.&lt;ref name=Cullman &gt;''Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr'' by [[Oscar Cullman]] 2011 {{ISBN|1602584133}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word "church" (''ekklesia'' in Greek), as used here, appears in the Gospels only once more, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#18:17|Matthew 18:17]], and refers to the community of believers at the time.&lt;ref name=Rudolf7 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by [[Rudolf Schnackenburg]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4438-3}} pages 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; The "gates of hell" (of [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) refers to the underworld, and the abode of the dead, and refers to the powers opposed to God not being able to triumph over the church.&lt;ref name=Sacra &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew (Sacra Pagina Series, Vol 1)'' by Dainel J. Harrington 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5803-1}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]] refer to the metaphor of the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] being a "place to be entered" as also used in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#23:13|Matthew 23:13]], where the entrance to it can be shut.&lt;ref name=Sacra /&gt;

Peter's authority is further confirmed by: "Whatsoever thou shalt [[Binding and loosing|bind on earth]] shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven". As discussed below, various Christian denominations have assigned different interpretations to the authority granted in this passage.

All three of the Synoptics end the account with Jesus telling the disciples not to reveal that he was the Messiah to anyone, a statement which in the 20th century gave rise to theory of the [[Messianic Secret]] in the Gospel of Mark.

==Denominational issues==

===Interpretations===
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul 2012-09-28 18-07-29.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at [[Nantes Cathedral]]: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church."]]
Various Christian denominations interpret [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]] in different ways. Although most denominations agree that the statement applies to Peter, they diverge on their interpretations of what happens after Peter.&lt;ref name=Boring69 &gt;''The People's New Testament Commentary'' by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22754-6}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Jesus' words, "upon this rock I will build my church" are interpreted as the foundation of the doctrine of the [[papacy]], whereby the Church of Christ is founded upon Peter and his successors, the Bishops of Rome.&lt;ref name=Rock &gt;''Upon this Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church'' by Stephen K. Ray 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-89870-723-6}} pages 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' next statement, "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." are interpreted as the foundation of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]].&lt;ref name=Powell35 &gt;''Papal infallibility: A Protestant Evaluation of an Ecumenical Issue'' by Mark E. Powell 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6284-6}} pages 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Protestants]] believe that the verse states that Peter was the foundation stone of the Church, but do not accept that it applies to the continuous succession of popes, as the Bishops of Rome. The statement "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" is usually taken to mean that the Church will never become extinct.&lt;ref name=Boring69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell35 /&gt;  Some [[Evangelicalism|Protestant evangelical groups]] adhere to the interpretation that it is Peter's "confession" itself that is "the rock on which will be built the Church of Jesus", i.e. The church will be built on Jesus alone as the foundation stone of his church. This interpretation usually uses the argument of the difference between ''petros'' and ''petra'' in Greek ("You are Peter [petros] and on this rock [petra] I will build my church.")

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches also reject the succession of popes and see Jesus' words, "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" as bestowing first upon Peter what was later bestowed upon all of the Apostles collectively. The Orthodox believe in the [[infallibility of the Church]] as a whole, but that any individual, regardless of their position can be subject to error.&lt;ref name=Boring69 /&gt;

[[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical meetings]] among different denominations have taken place regarding these interpretations, but no final agreement has emerged.&lt;ref name=Boring69 /&gt;

===Commemorations===
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] celebrates the Feast of the [[Chair of St. Peter]] on 22 February in the [[General Roman Calendar]]. In the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]], the feast is celebrated on 18 January. Some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] churches celebrate the Feast of the Confession of St. Peter on 18 January.&lt;ref name=Tristam /&gt;

The Confession of Peter is the beginning of the ''[[Week of Prayer for Christian Unity]]'', is actually an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] rather than a week and was originally known as the Octave of Christian Unity. It is an international Christian ecumenical observance that began in 1908. It spans from 18 January to 25 January (the [[Conversion of Paul|Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul]]).&lt;ref name=Tristam /&gt;

==Background and Origins==
Disaster Action was founded as a charity in 1991 by survivors and bereaved people from UK and overseas disasters. In the late 1980s, there were a number of serious incidents in which many lives were lost, such as the sinking of the [[MV Jupiter (1961)]], [[Hillsborough Disaster|Hillsborough]], the [[Herald of Free Enterprise]], [[Lockerbie]], the [[Marchioness disaster|Marchioness]], [[Piper Alpha]] and [[UTA Flight 772]]. [[Maurice de Rohan]] from the Herald Families Association realised that the issues the Herald families were experiencing would almost certainly be encountered by others in similar disasters and therefore gathered together a group of people in circumstances that paralleled his resulting in the charity Disaster Action being set up. It won a [[The Guardian|Guardian]] charity of the year award in 2004 for excellence in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guardian Award |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/oct/13/charityawards.voluntarysector1) |website=The Guardian |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The organisation evolved and developed through the years with one significant development being the introduction of legislation to provide for remedies against [[Corporate manslaughter]], which culminated with a new law coming into force on 1 April 2008. The charity also generated income through charging fees for presentations by members on training courses for corporate bodies based on members' experience.

==Funding and Status==
The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funded much of the organisation's work on corporate responsibility as well as offering core funding for five years from 2003. The Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and then the Golden Bottle/Bulldog trusts also gave grants for core funding. In 2015 the decision was taken to no longer offer a proactive response to major emergencies or offer presentations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15608">A '''drug recall''' removes a [[medical prescription|prescription]] or [[over-the-counter drug]] from the market. Drug recalls in the [[United States]] are made by the [[FDA]] or the creators of the drug when certain criteria are met. When a drug recall is made, the drug is removed from the market and potential legal action can be taken depending on the severity of the drug recall.&lt;ref name="Safety Recall Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety Recall Definitions|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm165546.htm|website=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug recalls are classified in the US by the [[FDA]] in three different categories. [[Class I recall]]s are the most severe and indicate that exposure and/or consumption of the drug will lead to adverse health effects or death. [[Class I recall|Class II recalls]] refer to drugs that induce temporary and/or medically reversible health effects. [[Class I recall|Class III recalls]] occur when adverse health effects are not likely to occur when consuming the drug or being exposed to it.&lt;ref name="Safety Recall Definitions" /&gt;

There are also [[market withdrawals]]&lt;ref name="Market Withdrawals and Safety Alerts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety Recall Definitions|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/default.htm|website=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[medical device]] safety alerts'.&lt;ref name="Market Withdrawals and Safety Alerts" /&gt; Market withdrawals occur when a product has a minor violation that does not require [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] legal action. [[Medical device safety alerts]] occur when there are unreasonable safety risks associated with using a product.&lt;ref name="Safety Recall Definitions" /&gt;

==Examples in the United States==
A more comprehensive list of drug recalls worldwide can be found here: [[List of withdrawn drugs]].

===Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup===
[[Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup]] introduced as a soothing agent for both humans and animals, but was primarily advertised to help soothe teething babies. Though not directly affiliated with the [[FDA]], [[Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup]] was denounced by the [[American Medical Association]] in 1911 via their article titled "Baby Killers." The syrup was sold until as late as 1930 in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Soothing Syrup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup|url=http://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/museum/item/529/mrs.-winslow's-soothing-syrup|website=The Wood Library Museum|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diethylstilbestrol (DES)===
In 1971, [[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) was recalled from the market. It was intended to be used to prevent [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] problems during [[pregnancy]]. Women who took [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] were shown to have a greater chance of having [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer JR, Wise LA, Hatch EE, Troisi R, Titus-Ernstoff L, Strohsnitter W, Kaufman R, Herbst AL, Noller KL, Hyer M, Hoover RN | title = Prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and risk of breast cancer. | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1509–14 | date = Aug 2006 | pmid = 16896041 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0109 | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/15/8/1509.full.pdf+html | accessdate = February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 5 to 10 million persons were exposed to [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] until its recall in 1971. Both mothers and second generation daughters are confirmed to have adverse [[side effect]]s from DES.&lt;ref name="CDC DES"&gt;{{cite web|title=DES Update Home|url=https://www.cdc.gov/des/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Daughters of DES Mothers are more than twice as likely to form [[breast cancer]] and are 2.4 times as likely to be [[infertile]]. 
Sons of DES mothers have displayed [[side effect]]s like genital abnormalities, non-cancerous [[spermatocele|Epididymal Cysts]], and [[infertility]].&lt;ref name="CDC DES" /&gt;
The Third Generation of people exposed to DES are just now entering into an age where reproductive problems and abnormalities can be studied. No viable results currently exist.&lt;ref name="Third Generation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Potential Health Risks for Third Generation (Offspring of DES Daughters and Sons)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/des/consumers/about/concerns_offspring.html|website=CDC|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for drug recall ==
The [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm165546.htm FDA] will issue different levels of recall depending on the severity of the effects. From most to least severe, there is [[Class I recall|Class I]], [[Class I recall|Class II]], and [[Class I recall|Class III]] (defined above).There is also [[market withdrawal]] which occurs when a drug does not violate [[FDA Regulation|FDA regulation]] but has a known, minor default. The producer must either fix the default or take the drug off the market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm165546.htm|title=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, &amp; Safety Alerts - Background and Definitions|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drug]]s and [[medical device]]s are typically recalled if the product is [[Product defect|defective]], [[Contamination|contaminated]], contains a [[Foreign object damage|foreign object]], fails to meet specifications, mislabeled, or misbranded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/ucm129259.htm|title=Industry Guidance - Guidance for Industry:  Product Recalls, Including Removals and Corrections|last=Affairs|first=Office of Regulatory|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misbranding was the most common reason for pharmaceutical recalls in 2015, accounting for 42%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stericycleexpertsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recall-Index-US-Q42015-Stericycle.pdf|title=Q4 2015 Recall Index|date=2016|website=StericycleExpertSolutions.com|publisher=|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This graph charts the rise in drug recalls by class in the United States from 2004 to 2014 with data from [http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2014/08/11/20005/Number-of-Drug-Recalls-Surges-at-FDA-Led-by-Mid-Level-Concerns/ Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society]

== Recall process ==
The recall process in the United States follows three approximate phases. Distinct difficulties arise depending on the type of drug being recalled.

Drug recalls can be initiated by the producing firm or the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], and those launched by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] can be either mandatory or voluntary. This is applicable not just to drugs but all products covered under the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notification and response ===
A firm submitting a recall to the FDA must provide all relevant information about the specific drug, including but not limited to: product name, use, description, and at least two samples of product (including packaging, instructions, inserts, etc.).

The firm must explain the problem they found with the product, how they found this problem, and the reason the problem occurred. For example, if the firm finds a leaking pipe near a product assembly line and tests for batches of the drug produced on that line are positive for contamination, they would submit that as the reason to how they believe their products came to be affected. After submitting a field report, the potential risks will be assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Processing and tracking ===
In processing the recall, a [[Health Hazard Assessment]] will be conducted by the FDA to determine the recall class (defined above). Level, notification, instructions, mechanics, impacts on economy, and individual consumer must all be considered in determining recall strategy. Level of recall refers to which part of the distribution chain to which the recall is extended ([[wholesale]], [[retail]], [[pharmacy]], medical user, etc.). Notification is the way consumers are alerted to the recall. In cases of a severe health hazard, a [[Public relations|press release]] must be promptly issued. The FDA recommends a written notification, so consumers will have lasting documentation. There are guidelines for notification depending on type; these types include: mail, phone, facsimile, e-mail, media. Instructions and mechanics are information provided to the consumer regarding appropriate action for the recall. The instructions include if the product is to be returned, and if so, where and how they should return the product. It is important to consider the recalled drug’s place in the market, should the recall lead to [[market shortages]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Compliance and reporting ===
The FDA will conduct an [[Effectiveness Check]] to determine the success of the recall. The drug will either undergo controlled destruction or reconditioning (i.e. relabeling with the correct label). Status reports are conducted throughout the recall to determine effectiveness.

The root cause of the recall must be addressed and corrected to prevent future occurrences. After all corrective action is acknowledged and carried out, the FDA can terminate the recall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Drug type ===
OTC, prescription, and compounded drugs (drugs tailored to a specific patient) each pose unique challenges to the recall process.

[[Over-the-counter drug|Over the counter drugs]] are widely distributed and there is no direct link between company and consumer. Recalls are typically only advertised online and in the media, so consumers are subject to their own awareness. Lot numbers indicated on the packing allow only those affected to participate in recall.

[[Prescription drug]] recalls are made simpler because they follow supply chain: the manufacturer notifies the pharmacy who notifies the patient. However, since there is not a lot/batch number on packaging, recalls must rely on date ranges (date the prescription was filled) whose inaccuracy may lead to higher costs.

[[Compounded drugs]] are simple to recall because there is a direct link to patient. Despite the seeming simplicity, the offending component is typically identified across multiple drug classifications, expanding the recall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Changes in United States government policy ==
Although incomplete, this list highlights some changes in United States government policy that have had an effect on drug recalls.

=== National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act ===
The [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act|National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986]] recognized the threat of injury and death that vaccines can pose. It allowed for [[financial compensation]] of the family should such threats come to light, and it increased vaccination safety precautions. If the federal compensation is not sufficient or not granted, this act allowed patients to take legal action for vaccine injuries. This is relevant to drug recalls because a vaccine producer is responsible for reparative damages if their vaccine causes injury and was not recalled.

=== FDA Modernization Act of 1997 ===
The [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997]] was passed in order to streamline the FDA to meet standards of efficiency expected by the 21st century. In regards to drugs, the act lowered the regulatory obligations of pharmaceutical companies, allowing them to rely on one clinical trial for approval. It is still the assumption, however, that two trials are necessary to determine safety and effectiveness.

In addition to lower regulatory hurdles, the act allowed for the advertisement of “off label” uses. The effects of this could be unnecessary overuse of the product by consumers and larger profits for the firm. Apropos to medical devices, private for-profit firms were allowed to review the products instead of the FDA.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2015/08/21st-century-cures-act-a-huge-step-backward-for-fda-standards/|title=21st Century Cures Act: A huge step backward for FDA standards - HealthNewsReview.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st Century Cures Act ===
{{main article|21st Century Cures Act}}
The 21st Century Cures Act would allow for faster approval of certain drugs, which could result in additional recalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/puzzling-prescription-pharmaceutical-industry-trends-pose-new-regulatory-recall-challenges-nasdaq-srcl-2097584.htm|title=A Puzzling Prescription: Pharmaceutical Industry Trends Pose New Regulatory and Recall Challenges|website=Marketwire|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by US President Barack Obama on December 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4599295/president-obama-cures-act-livestream-online/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 45 new drugs were passed by the FDA, which is more than double than the approval rate 10 years ago. The 21st Century Cures Act could make this number a trend rather than aberration by expediting approval through lower standards, much like the [[FDA Modernization Act of 1997]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rationale behind the act is that urgency trumps risk for “breakthrough” medical devices. The act would allow producers to submit data other than official [[clinical trial]]s for consideration, such as case histories. It would also allow reviews to be done by third parties instead of the FDA. Debates stem from the fact that approval could be based on [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] rather than [[scientific evidence]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This act is debated due to the FDA’s seemingly close relations with [[medical device]] producers. The two industries collaborated to write proposals for lobbying for the legislation of this act. The FDA is supposed to be neutral in its actions, but representatives from [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[St Jude Medical]], and [[CVRx Inc.]] (large medical device suppliers) were all in attendance for the collaborative meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2016/01/fda-teams-up-with-medical-device-industry-to-write-21st-century-cures-act/|title=FDA teams up with medical device industry to write 21st Century Cures Act - HealthNewsReview.org|website=www.healthnewsreview.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electromigration''' is the transport of material caused by the gradual movement of the [[ion]]s in a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] due to the [[momentum]] transfer between conducting [[electron]]s and diffusing metal [[atom]]s.  The effect is important in applications where high direct current densities are used, such as in [[microelectronics]] and related structures. As the structure size in [[electronics]] such as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) decreases, the practical significance of this effect increases.

== History ==
The phenomenon of electromigration has been known for over 100 years, having been discovered by the French scientist Gerardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9994/32106/01493049.pdf?arnumber=1493049|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic first became of practical interest during the late 1960s when packaged ICs first appeared. The earliest commercially available ICs failed in a mere three weeks of use from runaway electromigration, which led to a major industry effort to correct this problem. The first observation of electromigration in thin films was made by I. Blech.&lt;ref name="Blech" &gt;I. Blech: ''Electromigration in Thin Aluminum Films on Titanium Nitride.'' Journal of Applied Physics, Vol 47, pp. 1203-1208, April 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field was pioneered by a number of investigators throughout the fledgling [[semiconductor]] industry. One of the most important engineering studies was performed by Jim Black of [[Motorola]], after whom [[Black's equation]] is named.&lt;ref name="Black" &gt;J.R. Black: ''Electromigration - A Brief Survey and Some Recent Results.'' IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, Vol. ED-16 (No. 4), pp. 338-347, April 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the metal interconnects in ICs were still about 10 [[micrometre]]s wide. Currently interconnects are only hundreds to tens of [[nanometer]]s in width, making research in electromigration increasingly important.

== Practical implications of electromigration ==

Electromigration decreases the reliability of chips ([[integrated circuits]] (ICs)). It can cause the eventual loss of connections or failure of a circuit. Since reliability is critically important for [[Space exploration|space travel]], [[Armed force|military purposes]], [[anti-lock braking system]]s, medical equipment like [[Automated External Defibrillator]]s and is even important for personal computers or home entertainment systems, the reliability of chips [[integrated circuits|(ICs)]] is a major focus of research efforts.

Due to difficulty of testing under real conditions, [[Black's equation]] is used to predict the life span of integrated circuits.
To use [[Black's equation]], the component is put through [[high temperature operating life]] (HTOL) testing. The component's expected life span under real conditions is [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] from data gathered during the testing.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;

Although electromigration damage ultimately results in failure of the affected IC, the first symptoms are intermittent glitches, and are quite challenging to diagnose. As some interconnects fail before others, the circuit exhibits seemingly random errors, which may be indistinguishable from other failure mechanisms (such as [[electrostatic discharge]] damage). In a laboratory setting, electromigration failure is readily imaged with an electron microscope, as interconnect erosion leaves telltale visual markers on the metal layers of the IC.

With increasing miniaturization, the probability of failure due to electromigration increases in [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] and [[Ultra Large Scale Integration|ULSI]] circuits because both the power density and the current density increase.&lt;ref name="EM_book"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig, M. Thiele|title=Fundamentals of Electromigration-Aware Integrated Circuit Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-73558-0|pp=1–12|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Springer|date=2018|isbn=978-3-319-73557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, line widths will continue to decrease over time, as will wire cross-sectional areas. Currents are also reduced due to lower supply voltages and shrinking gate capacitances.&lt;ref name="EM_book" /&gt; However, as current reduction is constrained by increasing frequencies, the more marked decrease in cross-sectional areas (compared to current reduction) will give rise to increased current densities  in ICs going forward.&lt;ref name="Lienig2" &gt;J. Lienig, M. Thiele: "The Pressing Need for Electromigration-Aware Physical Design  " [https://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/ispd_2018_pp144_151.pdf (Download paper)], ''Proc. of the Int. Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD) 2018'', pp. 144–151, March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In advanced [[semiconductor manufacturing]] processes, [[copper]] has replaced [[aluminium]] as the interconnect material of choice. Despite its greater fragility in the fabrication process, copper is preferred for its superior conductivity. It is also intrinsically less susceptible to electromigration. However, electromigration (EM) continues to be an ever-present challenge to device fabrication, and therefore the EM research for copper interconnects is ongoing (though a relatively new field).&lt;ref name="Lienig2" /&gt;

In modern consumer electronic devices, ICs rarely fail due to electromigration effects.  This is because proper semiconductor design practices incorporate the effects of electromigration into the IC's layout.&lt;ref name="Lienig2" /&gt;  Nearly all IC design houses use automated [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] tools to check and correct electromigration problems at the transistor layout-level.  When operated within the manufacturer's specified temperature and voltage range, a properly designed IC device is more likely to fail from other (environmental) causes, such as cumulative damage from [[gamma ray|gamma-ray]] bombardment.

Nevertheless, there have been documented cases of product failures due to electromigration.  In the late 1980s, one line of [[Western Digital]]'s desktop drives suffered widespread, predictable failure 12–18 months after field usage.  Using forensic analysis of the returned bad units, engineers identified improper design-rules in a third-party supplier's IC controller.  By replacing the bad component with that of a different supplier, WD was able to correct the flaw, but not before significant damage to the company's reputation.

Electromigration due to poor fabrication processes was a significant cause of IC failures on [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s home computers during the 1980s. During 1983, the [[Commodore 64]] computer for a time had a nearly 50% customer return rate.

Electromigration can be a cause of degradation in some [[power semiconductor device]]s such as low voltage [[power MOSFET]]s, in which the lateral current through the source contact metallisation (often aluminium) can reach the critical current densities during overload conditions.  The degradation of the aluminium layer causes an increase in on-state resistance, and can eventually lead to complete failure.

== Fundamentals ==
The material properties of the metal interconnects have a strong influence on the life span. The characteristics are predominantly the composition of the metal alloy and the dimensions of the conductor. The shape of the conductor, the crystallographic orientation of the grains in the metal, procedures for the layer deposition, heat treatment or [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], characteristics of the [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and the interface to other materials also affect the durability of the interconnects. There are also grave differences with time dependent current:  [[direct current]] or different [[alternating current]] waveforms cause different effects.

=== Forces on ions in an electrical field ===
Two [[force]]s affect ionized [[atom]]s in a conductor: 1) The direct [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] force ''F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', as a result of the electric field, which has the same direction as the electric field, and 2) The force from the exchange of momentum with other [[charge carrier]]s ''F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', toward the flow of charge carriers, is in the opposite direction of the electric field. In metallic conductors ''F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is caused by a so-called "electron wind" or "[[Ion wind]]".

The resulting force ''F&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt;'' on an activated ion in the electrical field is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_{res}=F_e-F_p=q\cdot Z^*\cdot E=q\cdot Z^*\cdot j\cdot \rho
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;!-- I am trying to join the two articles from here --&gt;
&lt;!-- and not succeeding very well. But fixed anyway --&gt;

Electromigration occurs when some of the [[momentum]] of a moving electron is transferred to a nearby activated ion. This causes the ion to move from its original position. Over time this force knocks a significant number of atoms far from their original positions. A break or gap can develop in the conducting material, preventing the flow of electricity. In narrow interconnect conductors, such as those linking transistors and other components in integrated circuits, this is known as a '''void''' or '''internal''' '''failure''' [[Electric circuit|open circuit]]. Electromigration can also cause the atoms of a conductor to pile up and drift toward other nearby conductors, creating an unintended electrical connection known as a '''hillock failure''' or '''whisker failure''' ([[short circuit]]).  Both of these situations can lead to a malfunction of the circuit.

== Failure mechanisms ==

=== Diffusion mechanisms ===
In a homogeneous crystalline structure, because of the uniform lattice structure of the metal ions, there is hardly any momentum transfer between the conduction electrons and the metal ions. However, this symmetry does not exist at the grain boundaries and material interfaces, and so here momentum is transferred much more vigorously. Since the metal ions in these regions are bonded more weakly than in a regular crystal lattice, once the electron wind has reached a certain strength, atoms become separated from the grain boundaries and are transported in the direction of the current. This direction is also influenced by the grain boundary itself, because atoms tend to move along grain boundaries.

Diffusion processes caused by electromigration can be divided into grain boundary diffusion, bulk diffusion and surface diffusion. In general, grain boundary diffusion is the major electromigration process in aluminum wires, whereas surface diffusion is dominant in copper interconnects.

=== Thermal effects ===
In an ideal conductor, where atoms are arranged in a perfect [[crystal structure|lattice]] structure, the electrons moving through it would experience no collisions and electromigration would not occur.  In real conductors, defects in the lattice structure and the random thermal vibration of the atoms about their positions causes electrons to collide with the atoms and [[scattering|scatter]], which is the source of electrical resistance (at least in metals; see [[electrical conduction]]).  Normally, the amount of momentum imparted by the relatively low-[[mass]] electrons is not enough to permanently displace the atoms.  However, in high-power situations (such as with the increasing current draw and decreasing wire sizes in modern [[VLSI]] [[microprocessor]]s), if many electrons bombard the atoms with enough force to become significant, this will accelerate the process of electromigration by causing the atoms of the conductor to vibrate further from their ideal lattice positions, increasing the amount of electron [[scattering]].  High [[Current (electricity)|current density]] increases the number of electrons scattering against the atoms of the conductor, and hence the speed at which those atoms are displaced.

In integrated circuits, electromigration does not occur in [[semiconductor]]s directly, but in the metal interconnects deposited onto them (see [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]]).

Electromigration is exacerbated by high current densities and the [[Joule heating]] of the conductor (see [[electrical resistance]]), and can lead to eventual failure of electrical components. Localized increase of current density is known as [[current crowding]].

=== Balance of atom concentration ===
A governing equation which describes the atom concentration evolution throughout some interconnect segment, is the conventional mass balance (continuity) equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\vec J = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N(\vec x, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the atom concentration at the point with a coordinates &lt;math&gt;\vec x=(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; at the moment of time &lt;math&gt;
t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;
J&lt;/math&gt; is the total atomic flux at this location. The total atomic flux &lt;math&gt;
J&lt;/math&gt; is a combination of the fluxes caused by the different atom migration forces. The major forces are induced by the [[electric current]], and by the gradients of temperature, [[stress (physics)|mechanical stress]] and concentration. &lt;math&gt;\vec J = \vec J_c + \vec J_T + \vec J_\sigma + \vec J_N&lt;/math&gt;.

To define the fluxes mentioned above:

• &lt;math&gt;\vec J_c = \frac{NeZD\rho}{kT}\vec j&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;
e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron]] charge, &lt;math&gt;
eZ&lt;/math&gt; is the effective charge of the migrating atom, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the [[resistivity]] of the conductor where atom migration takes place, &lt;math&gt;\vec j&lt;/math&gt; is the local current density, &lt;math&gt;
k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant|Boltzmann’s constant]], &lt;math&gt;
T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]]. &lt;math&gt;D(\vec x, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time and position dependent atom diffusivity.

• &lt;math&gt;\vec J_T = -\frac{NDQ}{kT^2}\nabla T&lt;/math&gt;. We use &lt;math&gt;
Q&lt;/math&gt; the heat of thermal diffusion.

• &lt;math&gt;\vec J_\sigma = \frac{ND\Omega}{kT}\nabla H&lt;/math&gt; here &lt;math&gt;\Omega=1/N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the atomic volume and &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is initial atomic [[concentration]], &lt;math&gt;H=(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33})/3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hydrostatic stress]] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{11},\sigma_{22},\sigma_{33}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of principal stress.

• &lt;math&gt;\vec J_N = -D\nabla N&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming a vacancy mechanism for atom [[diffusion]] we can express &lt;math&gt;
D&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the hydrostatic stress &lt;math&gt;D = D_0\exp(\frac{\Omega H - E_A}{kT})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; is the effective [[activation energy]] of the thermal diffusion of metal atoms. The vacancy concentration represents availability of empty lattice sites, which might be occupied by a migrating atom.

== Electromigration-aware design ==

=== Electromigration reliability of a wire (Black's equation) ===
{{main article | Black's equation }}

At the end of the 1960s J. R. Black developed an empirical model to estimate the [[MTTF]] (mean time to failure) of a wire, taking electromigration into consideration. Since then, the formula has gained popularity in the semiconductor industry:&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{MTTF} = \frac{A}{J^n} e^{\frac{E_\text{a}}{k T}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a constant based on the cross-sectional area of the interconnect, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the current density, &lt;math&gt;E_\text{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]] (e.g. 0.7 eV for grain boundary diffusion in aluminum), &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann's constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a scaling factor (usually set to 2 according to Black).&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt; The temperature of the conductor appears in the exponent, i.e. it strongly affects the MTTF of the interconnect. For an interconnect to remain reliable as the temperature rises, the maximum tolerable current density of the conductor must necessarily decrease. However, as interconnect technology advances at the nanometer scale, the validity of Black's equation becomes increasingly questionable.

=== Wire material ===
Historically, aluminium has been used as conductor in integrated circuits, due to its good adherence to substrate, good conductivity, and ability to form [[ohmic contact]]s with silicon.&lt;ref name="EM_book" /&gt; However, pure aluminium is susceptible to electromigration. Research shows that adding 2-4% of copper to aluminium increases resistance to electromigration about 50 times. The effect is attributed to the grain boundary segregation of copper, which greatly inhibits the diffusion of aluminium atoms across grain boundaries.&lt;ref name="contact_book"&gt;{{Cite book|author=M. Braunovic, N. K. Myshkin, V. V. Konchits|title=Electrical Contacts: Fundamentals, Applications and Technology|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electrical-Contacts-Fundamentals-Applications-and-Technology/Braunovic-Myshkin-Konchits/p/book/9781574447279|pp=|publisher=CRC Press|date=2006|isbn=978-1-5744-47279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure copper wires can withstand approximately five times more current density than aluminum wires while maintaining similar reliability requirements.&lt;ref name="Lienig" &gt;J. Lienig: "Introduction to Electromigration-Aware Physical Design" [http://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/ispd06_emPaper_lienig.pdf (Download paper)], ''Proc. of the Int. Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD) 2006'', pp. 39–46, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to the higher electromigration activation energy levels of copper, caused by its superior electrical and thermal conductivity as well as its higher melting point. Further improvements can be achieved by alloying copper with about 1% [[palladium]] which inhibits diffusion of copper atoms along grain boundaries in the same way as the addition of copper to aluminium interconnect.

=== Bamboo structure and metal slotting ===
A wider wire results in smaller current density and, hence, less likelihood of electromigration. Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries and the higher likelihood of electromigration effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the wire material, grain boundaries become "crosswise", more or less perpendicular to the length of the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to electromigration increases, despite an increase in current density. This apparent contradiction is caused by the perpendicular position of the grain boundaries; the boundary diffusion factor is excluded, and material transport is correspondingly reduced.&lt;ref name="Lienig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zamri"&gt;M. Zamri ''et al'' "In Situ TEM Observation of Fe-Included Carbon Nanofiber: Evolution of Structural and Electrical Properties in Field Emission Process", ACS Nano, 2012, 6 (11), pp 9567–9573. [Link http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn302889e]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the maximum wire width possible for a bamboo structure is usually too narrow for signal lines of large-magnitude currents in analog circuits or for power supply lines. In these circumstances, slotted wires are often used, whereby rectangular holes are carved in the wires. Here, the widths of the individual metal structures in between the slots lie within the area of a bamboo structure, while the resulting total width of all the metal structures meets power requirements.&lt;ref name="Lienig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zamri"/&gt;

=== Blech length ===
There is a lower limit for the length of the interconnect that will allow higher current carrying capability. It is known as “Blech length”.&lt;ref name="Blech" /&gt; Any wire that has a length below this limit will have a stretched limit for Electromigration. Here, a mechanical stress buildup causes an atom back flow process which reduces or even compensates the effective material flow towards the anode. The Blech length must be considered when designing test structures for electromigration.

=== Via arrangements and corner bends ===
Particular attention must be paid to [[Via (electronics)|vias]] and contact holes.The current carrying capacity of a via is much less than a metallic wire of same length. Hence multiple vias are often used, whereby the geometry of the via array is very significant: multiple vias must be organized such that the resulting current is distributed as evenly as possible through all the vias.

Attention must also be paid to bends in interconnects. In particular, 90-degree corner bends must be avoided, since the current density in such bends is significantly higher than that in oblique angles (e.g., 135 degrees).&lt;ref name="Lienig" /&gt;

=== Electromigration in solder joints ===
The typical current density at which electromigration occurs in Cu or Al interconnects is 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For solder joints (SnPb or SnAgCu lead-free) used in IC chips, however, electromigration occurs at much lower current densities, e.g. 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
It causes a net atom transport along the direction of electron flow. The atoms pile up at the anode, voids are generated at the cathode and back stress is induced during electromigration. The typical failure of a solder joint due to electromigration will occur at the cathode side. Due to the current crowding effect, voids form first at the corner of the solder joint. Then the voids extend and cause a failed circuit. Electromigration also influences formation of [[intermetallic compound]]s.

=== Electromigration and TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) ===
The complete mathematical model describing electromigration consists of several partial differential equations (PDEs) &lt;ref name="Basaran_Lin03" &gt;C. Basaran, M. Lin, and H. Ye : ''A Thermodynamic Model for Electrical Current Induced Damage.'' International Journal of Solids and Structures, Vol 40, pp. 7315-7327, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; which need to be solved for three-dimensional geometrical domains representing segments of an interconnect structure. Such a mathematical model forms the basis for simulation of electromigration in modern TCAD tools.&lt;ref name="Ceric_Selberherr11" &gt;H. Ceric and [[Siegfried Selberherr|S. Selberherr]] : ''Electromigration in Submicron Interconnect Features of Integrated Circuits.'' Materials Science and Engineering R, Vol 71, pp. 53-56, 2011. [Link https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mser.2010.09.001]&lt;/ref&gt;
Usage of TCAD tools for detailed investigations of electromigration induced interconnect degradation is gaining importance. Results of TCAD study in combination with reliability tests lead to modification of design rules improving the interconnect resistance to electromigration.&lt;ref name="Orio_Ceric12" &gt;R. Orio, H.

The '''European Assembly for Climate Justice''' took place in Brussels from 26 to 29 November 2010.

Over 250 people from ten European countries assembled for four days of debates, discussion, action and networking.

==Motivation==
The Assembly was organised following a call out from [[Via Campesina]] for [[1000 Cancuns]] where people across the world would organise [[popular assemblies]] in the run up to the [[COP16]].

==Activities==
===Critical mass bike ride===
Events began on Friday 26th when 120 cyclists gathered for a [[critical mass]] ride around central Brussels.

===Workshops, general assembly and conference===
On Saturday and Sunday morning participants gathered at Erasmus Hogeschool for [[workshops]], a [[popular assembly]] and a [[Academic conference|conference]].

===Sing for the Climate===
On Sunday afternoon participants joined the climate justice bloc in the "[[Sing for the Climate]]" event which was organised by the [[Belgian Climate Coalition]].

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1988''' was the 33rd edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The contest took place on 30 April 1988 in [[Dublin, Ireland]], following the country's win at the previous [[1987 Eurovision Song Contest|1987 edition]]. The presenters were [[Pat Kenny]] and [[Michelle Rocca]]. The host broadcaster was [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Radio Telefís Éireann]] (RTÉ) which revamped the show's production style compared to its earlier editions, in order to appeal to a younger audience.

The winner was Switzerland with the song "[[Ne partez pas sans moi]]", performed by Canadian singer [[Céline Dion]] and composed by [[Atilla Şereftuğ]] with lyrics in [[French Language|French]] by [[Nella Martinetti]]. Switzerland beat the United Kingdom by just a point in the last vote to win the title. Twenty-one countries took part, after an initial plan of twenty-two, as [[Cyprus]] withdrew its already registered entry for breaching the contest's rules by being published few years earlier, in an attempt to represent the country at a prior edition of the contest. The Cypriot song had been drawn to be performed 2nd in the running order.

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Dublin}}
[[File:The RDS Simmonscourt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|RDS Simmonscourt – host venue of the 1988 contest.]]
Dublin is the capital and largest city of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Dublin is in the province of [[Leinster]] on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]]. Founded as a [[Viking]] settlement, the [[Kings of Dublin|Kingdom of Dublin]] became Ireland's principal city following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]]. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the [[British Empire]] before the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Republic of Ireland.

The contest took place at the Simmonscourt Pavilion of the [[Royal Dublin Society]], which was normally used for agricultural and horse shows. The same venue hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981 contest]].

==Format==

===Graphic design===
Host broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] employed [[Declan Lowney]], who was notable for being a director of music videos and youth programming, as director for this edition, in order to revamp the contest to attract and sustain a younger audience. The traditional [[scoreboard]] was replaced with two giant [[Video wall|Vidiwalls]] located on either side of the stage, which also projected live images of the performers from the [[green room]] where the competitors set during the votes announcements, and a new computer-generated scoreboard was used.

The [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] itself, conceived by Paula Farrell under chief production designer Michael Grogan, was also the largest and most elaborate ever constructed for the Eurovision Song Contest. To compensate for the fact that the vast stage took up most of the room in what is really an average size exhibition hall, the director deliberately darkened the hall where the audience was located and refused to use wide angled shots of the audience, in order to create the illusion of the venue being bigger than it actually was.

The Postcards featured the participants doing things in Ireland from culture, to tradition, to sports or sightseeing.

Lowney was also the director of the show's interval act, introduced after the competing songs and before the votes announcement. The interval act was a video of the popular Irish rock group [[Hothouse Flowers]], which was filmed in eleven countries around Europe and was the most expensive music video ever produced in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] at the time.

===Voting===
Each country had a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 point(s) for its top ten songs.

This edition features one of the closest and fickle-ending votes in the history of the contest. With three countries left to vote, the UK was well in the lead with 133 points against Switzerland's 118. With the third last country, France, only awarding Switzerland one point, the UK looked certain of victory, as even if Switzerland scooped the two final 12s, the UK would only need to gather nine points from three juries combined to be unbeatable. However, France didn't award the UK any points, and the following country, Portugal, gave the UK a meagre three points while giving the maximum 12 to Switzerland, making the contest blown open between the two countries until the end of the voting.

With the conclusion of voting from the penultimate jury, the UK was holding a five-point lead over Switzerland. As the final jury, that of Yugoslavia, began to award its points in the customary ascending order, a lot of excitement-sighs were heard from the audience to see how the two rivals for victory would fare. Switzerland was the first to be named with six points, edging it into a one-point lead over the UK. After earlier strong votes from most countries to the UK, it seemed highly likely that the UK would be given one of the higher remaining set of points. However, eventually the UK only managed to garner a meagre three points between the last three juries, as after Yugoslavia announced its seven, eight, ten and twelve points, it transpired that it had awarded the UK no points at all,{{#tag:ref|Yugoslavia, as being the last jury to announce its votes, had caused the same situation to happen when after their voting UK lost to Spain by 1 point in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968 Contest]].|group=n}} and Switzerland was left with its one-point lead to savour a dramatic triumph.

==Conductors==
Each performance had a [[conducted|conductor]] who was [[maestro]] to the orchestra, expect for Iceland and Italy.

==Participants==
Twenty-one countries took part, after an initial plan of twenty-two, as Cyprus withdrew from the contest after it had already submitted an entry. Cypriot broadcaster [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|CyBC]] had selected the song 'Thimame' sung by Yiannis Dimitrou, and at a late stage saw that the song was ineligible to represent them as it had been entered into the Cypriot selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984 Contest]], where it had finished in 3rd place. This was classed as a breach of the Cypriot rules of selecting their entry at this time as well as an infringement of the Eurovision Song Contest rules. It was a very late decision as the song was already drawn to perform second in the contest, advertised in the [[Radio Times]] information about the preview programme of the contest, and appears as song number two in accordance to its initial performance draw, on the record release “Melodi Grand Prix 1988” – the compilation disc of the contest’s entries.

This was the second victory for Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest after winning its [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|first edition in 1956]], and the last time a song in French won the contest, the language having dominated the event in earlier years.

The contest helped launch an international career for two artists, the winner for Switzerland [[Céline Dion]] and Luxembourg’s representative [[Lara Fabian]]. [[French-Canadian]] Céline Dion was only famous in the [[French language|French]]-speaking world at the time of the contest, shortly afterwards started recording songs in English.&lt;ref name=ESC1988&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1998|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=304#Participants|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' official website – History by year section|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgian]]-Canadian Lara Fabian started a successful career after the contest with becoming established in various countries worldwide, with a mainly French-sung repertoire.&lt;ref name=ESC1988/&gt; The UK entry was [[songwriter|written]] and composed by Julie Forsyth, the daughter of the entertainer [[Bruce Forsyth]] who was present. When interviewed afterwards he was particularly annoyed at the Dutch jury not having given a vote to the UK, as they had done some work there.

The contest saw the return of seven artists who had participated in its previous editions: Denmark's [[Hot Eyes|Kirsten &amp; Søren]] represented the country in [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], Finland's [[Boulevard (Finnish band)|Boulevard]] represented the [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1987|country in 1987]] as [[Vicky Rosti]]'s backing group, Israel's Re'uven Gvirtz and Yehuda Tamir, winners of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|contest in 1979]] as part of [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]] returned to Eurovision as backing singers for [[Yardena Arazi]], who represented the [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976|country in 1976]] as part of the group [[Chocolat, Menta, Mastik]]. Arazi had hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|contest in 1979]],{{#tag:ref|With this, she became the first person to compete in the contest after hosting an earlier edition; before her, there were few competitors that hosted later editions of the contest.|group=n}} Portugal's [[Dora (singer)|Dora]] represented the [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986|country in 1986]], Sweden's [[Tommy Körberg]] represented the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969|country in 1969]], and Turkey's [[Mazhar-Fuat-Özkan|MFÖ]] represented the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985|country in 1985]].

'''''Evropa''''' was a weekly [[Serbia]]n [[magazine]] published from 2004 until 2008. In written form, it was occasionally also referred to as '''''Evropa&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''''

At first, conceptually a cross between a [[newsmagazine|news]] and general interest magazine, ''Evropa'''s first issue appeared on April 15, 2004. Initially edited and owned by [[Željko Cvijanović]], the magazine devoted equal attention to political, social and economic issues, as well as to culture and entertainment topics. Written in lighter tone, published under "Nacionalni nedeljnik" (National weekly) mantra, it tried to avoid a single political and ideological position.

Its publisher's stated ambition was to promote European values as well as European perspective for Serbia. To that end, magazine has developed a network of correspondents in the following European capitals: [[Dublin]], [[Madrid]], [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Rome]], [[Paris]] as well as in the countries of former Yugoslavia.

In addition to Serbia, ''Evropa'' was available on the news stands in [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. During summer months the magazine was distributed throughout seaside resorts in [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Greece]].

In mid-2006, Cvijanović sold ''Evropa'' to [[Philip Zepter]] and the editing duties were taken over by [[Rade Stanić]] who in many ways continued with concept employed by Cvijanović.

In late August 2007, [[Dušan Veličković]] became ''Evropa''s editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekapija.com/website/sr/page/126074|title=Dušan Veličković, novi glavni i odgovorni urednik nedeljnika Evropa - sa velikim pojačanjima|website=www.ekapija.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue he put together was #178 on September 6, 2007. In addition to new editor, the magazine saw major conceptual changes with Veličković's arrival. "Nacionalni nedeljnik" mantra was immediately scrapped, and a whole new staff (editors and columnists) came along to replace the old guard. They included: Igor Marojević, Nastasija Radović, [[Bruce Sterling]], Richard Byrne, [[Vukša Veličković]], Miša Brkić, Zanko Tomić, Bojana Mijović, and Jens-Martin Eriksen. Since December 6, 2007 (issue #191), ''Evropa'''s new credo/marketing slogan is "Prvi evropski news magazin u Srbiji" (First European newsmagazine in Serbia). Since the same issue, the magazine also got a visual makevoer with dark blue replacing red as the dominant colour.

On February 14, 2008, the day its issue #201 was due to appear on news stands, deputy editor-in-chief Nastasija Radović announced the publishing of ''Evropa'' has been discontinued, which means that the issue #200 from February 7 was its last.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=86960 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215111822/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=86960 |archive-date=2008-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, the decision was communicated to the staff by the publishing company representatives who informed them it was due to financial reasons. Editor-in-chief Dušan Veličković added that the staff was still hoping to find a way for the magazine to keep publishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ndnv.org/vest.php?id=4225 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724074011/http://www.ndnv.org/vest.php/?id=4225 |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, however that has not happened.

The '''Golovnin Incident''' involved the capture of [[Russia]]n explorer and naval captain, [[Vasily Golovnin]] in 1811, by soldiers of the Japanese [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in accordance of Japan's policy of isolationism ([[Sakoku]]). Golovnin was interned in [[Japan]] for two years before being released in 1813. The incident was an important flashpoint in [[Empire of Japan–Russian Empire relations|Russo-Japanese relations]] over the control of the [[Kuril islands]]. Golovnin's book ''Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people'', recounted his captivity, was a popular work in Europe and was translated into several languages.

== Original Mission ==
In April 1811, the Russian minister of the Marine directed the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Diana'' to explore the Southern [[Kuril]] and [[Shantar Islands]] as well as the [[Tartary|Tartary Coast]]. Golovnin had originally been dispatched from [[Kronstadt]] to the North-West [[Pacific]] in 1807 to chart the eastern coast of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golovnin|first=Vasily|title=Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people Volume 1|year=1824|publisher=Henry Colburn &amp; Co|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The sloop Diana during Vasily Golovnins journey.JPG|thumb|Japanese illustration of the sloop ''Diana'']]

In the 18th century Russian [[fur trappers]] had moved through [[Siberia]] towards the North-West Pacific and some had even settled in the Kurils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lensen|first=George|title=Early Russo-Japanese Relations|journal=The Far East Quarterly|year=1950|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior attempts to map the islands had proved difficult due to the mists that rose from the islands as well as strong winds. The expedition would sail in the summer when conditions would be optimal and then Golovnin would continue to the Shantar Islands. The ''Diana'' left [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on 25 April through the ice-flows and set to sea from [[Avacha Bay]] on 4 May. Golovnin was conscientious of respecting relations between Russia and Japan as his voyage followed several diplomatic incidents with Japan such as the castaway incident of [[Daikokuya Kōdayū]] in 1784, the [[Adam Laxman]] incident of 1791 and [[Nikolai Rezanov|Nikolai Rezanov's]] failed trade mission in 1805. Rezanov who then visited the [[United States]] was brought back to Siberia by Lieutenant Chwostoff in vessels belonging to the [[Russian-American Company]] but died when he reached Siberia in 1807. Chwostoff, however, proceeded to raid Japanese villages in [[Sakhalin]] and the Kurils without [[Tsardom of Russia|government]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 6-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wildes|first=Harry|title=Russia’s attempts to open Japan|journal=Russian Review|volume=5|issue=1|page=76|doi=10.2307/125540}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Diana'' sailed to the island of [[Iturup|Eetooroop]] and made contact with a group of [[Ainu people|Ainu]] (or Kuriles) who had been sent by the Japanese to investigate the [[Europeans]]. Golovnin proceeded to meet the Japanese military commander of the island, declaring his intention to collect wood and water and then be on his way. The commander stated that they couldn't trust the Russians due to the actions of Chwostoff, he agreed to send a letter to other commanders granting them access to supplies at the town of 'Oorbeetsch'.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians set sail, but were then intercepted by a [[Umiak|baidara]] with the Kuriles on board, as well as a newcomer; Alexei Maximovitsch. Alexei joined the Russians as an interpreter, though his proficiency in Russian was low. Many of these Kuriles came from Russian-controlled islands and had been punished for Chwostoff's attack on Japanese settlements, thus feared and resented the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 28-37&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Japanese had brutally crushed an Ainu [[Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion|rebellion]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Brett|title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion 1590-1800|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|pages=172–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture ==

European explorers had not yet discovered [[Nemuro Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] (Matsmai) and [[Kunashir]], prompting Golovnin to explore them on 4 July. As the ''Diana'' approached the harbour at Kunashir, it was fired upon by the Japanese castle. After several attempts, the ''Diana'' made contact with Japanese officers on the island. They offered the necessary supplies as well as a meeting with the island's [[Bugyō]] or governor. So as to clear the Russian government of responsibility from the Chwostoff raids, Golovnin, two officers, four sailors and the Kurile Alexei landed. There they were met by the governor of Kunashir in his castle. Negotiations seemed amicable, but the Japanese had lured Golovnin onto the island and arrested him and the other crew members.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 48-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

The crew was tightly bound with ropes whilst the ''Diana'', now under control of Petr Rikord, shot at the castle but was then forced to set sail to avoid capture.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 76-79&lt;/ref&gt; The captives were sailed across the straits to Hokkaido and encountered many villagers who were curious to see the Russians, due to the almost complete absence of foreigners in Japan. A Japanese drawing of their captivity shows the Russians' tall stature compared to the Japanese, which is also confirmed by Golovnin. The crew was led to a prison in [[Hakodate]], the capital of Hokkaido.

== Captivity ==

The crew were kept in separate cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the ''Diana'' had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor handed him a letter from the remaining officers of the ''Diana'' who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of [[Sakhalin]] in the name of the [[Tsar]]. The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lower|first=Arthur|title=Ocean of Destiny: A concise History of the North Pacific, 1500-1978|year=1978|publisher=UBC|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 141-170&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in [[Matsumae, Hokkaido|Matsumae]].[[File:Vasily Golovnin during captivity.JPG|thumb|Japanese Illustration of Golovnin]]

After in depth interrogations for weeks, the governor of Hokkaido contacted the [[Tokugawa Shogunate|central government]] in [[Edo]] to ask whether the Russians could be released. In response, the Japanese government sent a scholar called Teske (a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speaker) to try to learn Russian, to question the Russians and finally draw their [[portraits]].&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 238-258&lt;/ref&gt; The government also sent renowned explorer [[Mamiya Rinzō]] who had been wounded in the skirmish with Chwostoff on Etrop to discover more about Russia's presence in the North-West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

== Escape Attempt ==

Golovnin and his crew began plotting to escape (despite a great improvement of their treatment by the Japanese). However, one of the officers of [[Germans|German]] origin, Moor, had resolved to stay and pursue a life in Japan and had made significant progress in learning [[Japanese Language|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 278-294&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1812, the Governor received a letter stating new orders from [[Edo]] to burn any Russian ships and imprison their crews.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Golovnin and the crew (without Moor) decide to make their escape into the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. pp. 314-315&lt;/ref&gt; The crew went through the mountains to the shore to find a boat to commandeer, but were arrested after eight days by soldiers and brought back into imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golovnin|first=Vasily|title=Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people, Volume 2|year=1824|publisher=Henry Colburn &amp; Co|location=London|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new governor Oga-Sawara-Isseno-Kami, presented another letter from Chwostoff stating that his attack had been motivated by Japan's refusal to open trade with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; They were forgiven for their escape attempt and moved back to more comfortable lodging.

== Release ==

After Golovnin's capture, Rikord returned to Kamchatka to gain permission to attempt to rescue which was granted by the governor of Kamchatka as well having a document condemning Chwostoff's raid given to him. He then attempted contact with the Japanese on Kunashir, and was met with cannon fire and the message that the captured Russians were all dead.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation for the capture of Golovnin, commander [[Pyotr Ivanovich Ricord|Petr Rikord]] of the ''Diana'' detained the Japanese ship ''Kansai Maru'' and took captive the wealthy merchant [[Takadaya Kahei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irish|first=Ann B.|title=A History of Ethnic Transition and development on Japan's northern island|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company INC|location=Jefferson, N. Carolina|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as symbolically retaining four other Japanese and a Kurile whilst releasing the rest of the crew on Kunashir.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; This action brought the two countries on the brink of war. In March, 1813 the new governor arrived prohibiting the firing on of Russian ships.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; To assure the Russians of their continuing survival, Golovnin and Moor wrote to Rikord informing them that they were still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; However, two of the Japanese and one of the Ainu had died in captivity in Kamchatka (seemingly of [[scurvy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Moor, scared of retaliation by the Russians when he was released, endeavoured to upset the exchange of prisoners by warning that the Russians would attack the Japanese. Negotiations were made between Rikord, the governor of Hokkaido and the Japanese Government in Edo, in which the Japanese were convinced that Chwostoff's action had not been condoned by the Russian government and that the crew of the ''Diana'' had gone to the Kurils without mal-intent towards the Japanese. Kakadaya Kahei was released on 29 July as a show of good intention by Rikord.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was finally reached to negotiate with Rikord and offer safe passage to the ''Diana'' and Golovnin was released from prison in August 1813 with copies of all their negotiations with the Japanese as well as those of Resanov and Laxman to present to the Russian government. The ''Diana'' arrived in late September, and after deliberations with the governor, Golovnin and his crew were officially released on 6 October.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Golovnin's parting with the Japanese was amiable and both sides exchanged gifts whilst Rikord hosted a party on board the ''Diana'' for the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to Petropavlovsk, but in despair (and possibly madness), Moor committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to [[St. Petersburg]] in 1814 and were rewarded for their service.&lt;ref&gt;Golovnin. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; The Golovnin incident did not establish a renaissance in diplomacy between Europe and Japan, with the Japanese becoming increasingly fearful of the growing European presence in [[East Asia]]. In 1825, the Japanese government enacted the [[Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels]] (異国船打払令 Ikokusen Uchiharairei), requiring the burning of all European ships and the execution of their crews if they were to land outside of [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaporis|first=Constantine|title=Voices of Early Modern Japan: Contemporary Accounts of Daily Life During the Age of the Shoguns|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Molasses Flood''', also known as the '''Boston Molasses Disaster''' or the '''Great Boston Molasses Flood''', occurred on January 15, 1919 in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. A large [[molasses]] storage tank burst and a wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated {{convert|35|mph|kph|abbr=on}}, killing 21 and injuring 150. The event entered local folklore and for decades afterwards residents claimed that on hot summer days the area still smelled of molasses.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;

== Flood ==
[[File:Boston post-January 16, 1919,.jpg|thumb|left|Coverage from ''[[The Boston Post]]'']]
The disaster occurred at the [[Purity Distilling Company]] facility on January 15, 1919.  The temperature had risen above {{convert|40|F|C}}, [[Thaw (weather)|climbing rapidly]] from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days.&lt;ref name=DarkTide /&gt;{{rp|91, 95}}

Molasses can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to produce [[rum]] and [[ethanol]], the active ingredient in other [[liquor|alcoholic beverages]] and a key component in the manufacturing of [[munitions]].&lt;ref name=DarkTide /&gt;{{RP|11}} The stored molasses was awaiting transfer to the Purity plant situated between Willow Street and what is now named Evereteze Way, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].

[[File:Boston molasses area map.png|thumb|Modern downtown Boston with molasses flood area circled]]

At about 12:30 in the afternoon near Keany Square,&lt;ref name="NYTimes1919" /&gt; at 529 Commercial Street, a molasses tank {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and containing as much as {{convert|2,300,000|USgal|m3|abbr=on}}, collapsed.  Witnesses variously reported that as it collapsed they felt the ground shake and heard a roar, a long rumble similar to the passing of an elevated train (coincidentally, with [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated|a line of that type]] close by), a tremendous crashing, a deep growling, or "a thunderclap-like ''bang!''" [emphasis added], and as the [[rivet]]s shot out of the tank, a [[machine gun]]-like sound.&lt;ref name=DarkTide /&gt;{{rp|92–95}}

The collapse unleashed a wave of molasses {{convert|25|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak,&lt;ref name="SciAmJabr" /&gt; moving at {{convert|35|mph|kph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; The molasses wave was of sufficient force to damage the girders of the adjacent [[Boston Elevated Railway]]'s [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated|Atlantic Avenue]] structure and tip a railroad car momentarily off the tracks. Author Stephen Puleo describes how nearby buildings were swept off their foundations and crushed. Several blocks were flooded to a depth of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.  Puleo quotes a ''Boston Post'' report:

{{quote|quote=Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage{{nbsp}} ... Here and there struggled a form{{nsmdns}}whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was{{nbsp}} ... Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings{{nsmdns}}men and women{{nsmdns}}suffered likewise.&lt;ref name=DarkTide /&gt;{{RP|98}}}}

[[File:Boston 1919 molasses disaster - el train structure.jpg|thumb|Damage to the Boston Elevated Railway caused by the flood]]
''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that people "were picked up by a rush of air and hurled many feet." Others had debris hurled at them from the rush of sweet-smelling air. A truck was picked up and hurled into [[Boston Harbor]]. About 150 people were injured; 21 people and several horses were killed. Some were crushed and drowned by the molasses. The wounded included people, horses, and dogs; coughing fits became one of the most common ailments after the initial blast.  In a 1983 article for ''Smithsonian'', Edwards Park wrote of one child's experience:

{{quote|quote=Anthony di Stasio, walking homeward with his sisters from the Michelangelo School, was picked up by the wave and carried, tumbling on its crest, almost as though he were surfing. Then he grounded and the molasses rolled him like a pebble as the wave diminished. He heard his mother call his name and couldn't answer, his throat was so clogged with the smothering goo. He passed out, then opened his eyes to find three of his four sisters staring at him.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;}}

== Aftermath ==

First to the scene were 116 cadets under the direction of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from [[USS Nantucket (IX-18)|USS ''Nantucket'']], a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the [[Massachusetts Maritime Academy]]), that was docked nearby at the playground pier.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1919" /&gt; They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from getting in the way of the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess to pull out the survivors. Soon, the [[Boston Police]], [[Red Cross]], [[US Army|Army]], and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

Local residents brought a [[class-action lawsuit]], one of the first held in Massachusetts, against the [[United States Industrial Alcohol Company]] (USIA), which had bought Purity Distilling in 1917.  In spite of the company's attempts to claim that the tank had been blown up by [[First Red Scare|anarchists]]&lt;ref name="DarkTide" /&gt;{{rp|165}} (because some of the alcohol produced was to be used in making munitions), a court-appointed auditor found USIA responsible after three years of hearings. United States Industrial Alcohol Company ultimately paid out $600,000 in out-of-court settlements ($6.5 million in 2017, adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="StraightD" /&gt;  Relatives of those killed reportedly received around $7,000 per victim.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

=== Cleanup ===
Cleanup crews used salt water from a [[fireboat]] to wash the molasses away, and used sand to try to absorb it.&lt;ref name="TheHour" /&gt; The harbor was brown with molasses until summer.&lt;ref name="HistoryChannel" /&gt; The cleanup in the immediate area took "weeks",&lt;ref name="YankeeMason" /&gt; with more than 300 people contributing to the effort.&lt;ref name="DarkTide" /&gt;{{RP|132–134, 139}} The cleanup in the rest of Greater Boston and its suburbs would take an indefinably longer time. Rescue workers, cleanup crews, and sight-seers had tracked molasses through the streets and spread it to subway platforms, to the seats inside trains and streetcars, to pay telephone handsets, into homes,&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DarkTide" /&gt;{{RP|139}} and to countless other places. "Everything a Bostonian touched was sticky."&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:North End molasses tank.jpg|thumb|left|The molasses tank, date unknown]]
Several factors that occurred on that day and the previous days might have contributed to the disaster. The tank was constructed poorly and tested insufficiently. Due to [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] occurring within the tank, [[carbon dioxide]] production might have raised the internal pressure. The rise in local temperatures that occurred over the previous day also would have assisted in building this pressure. Records show that the air temperature rose from {{convert|2|to|41|F|C|sigfig=2}} over that period. The failure occurred from a manhole cover near the base of the tank, and a [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality. The [[hoop stress]] is greatest near the base of a filled cylindrical tank.

The tank had been filled to capacity only eight times since it was built a few years previously, putting the walls under an intermittent, cyclical load.  Several authors say that the Purity Distilling Company was (or may have been) trying to outrace [[prohibition in the United States]];&lt;ref name="PuleoQuote79" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YankeeStanley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverman" /&gt; the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]] was ratified the next day (January 16, 1919), and took effect one year later.&lt;ref name="Streissguth" /&gt;

An inquiry after the disaster revealed that Arthur Jell, who oversaw the construction, neglected basic safety tests, such as filling the tank with water to check for leaks. When filled with molasses, the tank leaked so badly that it was painted brown to hide the leaks. Local residents collected leaked molasses for their homes.&lt;ref name="StraightD" /&gt;

An investigation first published in 2014, applying modern engineering analysis, found that the steel was not only half as thick as it should have been for a tank of its size, even with the lax standards of the day, but it also lacked manganese and was made more brittle as a result.&lt;ref name="GlobeSchworm" /&gt;

In 2016, a team of scientists and students at [[Harvard University]] conducted extensive studies of the historic disaster, gathering data from many sources, including 1919 newspaper articles, old maps, and weather reports.&lt;ref name="AP-Harv"&gt;{{cite news|title=Slow as molasses? Sweet but deadly 1919 disaster explained|url=https://www.boston.com/news/history/2016/11/24/slow-as-molasses-sweet-but-deadly-1919-disaster-explained|accessdate=2016-12-03|work=Boston.com|agency=Associated Press|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student researchers also studied the behavior of cold [[corn syrup]] flooding a [[scale model]] of the affected neighborhood.&lt;ref name="NYT-Harv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mccann|first1=Erin|title=Solving a Mystery Behind the Deadly ‘Tsunami of Molasses’ of 1919|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/science/boston-molasses-flood-science.html?|accessdate=2016-12-03|work=The New York Times|date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the reports of the high speed of the flood were credible.&lt;ref name="NYT-Harv" /&gt;

Two days before the disaster, warmer molasses had been added to the tank, reducing the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.  When the tank collapsed the fluid cooled quickly as it spread, until it reached Boston's winter evening temperatures and the viscosity increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Molasses Creates a Sticky Situation |date=November 17, 2016 |publisher=[[AlphaGalileo]] |url=http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=170069&amp;CultureCode=en |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard study concluded that the molasses cooled and thickened quickly as it rushed through the streets, hampering efforts to free victims before they suffocated.&lt;ref name="AP-Harv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Harv" /&gt; The study results were presented at a November 2016 meeting of the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name="NYT-Harv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract: L27.00008 : In a sea of sticky molasses: The physics of the Boston Molasses Flood |authors=Nicole Sharp,  Jordan Kennedy, Shmuel Rubinstein |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |work=Bulletin of the American Physical Society |date=November 21, 2016 |url=http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD16/Session/L27.8 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Industrial Alcohol did not rebuild the tank.  The property formerly occupied by the molasses tank and the North End Paving Company became a yard for the Boston Elevated Railway (predecessor to the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]). It currently is the site of a city-owned recreational complex, officially named [[Langone Park]], featuring a [[Little League Baseball]] field, a playground, and [[bocce]] courts.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Immediately to the east is the larger Puopolo Park, with additional recreational facilities.&lt;ref name="BHA"/&gt;

A small plaque at the entrance to Puopolo Park, placed by the Bostonian Society, commemorates the disaster.&lt;ref name=Ocker /&gt;  The plaque, titled "Boston Molasses Flood", reads:

{{quote|quote=On January 15, 1919, a molasses tank at 529 Commercial Street exploded under pressure, killing 21 people. A 40-foot wave of molasses buckled the elevated railroad tracks, crushed buildings and inundated the neighborhood. Structural defects in the tank combined with unseasonably warm temperatures contributed to the disaster.}}

== Cultural influences ==
Many laws and regulations governing construction were changed as a direct result of the disaster, including requirements for oversight by a [[architect|licensed architect]] and [[civil engineering|civil engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Durso|first1=Fred|title=NFPA Journal – The Great Boston Molasses Flood|url=http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/publications/nfpa-journal/2011/may-june-2011/features/the-great-boston-molasses-flood|website=www.nfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[DUKW]] amphibious tourist vehicles operated by [[Boston Duck Tours]], appropriately painted dark brown, has been named ''Molly Molasses'' in remembrance of the event, per the firm's practice of naming their DUKWs after famous Boston locations, events, and other bits of local culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/10/vintage-army-trucks-find-home-and-triage-thanks-group-veterans-winthrop/QE2nk3139AkyFT6Kj4Ol5J/story.html "Old Army trucks find a home — and triage"]. ''Boston Globe'', Billy Baker November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maine folk band [[Schooner Fare]] refers to the disaster in their song "Molasses", from their 1985 album ''We The People''. The lyrics mistake the number of fatalities, placing it at 26 instead of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We The People|publisher=Outer Green Records|url=http://outergreen.com/albums/8885.html|website=outergreen.com|accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Here Lies Love''''' is a biographical "poperreta" musical, based on the concept music album by [[David Byrne]] and [[Fatboy Slim]]. The concept album is based on David Byrne's research on the life of former Philippine first lady [[Imelda Marcos]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Productions==
''Here Lies Love'' premiered [[off Broadway]] at [[The Public Theater]] in New York City in 2013 under the direction of [[Alex Timbers]]. It starred [[Ruthie Ann Miles]] in the lead role, with [[Jose Llana]] as Ferdinand Marcos and [[Conrad Ricamora]] as Ninoy Aquino. The production played an extended run at the Public before closing in August 2013. It returned for an open-ended commercial run again at the Public in April 2014. It closed at the Public on January 4, 2015. The production won five Lucille Lortel Awards in 2014.

The musical, directed once again by Timbers, opened at the Royal National Theatre in September 2014, and played a limited, sold out run through January 2015 at the Royal's newly renovated Dorfman Theatre. The London-based production was nominated for three Olivier Awards in 2015 (Best New Musical, Outstanding Achievement in Music, and Best Theatre Choreographer).

A revamped production from the original Off-Broadway creative team, with the intention of recreating the immersive elements in a proscenium theater, was staged at the Seattle Repertory Theater from April 7 to June 18, 2017 (extended from May 28 after strong ticket sales). Notable returning actors included Conrad Ricamora and Melody Butiu reprising their roles from the original Off-Broadway cast as Ninoy Aquino and Estrella Cumpas, respectively, Mark Bautista from the London cast reprising his role as Ferdinand Marcos, and replacement actor Jaygee Macapugay reprising her role as Imelda Marcos from the Off-Broadway cast.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===
As clubbers get inside Club Millennium, the DJ sets up the party with music and with Imelda Marcos motif. The DJ instructs the clubbers to enjoy the party as they watch the club's staff reenacting the life of Imelda Marcos through the club's music. The club ensemble comes in ("American Troglodyte") and performs.

===Act 1===
Imelda Romualdez is shown as a poor lass in stormy Leyte ("Here Lies Love") with best friend Estrella. Ninoy Aquino comes out of the stage and tells of his background ("Child of the Philippines") and his endearment to Imelda. However, Ninoy ("Opposite Attraction") is apprehensive of having to be in a relationship with Imelda due to their differences. While Ninoy wants to be in politics, Imelda shows only a penchant for love and beauty. Imelda eventually joins a beauty pageant ("Rose of Tacloban") around the same time that Ferdinand Marcos is becoming even more famous ("A Perfect Hand"). Soon, Ferdinand and Imelda meet each other and start dating ("Eleven Days") and kiss each other at the end of the number. Afterwards, Ferdinand and Imelda are married in a ceremony while Estrella ("When She Passed By") watches from afar, reminiscing their past. Ferdinand and Imelda ("Sugartime Baby") go into their honeymoon and Imelda realizes how she should become a perfect wife to the Senator in exchange of Ferdinand pulling her out of poverty ("Walk Like a Woman"). Afterwards, Imelda and Ferdinand ("Don't You Agree? / Pretty Face") start campaigning and ending up winning. Now sitting in Malacañang, ("Dancing Together") Imelda has been spearheading lavish parties and celebrations in the palace while under medication - the price she paid for marrying a busy statesman. In response to the parties and construction projects, the now Senator Ninoy Aquino leads ("Fabulous One") the opposition with great rhetoric. Imelda is surprised by this act from Ninoy ("Men Will Do Anything") and about the same time that Ferdinand gets into a romantic affair with Dovie Beams.

===Act 2===
Imelda shows a fiercer side of herself after the gaffes ("Star and Slave") and has vented out her anger against a sickly Ferdinand  who is asking for forgiveness from her ("Poor Me") - Imelda claims she will be the one running the country, now that Ferdinand is sick. Apparently, the people do not like what was happening to the Philippines ("Please Don't") under Imelda's leadership; but she is doing crisis control by showcasing international leaders. Unfortunately, Estrella does a tell-all interview ("Solano Avenue") which results into a confrontation between her and old friend Imelda, where she offers Estrella money. When Estrella refuses, Imelda has her imprisoned. Due to growing numbers of riots ("Riots and Bombs") in Manila, Ferdinand declares Martial Law ("Order 1081") and the ensemble sings of their experiences and suffering: among them is Ninoy, who grows so vocal he is imprisoned. Imelda visits Ninoy in his cell and tells him he should go to the United States and never come back ("Seven Years"). Ninoy goes to the United States but returns ("Gate 37") only to be [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|assassinated on the tarmac]]. Ninoy's mother, Aurora ("Just Ask the Flowers") vents about her son's death and encourages the people to revolt. Watching her popularity and support crumble before her, Imelda bemoans her loss as an image of Estrella angrily criticizes her ("Why Don't You Love Me?"). The situation in the Philippines now out of their control, Imelda and Ferdinand are evacuated from the palace by helicopter, bringing their regime to an end.

===Epilogue===
The actress who played Imelda comes out and introduces the next number. The DJ comes down from his booth and sings about the story of the [[People Power Revolution]] while playing his guitar ("God Draws Straight"). The rest of the ensemble returns to do one last song and dance with the clubbers ("Here Lies Love [curtain call]").

==Critical response==
Generally described as innovative, ''Here Lies Love'' challenges tradition by becoming an immersive show that utilizes much audience engagement and inventive set design that transforms theatre into a disco ballroom adorned by horizontal screens and neon accents.

Alice Kaderlan writes "rarely has a show that gets this much advance PR met my expectations, but I was totally captivated from the production’s opening moments. The story is a little slim and there are no great insights about Imelda but the infectious, pulsating music (by Byrne and Fatboy Slim) and dazzling production design make for a snappy, nonstop 90 minutes.

Jeffrey Hannan says, "Narrative structure and character development are inviolable necessities in good theatre and Here Lies Love doesn't cheat in that regard. Despite any preconceived notions of Imelda Marcos you may harbor upon arrival, as the 90 minute event unfolds, you are demanded to see this as a story not of the somewhat laughable icon presented by American media but of a woman. And her husband. And his rival. And other core characters who give humanity to the terrible as well as tabloid headlines."

Vulture's Jesse Green states that while it is an accumulation of static disco songs, "something wonderful is also going on."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/theater-review-here-lies-love.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews were positive. Actress Sara Porkalob characterizes the production as having "failed to realize that Imelda was a formidable political figure in her own right. She was a crucial and knowing player in her husband's domestic and foreign policies and was not fashionable innocent, formed only by the men in her life, as the play makes her out to be."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saraporkalob.com/blog/2017/5/25/the-problem-of-spectacle-in-david-byrnes-here-lies-love&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hungarian State Opera House''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Állami Operaház}}) is a neo-Renaissance [[opera house]] located in central [[Budapest]], on [[Andrássy út]]. Originally known as the '''Hungarian Royal Opera House''', it was designed by [[Miklós Ybl]], a major figure of 19th-century Hungarian architecture. Construction began in 1875, funded by the city of Budapest and by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary]], and the new house opened to the public on the 27 September 1884.  Before the closure of the "Népszínház" in Budapest, it was the third largest opera building in the city; today it is the second largest opera house in Budapest and in Hungary.

Touring groups had performed operas in the city from the early 19th century, but as Legány notes, "a new epoch began after 1835 when part of the Kasa National Opera and Theatrical Troupe arrived in Buda".
&lt;ref name="Legány630"&gt;Legány, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; They took over the Castle Theatre and, in 1835, were joined by another part of the troupe, after which performances of operas were given under conductor [[Ferenc Erkel]]. By 1837 they had established themselves at the Magyar Színház (Hungarian Theatre) and by 1840, it had become the "Nemzeti Színház" (National Theatre).&lt;ref name="Legány630"/&gt; Upon its completion, the opera section moved into the  Hungarian Royal Opera House, with performances quickly gaining a reputation for excellence in a repertory of about 45 to 50 operas and about 130 annual performances.
&lt;ref name="Legány630"/&gt;

Today, the opera house is home to the [[Budapest Opera Ball]], a society event dating back to 1886.
[[Image:Andrássy út Budapest 1896.jpg|thumb|right|The Opera House is on the left in this view of 1896.]]
==History==
Many important artists were guests here including the composer [[Gustav Mahler]], who was director in Budapest from 1888 to 1891 and [[Otto Klemperer]], who was music director for three years from 1947 to 1950.

In the 1970s the state of the building prompted the Hungarian State to order a major renovation which eventually began in 1980 and lasted till 1984. The reopening was held exactly 100 years after the original opening, on the 27 September 1984.

==Overview==
[[File:Magyar Állami Operaház 08.JPG|thumb|Marble staircase steps up from the main entrance to the first floor]]
It is a richly decorated building and is considered one of the architect's masterpieces. It was built in [[neo-Renaissance]] style, with elements of Baroque. Ornamentation includes paintings and sculptures by leading figures of Hungarian art including [[Bertalan Székely]], [[Mór Than]] and [[Károly Lotz]]. Although in size and capacity it is not among the greatest, in beauty and the quality of acoustics the Budapest Opera House is considered to be amongst the finest opera houses in the world.

The auditorium holds 1,261 people. It is horseshoe-shaped and – according to measurements done in the 1970s by a group of international engineers – has the third best acoustics in [[Europe]] after [[La Scala]] in Milan and the [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Although many opera houses have been built since, the Budapest Opera House is still among the best in terms of the acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In front of the building are statues of [[Ferenc Erkel]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. Liszt is the best known Hungarian composer. Erkel composed the [[Himnusz|Hungarian national anthem]], and was the first music director of the Opera House; he was also founder of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra.

Each year the season lasts from September to the end of June and, in addition to opera performances, the  House is home to the [[Hungarian National Ballet]].

There are guided tours&lt;ref&gt;See information below&lt;/ref&gt; of the building in six languages (English, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Hungarian) almost every day.

==Architecture==
[[File:Opera blue.jpg|thumb|Hungarian State Opera House at evening]]
The decoration of the symmetrical façade follows a musical theme. In niches on either side of the main entrance there are figures of two of Hungary's most prominent composers, [[Ferenc Erkel]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. Both were sculpted by [[Alajos Stróbl]].

The foyer has marble columns. The vaulted ceiling is covered in murals by [[Bertalan Székely]] and [[Mór Than]]. They depict the nine Muses.

Wrought-iron lamps illuminate the wide stone staircase and the main entrance. Going to the opera was a great social occasion in the 19th century. A vast, sweeping staircase was an important element of the opera house as it allowed ladies to show off their new gowns.

[[Image:Meyers b15 s0624a.jpg|thumb|Section through the centre of the house]]

The main hall is decorated with a bronze chandelier weighing 3050&amp;nbsp;kg. It illuminates a fresco by [[Károly Lotz]], depicting the Greek gods on Olympus. The central stage proscenium arch employed the most modern technology of the time. It featured a revolving stage and metal hydraulic machinery.

The royal box is located centrally in the three-storey circle. It is decorated with sculptures symbolizing the four operatic voices - [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]] and bass.
&lt;ref&gt;Olszanska and Olszanski, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;

==The company's second theatre==
Today, a secondary building, which has been part of the Hungarian State Opera company since 1951, is the [[Erkel Theatre]] (renamed as such in 1953), which originally opened in 1911 as the "Népopera" (The People's Opera).  It was closed in 1915, modernized with seating capacity reduced to 2,400, and reopened in 1917 as the "Városi Színház" (City Theatre).  It fulfilled many functions over the years, including being a cinema, until it came under the control of the State Opera House. Significantly renovated in 1961, it functioned as a second venue for the company until 2007 when once again, closure and renovations took place until its reopening in 2013.

The '''IWA National Festival &amp; Boat Show''' run by the [[Inland Waterways Association]] is one of the key annual events on the United Kingdom's inland waterways. Generally referred to{{By whom|date=March 2012}} as the "National" it serves several functions:

*As a publicity vehicle for the IWA and inland waterways in general
*To raise funds for the IWA
*As a social gathering for boaters from around the country
*As a campaigning event

The four functions of the event are to some extent conflicting and in recent years the campaigning aspect has been somewhat separated by the creation of an annual "Campaign Cruise".

Arguably it is as a gathering of like minded people that the National has been most influential. The festival brings together people from all over the country who do not meet in numbers except on the festival site. The original decisions to form both the [[Waterway Recovery Group]] and the [[National Association of Boat Owners]] both arose out of informal discussions held at the National.

==Development==
The first festival was held in 1950, inspired by car rallies which [[Tom Rolt]], one of the founders of the Inland Waterways Association, had attended prior to the [[Second World War]]. It was held at Market Harborough, as the location was not restricted to narrow boats. The rally was called the Market Harborough Festival of Boats and Arts. The arts element of the festival was an addition made by [[Robert Aickman]], and was one of the elements that led to the eventual split between Rolt and Aickman. However, the festival was a success, and one of Rolt's innovations was the awarding of trophies for impressive service or performance, a practice which continued. The A. P. Herbert Trophy was awarded to the person who had travelled the furthest to get to the rally, and was won by Stan Offley, who had covered {{convert|220|mi|km}} and had passed through 156 locks. His route from [[Ellesmere Port]] had used the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], the [[Bridgewater Canal]], the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]], the [[River Trent]] and the [[Grand Union Canal]]. The much shorter route using the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] was unavailable to him, as his boat was {{convert|7.5|ft|m}} wide, and the Trent and Mersey locks were only {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Blagrove |2006 |p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many of the early rallies, that of 1962 was essentially a campaign to highlight the poor state of a particular waterway, in this case the [[Stourbridge Canal]] and its connecting waterways. The decision to hold it at Stourbridge Basin was taken in late 1961, and David Hutchings, by then chairman of the rally committee, approached British Transport Waterways, the operating arm of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC) to ensure that the Stourbridge Branch would be dredged, to allow the boats to reach the festival site. Faced with a refusal, Hutchings hired a dragline excavator to carry out the work himself. The British Transport Commission threatened legal action against Hutchings, the Inland Waterways Association and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society if he proceeded, but that did not stop him. His actions gained widespread media coverage, which was extremely critical of the BTC. The BTC was abolished later that year, and the rally went ahead,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Blagrove |2006 |p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[British Waterways]] staff assisting boats through the decrepit locks. Just two years later, British Waterways and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society agreed to work on restoring the Stourbridge Canal and the [[Dudley Canal]], and this early example of co-operation resulted in the canals and locks reopening in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marple Lock Flight|Marple Locks]] on the [[Peak Forest Canal]] was chosen as the site for the 1966 rally, again to highlight their condition. Access had to be along the [[Macclesfield Canal]], as the locks themselves were derelict and could not be used. Cosmetic restoration began the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Blagrove |2006 |p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the canal was reopened in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1970 was the first occasion on which the national festival was not also a campaign to save a threatened part of the waterways network. It was held at Guildford on the [[River Wey]]. Part of the reasoning for this was that the festival was proving to be very popular, and there were a limited number of places that had sufficient display space and water supply for the number of boats wanting to attend. The choice of site was not universally popular, but the rally saw the formal launching of the [[Waterway Recovery Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Blagrove |2006 |p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of volunteers who travelled the country to carry out restoration tasks on derelict waterways.

Management of the festivals is now handled by a division of Inland Waterways Enterprises Ltd called IWA Festivals. The [[limited company]] was set up in 2001 to manage the various trading activities of the Inland Waterways Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterways.org.uk/events_festivals/past_events/the_waterways_festival/home |title=The Waterways Festival |publisher=Inland Waterways Association |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b8ee7518b79ef21c4081dcdbe33119bc/compdetails |title=Company Details |publisher=Companies House |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistics below are mainly taken from the IWA website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterways.org.uk/learning/timeline/timeline|title=Timeline|publisher=IWA|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are incomplete. Some of these were called rallies rather than festivals and not all were national events.

The final column shows the overall membership of the IWA in the year in question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19492">When the war started in August 1914, Italy declared neutrality even though it had military alliances with Germany and Austria-Hungary. It bargained for better terms and received them from Britain and France, which promised it  a slice of Austria and a slice of the Ottoman Empire. in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies).&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Lowe,  "Britain and Italian Intervention 1914-1915." ''Historical Journal'' (1969) 12#3 533-548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and elite opinion was split on the wisdom of the war, for the nation was very poorly prepared, the army was not well trained, and there was too small an industrial and financial base.  A handful of leaders made the basic decisions, notably Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and especially the two foreign ministers Antonio di San Giuliano and Sidney Sonnino. They optimistically expected that victory would bring new territories and new glory, thus closing some of Italy's internal conflicts.  The poor Italian performance in combat made conditions worse and set the stage for Mussolini's fascism.

[[File:WWIchartX.svg|350px|thumb|Military alignments in 1914. When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies).]]

==Leadership==
The Italian leadership was inexperienced, unfamiliar with international affairs, and often quite ill. Forces outside the government played minor roles. The business and financial communities wanted peace, but they were ignored in the decision-making. Likewise intellectuals and foreign policy experts, As well as nationalistic pressure groups, were ignored. The King in nominal power over war and peace, but he had severe psychiatric problems in 1914, and in any case turned over all major issues to his cabinet. Prime Minister [[Antonio Salandra]] took the position March 1914, had little experience in foreign affairs, and had no talent or taste for statecraft. The decision for war was in the hands of Foreign Minister [[Antonino Paternò Castello, Marchese di San Giuliano|Antonio di San Giuliano]], an experienced diplomat, cynical and cautious. He was in poor health and died in October 1914. He was replaced by [[Sidney Sonnino]] who maneuvered to join the Allies primarily to gain territory.  [[Tommaso Tittoni]], the ambassador to France, was often consulted; he was a voice for joining the Allies. Civilian politicians marginalized the generals; the chief of staff died on July 1, and he was finally replaced by General [[Luigi Cadorna]] in late July. Cadorna exaggerated the Army's capabilities to the unsuspecting civilians, while working hard to remove its weaknesses.  All of the leaders distrusted Austria, and were eager to take control of the Austrian province of [[Trentino-Alto-Adige]] in the Alps, and the Austrian city of Trieste. They all distrusted the Ottoman Empire, and were proud that Italy had recently seized control of the Ottoman holdings in Libya. Italy, Austria and Serbia were all contending for control of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, ''Decisions for War, 1914-1917'' (2004), pp 184–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prelude to war ==
Italy was a formal member of the Triple Alliance, alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary. hhowever it also maintained good relations with France and Russia. The other countries understood this duality, and did not expect Italy to join in the war in 1914. Its treaty obligations did not require it to join with Germany and Austria, and it saw very little to gain from doing so. Public opinion wanted peace, in the leadership in Rome realized how poorly prepared the nation was contrasted with the powerhouse is at war. By late 1914, however, Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino decided that major territorial gains were possible by joining the Allies, and would help calm extremely serious internal dissension, by bringing glory to the victorious army, aas well as new patronage opportunities and political victories for the politicians. they plan to argue that these results would be the triumph it climax of "[[Risorgimento]]" (that is, Italian unification).  In December 1914 Sonnino opened negotiations in Vienna, asking territorial compensation in return for remaining neutral. These talks were designed to conceal the government's true intentions from Italian public opinion, and from the countries at war. In March 1915 Sonnino began serious negotiations with London and France. They had an exaggerated opinion of what Italy could contribute, not realizing it would be a very expensive drain on Allied money and manpower and munitions. The Pact of London was signed on 26 April 1915 and Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. Salandra boasted, the Pact of London was "the greatest, if not the first completely spontaneous act of foreign policy executed by Italy since the Risorgimento."&lt;ref&gt;William A. Renzi, "Italy's neutrality and entrance into the Great War: a re-examination." ''American Historical Review'' 73.5 (1968): 1414-1432.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1851376 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

from the standpoint of its erstwhile allies, Italy's recent success in occupying [[Libya]] as a result of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] had sparked tension with its [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] allies, who had been seeking closer relations with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Germans reacted to Italy's aggression by singing anti-Italian songs. Italy's relations with [[France–Italy relations|France]] were also in bad shape: France still felt betrayed by Italy's refusal to help in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] back in 1870. [[Italy–United Kingdom relations|Italy's relations with Great Britain]] had been impaired by constant Italian demands for more recognition in the international stage following its occupation of Libya and its demands that other nations accept its spheres of influence in Eastern Africa and the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. B. Bosworth, ''Italy and the Approach of the First World War'' (1983) pp 101-112. &lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Italian empire 1914.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Italy and its colonial possessions in 1914.]]

In the Mediterranean, [[Greece–Italy relations|Italy's relations with Greece]] were aggravated when Italy occupied the Greek-populated [[Dodecanese]] Islands, including [[Rhodes]], from 1912 to 1914. These islands had been formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Italy and Greece were also in open rivalry over the desire to occupy [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1983), pp 112–114&lt;/ref&gt; King Victor Emmanuel III himself was uneasy about Italy pursuing distant colonial adventures and said that Italy should prepare to take back Italian-populated land from [[Austria-Hungary]] as the "completion of the Risorgimento".&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1983), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; This idea put Italy at odds with Austria-Hungary.

[[Freemasonry]] was an influential semi-secret force in Italian politics with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, as well as among the leadership in parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion. and the leading political parties in support of Italy’s joining the Allies. traditionally, Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of [[Italian nationalism]]. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Conti, "From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640-662.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal instability==
A major hindrance to Italy's decision on what to do about the war was the political instability throughout Italy in 1914. After the formation of the government of Prime Minister Salandra in March 1914, the government attempted to win the support of nationalists and moved to the political right.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Clark, ''Modern Italy: 1871–1982'' (1984) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the same time, the left became more repulsed by the government after the killing of three anti-militarist demonstrators in June.  Many elements of the left including [[syndicalists]], [[republicanism|republicans]] and [[anarchists]] protested against this and the [[Italian Socialist Party]] declared a [[general strike]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Modern Italy'' p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The protests that ensued became known as "[[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]]" as leftists rioted and various acts of civil disobedience occurred in major cities and small towns such as seizing railway stations, cutting telephone wires and burning tax-registers. However, only two days later the strike was officially called off, though the civil strife continued. 

Militarist nationalists and anti-militarist leftists fought on the streets until the [[Italian Royal Army]] forcefully restored calm after having used thousands of men to put down the various protesting forces.  Following the invasion of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] by Austria-Hungary in 1914, World War I broke out as Germany and Austria stood opposed to Serbia, Russia, France and Britain. Despite Italy's official alliance to Germany and membership in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], it remained neutral, claiming that the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Merlicco, "Italy and the Austro‐Serbian crisis of July 1914", in VVAA, ''Serbian‐Italian Relations: History and Modern Times'', The Institute of History, Belgrade, 2015, pp. 121-35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabriele D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], national poet (''vate'') of Italy was the voice of nationalist revolutionaries calling for joining the Allies]]

Society was divided over the war: Italian socialists generally opposed the war and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[Luigi Federzoni]] and an obscure Marxist journalist and new convert to nationalist sentiment, [[Benito Mussolini]], demanded that Italy join the war. For nationalists, Italy had to maintain its alliance with Germany and Austria in order to gain colonial territories at the expense of France. For the liberals, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] to gain territories from Austria-Hungary, which had long been part of Italian patriotic aims since unification. 
Luigi Federzoni emphasized the need to join the war and warned of continued disunity if it did not: 
{{Quotation|Italy has awaited this since 1866 her truly national war, in order to feel unified at last, renewed by the unanimous action and identical sacrifice of all her sons. Today, while Italy still wavers before the necessity imposed by history, the name of Garibaldi, resanctified by blood, rises again to warn her that she will not be able to defeat the revolution save by fighting and winning her national war.&lt;br&gt;— Luigi Federzoni, 1915 &lt;ref&gt; John A. Thayer,  ''Italy and the Great War.'' (1964)  p 345.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mussolini used his new newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to join the Allies: "Enough of Libya, and on to Trento and Trieste".&lt;ref&gt; Thayer,  ''Italy and the Great War.'' (1964). p 279)&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini argued that it was in the interests of socialists to join the war to tear down the aristocratic [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Germany because it was the enemy of all European workers.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-wing nationalism]] also erupted in Southern Italy as socialist and nationalist [[Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida]] saw joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a "war of revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Bidding war: bargaining with both sides==
There was no good reason for Italy to risk the horrors and expenses of of war--it was in it for new territory that would make the government look good and dissolve the intense internal disharmony.  The strategy was to bargain for the best possible offer in terms both of territorial gains and coverage of Italian financial and military weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Lowe, "Britain and Italian Intervention 1914-1915." ''Historical Journal'' (1969) 12#3, pp. 533-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dennis Mack Smith, ''Italy: A Modern History'' (1969), pp. 292–305.&lt;/ref&gt;  

By August 1914 Russia was eager for Italian entry, expecting it would open a new front that would paralyze any Austrian offensive.  Russia had nothing to give Italy, so there were no results. Rome refused to make a commitment, and there was a pause when Foreign Minister  San Giuliano died in October.&lt;ref&gt; Lowe, pp 534-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  His replacement Sonnino planned to join the winning side in order to gain new territory. At first he expected the Central Powers to win, but the war looked more like a long one, so it was not necessary to hurry and join in. Austria had too little to offer and was showing its military weakness. Berlin pressured Vienna to make more territorial concessions to  Rome, but it was too little too late as Sonnino turned to the Allies.  They were more than willing to promise large territorial spoils taken from Austria and Turkey. Italy's very long coastline made it exposed to the vastly superior power of the Allied navies. Public opinion was divided and Sonnino used that to mislead the cabinet.  By February 1915 he was negotiating with both sides, but had decided that the Allies were making the better offer.  He ignored the poor state of the Italian military, expecting the Britain and France would do all the fighting that was necessary. The Italian treasury could not fund a war, but again there were promises of money and munitions from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt; Lowe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Mack Smith, pp 296-305.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1915 Italy signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|London Pact]] with Britain and France. The pact ensured Italy the right to attain all Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, as well as concessions in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] and suitable compensation for any territory gained by the Allies from Germany in Africa. Italy declared war a month later and invaded Austria from the south.

The reaction in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister [[Giovanni Giolitti]] was furious over Italy's decision to go to war against its two long-time former allies. Giolitti claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting high numbers of mutinies, Austro-Hungarian occupation of even more Italian territory. He warned that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the liberal-democratic monarchy and the liberal-democratic secular institutions of the state. Sonnino made the decision and ignored Giolitti's dire predictions, which came horribly true.&lt;ref&gt;Clark,  ''Modern Italy: 1871–1982''. (1984) p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major result was that Italian nationalism was greatly strengthened and became a major force at both elite and popular levels until 1945, when popular democracy became a much more important force.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Salvadori, "Nationalism in Modern Italy-1915 and after." ''Orbis-A Journal of World Affairs'' 10.4 (1967): 1157-1175.

'''Joseph Anthony Cafasso Jr.''' (born August 2, 1956) is an American former [[Fox News]] consultant on military and [[counterterrorism]] issues who left the network after allegations surfaced that he misrepresented his military record.

==Early life==
Born in 1956 to Joseph A. Cafasso Sr. and Giovanna "Jenny" Cafasso (née Mosca), Cafasso was raised in [[Carteret, New Jersey]] . He has four sisters and one brother. Cafasso graduated from [[Carteret High School]] before enlisting in the Army in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;

Accessed November 29, 2007. "Born in 1956, he graduated from Carteret High School in Carteret, N.J., military records show."

==TWA Flight 800 investigation==
In the late 1990s, Cafasso became involved with events following the crash of [[TWA Flight 800]] through his association with the [[Associated Retired Aviation Professionals]] (ARAP), an organization that claimed to be conducting its own independent investigation into the cause of the crash.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In November of that year, shortly after Cafasso appeared with William Donaldson at a conference sponsored by [[Reed Irvine]]'s think tank [[Accuracy in Media]],&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/1998/12a.html |title=Why Don't the Media Uncover the Cover-Ups? |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=AIM Report, December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}} he published an article about the investigation under the byline "legislative director" of the ARAP.&lt;ref name="worldnet"&gt;{{cite web | last =Cafasso | first =Joseph | authorlink = | title =What happened to TWA Flight 800? | work = | publisher =WorldNetDaily.com | date =November 23, 1998 | url =http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=16814 | format = | doi = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time thereafter, members of the group began questioning Cafasso's military background, and, according to Donaldson, Cafasso would not produce his official record when requested to do so. As a result, Donaldson disassociated his organization from Cafasso.&lt;ref name="Cafasso NYT"/&gt;

==Political activities==
Prior to his employment with Fox News, Cafasso had worked for the [[Pat Buchanan]] 2000 presidential campaign, [[fundraising]] and running [[petition]] drives.&lt;ref name="Dallas Morning News"&gt;{{cite news |first=Todd J. |last=Gilliam |authorlink= |author= |title=Buchanan secures Texas spot for Reform in presidential bid |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/archive |format= |work= |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |pages= |page= |date=May 9, 2000 |accessdate= |language= |quote=Joe Cafasso, the campaign worker who coordinated the statewide effort from an Irving hotel room, said he had expected to need 'body armor' when he arrived in Bush territory but found the Texans highly receptive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official campaign finance records show that Cafasso was being reimbursed by the Buchanan campaign committee for travel and other expenses.&lt;ref name="FEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herndon2.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00343400/50655/sb/23 |title=Itemized Disbursements, Committee: Buchanan Reform, Inc. |accessdate=2007-04-05 |format= |work=[[Federal Election Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also became involved with a humanitarian organization led by [[Serbian American|Serbian-American]] activist David Vuich that was seeking to help people in [[Yugoslavia]] in the aftermath of the 1999 [[NATO]] bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="Cafasso NYT"/&gt;

==Departure from Fox News==
Cafasso had claimed to have been a retired [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Special Forces]], a veteran of the [[Vietnam War]], a recipient of the [[Silver Star]], and a participant in [[Operation Eagle Claw]]. However, his official military record indicated that he served only 44 days in the [[U.S. Army]] from May to June 1976, being administratively separated from the service.&lt;ref name="Cafasso NYT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Rutenberg |authorlink= |author= |title=At Fox News, The Colonel Who Wasn't |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/29/business/media/29HOAX.html |work= |publisher=The New York Times |pages= |page= |date=April 29, 2002 |accessdate= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time the ''New York Times'' was developing a story about Cafasso he sent the newspaper an email claiming that his leaving Fox News was tantamount to "political assassination by a group of self-centered individuals with their own political agendas."&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/01/1019441389321.html |title=Fake war hero who outfoxed TV network terminated |date = May 2, 2002 | accessdate=2007-04-04 |work=The Age Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cafasso appeared briefly in ''[[Outfoxed|Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism]]'', the 2004 [[documentary film]] that made the argument that Fox News had a [[right-wing]] bias. In it he delivers a short comment on decision-making at the network, comparing it to what he calls the "[[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist movement]]".&lt;ref name="outfoxed transcript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outfoxed.org/docs/outfoxed_transcript.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040804184552/http://www.outfoxed.org/docs/outfoxed_transcript.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-08-04 |title=''Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism'' FULL TRANSCRIPT |accessdate= |format=PDF |work=Carolina Productions }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
In an interview published in a companion book to the film, Cafasso hinted at seeing evidence of "right-wing religious extremism" at the network, and claimed that Fox vice president and [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau chief Kim Hume once asked him whether he was "an angel."&lt;ref name="outfoxed book"&gt;{{cite book | last =Kitty | first =Alexandra | authorlink = |author2=Robert Greenwald | title =Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War On Journalism | publisher =The Disinformation Company |date=April 1, 2005 | location = | pages =251 | url = | doi = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious activities==
According to a 2007 article published in the ''Simpson County News'', under the nickname "Jay", Cafasso was referenced as Director of Development for Mendenhall Ministries in [[Mendenhall, Mississippi]], and was investigated by the local authorities who discovered that he had a long history of using many [[pseudonyms]], claiming credentials he did not have, and claiming illness. In that article, Mendenhall Mayor Neely is quoted as saying that the last time he had seen him, Cafasso said he was going to St. Dominic's to have his gall bladder removed. The article concludes "It is suspected warrants exist for him under other names" and urges "anyone with information regarding this man" to contact the Simpson County Sheriff or a Mendenhall Police investigator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/kathryncramer/470525876/sizes/o/ Clara Aucoin, "Con Man Blows Mendenhall", ''Simpson County News'', Thursday, April 19, 2007, Section A, page 14.] Cafasso had previously used the nickname "Jay" in connection with involvement with religious organizations' rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="post-trib.com"&gt;[http://www.post-trib.com/news/1455017,cafasso-con-301.article Expert in many fields only an expert in cons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309205956/http://www.post-trib.com/news/1455017%2Ccafasso-con-301.article |date=2009-03-09 }} by Andy Grimm, Post-Tribune of Northwest Indiana, March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests ==
Cafasso was arrested January 21, 2009 in Porter County, Indiana on a [[failure to appear]] warrant. He had previously been arrested in Porter County in 2008 for speeding, driving with a suspended license, and giving false information to police and did not appear as scheduled to address those charges.&lt;ref&gt;

At the time of his arrests, Cafasso had been living with a 63-year-old woman whom he had befriended under a false name via a [[dating site]]. According to her son, Cafasso defrauded her of her life savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-trib.com/news/1455019,cafasso-indiana-0302.article Son says con man bilked his mother of savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304200231/http://www.post-trib.com/news/1455019%2Ccafasso-indiana-0302.article |date=2009-03-04 }}, Post-Tribune of Northwest Indiana, March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Cafasso's January arrest, convicted criminal [[Jack Idema]], who spoke as a consultant on one occasion for a local Fox News affiliate, attempted to obtain a laptop computer that had been used by Cafasso from the woman he had been living with.

In 1997, the organisation acquired a large amount of arms through [[weapons smuggling]] from [[Albania]], following a [[Albanian Rebellion of 1997|rebellion]] which saw large numbers of weapons looted from the country's police and army posts.

==Background==

===Kosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945–1980)===
{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
The modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the [[Expulsion of the Albanians 1877–1878|explusion of the Albanians in 1877-1878 from areas that became incorporated into the]] [[Principality of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Eva Anne|title=Violence and its Impact on Loyalty and Identity Formation in Late Ottoman Kosovo: Muslims and Christians in a Period of Reform and Transformation|journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|volume=29|issue=4|year=2009|pages=460–461|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13602000903411366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Müller|first=Dietmar|title=Orientalism and Nation: Jews and Muslims as Alterity in Southeastern Europe in the Age of Nation-States, 1878–1941|journal=East Central Europe|volume=36|issue=1|year=2009|page=70|ref=harv|doi=10.1163/187633009x411485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), [[World War I]] (1914–18), and [[World War II]] (1939–45). After 1945 the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|socialist]] government under [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed all manifestations of [[nationalism]] throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, Tito diluted the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]—the largest and most populous republic—by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north and [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945-1963)|Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians remained in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Albanians in Serbia|Serbia]]). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. The [[UDBA|secret police]] (the UDBA) cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956 a number of [[Albanians]] went on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] had little political significance. Their long-term impact became substantial, though, as some—particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded{{when|date=October 2014}} by [[Adem Demaçi]]—would eventually form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (founded in 1990). Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.

Student demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November, but Yugoslav security forces quelled them. Tito conceded some of the students' demands—in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]. The [[University of Pristina (1969–99)|University of Pristina]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered Albanian education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks.

In 1969 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbs in Kosovo]], seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1974 Kosovo's political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|federal presidency]] and its own assembly, police force and national bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Judah|title=Kosovo: War and Revenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVf1na3FN_UC |accessdate=26 Nov 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-08313-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the death of Tito (1980–86)===
Provincial power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo, causing [[1981 protests in Kosovo|mass demonstrations]] in several towns. The disturbances were quelled by the Presidency of Yugoslavia proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.

Communist hard-liners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds. Kosovo endured a heavy secret-police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorised nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson (reporter)|Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.

In February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask "why the Serbian Church is silent" and why it did not campaign against "the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo". Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo.

In addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635.

In 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 "Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians"&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy.&lt;ref name="Ramet2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFXdiS25N78C&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71616-1|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'' (London) February 5, 1982–"Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo and the rise of Slobodan Milošević (1986–90)===
{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
In 1987 [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the growing ethnic tension in Yugoslavia and rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo and referred to the [[Paraćin massacre]], where an ethnic Albanian soldier in the JNA killed four fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name=NYDB&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder&lt;/ref&gt; Binder also—writing of Slobodan Milošević's deposing of [[Dragiša Pavlović]] as head of Belgrade's party organisation shortly before—wrote that "Mr. Milosevic accused Mr. Pavlovic of being an appeaser who was soft on Albanian radicals", and that "Mr. Milosevic and his supporters appear to be staking their careers on a strategy of confrontation with the Kosovo ethnic Albanians".&lt;ref name=NYDB/&gt; The article quotes the Federal Secretary for National Defence, Fleet Adm. Branko Mamula, who claimed that "from 1981 to 1987, 216 illegal Albanian organisations with 1,435 members were discovered in the JNA". Mamula had also said that ethnic Albanian subversives had been preparing for "killing officers and soldiers, poisoning food and water, sabotage, breaking into weapons arsenals and stealing arms and ammunition, desertion and causing flagrant nationalist incidents in army units".&lt;ref name=NYDB /&gt;

In Kosovo an increasingly poisonous atmosphere between Serbs and Albanians led to wild rumors being spread and otherwise trivial incidents being blown out of proportion. It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986, which concluded that a considerable number had left under pressure from Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523033457/http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-05-23 |title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija |year=2000 |publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts |author=Ruza Petrovic, [[Marina Blagojevic]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[SANU Memorandum]], leaked in September 1986, was a draft document that focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside [[Serbia proper]]. It paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to "physical, political, legal and cultural genocide" in an "open and total war" that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the World wars occupations. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left "unless things change radically." The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for "genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established" and "objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created." It concluded that "Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past." The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milošević]].

In November 1988 Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milošević announced an "[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]" in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milošević and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo's remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.

==Eruption of War==

===The slide to war (1995–1998)===
{{main|Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)}}
{{Kosovo War}} {{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
[[Ibrahim Rugova|Rugova's]] policy of passive resistance succeeded in keeping Kosovo quiet during the war with [[Slovenia]], and the wars in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the early 1990s. As evidenced by the emergence of the KLA, this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo's Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Kosovo. In 1997, Milošević was promoted to the presidency of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (comprising Serbia and Montenegro since its inception in April 1992).

Continuing repression{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} convinced many Albanians that only armed resistance would change the situation. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo. A hitherto-unknown organisation calling itself the "[[Kosovo Liberation Army]]" (KLA) subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first mysterious. At first, it seemed that their only goals were to stop repression from Yugoslav authorities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Also, KLA goals included the establishment of a [[Greater Albania]]n, state stretching into surrounding [[Republic of Macedonia|FYR Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Preševo Valley|southern Serbia]].&lt;ref name=DavidL /&gt;&lt;ref name=ICG&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pan-Albanianism: How big a threat to Balkan stability?|journal=International Crisis Group: Europe Report|date=25 February 2004|issue=Report No 153|page=6|url=https://www1.essex.ac.uk/armedcon/story_id/000201.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1998, in an interview for [[Der Spiegel]], [[Jakup Krasniqi]] publicly announced that the KLA's goal was the unification of all Albanian-inhabited lands.&lt;ref name=ICG /&gt; [[Sulejman Selimi]], a General Commander of KLA in 1998-1999, said:

While Rugova promised to uphold the minority rights of Serbs in Kosovo, KLA was much less tolerant. Selimi stated that 'Serbs who have blood on their hands would have to leave the Kosovo'.&lt;ref name=DavidL /&gt;

In 2000, a [[BBC]] article stated that ''Nato at War'' shows how the United States, which had described the KLA as "terrorist", now sought a relationship with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/674056.stm|title=Behind the Kosovo crisis|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC|date=2000-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the US officially described the KLA as terrorists, author Alastair MacKenzie claims the KLA received training by the US' closest NATO-ally, the United Kingdom, since 1998 in a training camp in the mountains above the northern Albanian town of [[Dragobia|Bajram Curri]].&lt;ref&gt;[Alastair MacKenzie 2011.

Early in 1998, US envoy Robert Gelbard referred to the KLA as terrorists.&lt;ref name="bbc_june_1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/121818.stm|title=The KLA&amp;nbsp;— terrorists or freedom fighters?|date=1998-06-28|publisher=BBC|author=Nened Sebak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to criticism, he later clarified to the House Committee on International Relations that "while it has committed 'terrorist acts,' it has 'not been classified legally by the U.S. Government as a terrorist organization.'"&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/fr033199.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816165402/https://www.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/fr033199.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-08-16 |title=The Kosovo Liberation Army: Does Clinton Policy Support Group with Terror, Drug Ties? |publisher=[[United States Senate]], Republican Policy Committee |date=1999-03-31 |accessdate=2008-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, he held talks with two men who claimed they were political leaders of the KLA.&lt;ref name="bbc_june_1998" /&gt;

Meanwhile, the US held an "outer wall of sanctions" on Yugoslavia which had been tied to a series of issues, Kosovo being one of them. These were maintained despite the agreement at Dayton to end all sanctions. The Clinton administration claimed that Dayton bound Yugoslavia to hold discussions with Rugova over Kosovo.

The crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the international community (as defined in the [[Dayton Agreement]]) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed, and that Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Yugoslavia stormed out of the meetings in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/11/world/serbs-pull-out-of-talks-on-bosnia-to-protest-warning-on-kosovo.html|title=Serbs Pull Out of Talks on Bosnia to Protest Warning on Kosovo|work=New York Times|author=Alan Cowell|date=1999-08-12|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Yugoslavia solve the problem in Kosovo.

===War begins===
KLA attacks intensified, centering on the [[Drenica]] valley area with the compound of [[Adem Jashari]] being a focal point. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the [[Likošane]] area, and pursued some of the KLA to Čirez, resulting in the deaths of 16 Albanian fighters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmlv.gv.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/01_kse1_02_tck.pdf Stefan Troebst: THE KOSOVO CONFLICT, 1998.

Despite some accusations of summary executions and killings of civilians, condemnations from Western capitals were not as voluble as they would become later. Serb police began to pursue Jashari and his followers in the village of [[Donje Prekaz]]. A massive firefight at the Jashari compound led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/campaigns/kosovo98/timeline.shtml|title=Kosovo War Crimes Chronology|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This March 5, 1998 event provoked massive condemnation from western capitals. [[Madeleine Albright]] said that "this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY".

On March 24, Yugoslav forces surrounded the village of Glodjane and attacked a rebel compound there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=235663&amp;apc_state=henitri2005|title=Ramush Haradinaj|author=Stacy Sullivan|date=2005-03-11|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite superior firepower, the Yugoslav forces failed to destroy the KLA unit which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in [[Glodjane]] was far from stamped out. It was in fact to become one of the strongest centres of resistance in the upcoming war.

The KLA's first goal was thus to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Watson|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-10-20/news/9810190342_1_kosovo-liberation-army-serbian-forces-serbian-officials|title=Serb Troops Digging In To Battle Kosovo Rebels|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1998-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Yugoslav government was also formed at this time, led by the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]]. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman [[Vojislav Šešelj]] became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with the country's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.

In early April, Serbia arranged for [[Serbian foreign mediation in Kosovo referendum, 1998|a referendum]] on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=rs011998 Serbien (Jugoslawien), 23. April 1998 : Internationale Beobachter für Kosovo] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around [[Deçan]] and ran a territory based in the village of Glođane, encompassing its surroundings. So, on May 31, 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, an air show over the Yugoslav borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm|title=Operation Determined Falcon|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the Yugoslav President Milošević reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who, through this whole crisis, refused to talk to the Serbian side, but not the Yugoslav. In fact, the only meeting between Milošević and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. One month later, Holbrooke, after a trip to Belgrade where he threatened Milošević that if he did not obey, "what's left of your country will implode", he visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June; there he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the US was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

The Yeltsin agreement included Milošević's allowing international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. This was the [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) that began operations in early July. The US Government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the US demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire "without linkage&amp;nbsp;... to a cessation in terrorist activities".

All through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. KLA surrounded [[Peć]], [[Gjakova|Đakovica]], and had set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mališevo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). The KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]], and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to the Belacevec coal pits and captured them in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] and [[mountain warfare]], and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

The tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On 17 July 1998, two close-by villages to Orahovac, Retimlije and Opteruša, were also captured. Similarly, less systematic events took place in Orahovac and the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Hoča. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from Orehovac—famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians—was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were levelled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

A new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo south of the Pristina-Peć road. This wound down with the capture of [[Klečka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In western Kosovo, around [[Peć]], another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

In early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, the threats intensified once again but a galvanising event was needed. They got it on September 28, when the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of [[Gornje Obrinje massacre|Gornje Obrinje]]; the bloody doll from there became the rallying image for the ensuing war.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

====Morale====
Morale was a serious problem for Serb forces; intelligence surveys found that many soldiers disagreed with their comrades' actions. One tank commander reported, "for the entire time I was in Kosovo, I never saw an enemy soldier and my unit was never once involved in firing at enemy targets. The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4YbP0fPcMYC&amp;lpg=PA332|page=332|title=The Serbs: History, Myth, and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|first=Tim|last=Judah|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0300085075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When retreating from Kosovo after NATO intervention, Yugoslav units appeared combat effective with high morale and displaying large holdings of undamaged equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nardulli, Perry, Pirnie, Gordon, McGinn|title=Disjointed War: Military Operations in Kosovo, 1999|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks before the end of hostilities, David Fromkin has noted that "it seemed possible that NATO unity might crack before Yugoslav morale did."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XR61G7jU09kC&amp;pg=PA364 The Strategic Triangle] by Helga Haftendorn, pag 364&lt;/ref&gt;  When Clinton announced it would not deploy ground troops, that made a tremendous boost to Serbian morale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0tEFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275 The Balkans Since the Second World]  by R.

===UN, NATO, and OSCE (1998–1999)===
[[File:Eksodi_99_Kukes.JPG|right|thumb|Kosovo Albanian refugees in 1999]]
On 9 June 1998, US President Bill Clinton declared a "national emergency" ([[state of emergency]]) due to the "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States" imposed by Yugoslavia and Serbia over the Kosovo War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Executive Order|13088}} of June 9, 1998. Blocking Property of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro, and Prohibiting New Investment in the Republic of Serbia in Response to the Situation in Kosovo. {{USFR|63|32109}} (June 12, 1998). "I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Serbia with respect to Kosovo, by promoting ethnic conflict and human suffering, threaten to destabilise countries of the region and to disrupt progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing the Dayton peace agreement, and therefore constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 1998 acting under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]]. This expressed 'grave concern' at reports reaching the Secretary General that over 230,000 people had been displaced from their homes by 'the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1199(1998) UNSCR 1199]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219093335/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F1199%281998%29 |date=December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demanding that all parties in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire. On 24 September the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC) of [[NATO]] issued an "activation warning" (ACTWARN) taking NATO to an increased level of military preparedness for both a limited air option and a phased air campaign in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the Secretary General following the ACTWARN decision|date=24 September 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1998/p980924e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the US Ambassador to the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Christopher R. Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading [[shuttle diplomacy]] between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. It was these meetings which were shaping what was to be the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo. During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milošević. Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that the Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Attempts were made to persuade Milošević to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.

On 13 October 1998, the [[North Atlantic Council]] issued activation orders (ACTORDs) for the execution of both limited [[air strike]]s and a phased [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement to the Press by the Secretary General Following Decision on the ACTORD|date=13 October 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1998/s981013a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October the NATO [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October.&lt;ref name="gs_oee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Eagle Eye|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/eagle_eye.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nato_oaf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927191114/http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and [[Operation Eagle Eye (Kosovo)|Operation Eagle Eye]] commenced on 30 October.&lt;ref name="gs_oee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nato_oaf" /&gt;

The KVM was a large contingent of unarmed [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the "clockwork oranges" in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles. Fighting resumed in December 1998 after both sides broke the ceasefire,&lt;ref name=Maisonneuve&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigadier-General Maisonneuve|title=THE OSCE KOSOVO VERIFICATION MISSION|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/49-54-eng.pdf|work=Canadian Military Journal|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this surge in violence culminated in the killing of Zvonko Bojanić, the Serb mayor of the town of [[Kosovo Polje]]. Yugoslav authorities responded by launching a crackdown against KLA militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/19/world/serbian-mayor-slain-in-kosovo-new-sweep-on-rebels-ordered.html|title=Serbian Mayor Slain in Kosovo; New Sweep on Rebels Ordered|date=19 December 1998|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the [[Vučitrn]] area in February and the heretofore unaffected [[Kačanik]] area in early March.

On 15 January 1999 the [[Račak massacre]] occurred when "45 Kosovan Albanian farmers were rounded up, led up a hill and massacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massacre that started long haul to justice|last=Strauss|first=Julius|date=30 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1312900/Massacre-that-started-long-haul-to-justice.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission [[William Walker (diplomat)|William Walker]], and foreign news correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racak massacre haunts Milosevic trial|last=Silverman|first=Jon|date=14 February 2002|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812847.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ustrans"&gt;{{citation|title=TRANSCRIPT: AMB.

The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the [[Western countries]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides. Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to heavy firefights and segregation according to OSCE reports.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/271316.stm|title=Pristina waits for war|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-02-03|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rambouillet Conference (January–March 1999)===
On 30 January 1999 NATO issued a statement announcing that the [[North Atlantic Council]] had agreed that "the NATO Secretary General may authorise air strikes against targets on FRY territory" to "[compel] compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the North Atlantic Council on Kosovo|date=30 January 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-012e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was most obviously a threat to the Milošević government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the "position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo."{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Also on 30 January 1999 the Contact Group issued a set of "non-negotiable principles" which made up a package known as "Status Quo Plus"—effectively the restoration of Kosovo's pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organisations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Château de Rambouillet]], outside Paris.

The [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on 6 February 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinović]], while Milošević himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milošević negotiated in person. The absence of Milošević was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment of Milošević for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.

The first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations "have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system". They went on to say that "a political framework is now in place", leaving the further work of finalising "the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo".

While the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking "the will of the people [of Kosovo]" in determining the final status of the province.

On 18 March 1999, the Albanian, US, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]] while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles|first=Ingrao|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|page=330|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=10&amp;article=1027&amp;context=purduepress_ebooks&amp;type=additional|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Yugoslav Government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia's sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The two sides did not discuss the issue in detail because of their disagreements on more fundamental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmfaff/28/2809.htm#a21 U.K. Parliamentary report] THE KOSOVO CRISIS AFTER MAY 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Serb side rejected the idea of any NATO troop presence in Kosovo to replace their security forces, preferring unarmed UN observers. Milošević himself had refused to discuss the annex after informing NATO that it was unacceptable, even after he was asked to propose amendments to the provisions which would have made them acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingrao|first=Charles|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|pages=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet and the alternative Yugoslav proposal.&lt;ref name="Caraccilo2011p44"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Guns and Steel: A War Termination Strategy|first=Dominic J.|last=Caraccilo|year=2011|page=44|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-39149-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDA8dQyaQ9MC&amp;pg=PA44|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international monitors from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] withdrew on 22 March, for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="Caraccilo2011p44" /&gt;

On 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC the [[Secretary General of NATO]], [[Javier Solana]], announced he had directed the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), US Army General [[Wesley Clark]], to "initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."&lt;ref name="wp99mar24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, Secretary General of NATO|date=23 March 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-040e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March at 19:00 UTC NATO started its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kosovo Report: Conflict, International Response, Lessons Learned|author=Independent International Commission on Kosovo|year=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-924309-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3uS1o4IFXEC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, NATO Secretary General following the Commencement of Air Operations|date=24 March 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-041e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO's bombing campaign lasted from 24 March to 11 June 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in [[Italy]] and aircraft carriers stationed in the [[Adriatic]]. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. With the exception of Greece, all NATO members were involved to some degree. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe''), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II after the Bosnian War.

The proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as "[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back". That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milošević's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.

[[File:Sremska mitrovica all force.jpg|right|thumb|Post-strike damage assessment of the [[Sremska Mitrovica]] ordnance storage depot, Serbia]]

NATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović|Đukanović]].

At the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later and the Yugoslavs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) entitled the "Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"&lt;ref name=ICTYReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; opined that "civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident" and that "neither the aircrew nor their commanders displayed the degree of recklessness in failing to take precautionary measures which would sustain criminal charges." On May 7, [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade]], killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. The United States and NATO later apologised for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the [[CIA]] although this was challenged by a joint report from ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK) and ''[[Politiken]]'' ([[Denmark]]) newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,203214,00.html|title=Nato bombed Chinese deliberately|author=John Sweeney, Jens Holsoe, Ed Vulliamy|work=The Guardian|date=1999-10-17|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals. The report by the newspaper contradicts findings in the same report by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] which stated that the root of the failures in target location "appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY|location=Para 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident at the [[Dubrava Prison Massacre|Dubrava prison]] in Kosovo in May 1999, the Yugoslav government attributed as many as 85 civilian deaths to NATO bombing{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} of the facility after NATO cited Serbian and Yugoslav military activity in the area&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Orders:War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=UNHCR|isbn=978-1-56432-264-7|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1n8DrZg2rb8C&amp;pg=PA244 |authorlink=Human Rights Watch|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Human Rights Watch]] report later concluded that at least nineteen ethnic Albanian prisoners had been killed by the bombing, but that an uncertain number – probably more than 70 – were killed by Serbian Government forces in the days immediately following the bombing.&lt;ref name=HRW /&gt;

By the start of April, the conflict appeared little closer to a resolution and NATO countries began to seriously consider conducting ground operations in Kosovo. British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was a strong advocate of ground forces and pressured the United States to agree; his strong stance caused some alarm in Washington as US forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive.&lt;ref name="Marr, Andrew page 550"&gt;Marr, Andrew; ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing); page 550&lt;/ref&gt; US President Bill Clinton was extremely reluctant to commit US forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorised a [[CIA]] operation to look into methods to destabilise the Yugoslav government without training KLA troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9905/24/kosovo.01/|title=CIA reportedly authorized to develop ways to 'destabilize' Yugoslavian government|publisher=CNN|author1=Walter Rodgers |author2=Carl Rochelle |author3=Matthew Chance |date=1999-05-24|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Russia]]n diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. Tony Blair would order 50,000 British soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive: most of the available [[British Army]].&lt;ref name="Marr, Andrew page 550" /&gt;

Milošević finally recognised that Russia would not intervene to defend Yugoslavia despite Moscow's strong anti-NATO rhetoric. He thus accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish–Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

The Norwegian special forces [[Hærens Jegerkommando]] and [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for an invasion on 12 June, [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces worked with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo and acted as scouts to monitor events in Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were in Kosovo two days prior to the entry of other forces and were among the first into Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=8665264|title=UCK hjalp norsk spesialstyrke|work=NTB|author1=Lise Åserud |author2=Gunnar Nyquist |date=1999-06-21|accessdate=2008-10-08|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hærens Jegerkommando's and Forsvarets Spesialkommando's job was to clear the way between the contending parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article254448.ece?service=print |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164320/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article254448.ece?service=print |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-06 |title=Norway has forces in Afghanistan |work=Aftenposten English Web Desk |author=Nina Berglund |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2008-10-08 |df= }} (Mentions work in Kosovo / Pristina)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Bakkeli|title=Norges Hemmelige Krigere / Norway's secret Warriors|isbn=978-82-489-0722-0|language=Norwegian|work=Kagge Forlag|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslav army withdrawal and the entry of KFOR==
On 3 June 1999, Milošević accepted the terms of an international peace plan to end the fighting, with the national parliament adopting the proposal amid contentious debate with delegates coming close to fistfights at some points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9906/03/kosovo.peace.04/|publisher=CNN|title=Milosevic accepts peace plan, Finnish envoy says|date=June 3, 1999|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html |work=The New York Times |title=The Kosovo Peace Plan |date=June 4, 1999 |accessdate=May 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605034712/http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June, the [[North Atlantic Council]] ratified the agreement and suspended air operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press statement by NATO Secretary General|publisher=NATO|date=10 June 1999|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990610a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, after Milošević accepted the conditions, the NATO-led [[NATO peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) began entering Kosovo. KFOR had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and [[United States Army]] brigades.

The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on the 12th of June 1999 were [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] and soldiers from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] 22 S.A.S, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] soldiers from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] were the first to come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=1085065&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651 Krigere og diplomater | Norli&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=286391&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651 Tittel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/serbia-og-montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724/ Britisk og norske soldater i Pristina - Montenegro - VG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899/ Norske elitesoldater skamroses - VG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division, commanded by Brigadier General Peterson, and was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Other units included 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 10th Special Forces Group(Airborne) from Stuttgart Germany and Fort Carson, Colorado, TF 1–6 Infantry (1-6 infantry with C Co 1-35AR) from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the US force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial US forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months—the start of a stay which continues to date—establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

During the initial incursion, the US soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as US soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three US soldiers from the Initial Entry Force were killed in accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant William Wright&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Specialist Sherwood Brim&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Private First Class Benjamin McGill&amp;nbsp;— C Company 1st Battalion 26th Infantry (5 August 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1999, approximately 150 paratroopers from Alpha Company, 1/508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team from Vicenza, Italy parachuted into [[Ferizaj|Uroševac]] as part of Operation Rapid Guardian. The purpose of the mission was primarily to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević of NATO resolve and of its rapid military capability. One US soldier, Army Ranger Sgt. Jason Neil Pringle, was killed during operations after his parachute failed to deploy. The paratroopers of the 1/508th then joined paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and KFOR in patrolling various areas of Kosovo, without incident, through 3 October 1999.

On 15 December 1999, Staff Sergeant Joseph Suponcic of 3rd Battalion/10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was killed, when the HMMWV in which he was a passenger struck an anti-tank mine planted by Albanians and meant for the Russian contingent with which SSG Suponcic's team was patrolling in Kosovska Kamenica.

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and occupied [[Pristina International Airport]] ahead of the arrival of NATO forces. This resulted in [[Incident at Pristina airport|an incident]] during which NATO Supreme Commander [[Wesley Clark]]'s wish to forcibly block the runways with NATO vehicles, to prevent any Russian reinforcement, was refused by KFOR commander [[General Sir Mike Jackson|General Mike Jackson]].&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book|title=Soldier |first=Jackson |last=Mike |publisher=Transworld Publishers |year=2007|pages=255–275 |isbn=978-0-593-05907-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[James Blunt]] described in an interview how his unit was given the assignment of securing Pristina during the advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and how the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the city's airport before his unit's arrival. Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and the NATO Supreme Commander, Wesley Clark, gave provisional orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by General Jackson, with the now famous line, "I'm not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Yugoslavia were exposed which led to the retaliation and bombings of Russian checkpoints and area police stations. [[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of ⅔ Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.&lt;ref name="bbc-airport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport|accessdate=2008-02-08|date=2000-03-09|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the war==
Because of the country's restrictive media laws, the Yugoslav media carried little coverage of events in Kosovo, and the attitude of other countries to the humanitarian disaster that was occurring there. Thus, few members of the Yugoslav public expected NATO intervention, instead thinking that a diplomatic agreement would be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=327|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the war===
Support for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the [[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign]] came from a variety of sources. In a 2009 article, David Clark claimed "Every member of NATO, every EU country, and most of Yugoslavia's neighbours, supported military action."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Statements from the leaders of [[Bill Clinton|United States]], [[Václav Havel|Czech Republic]] and [[Tony Blair|United Kingdom]], respectively, described the war as one "upholding our values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of peace",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Bill|title=Statement on Kosovo (March 24, 1999)|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3932|publisher=Miller Center at the University of Virginia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924154814/http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3932|archivedate=September 24, 2012|df=|date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the first war for values"&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=David|title=Kosovo was a just war, not an imperialist dress rehearsal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/clark-kosovo-war-crimes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one "to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in [[Kosovo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Blair: 'We must act – to save thousands of innocent men, women and children'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/23/balkans.tonyblair|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 March 1999|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included the then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate&lt;ref name=CAForces&gt;{{cite journal|last=Legault|first=Albert|title=NATO intervention in Kosovo: the legal context*|journal=Canadian Military Journal|date=Spring 2000|page=64|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/63-66-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Devenport|first=Mark|title=Kofi Annan's delicate balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/03/99/kosovo_strikes/318104.stm|publisher=BBC|date=April 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Kofi Annan|Annan]] stressed that the "[UN Security] Council should have been involved in any decision to use force."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports.

===Criticism of the case for war===
Some{{who|date=April 2018}} criticised the NATO intervention as a political diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]], pointing to the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the scandal in US news cycles.&lt;ref name="Foerstel"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HorHFYH0NsoC&amp;pg=PA132 From Watergate to Monicagate: ten controversies in modern journalism and media] By Herbert N. Foerstel, pg 131–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some{{who|date=April 2018}} point out that before the bombing, rather than there being an unusually bloody conflict, the KLA was not engaged in a widespread civil war against Yugoslav forces and the death toll among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) skyrocketed following NATO intervention.&lt;ref name="Foerstel" /&gt;

US President Clinton and his administration were accused of inflating the number of Kosovo Albanians killed by state forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phyllis Schlafly|date=1999-10-19|title=Numbers Game in Kosovo|work=[[Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]] said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Frederking2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frederking|first=Brian|title=The United States and the Security Council: Collective Security Since the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzNFT_7HcR4C&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=17 February 2014|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-77076-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council; this legal enjoinment has proved controversial with many&lt;ref name=CAForces /&gt;&lt;ref name=KosovoReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=UMich /&gt; legal scholars who argue that though the Kosovo War illegal, it was still legitimate. The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, ''inter alia'', would affirm "that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter". China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990326.sc6659.html|date=1999-03-26|publisher=United Nations|title=Security Council Rejects Demand for Cessation of Use of Force Against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, the combination of fighting and the targeting of civilians had left an estimated 1,500–2,000 civilians and combatants dead.&lt;ref name="HRW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.

Perhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of Serbian television on April 23, 1999, which killed at least fourteen people.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html | title=Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law | publisher=New York Times | date=June 8, 2000 | accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately NATO European members were divided about the aims and necessity of the war.&lt;ref name="Norris9"/&gt; Most European allies did not trust the motives of Kosovan Albanians and according to NATO General Wesley Clark, "There was a sense among some that NATO was fighting on the wrong side" in a war between Christians and Muslims.&lt;ref name="Norris9"/&gt;

By contrast, [[Susan Sontag]], who witnessed the 3-year long [[siege of Sarajevo]], said that the NATO intervention came "eight years too late" and that Milosevic should have been stopped already during the [[Siege of Dubrovnik|bombing of Dubrovnik]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/12/specials/sontag-kosovo.html | title=Why Are We in Kosovo? | author=Susan Sontag | publisher=The New York Times | date= 2 May 1999 | accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic League of Kosovo and FARK==
The [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] led by [[Ibrahim Rugova]] had been the leading political entity in Kosovo since its creation in 1989.

Sejdiiu, a member of the LPK since 1985, said that this decision had been made because of the LPK's frustration with the ineffectiveness of the passive civil disobedience line of the dominant Kosovar party, Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosova, the LDK. Sejdiiu said: With the creation of the KLA, the LDK, especially Rugova, started accusing the KLA of being a bunch of people linked to the Serbian state security. Roguva was saying that Serbia had an interest in destabilising us all. That was pure demagoguery because Serbia had it in hand, they didn't need any destabilisation and they controlled everything. So we have actually to fight on two fronts. As well as the military campaign we had to fight politically against the LDK as the main force who has been opposed to any other methods than peaceful means, while all the time only sitting in their offices, having meetings and press conferences. They have even been against the student organisation having mass demonstrations. But oppression in Kosova went on all the time, growing day by day and the ranks of the KLA began to grow from those people who actually started with the idea that the only way to get our independence was armed struggle.|access-date = February 26, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160229065047/http://www.dsp.org.au/node/117|archive-date = February 29, 2016|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugova himself stayed for several weeks out of Kosovo, while the prime-minister Bukoshi and other leading membership returned. But since only a fraction of Kosovo Albanians participated actively in the war, the support for DLK increased again as a way of opposing the arrogance of many KLA leaders who openly engaged in controlling the economical and political life within the vacuum created right before the deployment of [[UNMIK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/120-kosovo-landmark-election-albanian.pdf | quote=Shumica menduan se partia dhe udhëheqësi i saj do të zhdukeshin politikisht pas fushatës së bombardimeve të NATO-s në 1999.

==Casualties==

===Civilian losses===
In June 2000, the [[Red Cross]] reported that 3,368 civilians (mainly Kosovar Albanians, but with several hundred Serbs, and Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict, most of whom it concluded had to be 'presumed dead'.&lt;ref name="BBC-missing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm|publisher=BBC|title=3,000 missing in Kosovo|date=2000-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal [[the Lancet]] estimated that "12,000 deaths in the total population" could be attributed to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.thelancet.com/pdfdownload?uid=llan.355.9222.original_research.1004.1&amp;x=x.pdf |format=PDF |title=Casualties in Kosovo |work=[[The Lancet]] |date=2000-06-24 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related [[Physical trauma|trauma]], which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo's total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} For women between 15–49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it was not "possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties".

In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Centre (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Person, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of war and post-war victims. According to the Kosovo Memory Book, 13,421 people were killed in Kosovo during the conflict, from 1 January 1998 up until December 2000. Of that sum, 10,533 were Albanians, 2,238 were Serbs, 126 Roma, 100 Bosniaks and others.&lt;ref name=kosovomemorybook&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Kosovo Memory Book|url=http://www.kosovomemorybook.org/?page_id=2884&amp;lang=de|title=Public review of data on victims, killed and missing – Presentation in Belgrade|accessdate=21 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903234701/http://www.kosovomemorybook.org/?page_id=2884&amp;lang=de|archivedate=3 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] reported that between 1998 and 1999, more than 6,000 people had gone missing in Kosovo, and that 1,658 remained missing, with neither the person nor the body having, at that time, been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/MissingPersonsInKosovo.aspx Missing persons receive renewed attention in Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO's Secretary General, Lord Robertson, wrote after the war that "the actual toll in human lives will never be precisely known" but he then offered the figures found in a report by [[Human Rights Watch]] as a reasonable estimate. This report counted between 488 and 527 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents, the worst of which were the 87 Albanian refugees who perished at the hands of NATO bombs, near Koriša.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/repo2000/conduct.htm#TopOfPage|title=Kosovo One Year On: Achievement and Challenge, by Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, Secretary General of NATO|publisher=[[NATO]]|date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks in Kosovo overall were more deadly due to the confused situation with many refugee movements—the one-third of the incidents there account for more than half of the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/index.htm#TopOfPage|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various estimates of the number of killings attributed to Yugoslav forces have been announced through the years. An estimated 800,000 Kosovo Albanians fled and an estimated 7,000 to 9,000 were killed, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/10/world/europe/10iht-serbia.2166700.html|author=Marlise Simons|title=Tribunal focuses on Serbia's Kosovo war|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=1969-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate of 10,000 deaths is used by the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]], which cited human rights abuses as its main justification for attacking Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="state.gov-ethnic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/kosovoii/homepage.html|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo: An Accounting|publisher=[[US Department of State]]|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617043513/https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/kosovoii/homepage.html#|archive-date=2018-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military casualties on the [[NATO]] side were light. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities as a direct result of combat operations.

Of military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav aircraft including 6 MiG-29s destroyed in air-to-air combat. A number of G-4 Super Galebs were destroyed in their hardened aircraft shelter by bunker-busting bombs which started a fire which spread quickly because the shelter doors were not closed. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed that they had destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 3 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995.{{Citation needed|date = April 2014}} NATO claimed that the Yugoslav army lost 93 tanks ([[M-84]]'s and [[T-55]]'s), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces.&lt;ref name="one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com/airpwr.htm|title=Kosovo Coverup|publisher=One-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com|date=2000-05-15|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'', the second-largest news weekly magazine in the U.S, gained access to a suppressed US Air Force report that claimed the real numbers were "3 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450".&lt;ref name="one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Kosovo Cover-Up" by John Barry and Evan Thomas, ''Newsweek'', May 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Another US Air Force report gives a figure of 14 tanks destroyed.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II–era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of {{convert|15,000|ft|m|abbr=off}}, making accurate bombing much more difficult. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo–Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.

The most significant loss for the [[Yugoslav Army]] was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields ([[Batajnica Air Base|Batajnica]], [[Kraljevo-Lađevci Airport|Lađevci]], [[Slatina Air Base|Slatina]], [[Golubovci Air Base|Golubovci]] and [[Đakovica Airfield|Đakovica]]) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings could not be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged ([[Utva]], [[Zastava Arms]] factory, Moma Stanojlović air force overhaul centre, technical overhaul centres in [[Čačak]] and [[Kragujevac]]). In an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities (the [[Pančevo]] oil refinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbudbill.com/jme14.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010125073100/http://www.davidbudbill.com/jme14.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-01-25 |title=NATO BOMBS LEAVE TOXIC SLOUGH |work=Washington Post |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novi Sad]] oil refinery, bridges, TV antennas, railroads, etc.)

For the government of Serbia, cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] is "still regarded as a distressing obligation, the necessary price for joining the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/uncomfortable-truths-war-crimes-in-the-balkans|title=Uncomfortable Truths: War Crimes in the Balkans|date=16 November 2011|work=Balkan Insight|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, along with [[Milan Milutinović]], [[Nikola Šainović]], [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]] and [[Vlajko Stojiljković]] were charged by the ICTY with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible transfer, deportation, and "persecution on political, racial or religious grounds". In 2001, then-President [[Vojislav Koštunica]] "fought tooth and nail" against attempts to put Milošević before an international court but was unable to prevent this happening after further atrocities were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|title=The Serbs|edition=3rd|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, there were more indictments against former armed forces chief of staff [[Nebojša Pavković]], former army corps commander [[Vladimir Lazarević]], former police official [[Vlastimir Đorđević]], and [[Sreten Lukić]]. All were indicted for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war.
Later, the [[United Nations]] [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) legally found that FRY and Serbian forces "use[d] violence and terror to force a significant number of Kosovo Albanians from their homes and across the borders, in order for the state authorities to maintain control over Kosovo&amp;nbsp;...

The ICTY also leveled indictments against [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] members [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Haradin Bala]], [[Isak Musliu]], and [[Agim Murtezi]] for crimes against humanity. They were arrested on February 17 and 18, 2003. Charges were soon dropped against Agim Murtezi as a case of mistaken identity and Fatmir Limaj was acquitted of all charges on November 30, 2005 and released. The charges were in relation to the prison camp run by the defendants at [[Lapušnik prison camp|Lapušnik]] between May and July 1998.

In 2008, [[Carla Del Ponte]] published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion|first=Marc|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120812796372611429?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Horrors Alleged in Kosovo|work=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, a UN tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister [[Ramush Haradinaj]] for war crimes against the Serbs. On March 8, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed Prime Minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo's Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts along with fellow KLA veterans Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj.

===By NATO forces===
The Yugoslav government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g., [[Amnesty International]]) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on April 23, 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, "The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iI-Ix5tQ59McTX8NyBF1R120X4dAD97O8IRO0 Amnesty: NATO bombing of Serbian TV 'war crime'] {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled ''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'' concluded that, "Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable" and that, "NATO's targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power."&lt;ref name=ICTYReport /&gt; In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, "unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate."&lt;ref name=ICTYReport /&gt;

The Kosovo War had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo's level of autonomy as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.

The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm|title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock|publisher=BBC|date=2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes "supervised independence" for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Priština.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the US arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis |author=Antony Barnett |date=2000-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105123907/http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm |archivedate=2002-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the "sensor to shooter" time to virtually zero.

Kosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milošević government cooperated with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], passing on many of the lessons learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122163917/http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-11-22 |title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:
* US stealth aeroplanes were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors, they would become visible on the radar screens. An [[F-117 Nighthawk]] downed by a missile was possibly spotted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/sum02/lambeth.html|title=Kosovo and the Continuing SEAD Challenge|accessdate=May 28, 2011|author=Benjamin S. Lambeth|date=2006-06-03|work=Aerospace Power Journal|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|quote=Serb air defenders could have employed low-frequency radars for the best chance of getting a snap look at the aircraft. Former F-117 pilots and several industry experts acknowledged that the aircraft is detectable by such radars when viewed from the side or directly below.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dummy targets such as fake bridges, airfields and decoy aeroplanes and tanks were used extensively. Tanks were made using old tires, plastic sheeting and logs, and sand cans and fuel set alight to mimic heat emissions. They fooled NATO pilots into bombing hundreds of such decoys, though General Clark's survey found that in Operation: Allied Force, NATO airmen hit just 25 decoys—an insignificant percentage of the 974 validated hits.&lt;ref name="fooled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/june2000/0600kosovo.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030629000133/http://www.afa.org/magazine/June2000/0600kosovo.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-06-29 |date=June 2000 |title=Nine Myths About Kosovo |author=Rebecca Grant |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] sources claim that this was due to operating procedures, which oblige troops, in this case aircraft, to engage any and all targets, however unlikely they may be. The targets needed only to look real to be shot at, if detected. NATO claimed that Yugoslav air force had been devastated. "Official data show that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo lost 26 percent of its tanks, 34 percent of its APCs, and 47 percent of the artillery to the air campaign."&lt;ref name="fooled" /&gt;

==Military decorations==
As a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation created a second NATO medal, the [[NATO Medal]] for Kosovo Service, an [[international military decoration]]. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2449|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302012133/http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2449|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 2, 2010|title=News Release: Kosovo Campaign Medal Approved|publisher=Defense.gov|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the involvement of the [[United States armed forces]], a separate [[awards and decorations of the United States military|US military decoration]], known as the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]], was established by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.

The [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] (KCM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces established by Executive Order 13154 of President Bill Clinton on May 3, 2000. The medal recognises military service performed in Kosovo from March 24, 1999 through December 31, 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">The '''New York Sephardic Jewish Film Festival''' (NYSJFF), also known as the '''Sephardic Film Festival''', is an annual New York City [[Film festival]] sponsored by the [[American Sephardi Federation]]. It was founded in 1990. The 20th Anniversary Edition of the festival is from March 30 to April 6, 2017.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sephardicfilmfest.org/about.php | title=About the Festival | publisher=NYSJFF | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305042854/http://www.sephardicfilmfest.org/about.php | archivedate=March 5, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival showcases films about Jewish communities of the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Asia]], including [[Morocco]], [[Yemen]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Iran]]/[[Persia]] and [[India]], as well as the [[Sephardi]] descendants of the Jews expelled from [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Sephardic Cinema Shines, Richard Z.

The films are part of a movement towards popular narrative movies and more personal documentaries taking advantage of the freedom given by improvements in [[video camera]]s and associated [[digital hardware]] to pursue a more personal on-screen vision of [[Who is a Jew?|what it means to be Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c375_a14707/Advertise/Thank_You_-_Advertising.html First-Person Cinema, January 28, 2009, George Robinson, ''Jewish Week'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newsbooks''', also called news-books, were more sophisticated than posters. They were the 16th-century precursors to today's newspapers. They covered a single big story, such as a battle, a disaster or a sensational trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook|title=Newsbook|work=The Economist|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' describes them as "A small newspaper. In common use from about 1650 to 1700".

==Organised Gaming Association==
The Organised Gaming Association arranged a number of tournaments including the Frontosa Call of Duty 4 series and the Cafe Viva DotA series. The establishment of OGA was met with controversy after it was announced that members would have to sign MSSA ([[Mind Sports South Africa]]) membership forms.
&lt;ref name="www.pantheongaming.co.za"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazen plays intermediary, OC joins the MSSA bandwagon |url=http://www.pantheongaming.co.za/?q=node/458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frontosa Call of Duty 4 series has the highest prize money of all LAN events in South Africa, with a total of R30,000 (3,800 USD) prize money.&lt;ref name="http://www.oc.co.za/series-tournaments"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frontosa Call of Duty 4 Series |url=http://www.oc.co.za/series-tournaments }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organised Gaming Association has gone dormant and is no longer as a means of hosting tournaments pending a restructuring and massive development of a software framework required to run OGA. 

The current tournament structure is formed by its crew members for each event with both social and competitive tournaments taking place. Prize money for the tournaments includes the pool of players buying into the tournaments and the internal contribution from Organised Chaos revenue.

==Crew Members==

'''Osor Musical Evenings''' ({{lang-hr|Osorske glazbene večeri}}) is a [[Croatian music festivals|Croatian classical music festival]] that takes place in the historical town of [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], on the island of [[Cres]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/osor/events/music-festivals/osor-musical-evenings|title=Osor Musical Evenings|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/croatia/festivals/|title=Festivals|work=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kvarner Gulf]]. The festival was founded in 1976 by Daniel Marušić,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/label/299596-Osorske-Glazbene-Večeri-Musical-Evenings-In-Osor&lt;/ref&gt; a renowned Croatian TV and [[Opera director]], who was its artistic and executive director until his death in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.osorskeveceri.org/en/category/about-the-festival/history/|website = Osorske glazbene večeri|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea behind the festival was to revive Osor during the summer, and to create a festival dedicated mostly to works by historical and contemporary Croatian composers. Although in the first decades festival held conferences, theater and opera productions and art exhibitions, today Osor Musical Evenings are oriented exclusively to musical programs, including classical and [[Contemporary classical music]], and occasionally [[Early music]] and electronical music. The main concert hall is the late-15th century church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (the former cathedral of Osor), while other concert spaces are used, such as the main square in Osor and archeological site of St Peter church. For their outstanding contribution in the field of classical music in [[Croatia]], the festival was declared national in 2011. The top notch musicians over the last several years include [[L'Arpeggiata]] and [[Christina Pluhar]], [[Giovanni Sollima]], [[Diana Haller]], [[Renata Pokupić]], [[Aleksandar Marković]] among others.

In the last 40 years around 300 new compositions were first performed in Osor, many of which were commissioned by the festival or dedicated to Osor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First performances and festival commissions|url = http://www.osorskeveceri.org/en/about-the-festival/about-first-performances/a-premiere/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major festival commission is Osor Trilogy: Osor Requiem ([[Boris Papandopulo]], 1978), Osor Mystery (Boris Papandopulo, 1979), and Osor Cry ([[Berislav Šipuš]], 2009) for soloists, mixed choir, and chamber orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cantus – Info naslova – Boris Papandopulo / Berislav Šipuš, OSORSKA TRILOGIJA (DVD)|url = http://www.cantus.hr/infonaslova.php?id=658|website = www.cantus.hr|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first integral performance at the 37th Osor Musical evenings was recorded by [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] and was published as a triple DVD in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cantus – Info naslova – Boris Papandopulo / Berislav Šipuš, OSORSKA TRILOGIJA (DVD)|url = http://www.cantus.hr/infonaslova.php?id=658|website = www.cantus.hr|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; First three decades of festival are well documented in a book by Dodi Komanov, ''Arkadija hrvatske glazbe: 30 godina festivala Osorske glazbene večeri'' (Arcady of Croatian music: 30 years of Osor Musical Evenings) published by the festival in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Katalog Knjižnica grada Zagreba – Detalji|url = http://katalog.kgz.hr/pagesResults/bibliografskiZapis.aspx?&amp;currentPage=1&amp;searchById=40&amp;sort=0&amp;spid0=40&amp;spv0=78.09&amp;xm0=1&amp;selectedId=11009633|website = katalog.kgz.hr|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:.The Great Parade.JPG|thumb|right|The Carnival floats during the Great Sunday Parade.]]
[[Image:Great Sunday Parade.JPG|thumb|The Treasure Hunt groups, a Patras Carnival tradition.]]

The '''Patras Carnival''', '''Patrino karnavali''' is the largest event of its kind in [[Greece]] and one of the biggest in [[Europe]]. It has more than 180 years of history. The events begin on 17 January and last up to [[Clean Monday]]. The carnival of [[Patras]] is not a single event but a variety of events that includes balls, parades, hidden treasure hunt and the children's carnival amongst others. It climaxes in the last weekend of Carnival with the Saturday evening parade of carnival groups, the extravagant Sunday parade of [[Float (parade)|floats]] and groups, and finally the ritual burning of the carnival king at the St. Nikolaos Street pier in the harbour of Patras. Its characteristics are spontaneity, improvisation, inspiration and volunteerism.

==History==
[[Image:Patraschariot.JPG|right|thumb|250px| Patras Carnival Float 1995]]
[[Image:PATRAS2006 006 edited.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Apollon Theatre (Patras)|Apollon theatre's]] external facade, emblematic of the Patras Carnival]]
The Patras carnival, as most carnival events in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, is connected with ancient [[Paganism|pagan]] rituals, such as those to honour [[Dionysus]]. According to these traditions, in the heart of the winter the faithful invoke the deity with special feasts and he is reborn in order to bring spring once again.&lt;br /&gt; 
However most people agree that the starting event of the Patras Carnival in its modern-day form was a ball given in the residence of the merchant Moretis in 1829. French troops of [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|general Maison]] stationed in the city after its liberation from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] were a major influence on the carnival bringing their own culture and traditions to the festivities. During the 19th century new arrivals from the newly joined [[heptanese]], the islands in the [[Ionian sea]] that became part of Greece in 1864, were to also dramatically influence the nature of the festivities with tremendous vitality, creativity and a sense of fun that were part of their vibrant regional culture and music. Later on, and as a consequence of the prosperity of the city at the end of the 19th century, the carnival festivities take on a more regular nature. The geographical location of the town and the ever-increasing dominance of the port ensured a constant communication with [[Italy]] and the rest of Western Europe. Their grand carnivals and the [[Carnival of Venice|Venetian carnival]] in particular were especially influential in shaping the festivities, giving the carnival to this day its western characteristics. &lt;br /&gt;
The first carnival floats appeared in the 1870s. At that time the floats were exclusively the creations of individuals. Only later did the Municipality of Patras undertake to construct a large number of them. &lt;br /&gt;
In 1872, with contributions from the town's wealthy raisin merchants, the celebrated [[Apollon Theatre (Patras)|Apollon Theatre]] was built by [[Ernst Ziller]] in George square. Carnival dances were hosted there and they continue to be hosted to this day. George square is the central location in carnival celebrations and the Apollon theatre serves as a backdrop to most major carnival events that take part in the square making it emblematic not only of the carnival but of the town itself. &lt;br /&gt;
In 1880 on [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony's]] day the first "mpoules" appeared. These were groups who were disguised and anonymously poked fun at friends and other people in the neighbourhood. This custom has now disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;
As the historian of the Patras Carnival Nikos Politis points out, beautiful carnivals were organized during the [[belle époque]] in the years 1900, 1907, 1909 with attendance for the first time of individuals from all social classes and origins. This period also gave birth to the egg-war custom. Wax eggs were made stuffed with [[confetti]] using specially designed machines which the carnivalists threw from balconies. Although this custom has disappeared, it is considered to be the precursor of the chocolate war which still persists. Bars of chocolates are thrown by revellers on floats or amongst groups at parties.

The developments of the following decade were not favourable for the carnival; the continuous wars and conflicts ([[Balkan wars]], [[World War I]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Asia Minor campaign]]) sent the men to the front and  brought economic crisis and desolation to the city. In the first postwar years the situation did not improve perceptibly. Only some scattered events testify the arrival of the carnival. Obvious exception constitutes the imposing and amazing carnivals of the years 1938 and 1939. Nevertheless,  [[World War II]] and the consecutive [[Greek Civil War]] bring an obligatory interruption. In the beginning of the 1950s the first hesitant thoughts for a resurgence of the carnival are expressed. The most pessimistic predict a failure: "nothing will be as before". However, the carnival is indeed reborn. The pioneer musical groups "Orpheus" and "Patraiki' Mantolinata", a mandolin ensemble, lead the effort. The Patras Carnival returns into the lives of the citizens of Patras but also all Greeks, particularly those that could afford to travel to Patras (mainly affluent Athenians) in order to participate in the carnival and to attend the famous Bourboulia balls. In the same period the [[Cinema of Greece|Greek cinema]] showed scenes of the carnival in its films. Other historic scenes can be seen in prewar films. However, in the 1950s, the carnival came under attack as fanatic Christian and other misinformed [[moral]] organisations appear in Patras from other regions of Greece during the carnival in order to denounce orgies, moral corruption and a state of "[[Sodom and Gomorrah]]", but they are prevented from creating trouble by the police. These completely unfounded accusations are met with indifference or annoyance by the citizens of Patras and visitors of the carnival. It is characteristic that the local church does not sympathise with the troublemakers since it knows that the carnival is a completely innocent recreational event. Yet, in the same period there were cases of [[censorship]] which was imposed on certain carnival creations which had upset the establishment with their satirical humour. In 1964 the year of [[Paul of Greece|king Paul's]] death the Carnival was once again cancelled.

Under no circumstances could these events shade the magnificence of the carnival which had already acquired Pan-Hellenic recognition and attracted the attention of certain international media. In 1966 the carnival was reorganized. The journalist Nikos Mastorakis introduces the Hidden Treasure Hunt, a game in which 94 citizens of Patras and visitors take part with their cars to find a list of sometimes obscure objects. The first prize was won by a team led by a friend of the carnival from [[Thessalonica]]; his name was [[Alkis Steas]] and he presented the game starting from the following year. Thus, the late Steas became for decades the legendary presenter of the carnival, which was broadcast by [[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi|ERT]] and was watched by all Greek TV viewers. The presenter's expressions such as "the Carnival city of Greece", when he referred to Patras and "be happy" and "keep dancing!" when he referred to the carnival groups, remain historical. In 1974 the modern phase of the carnival begins as the revellers are convinced to abandon their cars and parade on foot in the streets (until then only floats paraded). Since then each year the spectacle grew and the carnival has become enormous with thousands of revellers taking part in the parade as hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Patras to witness the proceedings.

==Organiser==
[[Image:Kingcarnival.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Patras Carnival, the King's float 2003]]
The soul of the carnival are the tens of thousands of carnivalists, from Patras, visitors and friends of the Patras Carnival, people of every age group who participate spontaneously in the carnival events; the official events and the hundreds of unofficial events such as carnival balls, masqued balls and parties at home, in neighbourhoods, clubs, cafes and restaurants. In recent decades a large part of the organisation is consistently undertaken by the Municipality of Patras through the Municipal Organisation for Cultural Development of Patras which supervises the carnival workshop, a unique space in Greece in which the giant floats of the carnival King and his entourage are built along with other structures that decorate the town during the duration of the carnival season. The carnival receives funding from the Ministry of Culture and other institutions. The official support however has come to reinforce a time honoured tradition and does not create something from scratch as with carnival events in other Greek municipalities.

==The Opening Ceremony==
Irrespective of when the [[Triodion]] falls, the three-week period preceding the first Sunday of Lent, it is customary for the Carnival of Patras to start on the day of St. Anthony (17 January). A town crier appears on the streets of Patras; in recent years this has been a specially constructed float with music. The crier announces the opening with a satirical message and invites the town's residents to assemble that evening for the opening ceremony in George square. During a spectacular celebration with elements of surprise, as the programme is kept secret till the last moment, the start of the Patras Carnival is declared by the town's mayor from the first floor balcony of the Apollon theatre. The programme usually includes pantomimes and patters, dances, music and fireworks.

==The Children's carnival==
[[Image:The Children carnival.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Children in action&lt;/center&gt;]]
A spectacular take on the traditional baby rally which was first organised in 1968 by the Naturalist Association of Patras, the Children's Carnival is an event that is exclusive to the Patras carnival. It culminates with the major parade that takes place the week before the grand parade. On that day thousands of young carnivalists from Patras, Western Greece and beyond, from the age of zero upwards, parade through the streets of Patras with their mums and dads, teachers and supervisors dressed in bright costumes, in groups created by their nurseries, kindergartens, music schools, dance schools and others. Cheerleaders and young musicians in the municipality band accompany them. Over the years the Children's Carnival has gained its own momentum successfully competing with that of the grown ups. Music has been composed to accompany it, special competitions and games are organised and the municipality's carnival workshop creates special floats inspired by popular fairy tales. In the Ipsilon Alonion square a 'carnival town' is created. Giant and colourful carnival structures allow the children to play. Over 5000 children participate in a festival involving numerous game events and creative activities whose objective is to introduce the younger generation to the Carnival and to encourage their abilities in artistic expression related to aesthetic or satirical masquerading.

==The Treasure Hunt Game==
The groups that participate in the carnival are composed of either permanent carnival companions, groups of friends, colleagues or neighbours. They have a name as a group and a theme for their costumes. Depending on their carnival term, member's education, and the time they have available they choose whether they will participate in the treasure hunt games or the parades or both. These games comprise questions from subjects such as history, philosophy, mathematics, or from practical knowledge, exercises in navigation through hidden clues spread throughout the town, artistic competitions in painting, pantomimes, theatrical highlights or whatever else the organisers of the game can think of. The group's performance in various phases of the game is scored and so the big winner emerges. Several groups have offices and clubs for the duration of the carnival period and many organise parties and dances or public events on streets and in squares. Some participate in the parade with their own carnival float constructed to match the masquerade theme of the group. The number of participants in a group varies between 50 and 300 people, sometimes more.

==The Saturday night parade==
This is also called the "Nihterini Podarati" [Night Parade on foot]. In earlier years, only the Treasure Hunt groups could participate without their floats. However, the last few years every group is free to join. Night, bright lights, an overwhelming stream of people, colors and high spirits combine to create a spectacular scene.

==The Grand Parade==
This is the climax of the Patras Carnival. The parade begins around 2pm on the Sunday before [[Clean Monday]] with numerous satirical floats constructed by the municipality followed by an endless stream of groups, each one with an individual theme around which their costumes are designed. Despite the constant flow, due to the number of people participating which in recent years has reached between 35 and 40 thousand, the parade takes several hours to complete. It cuts through the town and is watched by thousands on the streets, on balconies, in the stands and throughout Greece in a televised coverage.

==Closing Ceremony==
[[Image:Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The burning....&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:The Closing Ceremony.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;...of the Carnival King&lt;/center&gt;]]

An extension of the traditional festivities based around the burning of the float of the Carnival King, with concerts, dances, a farewell to the carnival past, announcements about the carnival to come and countless fireworks. It takes place at the port on Sunday night and is also broadcast on TV.

After irrigation projects diverted water from the [[Aral Sea]] it began to dry up and left behind salts, other minerals and toxins in the soil.  These not only contaminated the soil but also were picked up by winds and storms, and traveled to other areas, including over crop lands.  This has led to increased health problems like respiratory diseases and cancers, among others.  The change in the size of the Aral has also affected the local climate and resulted in increased occurrence and worsening of storms.&lt;ref name=micklin &gt;Micklin, P. P. (1988).  Disiccation of the Aral Sea: A Water Management Disaster in the Soviet Union.  Science.  241(4870), 1172 &amp; 1175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
There is no doubt that the shrinking of the Aral Sea has resulted in health problems for the local community.  However, there is debate as to what extent of these problems can be sourced to this environmental situation. The full effects could take a generation to fully materialize and patterns of health problems to show up. 
Some of the main reasons why the Aral sea area suffered greatly were from "over irrigation and water mismanagement."  Environmental impacts resulting from the changes in the Aral Sea region that could affect human health are "the [[Salinity|salinization]] of the water table, [[pesticide]]s in the environment and [[food chain]], dust storms and air quality."&lt;ref name=small&gt;Small, I., Van Der Meer, J., &amp; Upshur, R. E. G. (2001).  Acting on an Environmental Health Disaster: The Case of the Aral Sea.  Environmental Health Perspectives.  109(6), 547 &amp; 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Uzbek region years of monoculture agriculture of cotton fields left soils depleted of naturally occurring minerals and nutrients.  This eventually led to an increased use of pesticides and fertilizers to try and counter these new soil deficiencies.  However, these increased chemicals found their way into the soils, water, and finally the Aral sea.&lt;ref name=precoda &gt;Precoda, N. (1991). Requiem for the Aral Sea.  Ambio.  20(3/4), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of agricultural activities have also "resulted in widespread soil erosion, chemical pollution, and poor water quality and quantity." &lt;ref&gt;Franz, J. S. &amp; FitzRoy, F. (2006). Child Mortality and Environment in Developing Countries. Population and Environment. 27(3), 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on Infant Mortality Rates==
As the sea dries up the contaminants become exposed on the surface and enter into the soil while also being blown into the air.  These environmental impacts have had wide-ranging effects on health of local residents.  Increases in the occurrence of many diseases and conditions have been noted and linked to the shrinking of the Aral.  Facing the highest risk from exposure to contaminants and toxins are infants and children.  This has contributed to an increasing infant mortality rate in the area.  According to Newbold the infant mortality rate is defined as "the number of deaths of infants younger than one year of age per one thousand births." &lt;ref&gt;Newbold, K.B. (2007). Six Billion Plus: World Population in the Twenty-First Century. 2nd Edition. Lanham:  Rowman &amp; Littlefield.  2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant mortality rates have been increasing in this region since the 1970s, while elsewhere in the world they have generally been going down.&lt;ref&gt;Zhiming, B. , Norio, I., Yoshiaki, K., Ariyoshi, K.,  Kunio, M., Tomokazu, O. &amp; Otsuka Kenji. (2006). Inner Asia: Balancing the Environment with Socioeconomic Development.  The State of the Environment in Asia 2005/2006. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  For residents of the Aral sea region living there has led to high "exposure to industrial pollutants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) [[organic compound|compound]]s and heavy metals but also to pesticides."&lt;ref name=kiess562 &gt;Kiessling, K. L. (1998).  Conference on the Aral Sea: Women, Children, Health and Environment.  Ambio.  27(7). 562.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon leading to increased infant mortality rates has been reported as high as 70 in Kazakhstan as of 1993.&lt;ref name=kiess562 /&gt;  Toxins can come from all sources including breathing them in from the air, drinking water, and food.  However, a young baby does not have much choice about what to eat or drink.  It has been found that these contaminants can be passed down through breast feeding and "in a number of areas the physicians recommend against breast feeding babies, as the nursing mothers milk is toxic." &lt;ref name=precoda /&gt;

As seen in Table 1, other surrounding countries and areas have also experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.  Although there are many other factors that contribute to infant mortality rates, the environmental state in the area has a definite influence on increasing rates.  When compared with developed countries these rates can illustrate differences in health care and access to health care between the areas.

==List of Adverse Health Effects==
In [[Turkmenistan]] alone, 50% of all reported illnesses in children are related to respiratory system difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggs, G.F.S., O'Hara, S. L., Wegerdt, J., Van Der Meer, J., Small, I., &amp; Hubbard, R.  (2003). The Dynamics and Characteristics of Aeolian Dust in Dryland Central Asia: Possible Impacts on Human Exposure and Respiratory Health in the Aral Sea Basin. The Geographical Journal.  169(2), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of this situation are far reaching and affect people in a wide range of ailments.  Following is a list of health problems contributing to high infant mortality, death, and lower standard of living in the Aral Sea area:

* [[diarrhea]]l diseases
* [[vaccine]] preventable diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]
* [[Malnutrition|nutritional deficiencies]]
* [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s&lt;ref name=kiess562 /&gt;
* [[teratogenesis]]
* [[endocrine]] disruption
* neurodevelopmental effects
* behavioral effects&lt;ref name=small /&gt;
* [[gastro-enteritis]]&lt;ref name=precoda /&gt;
* [[typhoid fever]]
* [[hepatitis]]
* [[esophageal cancer]]
* various other cancers
* [[hypertension]]
* [[heart disease]]
* [[anemia]]
* kidney disease&lt;ref name=small /&gt;
* eye disease

==Solutions==
A large concern of remediation of the area is the reduction of the blowing salt and minerals from the exposed  sea bed.  Some solutions include constructing dikes to control water flows and restricting the water amounts diverted for irrigation.  However, the health effects have already been felt and will continue to be present for a long time even if the situation is turned around in the very near future.&lt;ref name=micklin /&gt;

Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay (or only partially pay) its debts, or it may be unannounced. A [[credit rating agency]] will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural [[default (finance)|default]]s, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments.  Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through [[inflation]].  This is not "default" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value.  Sometimes governments [[Devaluation|devalue their currency]]. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates.  Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.

If potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in [[risk premium|compensation for the risk]] of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a '''[[debt crisis|sovereign debt crisis]]'''. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a situation of [[maturity mismatch]] between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base.

They may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to [[currency mismatch]]: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign-denominated bonds, decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back their foreign-denominated bonds (see [[Original Sin (economics)|original sin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. |last=Eichengreen |authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first2=R. |last2=Hausmann |year=2005 |title=Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Economies |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-19455-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=E. |last=Borensztein |first2=U. |last2=Panizza  |url=http://vox.lacea.org/fckeditor.html?q=node/25 |title=The Costs of Sovereign Default: Theory and Reality |work=VOXLACEA |date=Nov 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the [[UN Charter]] Article 2 (4) prohibiting [[use of force by states]], made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its [[creditor's rights]]. For example, Britain [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|invaded Egypt in 1882]]. Other examples include the United States' "[[gunboat diplomacy]]" in Venezuela in the mid-1890s and the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] beginning in 1915.&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carmen M. | last=Reinhart |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff | year=2009 |title=This time is different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (p. 54ff) |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today a government which defaults may be widely excluded from further credit, some of its overseas assets may be seized;&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"/&gt; and it may face political pressure from its own domestic bondholders to pay back its debt. Therefore, governments rarely default on the entire value of their debt. Instead, they often enter into negotiations with their bondholders to agree on a delay ([[debt restructuring]]) or partial reduction of their debt  (a '[[Haircut (finance)|haircut or write-off]]').

Some economists have argued that, in the case of acute [[insolvency]] crises, it can be advisable for [[regulator (economics)|regulators]] and [[supranational]] [[lender]]s to preemptively engineer the orderly restructuring of a nation’s public debt- also called "orderly default" or "controlled default".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |title=Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis |journal=The Vienna Review |date=March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nouriel |last=Roubini |authorlink=Nouriel Roubini |title=Greece’s best option is an orderly default |newspaper=Financial Times |date=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek debt crisis|the case of Greece]], these experts generally believe that a delay in organising an orderly default would hurt the rest of Europe even more.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Armitstead, "EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis" ''The Telegraph'', 23 June  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] often lends for sovereign debt restructuring. To ensure that funds will be available to pay the remaining part of the sovereign debt, it has made such loans [[conditionality|conditional]] on acts such as reducing [[corruption]], imposing [[austerity|austerity measures]] such as reducing [[public sector|non-profitable public sector]] services, raising the tax take (revenue) or more rarely suggesting other forms of revenue raising such as [[nationalization]] of inept or corrupt but lucrative economic sectors. A recent example is the [[European sovereign debt crisis#Greek government funding crisis|Greek bailout agreement of May 2010]].

== Causes ==
According to financial historian [[Edward Chancellor]], past instances of sovereign default have tended to occur under some or all of the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2010/07/chancellor.pdf ''Reflections on the sovereign debt crisis''], Edward Chancellor, GMO White Paper, Juli 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A reversal of global capital flows
* Unwise lending
* Fraudulent lending
* Excessive foreign debts
* A poor credit history
* Unproductive lending
* Rollover risk
* Weak revenues
* Rising interest rates
* [[Terminal debt]]

A significant factor in sovereign default is the presence of significant debts owed to foreign investors such as banks who are unable to obtain timely payment via political support from governments, supranational courts or negotiation; the enforcement of [[creditors' rights]] against sovereign states is frequently difficult. Such willful defaults (the equivalent of [[strategic bankruptcy]] by a company or [[strategic default]] by a mortgager, except without the possibility of the exercise of normal creditors' rights such as asset seizure and sale) can be considered a variety of sovereign [[theft]]; this is similar to [[expropriation]] (including inadequate repayment for the exercise of [[eminent domain]]).&lt;ref name=theft&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Mark|last2=Tomz|first2=Mike|editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Hogan|editor2-first=Federico|editor2-last=Sturzenegger|title=The Natural Resources Trap: Private Investment without Public Commitment|url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/Papers.html#Theft|accessdate=6 November 2011|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA, USA|pages=69–110|chapter=Sovereign Theft: Theory and Evidence about Sovereign Default and Expropriation|chapterurl=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/TomzWrightExpropriationDefault.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Is Walking Away From Your Mortgage Immoral? | first = James R. | last = Hagerty | date = 2009-12-17 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2009/12/17/is-walking-away-from-your-mortgage-immoral/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who?|date=October 2018}} also believe that sovereign default is a dark side of globalization and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/sovereign-default-the-dark-side-of-globalization-and-capitalism/ |title=Sovereign Default-The dark side of globalization and capitalism |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolvency/over-indebtedness of the state===
{{duplication|date=March 2014}}
If a state, for economic reasons, defaults on its treasury obligations, or is no longer able or willing to handle its debt, liabilities, or to pay the interest on this debt, it faces sovereign default.  To declare insolvency, it is sufficient if the state is only able (or willing&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;) to pay part of its due interest or to clear off only part of the debt.

Reasons for this include:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*massive increases in [[public debt]]
*declines in employment and therefore [[tax revenue]]
*government regulation or perceived threats of [[Financial regulation|regulation of financial markets]]
*popular unrest at [[austerity]] measures to repay debt fully

Sovereign default caused by insolvency historically has always appeared at the end of long years or decades of [[Government budget|budget]] emergency ([[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"&gt;{{citation|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/2192.html|title=Districts, spillovers, and government overspending|author=Baqir, Reza|publisher=World Bank|date=30 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the state has spent more money than it received.  This budget balance/margin was covered through new indebtedness with national and foreign citizens, banks and states.

===Illiquidity===
The literature proposes an important distinction between ''illiquidity'' and ''insolvency''. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is "in default because of illiquidity". In this concept the default can be solved as soon as the assets which are "only temporarily illiquid" become ''liquid'' (again), which makes illiquidity a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.

===Change of government===
While normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a [[regime change]] the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered [[odious debt]].

Important examples are:
*default of debts of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] France after the [[French Revolution]].
*default of bonds through [[Denmark]] in 1850, which were issued by the government of [[Holstein]] instated by the [[German Confederation]].
*default of debts of the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government came to power in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), "Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535.&lt;/ref&gt;
*repudiation of debts of the [[Confederate States of America]] by the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of Section 4 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

===Decline of the state===
With the decline of a state,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=how is this distinct from successor governments discussed above?}} its obligations are turned over to one or several [[succession of states|successor state]]s.

Lost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after [[World War II]] the [[government debt]] has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to [[compound interest]] and continued [[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"/&gt; it has increased substantially.

== Approaches to debt repayment ==
There are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.

=== Reputation approach ===
The reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/why-sovereigns-repay-debts-external-creditors-and-why-it-matters|title=Why sovereigns repay debts to external creditors and why it matters|last=|first=|date=|website=VoxEU.org|jstor=2296886|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment approach ===
The punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

==Consequences==
Creditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default.

===Consequences for creditors===

The immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country.

In this case very often there are international negotiations which end in a partial [[debt cancellation]] ([[London Agreement on German External Debts]] 1953) or [[debt restructuring]] (e.g. [[Brady Bonds]] in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)]] some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or "haircut") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( "holdouts") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation.

For the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;

===Consequences for state===
When a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt; In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the [[Monetary Sovereignty|monetary sovereignty]] of the debtor state or even declare war (see above).

===Consequences for the citizen===
If the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. [[government bonds]]), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth.

In addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default:
* a [[banking crisis]], as banks have to make [[Writedowns|write downs]] on credits given to the state.
* an [[economic crisis]], as the interior [[demand]] will fall and investors withdraw their money
* a [[currency crisis]] as foreign investors avoid this national economy

Citizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a [[Monetary sovereignty|monetarily sovereign]] state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's [[Plano Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazil-battle-against-inflation/ |title=Brazil's Battle Against Inflation |publisher=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
With the reputation of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] &amp;ndash; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] and [[Fitch Group]] &amp;ndash; coming under fire since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at [http://www.publicsectorcredit.org/ Public Sector Credit Solutions] (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit [[Econometric model|econometric models]], are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/rating-government-bonds-can-we-raise-our-grade |title=Joffe, Marc. "Rating Government Bonds: Can We Raise Our Grade?" Econ Journal Watch 9(3): 350-365, September 2012 |publisher=Econjwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with [[Wikirating]]) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the [[Public Sector Credit Framework]], an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities.

==Examples of sovereign default==
{{main article|List of sovereign defaults}}
A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted on debt four times – in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596 – becoming the first nation in history to declare sovereign default due to rising military costs and the declining value of gold,  as it had become increasingly dependent on the revenues flowing in from its [[Spanish Empire|mercantile empire]] in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH8.html Gold and Silver: Spain and the New World] University of California&lt;/ref&gt; This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fuggers]] as Spanish financiers. [[Republic of Genoa#Golden age of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures.

In the 1820s, several Latin American countries which had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.&lt;ref name="jorgensen"&gt;Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, "Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K42LgBw0zqMC The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s; as protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions.  For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports (or, at least, its exports under current pricing; whether reductions in prices – forced sales – would have enabled fulfilling [[creditors' rights]] is unknown).&lt;ref name="jorgensen" /&gt;

More recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund. In June 2015 Greece defaulted on a $1.7 billion payment to the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/30/news/economy/greece-imf-default/index.html|title=Greece defaults on $1.7 billion IMF payment|last=Liakos|first=Virginia Harrison and Chris|date=2015-06-30|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spillover of the Syrian Civil War''' is the impact of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in the [[Arab world]]. Since the first protests during the [[Arab Spring]], the increasingly violent Syrian Civil War has been both a [[proxy war]] for the major Middle Eastern powers, [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], and a potential launching point for a wider regional war. Fears of the latter were realized when the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), a [[Salafi Jihadism|Salafi Jihadist]] militant group and alleged former [[al-Qaeda]] affiliate, established itself in Syria in 2013, and later combined with the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]] into a single conflict the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/04/10/Qaeda-loses-ground-to-rivals-on-Syria-s-Iraq-border.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-iraqs-spoils-tip-balance-eastern-syria/story?id=24128478|title=For ISIS, Iraq's Spoils Could Tip Balance in Eastern Syria|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/06/13/321678737/in-one-map-the-dramatic-rise-of-isis-in-iraq-and-syria|title=In One Map, The Dramatic Rise Of The Islamic State Militants|date=13 June 2014|work=NPR.org|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is often dubbed as the [[Arab Winter]].

==Iraq==
{{main article|Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)}}
For much of 2012, the Iraqi government had turned a blind eye to the [[Sunni]] and [[Salafist]] militias crossing the border into Syria. This toleration ended when Salafist militias connected to [[al-Qaeda]] ambushed a convoy filled with unarmed Syrian soldiers at [[Akashat ambush|Akashat]] on the Syrian side of the border. This led to greater fighting throughout the country, [[Operation al-Shabah]] in May 2013 in which the  [[Iraqi Army]] failed to wipe these militias out and the consolidation of several of them with ISIL.  [[Anbar Province]] became a [[Anbar campaign (2013–14)|battle zone]] and an [[April 2014 Iraqi–Syrian border airstrike|airstrike]] in April 2014 was of little use, because in June 2014 ISIL launched an offensive in northern Iraq, taking large swaths of the country and threatening Baghdad itself. In response, Iran reportedly deployed its [[Quds force]] in Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10896670/Obama-ponders-as-Iran-sends-troops-to-Iraq.html|title=Obama ponders as Iran sends troops to Iraq|date=12 June 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus turning the conflict into a full-scale war.

===Iraqi-Syrian border incidents===
{{main article|Akashat ambush}}
The [[Akashat ambush]] was a well planned assault against a [[Syrian Army]] convoy defended by Iraqi soldiers that took place on 4 March 2013, as the group was travelling in the province of [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]], next to the border with Syria. The [[Islamic State of Iraq]] claimed responsibility for the ambush on 11 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/03/201331114024632648.html |title=Al-Qaeda claims killing Syrian troops in Iraq |publisher=Antiwar.com |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 51 Syrian soldiers were killed in the clashes.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324281004578352640821817264 | title=Islamists Try to Tighten Grip on Syria Regions | work=Wall Street Journal | date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another 9 Iraqi soldiers were killed as well from insurgent fire. The attackers carried unknown casualties.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In March 2013, a source from Sinjar hospital said that [[Free Syrian Army]]
attacked Iraqi soldiers after entering Iraqi territories.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alsumaria.tv/mobile/news/72418/iraq-news/en&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2014, The Islamic State has mutated and grown into a massive pseudo country which has taken over much of Iraq and Syria and erased the border between the two countries in a new, multinational war.

In June 2016, the New Syrian Army, backed by the United States, overtook ISIL forces in the border town of al-Bukamal. The city is essential to a key route linking eastern Syria to Iraq. However, in the hours following ISIL launched a counteroffensive and retook al-Bukamal, with the New Syrian Army suffering significant casualties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/isil-retakes-syria-border-town-backed-rebels-160629132742057.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 10, 2017, ISIL has maintained control over al-Bukamal and the key route linking Syria and Iraq. ISIL has additionally conducted attacks near the Waled-Tanif Border Crossing to the south, and west of Mosul in the north. The significant territorial control ISIL maintains surrounding al-Bukamal allows for relatively easy passage between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Sanctuary%20Map%2010%20MAY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanese–Syrian border===
{{main article|Lebanese–Syrian border clashes}}
At the beginning of summer 2012, two [[Hezbollah]] fighters were killed in a clash with Syrian rebels who were on Lebanese territory.&lt;ref name="increases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/international/171434781_Hezbollah_Increases_Support_for_Syrian_Regime__U_S__and_Lebanese_Officials_Say__Beirut_.html?c=y&amp;page=1 |title=Hezbollah Increases Support for Syrian Regime, U.S. and Lebanese Officials Say (Beirut) |publisher=Northjersey.com |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September, [[Syria]]n [[Ground-attack aircraft]] fired three missiles {{convert|500|m|ft}} over the border into Lebanese territory near [[Arsal]]. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese [[president]] [[Michel Sleiman]] to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/09/18/syrian-jets-hit-lebanese-territory-near-border/#ixzz27JvfB9lg |title=Syrian jets hit Lebanese territory near border, 18 September 2012 |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the [[Free Syrian Army]] attacked a border post near [[Arsal]]. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the [[Lebanese Army]], who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from dignified locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being “neutral from the conflicts of others". He called on border residents to “stand beside their army and assist its members.” [[Syria]] has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Sep-23/188927-lebanese-president-praises-army-response-to-fsa-attack.ashx#ixzz27JxWSuyo |title=(Lebanon), Lebanese president praises Army response to FSA attack, 23 September 2012 |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2012/09/22/rebeldes-sirios-atacan-un-puesto-del-ejercito-en-territorio-de-libano/ |title=Rebeldes sirios atacan un puesto del Ejército en territorio de Líbano, CNN Espanol, Alkhshali Hamdi, Amir Ahmed, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Ben Brumfield and Joe Sterling, 22 September 2012 |publisher=Cnnespanol.cnn.com |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2012, four shells fired by the Syrian military hit [[Masharih al-Qaa]], where previous shelling incidents have caused fatalities. Lebanon's position of ignoring the attacks and dissociating itself from the conflict remained unchanged.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In October 2012 [[Hassan Nasrallah]] denied Hezbollah members were fighting alongside the Syrian army, but that Lebanese in Syria were only protecting Lebanese inhabited villages from the Free Syrian Army.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/57430-report-5-000-pro-hizbullah-fighters-defending-lebanese-inhabited-border-towns-in-syria|title=Report: 5,000 Pro-Hizbullah Fighters Defending Lebanese-Inhabited Border Towns in Syria|publisher=Naharnet|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon vs. ISIL and al-Nusra Front===
{{main article|Battle of Arsal}}
Starting in June 2014, Hezbollah began battling with Islamists along the Lebanese border, who had crossed into Lebanon several times and threatened to throw the country into full-scale war.

From 2–5 August 2014, the [[Lebanese Army]] clashed with Syrian gunmen in the town of [[Arsal]], which left over a hundred soldiers on both sides dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/141658-army-announces-death-of-10-troops-in-arsal-sends-reinforcements-as-residents-flee-en-masse |title=Army Retakes Posts in Arsal, Says 10 Troops Killed as 'Humanitarian Truce' Reportedly Reached — Naharnet |publisher=Naharnet.com |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2014, the [[al-Nusra Front]] invaded Lebanon near Arsal and the Bekaa Valley town of Al-Fakiha. Following a battle between them and Hezbollah, seven Hezbollah fighters and 32 Syrian terrorists died in clashes around the Syrian village of Nahleh, just over the border from Arsal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Jul-17/264184-hezbollah-nusra-front-clash-near-lebanon-border&lt;/ref&gt;

Dozens of hostages were taken back to Syria during the above-mentioned battle of Arsal. After fruitless negotiations, the Lebanese cabinet voted to authorize the army to invade Syria to free them on 4 September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Sep-05/269635-military-option-on-table-to-free-hostages.ashx#axzz3BQqtSY8q|title=Military option on table to free hostages|work=The Daily Star Newspaper – Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that they have yet to do. There was another attempted invasion of Lebanon by a joint ISIL-Nusra force in early October, which was beaten back by Hezbullah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29498972|title=BBC News – Hezbollah repel al-Nusra attack on Lebanon-Syria border|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2015.

In December 2015, after over a year and a half in captivity, Lebanese troops held prisoner by Al Nusra were exchanged for prisoners held in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/lebanese-hostages-released-prisoner-swap-151201072408599.html|title=Lebanese army and al-Nusra Front conduct prisoner swap|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hezbollah vs. ISIL===
In June 2015, the [[Hezbollah]] claimed that it was in the midst of a major battle with ISIL, which it claimed had invaded Lebanon and seized territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/hizbollah-declares-war-on-isil|title=Hizbollah declares war on ISIL|author=Josh Wood|work=The National}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July 2017 Hezbollah along with the Syrian Army declared an offensive on the seized territories by insurgents. On 22 July 2017 Hezbollah officials claimed capturing several points of the re-seized territories.

==Turkey==
{{main article|Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War}}
With a thousand-mile border with Syria and Iraq, there have been a number of incidents involving this nation with various factions in the conflicts south of the border.

===Syrian–Turkish border clashes===
{{main article|Syrian–Turkish border clashes during the Syrian Civil War}}
Openly supporting the overthrow of [[Bashar al-Assad]] Turkey permitted the establishment of a "jihadist highway" where rebels of all stripes, including ISIL, were permitted to cross both supplies and personnel South of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/2014/09/30/empathy-might-work-turkey-delivers-tanks-to-isis|title='Empathy' might work: Turkey delivers tanks to ISIS – Opinion – Daily Sabah|work=dailysabah.com|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were various incidents including the shooting down of a Turkish Air Force jet by Syria which killed the 2 pilots and also the shooting down of a Syrian Air Force jet by Turkey, and a February 2015 raid by the Turkish army to evacuate a tiny exclave in Syria.

===Turkey and ISIL===
{{main article|Turkey–ISIL conflict}}
Turkey had been allegedly supporting ISIL throughout its many incarnations as a "lesser evil" against the Assad government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html|title=Research Paper: ISIS-Turkey List|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/11/turkey-joins-the-coalition-of-the-unwilling.html|title=Why Turkey Is Sitting Out the ISIS War|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This to some extent began to change with the [[2013 Reyhanlı bombings]] and a retaliatory airstrike in January 2014. ISIL shook this off and began its conquest of northern Iraq, followed by consolidation of territories in Northern Syria. In the summer of 2014 it began taking over the border area with Turkey, leading to hundreds of thousands of refugees coming north along the border, riots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_16-dead-across-turkey-as-fate-of-kobani-stirs-up-tensions_360981.html|title=22 killed in protests against ISIL siege of Kurdish town|date=9 October 2014|work=TodaysZaman|accessdate=13 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010194804/http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_16-dead-across-turkey-as-fate-of-kobani-stirs-up-tensions_360981.html|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of teargas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, as well the end of the truce with the [[PKK]].

A vote to authorize military action was passed by the Turkish parliament on 2 October 2014. However, it had no follow-through and [[2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey|further rioting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/193844-protests-turkey-isis-kurdish/|title=Tear gas, clashes, fatality: Anti-ISIS rally in Turkey turns violent (PHOTOS)|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensued through much of Turkey's cities as the government demanded more and more conditions to join in the war. The riots intensified and several dozen protesters have been killed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The relationship between ISIL and Turkey deteriorated during the spring and summer of 2015, leading to sniping at the border and airstrikes by the Turks.

===Siege of the Süleyman Shah Tomb===
On 22 February 2015, the Turkish army invaded Syria via Kobani and drove to the Süleyman Shah Tomb, which was dismantled and brought back to Turkey. The 40 guards, who were due to return home months before, were also rescued. About 100 military vehicles, including 39 tanks, were involved along with 572 military personnel, one of which was killed in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Arts-and-Ent/Culture/2015/Feb-22/288280-turkey-evacuates-troops-guarding-tomb-inside-syria.ashx#sthash.3n0dA379.dpuf|title=Turkey evacuates troops guarding tomb inside Syria|work=The Daily Star Newspaper – Lebanon|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty to thirty-six Turkish soldiers were stationed there to guard the tomb. An attack on the tomb, considered Turkish territory under a 1921 Franco-Turkish agreement, was under threat earlier in the year, prompting the government to declare that it would retaliate against any such attack, and would serve as a [[casus belli]].

The Syrian government said the raid was&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Feb-22/288305-syria-condemns-turkeys-flagrant-aggression-in-north.ashx#sthash.mn9yNy3I.dpuf|title=Syria condemns Turkey's 'flagrant aggression' in north|work=The Daily Star Newspaper – Lebanon|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an act of "flagrant aggression" and that it would hold Ankara responsible for its repercussions.

===Russian warplane downing===

{{main article|2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown}}

On 24 November 2015, a Russian warplane was shot down in the Syrian-Turkey border area.  Turkey claims the plane violated Turkish airspace, a claim Russia denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34907983|title=Turkey 'downs Russian warplane on Syria border'|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early reports from multiple Russian news agencies indicated that the plane had been downed by a ground-based strike from Syrian rebels, but Russian officials later confirmed the Turkish reports that the plane had been downed by Turkish fighter jets.  According to Turkish officials, the Russian jet, an [[Sukhoi Su-24|SU-24]], was shot down by two Turkish [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jets after multiple requests (10 requests in a five-minute span) for the Russian jet to change its course.  Turkey maintains that the Russian jet violated its airspace, flying over Turkish territory despite warnings to change course, while Russia states that its jet never entered Turkish airspace and was over Syria the whole time.  Turkey produced a graphic showing the Russian plane's flight pattern, which appears to show it crossing the southern tip of [[Hatay Province]] before being shot down and crashing near [[Turkmen Mountain]] near the Syria-Turkey border.&lt;ref name=Buzzfeed&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=Francis|last2=Melville-Smith|first2=Alicia|title=Russian Jet Downed Near Turkey-Syria Border|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/franciswhittaker/warplane-crashes-near-turkeys-border-with-syria#.skMd8XV6pg|accessdate=24 November 2015|agency=Buzzfeed News|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey had previously warned Russia about violations to Turkish airspace, and had also warned them off strikes against civilian [[Syrian Turkmen]] living along the Turkish border.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey 'shoots down Russian warplane on Syria border'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34907983|accessdate=24 November 2015|agency=BBC|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia has steadfastly maintained "throughout its flight, the aircraft remained exclusively above Syrian territory."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  In response, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] stated that the attack was "a stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorists."&lt;ref name=Buzzfeed/&gt;

===Kurdish conflict===
{{main article|Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)}}

The 2015 conflict between Turkey and the PKK broke out following two year-long peace negotiations, which began in late 2012, but failed to progress in light of the growing tensions on border with Syria in late 2014, when the [[Siege of Kobani]] created an unprecedented wave of Kurdish refugees into Turkey. Some of the Kurds accused Turkey of assisting the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) during the crisis, resulting in widespread [[2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey|Kurdish riots in Turkey]] involving dozens of fatalities. The tensions further escalated in summer 2015 with the [[2015 Suruç bombing|20 July bombing in Suruç]], allegedly executed by an ISIL-affiliated Turkish group against Kurdish supporters. On 21 July, the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] killed a Turkish soldier and wounded 2 more in [[Adıyaman]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adiyaman-da-catisma-1-sehit-2-yarali-29593577|title=Adıyaman’da çatışma: 1 şehit, 2 yaralı|last=|first=|date=21 July 2015|website=[[Hurriyet]]|publisher=DHA|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some PKK supporters then claimed responsibility for the 23 July killing of two Turkish police officers in Ceylanpinar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/kurdish-group-claims-revenge-murder-turkish-police-150722132945249.html|title=Kurdish group claims 'revenge murder' on Turkish police|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as a retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-21/tensions-rise-in-kurdish-turkey-after-military-crackdown/6790752|title=Turkish crackdown on Kurds leaves death and destruction in border town of Cizre|work=ABC News|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jordan==
{{main article|Jordanian–Syrian border incidents during the Syrian Civil War}}

There have been several incidents on the 375&amp;nbsp;km long border between Syria and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Jun-14/260116-jordan-4-vehicles-destroyed-on-syria-border.ashx#ixzz34ciqgxnK|title=Jordan: 4 vehicles destroyed on Syria border|work=The Daily Star Newspaper – Lebanon|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan hosts nearly 600,000 registered Syrian refugees—although Jordanian officials say the total number is 1.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/higher-population-council-says-syrian-refugees-number-14-million|title=Higher Population Council says Syrian refugees number 1.4 million|date=24 September 2014|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the [[Jordanian Air Force]] launched [[April 2014 Jordanian–Syrian border airstrike|an airstrike]] on soldiers trying to illegally cross the border from Syria. Since then, attempted militant infiltration into Jordan has become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/main-headlines/jordan-syria-border-577250|title=One killed, several wounded in Jordan-Syria border clashes|work=Al Bawaba|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this was due to the return of Jordanian citizens who, as Jihadists, went to fight in Syria for a while and decided to go home for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/us-jordan-syria-militants-insight-idUSBREA3G16H20140417|title=Jordanian jihadis returning from Syria war rattle U.S.-aligned kingdom|work=Reuters|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports, there are over 2000 Jordanian Jihadis fighting in Syria. Over a hundred have been arrested and charged for crossing the border to fight, which is illegal in Jordan.

Since October 2014, Jordan has been an active part of the anti-ISIS coalition, contributing to the American-led campaign of airstrikes.

Two incidents occurred in January 2016. On 23 January Jordanian armed forces spokesman stated that a total of 36 armed men tried to infiltrate the border and an engagement with Jordanian border patrol left 12 dead while the rest retreated back into Syria. They were found to have 2,000,000 drug pills. The spokesperson also stated that "Jordan will not tolerate any infiltration attempt and will strike with an iron fist to whoever tries to disrupt Jordanian national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/army-kills-12-infiltrators-syria-border|title=Army kills 12 infiltrators on Syria border|work=Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The takeover of the city of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] in [[Cyrenaica]], [[Libya]] by the self-declared [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) took place in late 2014.

ISIL in Libya posted a video online on 15 February 2015 depicting the killing of 21 [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts]]. The video bore similarities to previous videos showing the "execution" of [[Western world|Western]] and [[Japan]]ese hostages, including the orange jumpsuits worn by the victims and the method of killing by [[decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3710610/libya-coptic-christians-isis-egypt/|agency=TIME|title=Beheading of Coptic Christians in Libya Shows ISIS Branching Out|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt responded to the video by [[2015 Egyptian military intervention in Libya|launching airstrikes]] against targets in Derna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/egypt-air-strikes-target-isis-weapons-stockpiles-libya|agency=The Guardian|title=Egyptian air strikes in Libya kill dozens of Isis militants|date=16 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2015/02/16/breaking-news-more-egyptians-being-kidnapped/#axzz3S54HzxID|agency=Libya Herald|title=More Egyptians being kidnapped|date=16 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main article|Islamic terrorism in Europe (2014–present)|France-ISIL conflict}}
A campaign of [[Islamist]] attacks occurred in France, beginning with the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Île-de-France attacks]] on 7 January 2015, between the French Government and ongoing [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by [[Jihadism|jihadist]] terror groups like [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]], or isolated individuals who sympathise with the jihadist movement. Since 2015 and until July 2016, eight Islamic terrorist incidents have occurred in France, including fatal attacks in Île-de-France, [[Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack|Saint-Quentin-Fallavier]] and [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris]]. [[November 2015 Paris attacks|The November 2015 attacks in Paris]] were motivated by ISIL as a "retaliation" for the French role in Syrian Civil War and Iraqi War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-attacks-were-an-act-of-war-by-islamic-state-french-president-francois-hollande-says-1447498080] "Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on a social media account, but didn’t provide specific information that would allow the claim to be verified. It said the attacks were retaliation for French airstrikes against the group in Syria and Iraq."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
A majority of [[attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh]] since October 2015 have been claimed by ISIL. In November 2015, the ISIL magazine Dabiq published an article calling for the "revival of jihad in [[Bengal]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/bangladesh-saw-rise-attacks-1234156|title=Bangladesh saw rise in attacks|date=3 June 2016|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, radical Islamic militants have assassinated Bangladeshi secularists, atheists, writers, bloggers, LGBT activists, Sufi and liberal Muslims, Hindu and Buddhist priests and Christian missionaries, as well as foreign expatriates from Europe and East Asia. On 1 July 2016, [[2016 Gulshan attack|six gunmen stormed an upmarket restaurant]] in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, killed customers of various nationalities and held hostages for nearly 12 hours, before the Bangladesh army ended the siege. ISIL claimed credit for the attack and reportedly released photographs of both the gunmen and victims from inside the restaurant during the hostage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/01/gunmen-attack-restaurant-in-diplomatic-quarter-of-bangladeshi-ca/|title=20 hostages killed in 'Isil' attack on Dhaka restaurant popular with foreigners|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bangladesh, however, has refuted ISIL claims and denies the group has any presence in the country. It has instead blamed local terrorist outfits, particularly the [[Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh]] (JMB) and the [[Ansarullah Bangla Team]], both of which have been linked to the country's far-right Islamist opposition parties.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Industry Standard''''' is a U.S. news web site dedicated to technology business news, part of [[InfoWorld]], a news website covering technology in general. It is a revival of a weekly [[magazine]] based in [[San Francisco]] which was published between 1998 and 2001.

==Print magazine, 1998-2001==
''The Industry Standard'' called itself "the newsmagazine of the Internet economy", and it specialized in areas where business and the Internet overlapped. Like ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]'', and (later) ''[[Business 2.0]]'', it was part of a breed of late 1990s publications that filled a gap in technology coverage left by mainstream media at the time.

The magazine, which was owned by the technology publishing company [[International Data Group|IDG]], was in many ways the brainchild of [[John Battelle]], who had been a journalist at ''Wired'' both in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Jonathan Weber was its editor-in-chief. The magazine also ran a web site, thestandard.com.

Beginning in 1999, ''The Standard'' began selling a large number of advertising pages in the magazine, and began to be referred to as "the bible" of the Internet economy. In 2000, it sold more ad pages than any magazine in America, and launched that year a European edition. However, as the [[dot-com boom]] failed, sales of the magazine began to shrink, and it went into bankruptcy in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|url=http://news.com/2100-1023-271755.html|title=The Industry Standard to stop publishing|work=CNET News.com|date=August 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of The Standard's writer/editors, [[James Ledbetter]], published a book in 2003 about the magazine's rise and fall; entitled ''Starving to Death on $200 Million: The Short, Absurd Life of The Industry Standard''.

==Website, 2008-present==
IDG relaunched ''The Industry Standard'' as an online-only publication in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Brad|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/bubblewatch-the-industry-standard-is-coming-back/|title=Bubblewatch: The Industry Standard Is Coming Back|work=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site featured technology industry news and an interactive section where visitors could make predictions about the future of the tech industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehd|first=Amanda|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Feb04/0,4675,IndustryStandard,00.html|title=Industry Standard Returns, Online Only|publisher=Associated Press (via foxnews.com)|date=February 4, 2008| accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''The Industry Standard'' became a "channel" within InfoWorld, another publication owned by IDG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Knorr|first2=Ian|last2=Lamont|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/welcome-readers-the-industry-standard-170|title=Welcome, readers of the Industry Standard!|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
