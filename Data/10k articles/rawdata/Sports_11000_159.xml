The '''1949 Chatham Cup''' was the 22nd annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Eden (soccer)|Eden]] (Auckland), [[Moturoa (soccer)|Moturoa]] (New Plymouth), [[Petone Soccer Club|Petone]], [[Christchurch Technical|Technical Old Boys]] (Christchurch), [[Northern (soccer)|Northern]] (Dunedin), and [[Invercargill Thistle]].

==The 1949 final==
The final was played in front of a then-record crowd of 12,000. Interest was high as the local Wellingtonian team was a lower ranked team (in the second division of Wellington football) who had gained a reputation as giant-killers. They went on to win the final 1-0 after having beaten several higher ranked sides in the course of the tournament, including a narrow win over [[Waterside (Wellington)|Waterside]] and a heavy 7-1 thrashing of [[Wellington Marist]]. The final is memorable for the magic of the giant-killing performance, which caught the imagination of the local population. The only goal of the match came in the second half, when Northern keeper [[Jim Stephenson]] parried a David McKissock shot directly into the path of Petone forward Wally Hewitt who duly scored. Petone survived a late scare when keeper Ben Savage was required to save a penalty, and the Settlers of Petone held on to win by the solitary goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{HiltonNZAssoc}} p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest métro station is [[Bercy (Paris Métro)|Bercy]]. Designed by the architectural firm Andrault-Parat, [[Jean Prouvé]] and Aydin Guvan, the arena has a pyramidal shape, and walls covered with a sloping lawn. It has a [[seating capacity]] ranging from 7,000 to 20,300, depending on the event.

==History==
[[File:AccorHotels Arena (Bercy Arena).jpg|thumb|left|The arena during the Paris Masters in 2008.]]
It has been used as the main venue for the [[Paris Masters]] [[ATP Tour]] [[tennis]] tournament, and for many sports events, such as: [[table tennis]], [[team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[artistic gymnastics|gymnastics]], [[track cycling]], [[show jumping]], and more.

POPB hosted the European gymnastics championship in 2000, the [[1991 EuroLeague Final Four|1991]] and [[1996 EuroLeague Final Four|1996]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.13.116.51/finalfour05/noticia.jsp?temporada=E02&amp;jornada=20&amp;id=379 1996 Final Four: Victory comes to Greece and the Greens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012144543/http://217.13.116.51/finalfour05/noticia.jsp?temporada=E02&amp;jornada=20&amp;id=379 |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EuroLeague|FIBA EuroLeague]] [[EuroLeague Final Four|Final Four]]s, and the [[FIBA EuroBasket]] championship in [[EuroBasket 1999|1999]], among others.

On 28 June, it was announced that the arena would host the 2017 [[League of Legends Championship Series#Europe|European League of Legends Championship Series]] Summer Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Esport/Actualites/Esport-league-of-legends-les-finales-lcs-a-l-accorhotels-arena-de-paris/814150|title=eSport - League of Legends : les finales LCS à l'AccorHotels Arena de Paris|last=Arrivé|first=Paul|date=28 June 2017|work=L'Équipe|access-date=2017-06-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the 2014–15 renovations efforts, the arena was renamed to Bercy Arena on 1 January 2015. It was again renamed to AccorHotels Arena in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article86000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509034238/http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article86000.html |archivedate=2016-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch''''' (also known as '''''Air Bud 4''''') is a 2002 Direct-To-Video American film, and the fourth film in the ''[[Air Bud]]'' series.

==Plot==
Josh is off to his first year of college and Buddy has stayed behind with Josh's little sister, Andrea, and the rest of the family. Jackie and Patrick have recently welcomed Josh and Andrea's half brother Noah. Andrea, attempting to fit in with her junior high classmates, decides to join the baseball team. Along the way she discovers that Buddy also has the uncanny ability to play baseball. Just as the season is settling in, a terrible discovery is made—Buddy's puppies have mysteriously started disappearing with the help of the kidnappers' little helper, Rocky Raccoon. It turns out the kidnappers were researchers who were dognapping the puppies because they thought they had a special gene that would enable them to play sports. Buddy must find them and make it to the major leagues as he goes to bat for the [[Anaheim Angels]].

The '''Eastern States Coliseum''', better known as the '''Big E Coliseum''', is a 5,900-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]].

==History==
The Big E Coliseum was built in 1916.  The longtime home of the [[Springfield Indians]] professional hockey team in the [[American Hockey League]], it was a part-time home to the [[New England Whalers]] [[ice hockey]] team while the team was in the [[World Hockey Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Garry |date=May 9, 2009 |title=Hartford Whalers, now Carolina Hurricanes, found their way to Springfield Civic Center, Eastern States Coliseum |url=http://www.masslive.com/sports/index.ssf/2009/05/hartford_whalers_now_carolina.html |newspaper=Springfield Union-News |location= |publisher=Larry McDermott |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s through to the building of the [[Springfield Civic Center]] in 1972, the Coliseum frequently hosted local showings of the [[Ice Capades]] and the [[Ice Follies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=November 1, 1959 |title=Birthday Edition Of Ice Capades Hailed By Critics |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/914255212.html?dids=914255212:914255212&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+01%2C+1959&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Birthday+Edition+Of+Ice+Capades+Hailed+By+Critics&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Hartford Courant |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher= |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for many years the largest capacity rink in western Massachusetts, and was the home arena of several local high school hockey teams as well as a prominent venue for regional and state high school tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Matt |date=March 13, 2008 |title=Cheers fade, but glory endures |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15504316.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |location= |publisher= |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, though the ice plant has been dismantled and hockey games are no longer played there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donahue |first=Chris |date=April 1, 1991 |title=Hockey mecca's demise leaves high schools scrambling |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56142294.html?dids=56142294:56142294&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+01%2C+1991&amp;author=Chris+Donahue&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=HIGH+SCHOOL+NOTES%3BMass.+hockey+mecca%27s+demise+leaves+schools+scrambling&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=USA Today |location=|accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the arena is a venue for [[The Big E]], and hosts Shriner circuses, equestrian shows and other local events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebige.com/ Eastern States Exhibition website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Coliseum has often been the location for the draft horse World Championship Finals, serving as such in 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebige.com/fair/horseshow/horseshow.asp |title=BigE Draft Horse Show |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=The Big E |publisher=Eastern States Exhibition |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a venue for rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blowen |first=Michael |date=March 27, 1993 |title=Rodeo king |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8220696.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |location= |publisher=William Taylor |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indians and The Coliseum==
The first game played in the new arena was on December 1, 1926. Boxing promoter [[Tex Rickard]] dropped the ceremonial first puck. The [[Springfield Indians]] lost to the [[Providence Reds]] 3–1.  In 1933, the parent [[New York Rangers]] decided to pull the franchise out of Springfield, but the Indians were back in the Coliseum for the 1935–36 season when [[J. Lucien Garneau]] transferred his [[Quebec City]] club to Springfield.

When World War II broke out, the franchise had to be suspended for the duration of the war due to the [[Eastern States Exposition]] grounds being commandeered by the [[United States Army]] for use as a quartermaster's depot.  The Indians were back at the Coliseum for the 1946–47 season until 1972, when the team moved into the [[Springfield Civic Center]] in downtown Springfield at the start of the 1972–73 season.

'''Centennial Stadium''' is a stadium located on the campus of the [[University of Victoria]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. The facility was built as a 1967 Canadian Centennial project to celebrate the [[Canadian Centennial|100th anniversary of Canadian confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Emergence of Architectural Modernism in Victoria - http://uvac.uvic.ca/Architecture_Exhibits/UVic_campus/buildings/Centennial_Stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;

The original seating capacity was 3,000. The venue was renovated and temporarily expanded to 30,000 seats to serve as the main stadium of the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]]. After the Commonwealth Games, the temporary seats were removed, leaving 2,000 new seats opposite the main grandstand for a total of 5,000 seats.

The stadium features a 400m synthetic rubberized track surface, as well as separate areas for [[long jump]]/[[triple jump]], [[high jump]], [[pole vault]], [[Discus throw|discus]], [[Hammer throw|hammer]], [[shot put]], and [[Javelin throw|javelin]]. Inside the track is a natural grass field for sports such as [[Canadian football|football]] and [[soccer]].

Centennial Stadium is the home of the [[Victoria Vikes]] soccer team of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].  It was also used as a soccer venue for the [[2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19154">The '''Chess World Cup 2019''' is a 128-player [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[chess]] tournament to be held in [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], [[Russia]] from 9 September to 2 October 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/index.php?option=com_fidecalendar&amp;view=fidecalendar&amp;ny=2019 FIDE Calendar 2019]. FIDE.&lt;/ref&gt; The top 2 finishers in the tournament will qualify for the [[Candidates Tournament]] for the [[World Chess Championship 2020]]. 

==Bidding process==
There was only one bid received for the combined [[FIDE]] World Cup and Olympiad events which was done by the [[Yugra]] Chess Federation.&lt;ref name="fc_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/10031-fide-and-ugra-cf-signed-an-agreement-on-chess-olympiad-2020-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The tournament is a knock-out event whereby the finalists automatically qualify for the Candidates tournament. If one of the two players has already qualified for the Candidates tournament by some other path, then a third place playoff may be required to determine the second qualifier. 
&lt;!--
Matches consist of two regular time limit games (except for the final, and playoff for third if required, which consist of four regular time limit games). For these two games, players have 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an [[Glossary of chess#Increment|increment]] of 30 seconds per move from the start of the game. 

If a match is tied after the regular games, tie breaks will be played the next day. The format for the tie breaks is as follows:
* Two [[Fast chess|rapid]] games (25 minutes plus 10 seconds [[Glossary of chess#Increment|increment]]).
* If the score is tied after two [[Rapid chess|rapid]] games, further two rapid games (10 minutes plus 10 seconds increment) are played.
* If the score is tied after four rapid games, the opponents play two [[Fast chess|blitz]] games (five minutes plus three seconds increment).
* If the score is tied after a pair of blitz games, an [[Armageddon (chess)|armageddon]] game (in which a draw counts as a win for Black) is played. White has 5 minutes and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 3 seconds/move starting from move 61.
--&gt;
&lt;!--
==Schedule==

Each of the first six rounds takes three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games, then a third day for tie breaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games, then a fifth day for tie breaks, if required.
* Round 1: 
* Round 2: 
* Round 3: 
* Round 4:
* Round 5: 
* Rest day: 
* Round 6: 
* Rest day: 
* Final (and play-off for third place if required):

Cue sports have a long history in India. The game of [[snooker]] originated among British Army officers stationed in India in the latter half of the 19th century. 

Billiard champions like [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]], [[Michael Ferreira]], and [[Geet Sethi]] have come out of India. [[Pankaj Advani]] is another successful Indian player. Training camps for identifying talent and providing them regional and state sponsorship have been organised by the Billiards and Snooker Federation in various parts of the country. 

==History==
The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sporting-vernacular-11-snooker-1089731.html|first=Chris|last=Maume|title=Sporting Vernacular 11.

One such variation originated at the officers' [[mess]] of the 11th [[Devonshire Regiment]] in 1875,&lt;ref name=heritage2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/|title=Origins of Snooker|first=Peter|last=Clare|date=2008|publisher=Snooker Heritage|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103150005/http://snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/|archivedate=3 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined the rules of two [[pocket billiards]] games, [[pyramid pool|pyramid]] and [[life pool]]. The former was played with fifteen red balls and one black positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls.&lt;ref name="jothiarun's balls book of billiards"&gt;Shamos, Mike (1993), ''The Complete Book of Billiards''. {{ISBN|0-517-20869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game developed its own identity in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]], an English officer who helped develop and popularise the game at [[Stone House, Ooty|Stone House]] in [[Ooty]] on a table built by Burroughes &amp; Watts that was brought over by boat.&lt;ref name=telegraph2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/Ooty-India-back-in-time-to-the-birthplace-of-snooker/|title=Ooty, India: back in time to the birthplace of snooker|date=16 June 2014|work=The Telegraph|first=Martin|last=Hughes-Games|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321074803/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/Ooty-India-back-in-time-to-the-birthplace-of-snooker/|archivedate=21 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "snooker" was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it to describe the inept performance of one of his fellow officers at the table.

The earliest contemporary reference to cue sports in India appears in a letter written by Captain Sheldrick from [[Calcutta]] on 2 February 1886. The letter gives a detailed account of a game called "Snookers". The letter also contains references to the game being played among members of the [[British Indian Army]] in 1884. British officer Ian Hamilton, who was stationed in [[Ooty]] from 1882-84, wrote a letter in 1938 in which he noted, "I have never doubted that my old friend Sir [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]] invented the game of Snooker. I was in at [[Ooty|Ootacamund]] in 1882-84 and there still must be some crowd left who can testify to the belief their current that Snooker owed its birth to Neville Chamberlain fertile brain. Could the game have existed in Ooty even before Chamberlain arrival just waiting for him to discover it and give it a new name. This is a certainly a possibility." The [[Billiards and Snooker Federation of India]] (BFSI) states that Ooty is "the most credible birthplace for the game of Snooker", however, the federation rejects the theory that the game was already established in Ooty. The BSFI also states that, based on available evidence, the first snooker game in India occurred at Ooty "almost precisely" in December 1881.&lt;ref name = "BSFI history"&gt;{{cite web |title=BIRTH PLACE OF SNOOKER |url=http://bsfi.net/birth-place-of-snooker/ |website=Billiards and Snooker Federation of India |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghana Karate Do Association''' it is the largest association for karate in Ghana and a member as well as the official representative for this sport in the [[Ghana Olympic Committee]]. It was founded in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/503186/tribute-from-ghana-karate-do-association-to-mr-jude-adu-ama.html|title=Tribute From Ghana Karate-Do Association To Mr Jude Adu- Amankwah, Former President Of Ghana Karate Association|first=Peter|last=Agbeko|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Karate was first introduced in Ghana in the second half of the 1990s. Until the late 1990s, karate training in Ghana was more of a traditional martial art than a sport. Karate prospered because of the immense contribution of practitioners and mentors such as Sensei Daniel Djura, founder of Africa Goju; Sensei Donald Djura; Sensei Moses Baiden; Sensei Duke Banson; and Sensei Quagrine.

On 30 April 1997, a national body was registered and inaugurated with the National Sports Council (NSC) in the name of Ghana Karate-Do Federation (GKF) as the 26th sporting association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0rnTWd17UngC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=GHANA+KARATE+DO+ASSOCIATION&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vOWwLMutS0&amp;sig=wTi-y7uwcbzAGfrSBYIRAedMVWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK4pzH8pTYAhXRp6QKHYXlCIw4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=GHANA+KARATE+DO+ASSOCIATION&amp;f=false|title=Graphic Sports: Issue 624 May 6-12 1997|first=Joe|last=Aggrey|date=6 May 1997|publisher=Graphic Communications Group|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GKF was affiliated to the [[Union of African Karate Federation]] (UFAK) and eventually to the [[World Karate Federation]] (WKF).

The founding members were Melvin Brown, Francis Fuster, Benjamin Selormey, Victor Amara, Daniel Gyamfi and Samuel Akpalu. After the inauguration of the federation, there was the need to form an executive and a technical committee. The executive committee was chaired by Rtd. Captain George Mould, and FrancisFuster and Jude Adu-Amankwah were his vice.{{clarification needed|date=February 2018|reason=vice what?}} All the other members were karatekas and served on the technical committee with Benjamin Selormey as Technical Director. 

The Ghana Karate-Do Federation later came to be recognized as Ghana Karate-Do Association. 

In 2004 Jude Adu-Amankwah took over from Capt. Mould as president of the association, with Sensei Melvin Brown as Technical Director, and Sensei Kwabena A. Poku as Referee and vice to the Technical Director. The other members of the technical committee were Sensei Prince Wilson, Sensei George-Slater Commodore, Sensei Saadisu Mamah Idrissu, Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe and Sensei Sylvester Davies. The technical committee is in charge of coaching and general training and grading of karatekas at the national level.
 
The membership of the executive committee was changed in 2009, with Michael Nunoo as the Chairman of the association and Sensei Saadisu Idrissu as the Technical Director. The present composition of the Management Board as of May 2011 is  Michael Nunoo, Chairman; Ade Sawyer, Vice-Chairman; Patrick Anyidoho-Cofie, General Secretary; Nathaniel Nartey, member; Sensei Kwabena Poku, Head Coach; Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe, Deputy Coach; and Dr. Sulley, member. The executive committee is now referred to as the management board.

The present members of the technical committee are Sensei Kwabena A. Poku, Head Coach; Sensei Prince Wilson; Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe, Deputy Coach; Sensei Isaac Amponsah; Sensei Ibrahim Jarrah; Victor Lartey; and Emmanuel Adjei.

The GKA took its first outing the year it was inaugurated, in 1997, to the UFAK Zone 3 Championships in the Ivory Coast, and won two gold, four silver and two bronze medals. Since then the association has participated in many yearly UFAK Zone 3 Championships and has performed increasingly well, winning laurels in both Kumite and Kata. The Association has also represented Ghana in three All Africa Games since its inauguration: in 1997, 2003 and 2007, when contestant Victor Lartey won by correction of a previous decision.

==International competition==

Ghana Karate Do Association is a member of the African umbrella organization [[Union of African Karate Federation]] (UAKF) as well as the World Association for [[World Karate Federation]] (WKF).

On the part of the Ghana Olympic Committee, the Ghana Karate Association is the only Karate Association authorized to send athletes to the Olympic Games.

'''Shoulder impingement syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] which occurs when the [[Tendon|tendons]] of the [[rotator cuff]] muscles become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the [[subacromial space]], the passage beneath the [[acromion]]. This can result in pain, weakness and loss of movement at the [[shoulder]].&lt;ref name="pmid9490991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fongemie AE, Buss DD, Rolnick SJ |title=Management of shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=667–74, 680–2 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9490991 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=SimonMoyes.com |title= What is Subacromial Impingement? |url=http://simonmoyes.co.uk/2011/02/11/what-is-subacromial-impingement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms in impingement syndrome are pain, weakness and a loss of movement at the affected shoulder.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt; The pain is often worsened by shoulder overhead movement and may occur at night, especially when lying on the affected shoulder. The onset of the pain may be acute if due to an injury or insidious if due to a gradual process such as an [[Osteoarthritis|osteoarthritic]] [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]. The pain has been described as dull rather than sharp, and lingers for long periods of a time, making it hard to fall sleep.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt; Other symptoms can include a grinding or popping sensation during movement of the shoulder.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt;

The range of motion at the shoulder may be limited by pain. A painful arc of movement may be present during forward elevation of the arm from 60° to 120°.&lt;ref name="chen03"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen AL, Rokito AS, Zuckerman JD |title=The role of the acromioclavicular joint in impingement syndrome |journal=[[Clin Sports Med]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=343–57 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12825535 |doi= 10.1016/S0278-5919(03)00015-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Passive movement at the shoulder will appear painful when a downwards force is applied at the [[acromion]] but the pain will ease once the downwards force is removed.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt;

==Causes==
When the arm is raised, the subacromial space (gap between the anterior edge of the acromion and the head of the [[humerus]]) narrows; the [[supraspinatus muscle]] tendon passes through this space.&lt;ref&gt;NEER, C. S. (1983). Impingement lesions. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 173, 70-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Anything that causes further narrowing has the tendency to impinge the tendon and cause an inflammatory response, resulting in impingement syndrome. Such causes can be  bony structures such as subacromial spurs (bony projections from the acromion), osteoarthritic spurs on the [[Acromioclavicular joint|acromioclavicular joint,]] and variations in the shape of the acromion. Thickening or calcification of the [[coracoacromial ligament]] can also cause impingement. Loss of function of the rotator cuff muscles, due to injury or loss of strength, may cause the humerus to move superiorly, resulting in impingement. Inflammation and subsequent thickening of the subacromial bursa may also cause impingement.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt;

Weight training exercises where the arms are elevated above shoulder height but in an internally rotated position such as the [[upright row]] have been suggested as a cause of subacromial impingement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoenfeld |first1=Brad |last2=Kolber |first2=Morey J |last3=Haimes |first3=Jonathan E |title=The Upright Row: Implications for Preventing Subacromial Impingement |journal=Strength and Conditioning Journal |date=October 2011 |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=25–28 |doi=10.1519/SSC.0b013e31822ec3e3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of Impingement syndrome is restrictions in the range movement of the scapulo-thoracic surfaces. Commonly, a rib (or ribs) between rib 2 and rib 7/8 on the side of the impingement, may jut out slightly and/or feel hard when the person springs on it/them. When this occurs, the [[scapula]] is raised and anteverted (angled forwards). This in turn pushes the acromion and the humeral head out of its usual anatomical position placing pressure downwards at the head of the humerus at the position of the nerve thus causing the impingement syndrome. This is visibly demonstrated by a slightly raised and protracted shoulder girdle. Note: the humerus anteverts in this position causing a more protrusive section of the humerus to press upwards towards the acromion.

==Mechanism==
The [[scapula]] plays an important role in shoulder impingement syndrome.&lt;ref name="Kibler, BW. 1998"&gt;Kibler, BW. (1998). The role of the scapula in athletic shoulder function. The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 26(2), 325-337.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a wide, flat bone lying on the posterior [[thoracic wall]] that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff- the [[Subscapularis muscle|subscapularis]], [[Infraspinatus muscle|infraspinatus]], [[Teres minor muscle|teres minor]] and [[Supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Marieb, E. (2005). Anatomy &amp; Physiology (2nd ed.). San Francisco, CA: Pearson Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; These muscles attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the [[biceps]], [[triceps]], and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]] muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula. Each of these muscles has their own role in shoulder function and must be in balance with each other in order to avoid shoulder pathology. 

Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons.&lt;ref name="Kibler, BW. 1998" /&gt; If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius.&lt;ref name="Cools, A. 2007"&gt;Cools, A., Dewitte, V., Lanszweert, F., Notebaert, D., Roets, A., et al. (2007). Rehabilitation of scapular muscle balance. The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 35(10), 1744.&lt;/ref&gt; These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MRI. Subacromial impingement..jpg|thumb|MRI showing subacromial impingement with partial rupture of the supraspinatus tendon. However, no retraction or fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle.]]
Impingement syndrome can usually be diagnosed by history and physical exam. On physical exam, the physician may twist or elevate the patient's arm to test for reproducible pain (the [[Neer Impingement Test|Neer sign]] and [[Hawkins-Kennedy test]]). These tests help localize the pathology to the rotator cuff; however, they are not specific for impingement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15866244 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.01.040 | volume=118 | issue=5 | title=Shoulder impingement syndrome | journal=The American Journal of Medicine |date=May 2005 |vauthors=Koester MC, George MS, Kuhn JE | pages=452–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neer sign may also be seen with [[subacromial bursitis]].&lt;ref name="OFP"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical examination of the shoulder joint-Part I: Supraspinatus rotator cuff muscle clinical testing|last1=Marreez |first1=YM |last2=Forman |first2=MD|last3=Brown|first3=SR|journal=Osteopathic Family Physician|volume=5|issue=3|pages=128–134 |date=May 2013|doi=10.1016/j.osfp.2013.01.005|pmid=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physician may inject [[lidocaine]] (usually combined with a steroid) into the bursa, and if there is an improved range of motion and decrease in pain, this is considered a positive "Impingement Test".  It not only supports the diagnosis for impingement syndrome, but it is also therapeutic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20522833 | doi=10.1177/0363546509359071 | volume=38 | issue=7 | title=Modified impingement test can predict the level of pain reduction after rotator cuff repair | journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |date=July 2010 |vauthors=Oh JH, Kim SH, Kim KH, Oh CH, Gong HS | pages=1383–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain x-rays of the shoulder can be used to detect some joint pathology and variations in the bones, including acromioclavicular arthritis, variations in the acromion, and calcification.  However, x-rays do not allow visualization of soft tissue and thus hold a low diagnostic value.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt;  [[Ultrasonography]], [[arthrography]] and [[MRI]] can be used to detect rotator cuff muscle pathology.  MRI is the best imaging test prior to arthroscopic surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid9490991" /&gt;  Due to lack of understanding of the pathoaetiology, and lack of diagnostic accuracy in the assessment process by many [[physician]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid18838403"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis JS. |title=Rotator cuff tendinopathy / subacromial impingement syndrome: Is it time for a new method of assessment? |journal= British Journal of Sports Medicine |date=Oct 17, 2008 |pmid=18838403 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.052183 |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=259–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; several opinions are recommended before intervention.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Treatment==
Impingement syndrome is usually treated conservatively, but sometimes it is treated with [[arthroscopic surgery]] or [[open surgery]].&lt;ref name="pmid1636936 8"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taheriazam A, Sadatsafavi M, Moayyeri A |title=Outcome predictors in nonoperative management of newly diagnosed subacromial impingement syndrome: a longitudinal study |journal=MedGenMed |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=63 |year=2005 |pmid=16369368 |pmc=1681371 |doi= |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative treatment includes rest, cessation of painful activity, and [[physical therapy]]. Physical therapy treatments would typically focus at maintaining range of movement, improving posture, strengthening shoulder muscles, and reduction of [[pain]]. To improve pain and function, [[physical therapists]] may employ  techniques such as  [[joint mobilization]], [[interferential therapy]], [[acupuncture]], [[soft tissue therapy]], therapeutic [[taping]], [[rotator cuff]] strengthening, and [[education]] regarding the cause and mechanism of the condition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} [[NSAID]]s and ice packs may be used for pain relief.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1636936 8" /&gt;

Therapeutic injections of [[corticosteroid]] and [[local anaesthetic]] may be used for persistent impingement syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid1636936 8" /&gt; The total number of injections is generally limited to three due to possible side effects from the corticosteroid.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt; A recent systematic review of [[Levels of evidence|level one evidence]] showed corticoestroid injections only give small and transient pain relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Chan|first2=Jimmy J.|last3=Claessen|first3=Femke M. A. P.|last4=Ring|first4=David|last5=Chen|first5=Neal C.|date=January 2017|title=Corticosteroid Injections Give Small and Transient Pain Relief in Rotator Cuff Tendinosis: A Meta-analysis|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=475|issue=1|pages=232–243|doi=10.1007/s11999-016-5002-1|issn=1528-1132|pmc=5174041|pmid=27469590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of surgical interventions are available, depending on the nature and location of the pathology. Surgery may be done arthroscopically or as open surgery. The impinging structures may be removed in surgery, and the subacromial space may be widened by resection of the distal clavicle and excision of osteophytes on the under-surface of the acromioclavicular joint.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt; Damaged rotator cuff muscles can be surgically repaired.

If the impingement syndrome is caused by restrictions in the scapulo-thoracic region the treatment may be to ease up the relevant rib restrictions (subluxation). One way of doing this is with a small amplitude high velocity thrust at the angle of the subluxed rib whilst stabilising the transverse process of the vertebra that the rib is attached to on the other side of the spine so that the vertebra does not rotate when the thrust is applied to the rib angle.  The thrust applied to the rib should be applied in an inferior and anterior direction perpendicular to the plane of the facet of the costo-transverse process joint on the side of the restriction on the rib that is subluxed. (restricted). Once the scapulo-thoracic restrictions are released it may take 48 hours for the scapula to retro-vert and drop inferiorly back into place its normal anatomical position such that pressure on the impinged nerve is returned to a healthy (un-impinged) level.

==History==
Impingement syndrome was reported in 1852.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt; Impingement of the shoulder was previously thought to be precipitated by shoulder abduction and surgical intervention focused on lateral or total acromionectomy.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neer72"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neer CS |title=Anterior acromioplasty for the chronic impingement syndrome in the shoulder: a preliminary report |journal=[[J Bone Joint Surg Am]] |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=41–50 |date=January 1972 |pmid=5054450 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Charles Neer proposed that impingement was due to the anterior third of the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament and suggested surgery should be focused on these areas.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neer72" /&gt; The role of anteriorinferior aspect of the acromion in impingement syndrome and excision of parts of the anteriorinferior acromion has become a pivotal part of the surgical treatment of the syndrome.&lt;ref name="chen03" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Subacromial impingement is not free of criticism.

Shoulder impingement: objective 3D shape analysis of acromial morphologic features" ''Radiology'' 2006; 239:497-505.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on bursal surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur.&lt;ref&gt;Loehr J, Uhthoff H.

'''Internacional Complex''' ({{lang-sq|Kompleksi Internacional}}) is a [[training ground|football training facility]] located in [[Pezë Helmës]], [[Tirana County|Tiranë]], [[Albania]]. The complex consists of two football stadiums, the 1,000 seater [[Pezë Helmës Stadium]] and the 500 seater [[Pezë Helmës Stadium II]]. It is opened and operated by [[FC Internacional Tirana|Internacional Tirana]], and some Albanian football clubs use the facility for training such as [[FK Kukësi|Kukësi]] and [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani]]. Many lower league sides use the facility to host games, as both stadiums meet the licensing requirements to host games up to the [[Albanian First Division]].

==History==
JanSport was founded in 1967 in [[Seattle, Washington, USA]] by Murray Pletz, his wife Janis "Jan" Lewis (for whom the company is named), and his father Norman Pletz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1975, JanSport introduced the first convertible travel pack, as well as its signature daypack.&lt;ref name=universe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/JanSport-Inc-Company-History.html|accessdate=2011-06-15|publisher=fundinguniverse.com|title=JanSport, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, VF purchased JanSport's then parent, [[Wrangler (jeans)|Blue Bell]].{{fact|date=February 2014}}

JanSport's corporate headquarters is in [[Alameda, California]], at VF Outdoor headquarters, where it shares offices with divisional siblings Lucy and [[The North Face]]. A distribution facility in [[Everett, Washington]], which had opened in 1971, closed in March 2012. JanSport also has a [[warehouse]] in Appleton, Wisconsin, which houses its collegiate apparel division.&lt;ref name="Horovitz"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Horovitz|title=New 'badge' of cool: High-tech, high-fashion backpacks|work=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2007-08-19-backpack_N.htm|date=2007-08-20|page=1A|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JanSport started by developing the external frame backpack, which used a metal frame with a cloth packsack attached to it; the products made include technical day packs and internal frame backpacks.  Up until the early 1990s, all JanSport packs were made in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/1998/10/26/focus2.html "JanSport Backpacks into Cost-cutting era"].

'''''L.A. Confidentiel: Les secrets de Lance Armstrong''''' (''L.A. Confidential: Lance Armstrong's Secrets'') is a book by [[sports journalist]] [[Pierre Ballester]] and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' sports correspondent [[David Walsh (sports reporter)|David Walsh]]. The book contains circumstantial evidence of cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] having used [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. The book has only been published in French.

A key witness for the authors was Armstrong's and his teammates' [[masseuse]] and [[soigneur]] [[Emma O'Reilly]]. She revealed that she has taken clandestine trips to pick up and drop off what she concluded were doping products.

Many of the incidents and allegations in the book were later featured in the [[USADA]] 2012 report on the [[US Postal Service cycling team]],&lt;ref name=cooper1&gt;[http://media.todayfm.com/podcasts/popup The Last Word, with Matt Cooper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029094718/http://media.todayfm.com/podcasts/popup |date=2012-10-29 }}, Oct 22 2012, interview with Paul Kimmage on Today FM (Radio Ireland Limited T/A Today FM, Dublin), retr 2012 10 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/ U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team Investigation], 2012, [[USADA]].org&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Armstrong being stripped of most of his titles by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-confirms-lance-armstrongs-life-ban UCI confirms Lance Armstrong's life ban], Barry Ryan, cyclingnews.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Many 2012 news reports would feature O'Reilly and others previously reported on in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/10/11/3608613.htm The World According to Lance], Quentin McDermott and Clay Hichens, October 15, 2012, Four Corners, ABC news (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

In the mid-1990s, Walsh had been a fan of Lance.&lt;ref name=kimmage1&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/cycling-big-reveal-of-cancer-jesus-3266380.html Cycling: Big reveal of Cancer Jesus], 2012 10 21, Paul Kimmage, Independent (Ireland). retr 2012 10 22&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh claims that what first raised doubts in his mind about Armstrong was his bullying of [[Christophe Bassons]] at the [[1999 Tour de France]].&lt;ref name=pugh1&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/david-walsh-it-was-obvious-me-lance-armstrong-was-doping David Walsh: 'It was obvious to me Lance Armstrong was doping'] Andrew Pugh, Press Gazette, 11 October 2012, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2001 he was granted an interview with Armstrong. It left Armstrong angry.&lt;ref name=pugh1/&gt;

In 2003 Walsh contacted former US Postal soigneur and masseuse Emma O'Reilly. She had been reluctant to talk to the press for years out of loyalty to Armstrong and the team. She claimed that she was motivated to cooperate with Walsh after she came to believe that several riders had died of blood doping. O'Reilly  was paid 5,000 pounds, after reviewing several transcripts and chapter drafts and doing PR for the book for Walsh.&lt;ref name=usada1&gt;[http://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/ USADA U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team Investigation], Oct 2012, affidavit of Emma O'Reilly, retrieved from usada.org on 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defamation lawsuits ==

Armstrong denied the claims. He and his lawyers filed lawsuits in various countries against the book's authors and the publisher Editions de la Martiniere, as well as against newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' which referenced the book, and the publishers of magazine ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' which printed excerpts.&lt;ref name=henry1&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2004/jun04/jun18news First Edition News for June 18, 2004], French judge to hear Armstrong case, Edited by Chris Henry, 2004 jun 4, cyclingnews.com, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sandomir1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/sports/cycling-armstrong-is-suing-accuser.html CYCLING; Armstrong Is Suing Accuser], By RICHARD SANDOMIR; Samuel Abt in Paris contributor, June 16, 2004, New York Times, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt; His UK lawyers also told "every UK paper and broadcaster" to not re-state what was in the book.&lt;ref name=pugh1/&gt; Armstrong also sued Emma O'Reilly &lt;ref name=usada1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/sports/cycling/lance-armstrong-aide-talks-of-doping-and-price-paid.html?pagewanted=all Armstrong Aide Talks of Doping and Price Paid], By MARY PILON, October 12, 2012, from nytimes.com, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrongs lawyers in France included Donald Manasse and Christian Charrière-Bournazel.&lt;ref name=henry1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sandomir1/&gt; In the UK he retained the [[Schillings]] firm, where&lt;ref name=pugh1/&gt; Gideon Benaim and Matthew Himsworth&lt;ref name=radar1&gt;[http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/armstrong-v-sunday-times-in-november-8322/ Armstrong v Sunday Times in November] Monday, Aug 1, 2005, bikeradar.com, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt; worked on his libel cases.&lt;ref name=chadderton1&gt;[http://www.thelawyer.com/libel-star-benaim-quits-schillings/1012873.article Libel star Benaim quits Schillings], 8 June 2012, Sam Chadderton, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong said the following at a news conference in 2004 regarding the suits:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ". . . we can't really tolerate it anymore, and we're sick and tired of the allegations . . . We'll do everything we can to fight them.  . . . It's unfortunate. It's a few journalists who took this on as a personal mission. Again, enough is enough." - Lance Armstrong, 2004, quoted in ''The New York Times''&lt;ref name="sandomir1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Armstrong's lawyers first asked the French courts for an "emergency ruling" to insert a denial into the book, as the book was to come out shortly before the [[2004 Tour de France]]. Judge Catherine Bezio denied the request. According to the Associated Press, the "judge . . . called Armstrong's request an "abuse" of the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-06-19/armstrong-wants-doping-denial-in-book/1995852 Armstrong wants doping denial in book], ABC News (Australia) Jun 19, 2004, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=1825480 Judge calls Armstrong's request 'abuse' of system], Associated Press, 2004 6 21, via espn.go.com, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong then sued the UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' under [[English libel law]] because it published an article referencing the book. The article was ruled in pre-trial to have conveyed the impression that Armstrong was guilty of doping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/tourdefrance2006/story/0,,1810152,00.html The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong's lawyers also sued the publisher in a French court regarding eight passages which were claimed to violate French [[defamation]] law. They wanted the passages removed or the book pulled from shelves.&lt;ref name=henry2/&gt;

When Bob Hamman, president of Dallas insurer SCA Promotions, read the book, he announced that his company would not pay $5 million promised to Armstrong for winning his sixth tour until he investigated the allegations.  However, an [[arbitration]] panel ruled that Hamman had to pay.&lt;ref name=Macur&gt;{{cite book|last=Macur|first=Juliet|title=Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=2014|isbn=9780062277220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the lawsuits came to an end. Armstrong reached an [[out-of-court settlement]] for a large sum of money with ''The Sunday Times'', which issued an apologetic statement. Emma O'Reilly didn't have to pay, although the emotional toll on her was severe.&lt;ref name=nytimes2/&gt; The French defamation lawsuit was dropped in 2006, which Armstrong's lawyers claimed was due to him being already "vindicated on three different occasions" regarding the allegations. This was referring to [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]]'s Vrijman report which exonerated Armstrong, the arbitration settlement with SCA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA Promotions|url=http://www.scapromotions.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the aforementioned ''The Sunday Times'' settlement.&lt;ref name=henry2&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2004/tour04/news/?id=jun04/jun18news Tour de France News for June 18, 2004: French judge to hear Armstrong case], Edited by Chris Henry, cyclingnews.com, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procycling.com/news.aspx?ID=2250 Pro Cycling News, July 6, 2006 )dead link)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/sports/05iht-world.2124018.html?_r=0 Roundup: Armstrong drops defamation suits - Sports - International Herald Tribune], New York Times, 2006/07/05, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatod1&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/cycling/2006-07-06-armstrong-lawsuit-dropped_x.htm Armstrong drops defamation lawsuits in France], Associated Press, Updated 7/6/2006, via USA Today, retr 2012 10 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the book proved to be the beginning of the end for Armstrong.  While Hamman realized he would likely lose, he believed that the testimony would provide strong circumstantial evidence that Armstrong had indeed doped--strong enough that sporting authorities would be forced to launch an investigation of their own.  His hunch was right; officials from the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) asked to review the evidence Hamman had gleaned.  Six years later, USADA charged Armstrong with doping.  Armstrong opted not to contest the charges, claiming the process was too one-sided.  As a result, he was banned from competing in any sport whose national or international federation followed the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Code]]--effectively ending his competitive career.&lt;ref name=Macur&gt;{{cite book|last=Macur|first=Juliet|title=Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=2014|isbn=9780062277220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, after USADA released its report on Armstrong's doping operation, ''The Sunday Times'' stated it might attempt to recover the money it lost in the suit, and might sue Armstrong for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/13/sport/armstrong-doping-sunday-times/index.html?hpt=hp_bn2 UK newspaper may sue Armstrong over doping libel case], By the CNN Wire Staff, October 13, 2012 retr 2012 10 16&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2012, after the UCI accepted USADA's report, SCA announced it would attempt to recover the money it lost in its arbitration settlement with Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Armstrong-Will-Be-Asked-to-Repay-7-5-Million-to-3971794.php Armstrong Will Be Asked to Repay $7.5 Million to Bonus Promoter], Mason Levinson, Bloomberg News, republished on SFGate.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leamington Kinsmen Recreation Complex''' was opened in 1985 as the F.T. Sherk Aquatic and Fitness Centre in [[Leamington, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leamington.ca/en/ourcommunity/leamingtonkinsmenrecreationcomplex.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was expanded in 2000 providing the community with access to 2 ice pads, and a fitness and aquatic centre.

==Facilities==
===Highbury Canco Arena===
Added to the complex in 2000 as the Heinz Arena, Highbury Canco Arena is the home of the 2 time defending Western Conference Champion [[Leamington Flyers]] of the [[Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League]].  The arena has an [[Ice hockey rink#International|Olympic (or international)]] sized ice surface with bowl seating for up to 2,500 people.  Highbury Canco Arena is also used by local [[Minor ice hockey|minor hockey]] teams and the Leamington Skating Club.&lt;ref name = "Arena"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.leamington.ca/en/ourcommunity/arenasheinzandunico.asp |title=Arenas Highbury Canco and Unico|publisher='''The Municipality of Leamington''' |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Heinz Arena name was changed after the main sponsor of the arena, Heinz, ended Canadian production of its products in Leamington. On August 15, 2015, The Heinz Arena became the Highbury Canco Arena &lt;ref&gt;http://windsorite.ca/2015/08/heinz-arena-becomes-highbury-canco-arena/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unico Arena===
Unico Arena was also added in the renovations done to the complex in 2000.  The Unico Arena has an [[Ice hockey rink#North American|NHL (or North American)]] sized ice pad with seating for 200 people.

===The F.T. Sherk Aquatic and Fitness Centre===
The original portion of the current complex is the F.T. Sherk Aquatic and Fitness Centre.  This portion of the complex houses:
*25 meter indoor saltwater [[swimming pool]]
*An indoor walking/jogging track
*[[Weight training]] and [[Aerobic exercise|cardio]] fitness rooms
*[[Racquetball]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts
*[[Gym]]
*A fitness studio
*An indoor cycling studio

The municipality offers gym memberships to the public, and there are currently over 3000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leamington.ca/en/ourcommunity/ftsherkaquaticandfitnesscentre.asp |title=FT Sherk Aquatic and Fitness Centre |publisher='''The Municipality of Leamington'''|accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magnavox Odyssey²''', also known as '''Philips Odyssey²''' is a [[History of video games (second-generation systems)|second generation]] [[home video game console]] released in 1978. It was sold in [[Europe]] as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', in [[Brazil]] as the '''Philips Odyssey''' and in Japan as '''Odyssey2''' (オデッセイ2 ''odessei2''). Odyssey² was one of the major three home consoles prior to the 1983 [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash]], along with [[Atari 2600]] and [[IntelliVision]].

In the early 1970s, [[Magnavox]] pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market, the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]], which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (''see [[Magnavox Odyssey series]]''). In 1978, Magnavox, now a subsidiary of [[Philips#North_America|North American Philips]], decided to release an all-new successor, Odyssey².

In 2009, the video game website [[IGN]] named the Odyssey² the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/21.html |title=Magnavox Odyssey 2 is number 21 |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Videopac phillips.jpg|thumb|The Videopac G7200, unlike Videopac G7000, had a 9" (23 cm) black &amp; white display built in.]]
The original [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]] had a number of removable [[printed circuit board|circuit cards]] that switched between the built-in games. With the Odyssey², each game could be a completely unique experience, with its own background graphics, foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and [[video game music|music]]. The potential was enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest. Unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey² included a full [[alphanumeric]] [[membrane keyboard]], which was to be used for [[educational game]]s, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox released a cartridge called ''Computer Intro!'' with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).

The Odyssey² used the standard [[joystick]] design of the 1970s and early 1980s: the original console had a moderately sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php Electronic Game Wizards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053639/http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php |date=8 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).

One of the strongest points of the system was its [[speech synthesis]] unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey² may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of [[board game|board]] and video games: ''The Master Strategy Series''. The first game released was ''[[Quest for the Rings|Quest for the Rings!]]'', with gameplay somewhat similar to ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', and a storyline reminiscent of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Later, two other games were released in this series, ''Conquest of the World'' and ''The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt'', each with its own gameboard.

Its graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time—the [[Atari 2600]], Mattel's [[Intellivision]] and the [[Bally Astrocade]]—were its "weakest point".&lt;ref&gt;"The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games" by Jeff Rovin, [[Collier Books]], 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Of these systems, the Odyssey² was listed by [[Jeff Rovin]] as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.

==Market life==

===United States===
The console sold moderately well in the U.S. It was one of the three primary consoles prior to mid-1982, though a distant third, after the [[Atari 2600]] and Mattel [[Intellivision]]. By 1983 over one million Odyssey² units were sold in the U.S. alone.

To sell would-be customers on its technical abilities as a computer-based console, the Odyssey² was marketed with phrases such as "The Ultimate Computer Video Game System", "Sync-Sound Action", "True-Reality Synthesization", "On-Screen Digital Readouts" and "a serious educational tool" on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges. All games produced by Magnavox/Philips ended with an exclamation point, such as ''[[Munchkin (video game)|K.C. Munchkin!]]'' and ''Killer Bees!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HYPE! |author=William from The Odyssey 2 Homepage |url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/odyssey2/articles/hype/index.php |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[third-party developer|third-party]] game appeared for the Odyssey² in the United States until [[Imagic]]'s ''[[Demon Attack]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="eg198306"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Programmable Arcade | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 |author1=Katz, Arnie |author2=Kunkel, Bill | pages=38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of third-party support kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas led to two other companies producing games for it: [[Parker Brothers]] released ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Q*bert]]'' and ''[[Super Cobra]]'', while [[Imagic]] also released ''[[Atlantis (video game)|Atlantis]]''.


===Europe===
[[Image:Videopac-pete-screen-800px.jpg|right|thumb|European models had no power button, and black action buttons]]

In [[Europe]], the Odyssey² did very well on the market. The console was most widely known as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', or just the '''Videopac''', although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names '''Philips Videopac C52''', '''Radiola Jet 25''', '''Schneider 7000''', and '''Siera G7000'''. [[Philips]], as Magnavox's [[Netherlands|Dutch]] parent company, used their own name rather than Magnavox's for European marketing. A rare model, the '''Philips Videopac G7200''', was only released in Europe; it had a built-in black-and-white [[computer display|monitor]]. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey² units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible, such as [[Frogger]] on the European console, being unable to show the second half of the playing field, and Chess on the American model, as the extra hardware module could not work with the console. A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U.S.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the console was released as the '''Philips Odyssey'''; the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] was released in Brazil by a company named "Planil Comércio", not affiliated with Philips or Magnavox. Odyssey became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U.S.; tournaments were even held for popular games like ''K.C.'s Krazy Chase!'' (''Come-Come'' in Brazil). Titles of games were translated into Portuguese, sometimes creating a new story, like ''Pick-axe Pete'', that became ''Didi na Mina Encantada'' (Didi in the Enchanted Mine) referring to [[Renato Aragão]]'s comedy character, and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil.

===Japan===
The Odyssey² was released in [[Japan]] in December 1982 by Kōton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (コートン・トレーディング・トイタリー・エンタープライズ, a division of [[DINGU company]]) under the name '''オデッセイ２''' (''odessei2''). "Japanese" versions of the Odyssey² and its games consisted of the American boxes with [[katakana]] stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white [[Japanese language|Japanese]] manuals. The initial price for the console was [[yen|¥]]49,800, which is approximately US$200 in 1982, but roughly $500 in 2018. It was apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey² items are now very difficult to find.

[[Image:Videopac with chess module.jpg|right|thumb|Videopac with chess module]]

*Expansion modules:
**The Voice: provides speech synthesis and enhanced sound effects. Unlike [[Intellivoice]], games compatible with The Voice did not require it; [[Danny Goodman]] of ''[[Creative Computing]] Video &amp; Arcade Games'' predicted "that eliminates any incentive to buy the $100 voice module".&lt;ref name="goodman1983spring"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Chess Module: the Odyssey² did not have enough memory and computing power for a decent implementation of [[computer chess|chess]] on its own, so the C7010 chess module contained a secondary CPU with its own extra memory to run the chess program
**[[Philips Videopac + G7400|Videopac+]]/Jopac-compatible only, Microsoft Basic. &lt;small&gt;The rare ''C7420 Home Computer Module'', made available in 1983 by Philips, was a costly extension for the newer Videopac+ and Jopac consoles only. It went with a thick A4 manual, and required an optional external tape recorder to save the programs. This module was the sole valuable justification of the presence of a so-called keyboard, which was supposedly designed to look like an hybrid educational toy, as read in header lines describing earlier this family of pluri-purpose consoles, even in the TV commercials that echoed the slogan written on these brand-new machines: “Video Computer”. Unfortunately, this late niche concept, even limited to learning game code contrary to the more professional packaging, could not resist at all the already overwhelming market of the real 8-bit home computers, where the [[Atari 400]] shared the same look in 1979, surprisingly. [The latter was advertised itself: « The affordable home computer that's easy to use even for people who've never used a computer before ».] This expensive module is not to be confused with the cheap cartridge #9: ''Computer Intro!''&lt;/small&gt;)

==Emulation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[O2EM]] --&gt;
An [[open source software|open source]] [[console emulator]] for the Odyssey² called ''O2EM'' is available. It includes [[Philips Videopac G7400]] emulation among other features. The emulator works on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[DOS]] and other platforms, and is included within [[OpenEmu]] for [[Mac OS X]]. ''O2EM'', (originally not open source) was created in 1997 by [[computer programming|computer programmer]] Daniel Boris and further enhanced by André Rodrigues de la Rocha.

The open source multi-platform multi-system emulator [[MESS]] has Odyssey² support, and is the only emulator to emulate The Voice expansion module without using sound samples.

[[Image:MSU Munn Ice Arena.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Munn Ice Arena is named for former MSU football coach and athletic director "Biggie" Munn.]]

'''Clarence L. Munn Ice Arena''' is a 6,114-seat hockey-only [[arena]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]] on the campus of Michigan State University, situated across Chestnut Road from the Intramural Recreative Sports Center West and [[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing, Michigan)|Spartan Stadium]]. It is home to the [[Michigan State University|MSU]]'s [[ice hockey]] team. Completed in 1974, the arena is named in honor of former MSU football coach and athletic director [[Biggie Munn|Clarence "Biggie" Munn]].

== History ==
Munn Arena came to be after debate over building a new basketball or hockey arena in the early 1970s. Plans were to build a new basketball arena and move the ice hockey team to [[Jenison Fieldhouse]]. In the end, Michigan State athletic director Burt Smith chose to build a new ice hockey facility to replace [[Demonstration Hall]]. Munn Ice Arena was designed by Daverman Associates of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The original design called for 10,000 seats, but MSU was skeptical they could sell that many tickets. Thus instead, they built a 6,250-seat arena.

The MSU ice hockey team moved out of [[Demonstration Hall|Dem Hall]] following the 1973–74 season and into Munn Ice Arena on Nov. 1, 1974. Michigan State lost its first regular season game at Munn 4-3 in overtime to defending national champion [[Minnesota Golden Gopher men's hockey|Minnesota Golden Gophers]].

As Michigan State grew into a hockey powerhouse in the 1980s, Munn became home to one of the hottest tickets in the state. Improvements were made to accommodate the program's increasing popularity. In 1985, the heat-exchanger pipes for creating ice were replaced by a direct refrigeration system allowing year-round ice. With increasing coverage, the press box was expanded from one row to two rows accommodating 50 people. A new four-sided scoreboard was added at center ice in 1991. To make handicap-accessible seats, the rink's capacity was reduced to 6,170 in the early 1990s. In 1999–2000, the press box was relocated from center ice to the rink end to make room for 300 club seats on the south end. Luxury boxes were added a year later on the north end of the rink. The additions boosted capacity to 6,470. During the same time the four-sided scoreboard was replaced with two boards at the east and west ends of the rink along with two video replay boards. Recent renovations, which included the installation of additional handicap-accessible platforms, brought capacity to its current 6,114.

For its first 20 years Munn Ice Arena was the premier on-campus collegiate hockey facility in the country. It is still recognized as one of the top campus hockey rinks in the NCAA.  It is also used for high school and amateur hockey and ice skating.

A job at Munn is one of the most highly sought after student jobs on Michigan State's campus.  The employees have referred to themselves as "Munnsters" (a reference to the 1960s TV show with an intentional misspelling), a title which has recently replaced the word "staff" on employee uniforms.

== Sell-out streak ==
Munn Ice Arena was home to the NCAA's longest consecutive regular-season sell-out streak. On Dec. 19, 1985, Michigan State produced a sell-out crowd versus [[Northern Michigan University]]. Michigan State went on to sell-out 323 consecutive regular season home games. The streak ended on Oct. 15, 2004 when Munn failed to fill to capacity for a game against [[St. Lawrence University]].

==Memorable games==
*November 6, 1974 – vs. [[University of North Dakota|North Dakota]] – The first sell-out crowd in Munn history watches goalie Ron Clark stop a record 30 first-period shots in a 6-2 win over North Dakota.
*March 14, 1976 – vs. [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] – Michigan State is upset by Minnesota in triple overtime during the WCHA playoffs. The loss cost the Spartan squad, one of the best to that date, a berth in the NCAA tournament. The game lasted over 86 minutes.
*March 3, 1979 – vs. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] – In [[Amo Bessone]]'s final game as head coach Michigan State completes a two-game sweep of Michigan with a 5-3 win.
*March 18, 1984 – vs. [[Boston College]] – With a 7-6 victory over the Eagles, Michigan State advances to their first NCAA Frozen Four since 1967.
*December 15, 1985 – vs. [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] – Senior Mike Donnelly scores a Spartan-record five goals including the overtime game-winning goal in a 6-5 win over the Buckeyes. Donnelly had tallied a hat trick in the previous night's contest with the Buckeyes.
*February 22, 1986 – vs. [[Lake Superior State University|Lake Superior State]] – With three teams (Lake Superior State, Michigan State and Western Michigan) tied for first place in the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association|CCHA]] heading into the final two games of the season, Michigan State defeats Lake Superior State 5-4 in a dramatic overtime game on the final night of the season. The victory and a Western Michigan loss gave MSU sole possession of the CCHA title.
*February 12, 1993 – vs. [[Kent State University|Kent State]] – A 6-5 win over the Golden Flashes made head coach Ron Mason the winningest coach in NCAA ice hockey history with 674 wins.
*November 2, 1996 – vs. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] – Unranked Michigan State upsets defending national champion and No. 1 ranked Michigan 5-4. The loss cost the Wolverines the top spot in the polls for one week — the only week the Wolverines were not ranked No. 1 that season. The victory completed a weekend sweep as MSU recorded an 8-2 win over No. 3 ranked Bowling Green State the previous night.
*February 20, 1998 – vs. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] – The Spartans hand the Wolverines a 5-1 loss giving Ron Mason win No. 800. After the victory, students poured onto the ice celebrating the milestone. The celebration was featured on [[ESPN]]'s [[SportsCenter]].
*February 28, 1998 – vs. [[Ferris State University|Ferris State]] – On Senior Night, senior goalie Chad Alban scores an empty-net goal with 13 seconds remaining in a 6-3 win over the Bulldogs.
*February 10, 2001 – vs. [[University of Alaska Fairbanks|Alaska]] – Sophomore goalie Ryan Miller records his 17th shutout of his career in a 3-0 win over the Nanooks. No. 17 gives Miller the NCAA record for career shutouts. Miller ended his three-year career with 26 shutouts.
*March 1, 2001 – vs. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] – An over-capacity crowd of 7,121, the second-largest crowd in Munn history, watch MSU beat archrival UM 3-1 on Senior Night.
*March 9, 2002 – vs. [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green State]] – In his final game at Munn as head coach, [[Ron Mason]] delivers a 4-2 victory over the Falcons to advance to the CCHA Semifinals in Detroit.

The '''NBA Development League Most Valuable Player (MVP)''' is an annual [[NBA Development League]] (D-League) award given since the league's [[2001–02 NBDL season|inaugural season]] to the best performing player of the regular season. The league's head coaches determine the award by voting and it is usually presented to the honoree during the D-League playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dleague.nba.com/news/jarnell-stokes-2015-16-nba-dleague-mvp/|title=Jarnell Stokes Named 2015-16 NBA Development League MVP|work=NBA.com|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No player has been named the MVP more than once, and no international player has won the award. [[Ansu Sesay]] was the inaugural winner while playing for the [[Greenville Groove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/nbdl/groove_sesay_mvp_020327.html|title=Groove's Sesay Named 2001-02 NBDL MVP|work=NBA.com|date=March 27, 2002|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[basketball position|position]], [[guard (basketball)|guards]] have dominated the award with 11 winners, followed by [[forward (basketball)|forwards]] with six. Only one [[center (basketball)|center]] has won, [[Courtney Sims]] in 2008–09.

The '''National Olympic Committee of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos tautinis olimpinis komitetas}}, ''LTOK'') is the [[National Olympic Committee]] representing [[Lithuania]].

== History ==
Lithuania's national Olympic committee was established and recognized in 1924. In the same year LTOK sent its first delegation to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. During [[Soviet Union]] occupation time LTOK was disestablished. At 1988 movement for freedom times there was offered to restore national committee. On October 10, 1988 [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|LSSR]] physical education and sport organization created a special group to reestablish National Olympic Committee of Lithuania. Group chairman become [[Artūras Poviliūnas]]. At same year December 11 in [[Vilnius]] was held delegates session in which LTOK was restored, and [[Artūras Poviliūnas]] was elected its president. LTOK delegates on February 15, 1990 in [[Lausanne]] met [[IOC]] spokesman. Following the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]] on March 11, the republic withdrew its athletes from all Soviet national competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/sports/olympics-lithuanians-want-sports-independence.html OLYMPICS; Lithuanians Want Sports Independence]&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania attempted to first compete on its own at the [[1990 Goodwill Games]] that would be contested from July to August, but the request was rejected and an attempt to make the athletes wear carry the republic's flag during welcoming ceremonies and wear patches on their Soviet uniforms bearing the Lithuanian insignia was not accepted by the LTOK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900622&amp;slug=1078376 Lithuanians Won't Play With Soviets -- Marciulionis, Sabonis Just Say No]&lt;/ref&gt; Only four Lithuanian athletes accepted to play for the USSR at the Goodwill Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-07-25/sports/9007250329_1_soviet-union-goodwill-games-lithuanian Soviets Whip U.s. Without Lithuanians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1991 IOC meeting at [[Berlin]], the National Olympic Committee of Lithuania was officially recognized. Lithuania was along with Baltic neighbors [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] part of the first former [[United Republic]] to participate as independent countries.

== Participating incidents ==
*In the 1932 Summer Olympics in [[Los Angeles]], Lithuania did not participate due to economic difficulties and political controversies surrounding the National Olympic Committee.
*In the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Lithuania was not invited by [[Nazi Germany]] due to the [[Klaipėda]]/Memelland region controversy.

A '''net sport''' is a [[sports|sport]] where a [[net (device)|net]] is a standard part of the game, especially where the net separates the opponents. The basic goal in these sports is to hit the [[ball]] or [[Badminton#Shuttlecock|bird]] over the net back to the opponent. Players score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball or bird back over the net. The criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).

Net sports usually include:&lt;ref name=spokesman-review&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[racquet sports]] such as [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[pickleball]] and [[table tennis]] (but not [[Squash (sport)|squash]] or [[racquetball]], where players must hit the ball towards a wall).
* [[volleyball]], [[footvolley]], [[headis]] or [[sepak takraw]], where players must hit the ball with body.

Although [[basketball]], [[hockey]], [[water polo]] and other sports have netting around the [[Goal (sport)|goal]] area designed to more clearly indicate when goals are scored, they are not usually considered "net sports". Similarly, [[lacrosse stick]]s have a loose netting that is used to catch and fling the ball, but again [[lacrosse]] is not usually considered a "net sport".

The [[Los Angeles Daily Times]] reports: "Net sports are unique in that the equipment is light, portable and affordable, and partners and opponents are easy to find. The sports are easy to learn, and the social aspect of the game[s] appeals to those who find the health club to be an isolationist palace of mirrors."&lt;ref name=spokesman-review/&gt;

The three "favorite" net sports (tennis, badminton, and volleyball) usually involve arching of the [[human back|back]] when [[Serve (tennis)|serving]] or [[Volleyball#Attack|spiking]]/[[Smash (tennis)|smashing]] the ball or bird.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

'''The Richmond Golf Club''' is a private golf club whose 18-hole course now occupies the historic [[Sudbrook Park, Petersham|Sudbrook Park]] adjacent to  [[Richmond Park]], in [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], south west London.  The [[Listed Building|Grade I listed building]], Sudbrook House, in the park, is now the clubhouse. The patron of the club is His Royal Highness, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]].

==History==
The Club was founded in February, 1891, at a meeting at the Greyhound Hotel in Richmond.  It briefly leased a course at [[Old Deer Park]], before moving to Sudbrook Park in Petersham, where it has been located ever since.

Without a clubhouse initially, the members met in the Fox and Duck public house, which they also used for the changing rooms, before obtaining the lease of Sudbrook Park and House in 1898.&lt;ref name="Brennand"&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Brennand |title=Richmond Golf Club: A Centenary History 1891–1991 |year=1990 |publisher=St Edmundsbury Press Ltd |pages=20,38–39,104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golfing and Competitions==
The club runs a full schedule of friendly and competitive golfing activities.  It still runs competitions dating back to the first days of the club, of which notable competitions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Brennand |title=Richmond Golf Club: A Centenary History 1891–1991 |year=1990 |publisher=St Edmundsbury Press Ltd |pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Stephenson Challenge Cup''' trophies, first presented in 1895 to the winners of the singles and foursomes matchplay competitions.

'''The Don Memorial Challenge Cup''', instituted in 1895, a 36-hole scratch medal which is open to members of invited local golf clubs.

'''The Victory and Rube Shields''', a series of annual matches played between The Richmond Golf Club and Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club, first played in 1897.

The club has hosted visits from many professionals including, in 1975, Tom Watson playing his first game of golf in Britain.  This was the day before playing in and winning his first Open Championship at Carnoustie, beating Jack Newton in a play-off.&lt;ref name="Frampton"&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Frampton |title=Golf Since 1891 at The Richmond Golf Club |year=2007 |publisher=Roger Frampton |pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
The course was designed by [[Tom Dunn (golf course architect)|Tom Dunn]] in 1896, one of many laid out by Dunn during the explosion of popularity of the sport in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="GA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golfclubatlas.com/in-my-opinion/in-my-opinion-the-early-architects-beyond-old-tom-by-tom-macwood/the-early-golf-architects-beyond-old-tom-by-tom-macwood-pg-ii/ |title=The Early Golf Architects: Beyond Old Tom |first=Tom |last=Macwood |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current layout of the course consists of six par 3, eight par 4 and four par 5 holes, with a total length of {{convert|6091|yards|m}} and a par of 70 ([[Standard scratch scoring|SSS]] 69).

Between 2010 and 2012, the course underwent significant renovation, including the construction of 56 new bunkers, as well as improvements to putting greens, tees and the planting of new trees along the fairways.  Following these enhancements, the course was awarded first place in the Golf Inc. Monthly, Renovation of the Year for 2012.&lt;ref name="Golf Inc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golfincmagazinemonthly-digital.com/golfincmagazinemonthly/july_2013?pg=41#pg44 |title=Golf Inc. Monthly |date=July 2013 |first=Mike |last=Stetz |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubhouse==
{{main|Sudbrook Park, Petersham}}
The club's clubhouse, Sudbrook House, was built around 1725 by architect [[James Gibbs]], for [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll]]. It is built of a combination of white Portland stone and dark red brick, and is widely regarded{{By whom|date=January 2015}} as one of the finest examples of early eighteenth-century English Palladian architecture.

At the centre of Sudbrook House is The Cube Room, which is the club's principal dining and function room.  The Cube Room is of Baroque style, and as its name suggests, the height (over 30 feet) is the same as the width and length.  The interior of The Cube Room is adorned with trophies of arms above the doorways from the Duke of Argyll's military achievements, and the Campbell family coat of arms carved in pine in the great panel above the mirror.  The carved marble chimney is the work of Flemish sculptor [[John Michael Rysbrack|Jan Michiel Rysbrack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Brennand |title=Richmond Golf Club: A Centenary History 1891–1991 |year=1990 |publisher=St Edmundsbury Press Ltd |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facilities==
In addition to the course, there are extensive practice facilities, including: 2 putting greens, a 250-yard driving range with covered teaching bays, and a short-game practice area for chipping and bunker shots.

The clubhouse has two bars, one which is reserved exclusively for members, dining rooms, a TV lounge and a snooker room.

The course also has a [[pro shop]] and the clubhouse is available to host weddings and other social events.

'''Scotiabank Saddledome''' is a multi-use [[indoor arena]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada. Located in [[Stampede Park]] in the southeast end of [[downtown Calgary]], the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the [[Stampede Corral]] as the home of the [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]], and to host [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] and [[figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].

The facility also hosts concerts, conferences and other sporting championships, and events for the [[Calgary Exhibition and Stampede]]. It underwent a major renovation in 1994–95 and sold its [[naming rights]], during which its original name of '''Olympic Saddledome''' was changed to '''Canadian Airlines Saddledome'''. The facility was given the name '''Pengrowth Saddledome''' in 2000, after [[Pengrowth Management Ltd.]] signed a ten-year agreement. It adopted its current name in October 2010 as [[Scotiabank]] signed on as title sponsor.

The Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary, who leases it to the Saddledome Foundation, a [[non-profit organization]], to oversee its operation. Since 1996, it has been managed by the Flames. The Saddledome was damaged during the [[2013 Alberta floods]] but was repaired and reopened in time for the [[2013–14 NHL season]].

The arena's roof is shaped like a [[saddle]], thus earning the name "Saddledome". 

== Construction ==
Calgary had been served for 30 years by the [[Stampede Corral]] when the [[Calgary Flames]] arrived in 1980. With a total capacity of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toth |first=Dan |title=Shootout at the Stampede Corral |work=Calgary Sun |date=2005-02-12 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in 1977, leading the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Calgary Cowboys]] to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zeman |first=Gary |title=Alberta on Ice |year=1985 |page=90 |publisher=GMS Ventures |isbn=0-9692320-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgary's bid to host the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], coupled with the arrival of the Flames, drove the need to build a new arena.  City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city's new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the [[Victoria Park, Calgary|Victoria Park]] neighbourhood on the east end of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Sheila |title=Coliseum decision today — east end has edge |work=Calgary Herald |page=A1 |date=1981-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]] were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tennant |first=Jack |title=Airdrie logical site for coliseum |work=Calgary Sun |page=5 |date=1981-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Saddledome from Calgary Tower.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Saddledome's location within Stampede Park, as seen from the [[Calgary Tower]]]]

The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Laurent |first=Steve |title=Residents will fight coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=March 2, 1981 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warden |first=Kathryn |title=Stampede picked for coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-03-04 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Sheila |title=Klein tries end run in coliseum battle |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-25 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bid to end the battle, Mayor [[Ralph Klein]] asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cotton |first=Crosbie |title=Klein's action may guarantee Games |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-28 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final hurdle is cleared for coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-29 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena.&lt;ref name="ConstructionStart"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cotton |first=Crosbie |title=Work starts on coliseum site |work=Calgary Herald |date=1980-07-30 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Olympic Committee]] was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated "The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary's) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary's commitment to hosting the Games".&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Remington |first=Robert |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=bb367c51-527e-4abc-b61a-39821fa3f0f9 |title=Sensational Saddledome helped define Calgary |work=Calgary Herald |page=A3 |date=2008-10-12 |accessdate=2008-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122112758/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=bb367c51-527e-4abc-b61a-39821fa3f0f9 |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects.  While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1"/&gt;  The [[saddle roof|roof]] of the building was designed to be a reverse [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/b_design.html |title=Building Design |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1"/&gt;  When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped.  Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle.  The winning name in the contest, ''Olympic Saddledome'', was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary's Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying "It is neither Olympic nor western, and it's not even dome".&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt;

The designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome,&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt; and were honoured by the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.ab.ca/pages/public/csaa/csaa-30.aspx |title=Olympic Saddledome |publisher=Alberta Association of Architects |accessdate=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416224920/http://www.aaa.ab.ca/pages/public/csaa/csaa-30.aspx |archivedate=2008-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the Saddledome was still reported as the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt; The Saddledome was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on September 27, 1987, for an article discussing the city of Calgary and the upcoming 1988 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Welcoming the world |work=Time Magazine |date=1987-09-27 |page=cover |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary's [[CTrain]] light rail transit system via the [[Victoria Park/Stampede (C-Train)|Victoria Park/Stampede station]] that stands parallel to [[Macleod Trail (Calgary)|Macleod Trail]].  The CTrain station, BMO Centre, Stampede Corral and Saddledome are all connected via a [[+15|Plus 15]] pedestrian [[skyway]]. Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premier.alberta.ca/royalvisit/images/StampedeParkMap.pdf |format=PDF |title=Stampede Park map |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n12Le0Od?url=http://www.premier.alberta.ca/royalvisit/images/StampedeParkMap.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Calgary skyline.jpg|thumb|204x204px|The Saddledome and [[Calgary]] skyline at night]]
The arena was initially projected to cost $60 million to build,&lt;ref name="ConstructionStart" /&gt; and later revised to over $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddledome's a cinch to please |work=Calgary Herald |date=1983-10-15 |page=G1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $16 million cost overrun, resulting in a final cost of $97.7 million and an eight-month delay in its completion.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt;  Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gu8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1274,5728567 |title=Calgary Saddledome: 10 months overdue, $16.5 million over |work=New London Day |date=1983-09-20 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upset with the excess cost, [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=Michael |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SRUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RKUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5761,2892000 |title=Calgary Olympics: Trying to avoid Montreal's example |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1983-07-30 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager, while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Jeff |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-zA0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MPUIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1642,2979213 |title=Report questions Olympic chief's competence |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1984-10-16 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it opened on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government's [[National Energy Policy]].&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt;  During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the standard of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Larry |title=Glass, pigeons crash opening clambake |work=Calgary Herald |date=1983-10-16 |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oilers defeated the Flames 4–3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Saddledome infested with 'Rat' |work=Calgary Herald |page=E1 |date=1983-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial [[seating capacity]] was 16,605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mummery |first=Bob |title=Countdown to the Stanley Cup |page=39 |publisher=Polestar Book Publishers |year=1989 |isbn=0-919591-48-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Olympics neared, the Calgary organizing committee spent $1 million to add over 2,600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=J.D. |title=Games on the range |work=Time Magazine |date=1987-09-27 |page=17 |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 20,016, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games, and called the facility "the finest international rink in the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Canada's Olympic Hockey History 1920–2010 |publisher=Fenn Publishing |location=Toronto |page=149 |isbn=1-55168-323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Olympic Committee]] praised the city's commitment to hosting the Olympics, noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary's bid and positively influenced voters.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt;  The Saddledome was the first arena in North America designed to accommodate the larger international [[Ice hockey rink|ice surface]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/travel/stadium/_/s/nhl/id/3/scotiabank-saddledome |title=Scotiabank Saddledome |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (international rinks are 13 feet wider than NHL rinks). The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in the early '90s at 20,230.

[[Image:Pengrowth Saddledome lacrosse.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the Saddledome during a [[Calgary Roughnecks]] game]]
The Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994, requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section.  The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena. They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required.&lt;ref name="MovingThreat"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moving never option, Doc Seaman claims |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-08-09 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds. At the same time, they rejected a counter proposal for applying a ticket surcharge to pay the cost.&lt;ref name="Herald1994deal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stelnhart |first=David |work=Calgary Herald |title=Council approves Saddledome deal |date=1994-03-22 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports claimed the team was considering relocating out of Calgary if council did not agree. Flames' owners denied the reports, but said they had threatened to build a new rink elsewhere in the city.&lt;ref name="MovingThreat" /&gt; City Council supported the Flames' proposal in a 9–6 vote following several months of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Megrath |first=Vickie |last2=Miller |first2=Mark |title=Council OK's 'Dome deal |work=Calgary Sun |date=1994-03-22 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl, an 1,172 seat club section, a new restaurant, expanded offices for the Flames, Saddledome management and [[Hockey Canada]], as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new parkade structure.&lt;ref name="DomeImprovement"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dome improvement |work=Calgary Sun |date=1994-03-20 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction, but was closed entirely between April and October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Monte |title=It's chaos, but the shows go on |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-08-10 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saddledome officially reopened on October 25, 1995 for the Flames' first home game of the [[1995–96 NHL season]].&lt;ref name="FlamesHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=40685 |title=Flames history |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its reopening, the Flames signed a deal with [[Canadian Airlines]] to rename the facility.  Under a twenty-year agreement worth approximately $1 million per year, the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome. Removing the "Olympic" moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council, though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dolik |first=Helen |title=Deal made to rename 'Dome |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-07-19 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by [[Air Canada]] and ceased operations. [[Pengrowth Energy Trust|Pengrowth Management Ltd.]] signed a ten-year agreement that gave the facility the name Pengrowth Saddledome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.canoe.ca/HockeyCalgaryArchive/jun30_tha.html |title=That's the ticket! |work=Calgary Sun |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years. In 2004, the Flames spent $1 million on a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] "power ring" display that lines the facing of the second level. The [[JumboTron]] that was installed in 1995 was replaced in 2006 with a new [[High-definition video|high definition]] scoreboard.&lt;ref name="newScoreboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=58c4dfd1-dd93-408a-805d-479342340ac5&amp;k=76617 |title=Lights out for JumboTron |work=Calgary Herald |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604114553/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=58c4dfd1-dd93-408a-805d-479342340ac5&amp;k=76617 |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by [[Daktronics]], the display has twelve screens and two LED ribbons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx?photoID=WP-13088&amp;keywords=Saddledome&amp;filters= |title=Photo Gallery – Saddledome |publisher=Daktronics |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is called the [[Enmax]] Energy Board.&lt;ref name="newScoreboard" /&gt;

===2013 flood===
[[File:Saddledome flood seats.jpg|thumb|right|Flooding of the lower bowl reached the eighth row of seating.]]
The Saddledome was one of many buildings impacted by the [[2013 Alberta floods]]. The flooding of the [[Elbow River|Elbow]] and [[Bow River|Bow]] Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. The event level of the arena was filled with water, also wrecking the [[High-definition video|high definition]] scoreboard that had been sitting on the rink floor during the summer downtime, while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=425999 |title=Saddledome, Stampede Grounds hit by flooding in Alberta |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a "total loss". He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the [[2013–14 Calgary Flames season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/06/22/sp-nhl-calgary-flames-flooding-saddledome.html |title=Flames say lower part of Saddledome 'total loss' from flooding |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 [[Calgary Stampede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Kiss+Jepsen+McGraw+Dixie+Chicks+Saddledome+concerts/8607227/story.html |title=Kiss, Jepsen, Dixie Chicks, Saddledome concerts cancelled by Calgary Stampede |work=Calgary Herald |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crews worked around the clock to repair the facility; Saddledome director of building operations Robert Blanchard estimated that 650,000 man hours of work was performed on the facility and noted that they had compressed a six-month project into two. The facility was granted its occupancy permit in late August, and the first event following the Saddledome's reopening was an [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] concert on September 11. The first hockey game was September 14, a Flames pre-season contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=431244 |title=Saddledome prepares to host concerts, hockey after flood |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the Saddledome allowed Calgary to host major musical acts that were bypassing the city in the early 1980s, because the city's existing facilities were not large enough to accommodate the industry's top performers.&lt;ref name="BigActs"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCoy |first=Heath |title='Dome saddles up big acts |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-10-13 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saddledome has also been a host for PBR Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tyler Thomson |url=http://www.pbrcanada.com |title=Home |publisher=PBR Canada |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; events.

On October 3, 2016, the Saddledome hosted a [[National Basketball Association]] preseason game between the [[Toronto Raptors]] and [[Denver Nuggets]].

On July 21, 2012, the Saddledome hosted an [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] event, which is [[2012 in UFC#UFC 149: Faber vs. Barão|UFC 149]]. Six years later, on July 28, 2018, the Saddledome hosted another UFC event, which is [[UFC on Fox: Alvarez vs. Poirier 2]].

The arena was also the site of the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1990|1990 Liberal Party leadership convention]].

==Saddledome Foundation==
The City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50-years to the non-profit organization.  Its mandate was to "oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local, provincial and national level".&lt;ref name="DomeImprovement" /&gt; The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors: three appointed by the city, three appointed by the province, and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association (now [[Canadian Winter Sport Institute|WinSport Canada]]), Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/foundmain.html |title=Saddledome Foundation |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena, and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames, earned 15% of gross concession sales, 50% of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena's revenues.&lt;ref name="DomeImprovement" /&gt;  The Flames signed a 20-year lease in 1983 that earned them 70% of advertising revenues and 90% of ticket revenues.  The Stampede earned 85% of concession revenues and all revenue from parking.&lt;ref name="DomeImprovement" /&gt;

As part of the 1994 deal with the city, the Flames bought out the Stampede's contract for $20 million and took over management of the facility.&lt;ref name="Herald1994deal" /&gt; While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994–95 renovations, the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs, as well as any further renovations.&lt;ref name="DomeImprovement" /&gt;  The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $14.5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time.&lt;ref name="Herald1994deal" /&gt; The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport. From its inception through 2007, it had allocated over $20 million toward this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/pdf/AnnualReport2006_07.pdf |title=2005/2006 Board of Director's annual report |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL, fueling speculation that it is due to be replaced.&lt;ref name="Herald90412" /&gt; Only [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] are older than the Saddledome; however, both arenas underwent major renovations in the 2010s, and the [[New York Islanders]] are scheduled to move into a [[Belmont Park Arena|new arena]] in [[Elmont, New York]] in 2021. Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were "five to eight years away" creating the expectation that the team hoped to have a new arena built for when their lease was due to expire in 2014, but such plans never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sportak |first=Randy |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Sportak/2007/08/23/4440643-sun.html |title=Home sweet 'Dome no more? |work=Calgary Sun |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Team chairman [[N. Murray Edwards|Murray Edwards]] argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts are growing increasingly limited as the facility ages.  Along with Edwards, sports financial analysts also note that newer arenas generate far more revenue for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames.&lt;ref name="Herald90412" /&gt;

It is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary.&lt;ref name="Herald90412" /&gt; While NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support,&lt;ref name="Herald90412" /&gt; Calgary mayor [[Naheed Nenshi]] and [[alderman]] John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena.&lt;ref name="Maki_Walton"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/calgary-flames-keeping-a-low-profile-on-plans-to-replace-saddledome/article8146553/|title=Calgary Flames keeping a low profile on plans to replace Saddledome|author1=Allan Maki  |author2=Dawn Walton |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1 February 2013|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2 February 2013|location=Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Logan |first=Shawn |title=Timeline frozen for new arena |work=Calgary Sun |date=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but are not ready to release them.&lt;ref name="Herald25thP1" /&gt;  Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city's [[C-train]] [[light rail transit]] line below ground and run straight into a new facility.&lt;ref name="Herald90412" /&gt;

In 2015, Calgary Sports and Entertainment proposed [[CalgaryNEXT]]—a sports complex in the western downtown area that would feature a new arena and football stadium to replace the Saddledome and [[McMahon Stadium]].&lt;ref name="CHStampedePark"&gt;{{cite news |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |title=Flames' aspirations were just too big for Stampede Park |work=Calgary Herald |date=August 19, 2015 |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |page=A6 |url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/flames-aspirations-were-just-too-big-for-stampede-park-to-accommodate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was shot down by Calgary's city council in 2017, who voted to support a "plan B" of a new arena on a site adjacent to the existing Saddledome, which is currently used as a parking lot for the Stampede grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-council-plan-b-calgary-next-still-sleeping-1.4083787|title=CalgaryNext on life support as council votes unanimously in favour of 'Plan B' near Saddledome|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2017, Flames president [[Ken King (ice hockey)|Ken King]] stated that the team was no longer pursuing the arena, as "we've been working for a long time trying to come up with a formula that really works to replace this building and we really put our best foot forward and I’ve come to the conclusion sadly and I’m very disappointed that I don't think we can make a deal that works for us".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsn.ca/king-says-flames-are-no-longer-pursuing-new-arena-1.854741|title=King says Flames are no longer pursuing new arena|date=2017-09-12|work=TSN|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Naheed Nenshi]] subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of "plan B" would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges. King objected to this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-city-council-flames-negotiations-deal-1.4291316|title=Calgary Flames CEO says city's arena proposal would leave team footing full bill|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics alleged that the Flames had been trying to use the issue of a new arena to influence the [[Calgary municipal election, 2017|2017 municipal elections]], where Nenshi was elected for a third term as mayor of Calgary. King denied that this was the case, stating that "we did not raise this as an election issue: it became an election issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames-president-keeps-mum-on-dispute-over-new-arena/article36394415/|title=Calgary Flames president keeps mum on dispute over new arena|date=2017-09-25|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/new-calgary-flames-arena-in-limbo-after-mayor-s-re-election-1.3636787|title=New Calgary Flames arena in limbo after mayor's re-election|last=Spencer|first=Donna|date=2017-10-17|agency=Canadian Press|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zeltbahn bundeswehr.png|thumb|Schematics of a German Bundeswehr shelter half ("Zeltbahn")]]
[[File:Pup Tent at Fort Benning-Overstreet.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army pup tent in World War II, made with two shelter halves]]
A '''shelter-half''' ([[UK]], [[Australia]], and [[United States]];  the German equivalent, dating from before the Second World War, being the '''[Dreiecks]Zeltbahn''' or triangle tarpaulin), is a simple kind of partial [[tent]] designed to provide temporary [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] and concealment when combined with one or more sections. Two sheets of canvas or a similar material (the halves) are fastened together with snaps, straps or buttons to form a larger surface. The shelter-half is then erected using poles, ropes, pegs, and whatever tools are on hand, forming an inverted V structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.outdoorhistory.com/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/5176/FM15-85CareAndUseIndividualClothingEquipment1985.pdf Care And Use of Individual Clothing and Equipment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031184238/http://mobile.outdoorhistory.com/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/5176/FM15-85CareAndUseIndividualClothingEquipment1985.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }}, US Army File Manual FM15-85, 1985, pp. 3-4ff&lt;/ref&gt; Small tents like these are often called '''pup tents'''" in [[American English]].

Shelter halves are a mainstay of most armies, and are known from the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tent, Shelter Half (Pup Tent)|url=http://olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_shelter_half.php|publisher=Olive-Drab|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, each soldier carries one shelter-half and half the poles, etc., and they pair off to erect a two-man tent. The size and shape of each half shelter piece may vary from army to army, but are typically rectangular, triangular or [[Rhombus|lozenge]] shaped. When time and space allow, some forms of half-shelters can be combined into a larger, more complex tent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interesting gear: The Zeltbahn shelter-quarter|url=http://oblio13.blogspot.no/2008/09/interesting-gear-zeltbahn-shelter.html|work=Philosophizing with a Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelter-halves are usually designed to serve double duty as [[ponchos]] against the rain, or for the concealment of [[snipers]]. While the fabric is often simple [[olive drab]], several nations use camouflaged fabric. The first printed camouflage for soldiers were the Italian ''[[Telo mimetico]]'' introduced in 1929 for their half-shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=B.|title=Italian three-colour camouflage (2nd pattern)|url=http://www.kamouflage.net/camouflage/00295.php|publisher=Kamouflage.net|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first camouflage uniforms were the Second World War German paratrooper smock, based on their M1931 [[Splittermuster]] shelter-halves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Brian L.|title=German Army uniforms and insignia : 1933 - 1945|year=1998|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-86019-869-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Army has used ''Plasch-palatkas'' (literally "cape-tents", designed to be used as both a part of a larger tent cover, or an individual weatherproof cape) since 1894,&lt;ref name=Ulianov&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulianov|first=I.|title=History of Russian Army: Regular Infantry 1885-1918|year=1998|publisher=AST|location=Moscow|isbn=5-15-000508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern version, virtually unchanged since, was introduced in 1936,&lt;ref name=Burdin&gt;Col. S.Burdin, "The Rear and Supplies of the [[Red Army]]" #9, 1942, in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; with the camo version being available since 1942.&lt;ref name=Burdin /&gt; To add some confusion, the ordinary waterproofed cape with a similar name (plasch-nakidka, "cape-overcoat") was issued at the same time, but these weren't intended to combine with each other.&lt;ref name=Ulianov /&gt;
