The '''Belfast City and District Water Commissioners''' was a public body in northern Ireland, established by the [[Belfast Water Act 1840]], to improve the supply of water to the expanding city of Belfast. By 1852, the city was suffering a shortfall in supply of almost one million gallons per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earc.org.uk/ShortHistoryofBelfastWaterSupply.htm Short History of Belfast’s Mourne Water Supply.] William R Darby, EARC, 2 November 2010.

The commissioners were responsible from 1914 for the construction of the [[Mourne Wall]] which [[Northern Ireland Water]] began to restore in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/113-years-on-work-begins-to-repair-the-wonder-wall-of-the-mournes-35734916.html 113 years on, work begins to repair the wonder wall of the Mournes.] Allan Preston, ''Belfast Telegraph'', 20 May 2017.

'''Builder's Old Measurement''' ('''BOM''', '''bm''', '''OM''', and '''o.m.''') is the method used in England from approximately 1650 to 1849 for calculating the [[cargo]] capacity of a [[ship]].  It is a volumetric measurement of cubic capacity. It estimated the [[tonnage]] of a ship based on length and maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]]. It is expressed in "tons '''burden'''" ({{lang-en-em | '''burthen''' }}, {{lang-enm | '''byrthen''' }}), and abbreviated "tons bm".

The formula is:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Tonnage} = \frac {(\text{Length}- (\text{Beam}\times\frac{3} {5})) \times \text{Beam} \times \frac {\text{Beam}}{2}} {94}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Length'' is the length, in [[foot (length)|feet]], from the [[stem (ship)|stem]] to the [[sternpost]];
* ''[[Beam (nautical)|Beam]]'' is the maximum beam, in feet.&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 0-19-211553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Builder's Old Measurement formula remained in effect until the advent of steam propulsion. Steamships required a different method of estimating tonnage, because the ratio of length to beam was larger and a significant volume of internal space was used for boilers and machinery. In 1849, the [[Moorsom System]] was created in [[Great Britain]]. The Moorsom system calculates the cargo-carrying capacity in cubic feet, another method of volumetric measurement. The capacity in cubic feet is then divided by 100 cubic feet of capacity per gross ton, resulting in a tonnage expressed in tons.

==History and derivation==
King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] levied the first tax on the hire of ships in England in 1303 based on tons burthen. Later, King [[Edward III]] levied a tax of 3 shillings on each "[[tun (unit)|tun]]" of imported wine, equal to £{{Inflation|UK|0.15|1377|r=2}} today (using the last year of Edward III's reign, 1377, as the base year). At that time a "tun" was a wine container of 252 gallons weighing about {{convert|2240|lb|abbr=on}}, a weight known today as a [[long ton]] or imperial ton. In order to estimate the capacity of a ship in terms of 'tun' for tax purposes, an early formula used in England was:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Tonnage} = \frac {\text{Length}\times \text{Beam} \times \text{Depth}} {100}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Length'' is the length (undefined), in [[foot (length)|feet]]
* ''Beam'' is the [[beam (nautical)|beam]], in feet.
* ''Depth'' is the depth of the hold, in feet below the main deck.
The numerator yields the ship's volume expressed in cubic feet.

If a "tun" is deemed to be equivalent to 100 cubic feet, then the tonnage is simply the number of such 100 cubic feet 'tun' units of volume.

* ''100'' the divisor is unitless, so tonnage would be expressed in 'ft³ of tun'.&lt;ref name = Kemp/&gt;

In 1678 Thames shipbuilders used a method assuming that a ship's burden would be 3/5 of its displacement. Since tonnage is calculated by multiplying length &amp;times; beam &amp;times; draft &amp;times; [[Block coefficient#Metrics|block coefficient]], all divided by 35&amp;nbsp;ft³ per ton of seawater, the resulting formula would be:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Tonnage} = \frac {\text{Length}\times \text{Beam} \times \frac {\text{Beam}}{2} \times \frac {3}{5}\times {0.62}} {35} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Draft'' is estimated to be half of the beam.
* ''Block coefficient'' is based on an assumed average of 0.62.
* ''35 ft³'' is the volume of one ton of sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Or by solving :

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Tonnage} = \frac {\text{Length}\times\text{Beam} \times \frac \text{Beam}{2}} {94} &lt;/math&gt;

In 1694 a new British law required that tonnage for tax purposes be calculated according to a similar formula:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Tonnage} = \frac {\text{Length}\times\text{Beam} \times \text{Depth}} {94}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula remained in effect until the Builder's Old Measurement rule was put into use in 1720, and then mandated by Act of Parliament in 1773.

==American tons burthen==&lt;!-- Please do not alter this section heading; it is directly linked from multiple articles --&gt;
The British took the length measurement from the outside of the stem to the outside of the sternpost; the Americans measured from inside the posts. The British measured breadth from outside the planks, whereas the American measured the breadth from inside the planks. Lastly, the British divided by 94, whereas the Americans divided by 95.

The upshot was that American calculations gave a lower number than the British. For instance, when the British measured the captured {{USS|President|1800|6}}, their calculations gave her a burthen of 1533&lt;small&gt;{{frac|7|94}}&lt;/small&gt; tons, whereas the American calculations gave the burthen as 1444 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, James, CBE (1994) ''The Frigates: An account of the lighter warships of the Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815''. (London:Leo Cooper), p.167. {{ISBN|0-85052-432-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British measure yields values about 6% greater than the American.

The US system was in use from 1789 until 1864, when a modified version of the Moorsom System was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Essex |first2=Craig S. |last2=Mork |last3=Pomeroy |first3=Craig A. |title=An Owner's Guide to Tonnage Admeasurement 1998-2003 |website=Jensen Maritime Consultants, Inc. |date= |url=http://www.jensenmaritime.com/content/download/7782/49839/file/Guide%20to%20Tonnage.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2014-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon dioxide''' ([[chemical formula]] '''{{CO2}}''') is a colorless [[gas]] with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air.  Carbon dioxide consists of a [[carbon]] [[atom]] [[covalent bond|covalently]] [[double bond]]ed to two [[oxygen]] atoms. It occurs naturally in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] as a [[trace gas]]. The current concentration is about 0.04% (410&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280&amp;nbsp;ppm.  Natural sources include [[volcano]]es, [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s, and it is freed from [[carbonate rock]]s by [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in [[groundwater]], [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s and [[seawater]]. It is present in deposits of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations. However, at high concentrations, it has a sharp and acidic odor.&lt;ref name=AirProductsMSDS/&gt;

As the source of available carbon in the [[carbon cycle]], [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] is the primary carbon source for [[life|life on Earth]] and its concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the [[Precambrian]] has been regulated by [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms and geological phenomena. [[Plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] use [[light]] [[energy]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] [[carbohydrate]] from carbon dioxide and water, with oxygen produced as a waste product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald G. |last1=Kaufman |first2=Cecilia M. |last2=Franz |title=Biosphere 2000: protecting our global environment |year=1996 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub.

{{CO2}} is produced by all [[aerobic organisms]] when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyproject.org/activities/foodfactories.html |title=Food Factories |website=www.legacyproject.org |access-date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is returned to water via the [[Fish respiration|gills of fish]] and to the air via the lungs of air-breathing land animals, including humans. Carbon dioxide is produced during the processes of [[decomposition|decay]] of organic materials and the [[fermentation]] of sugars in [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]] making. It is produced by combustion of [[wood]] and other organic materials and [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. It is an unwanted byproduct in many large scale [[oxidation]] processes, for example, in the production of [[acrylic acid]] (over 5 million tons/year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Lénárd-István Csepei |title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts |date=2011 |publisher=Technical University of Berlin |url=https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/3269/1/Dokument_8.pdf |degree=PHD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid |journal=Journal of Catalysis |date=2012 |volume=285 |pages=48–60 |first1=M. |last1=Hävecker |first2=S. |last2=Wrabetz |first3=J. |last3=Kröhnert |first4=L.-I. |last4=Csepei |first5=R. |last5=Naumann d’Alnoncourt |first6=Y.V. |last6=Kolen’ko |first7=F. |last7=Girgsdies |first8=R. |last8=Schlögl |first9=A. |last9=Trunschke |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol |journal=ACS Catalysis |date=2013 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1103–1113 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177 |last1=Amakawa |first1=Kazuhiko |last2=Kolen'ko |first2=Yury V. |last3=Villa |first3=Alberto |last4=Schuster |first4=Manfred Erwin |last5=Csepei |first5=Lenard-Istvan |last6=Weinberg |first6=Gisela |last7=Wrabetz |first7=Sabine |last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt |first8=Raoul |last9=Girgsdies |first9=Frank |last10=Prati |first10=Laura |last11=Schloegl |first11=Robert |last12=Trunschke |first12=Annette |doi=10.1021/cs400010q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts |journal=Journal of Catalysis |volume=311 |pages=369–385 |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf |first1=Raoul |last1=Naumann d’Alnoncourt |first2=Lénárd-István |last2=Csepei |first3=Michael |last3=Hävecker |first4=Frank |last4=Girgsdies |first5=Manfred E. |last5=Schuster |first6=Robert |last6=Schlögl |first7=Annette |last7=Trunschke |doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|year=2014 |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a versatile industrial material, used, for example, as an inert gas in welding and [[fire extinguishers]], as a pressurizing gas in air guns and oil recovery, as a chemical feedstock and as a supercritical fluid solvent in decaffeination of coffee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Supercritical Fluid Extraction |authors=G.N.

It is added to drinking water and [[carbonated beverage]]s including [[beer]] and [[sparkling wine]] to add [[effervescence]]. The frozen solid form of {{CO2}}, known as ''[[dry ice]]'' is used as a refrigerant and as an abrasive in [[dry-ice blasting]].

Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived [[greenhouse gas]] in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|Earth's atmosphere]]. Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and [[deforestation]] – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to [[global warming]].  Carbon dioxide also causes [[ocean acidification]] because it dissolves in water to form [[carbonic acid]].&lt;ref name=NRC2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Ocean Acidification: A National Strategy to Meet the Challenges of a Changing Ocean |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12904/ocean-acidification-a-national-strategy-to-meet-the-challenges-of |isbn=978-0-309-15359-1 |doi=10.17226/12904 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC|date=2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Carbon-dioxide-crystal-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|upright|Crystal structure of [[dry ice]]]]
Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance. In about 1640,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673600524209 | title=The Pioneer in the Hygiene of Ventilation | author=DavidFraser Harris | journal=The Lancet |date=September 1910  | volume=176 | issue=4542 | pages=906–908 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)52420-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] observed that when he burned [[charcoal]] in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a "gas" or "wild spirit" (''spiritus sylvestris'').&lt;ref&gt;Almqvist, Ebbe  (2003). ''History of [[industrial gas]]es''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0306472770}}. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the 1750s by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician [[Joseph Black]]. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with [[acid]]s to yield a gas he called "fixed air." He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through [[limewater]] (a saturated aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]), it would [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] published a paper entitled ''Impregnating Water with Fixed Air'' in which he described a process of dripping [[sulfuric acid]] (or ''oil of vitriol'' as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Joseph|last = Priestley|authorlink = Joseph Priestley|title = Observations on Different Kinds of Air|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 62|year = 1772|pages = 147–264|url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/priestley.html|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1772.0021|last2 =Hey|first2 = Wm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by [[Humphry Davy]] and [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Humphry|last = Davy|authorlink = Humphry Davy|title = On the Application of Liquids Formed by the Condensation of Gases as Mechanical Agents|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-107649|jstor=107649|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 113|year = 1823|pages = 199–205|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1823.0020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by [[Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier]], who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a "snow" of solid {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thilorier | first1 = Adrien-Jean-Pierre | year = 1835 | title = Solidification de l'Acide carbonique | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29606/f194.item | journal = Comptes Rendus | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 194–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1836 | title = Solidification of carbonic acid | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4GwqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA446 | journal = The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine | volume = 8 | issue = 48| pages = 446–447 | doi=10.1080/14786443608648911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure and bonding ===
{{See also|Molecular orbital diagram#Carbon dioxide}}
The carbon dioxide molecule is linear and [[centrosymmetric]]. The [[carbon–oxygen bond]] length is 116.3&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], noticeably shorter than the [[bond length]] of a C–O single bond and even shorter than most other C–O multiply-bonded functional groups.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Since it is centrosymmetric, the molecule has no electrical [[dipole]]. Consequently, only two vibrational bands are observed in the [[IR spectrum]] – an antisymmetric stretching mode at 2349&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] pair of bending modes at 667&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. There is also a symmetric stretching mode at 1388&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; which is only observed in the [[Raman spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J. ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006) pp. 461, 464 {{ISBN|0716787598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In aqueous solution ===
{{See also|Carbonic acid}}
Carbon dioxide is [[soluble]] in water, in which it reversibly forms {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} ([[carbonic acid]]), which is a [[Acid strength|weak acid]] since its ionization in water is incomplete.
:{{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|CO|3}}

The [[Henry's law|hydration equilibrium constant]] of carbonic acid is &lt;math&gt;K_{\mathrm h}=\frac{\rm{[H_2CO_3]}}{\rm{[CO_2(aq)]}}=1.70\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; (at 25&amp;nbsp;°C). Hence, the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid, but remains as {{CO2}} molecules, not affecting the pH.

The relative concentrations of {{chem|CO|2|, H|2|CO|3}}, and the [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] forms {{chem|HCO|3|−}} ([[bicarbonate]]) and {{chem|CO|3|2−}}([[carbonate]]) depend on the [[pH]]. As shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]], in neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater. In very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4), the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The oceans, being mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2–8.5, contain about 120&amp;nbsp;mg of bicarbonate per liter.

Being [[diprotic acid|diprotic]], carbonic acid has two [[acid dissociation constant]]s, the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate (also called hydrogen carbonate) ion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;):

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|2.5|e=-4|u=mol/litre}}; p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.6 at 25 °C.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the ''true'' first acid dissociation constant, defined as &lt;math&gt;K_{a1}=\frac{\rm{[HCO_3^-] [H^+]}}{\rm{[H_2CO_3]}}&lt;/math&gt;, where the denominator includes only covalently bound H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and does not include hydrated {{CO2}}(aq). The much smaller and often-quoted value near {{val|4.16|e=-7}} is an ''apparent'' value calculated on the (incorrect) assumption that all dissolved {{CO2}} is present as carbonic acid, so that &lt;math&gt;K_{\mathrm{a1}}{\rm{(apparent)}}=\frac{\rm{[HCO_3^-] [H^+]}}{\rm{[H_2CO_3] + [CO_2(aq)]}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since most of the dissolved {{CO2}} remains as {{CO2}} molecules, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;(apparent) has a much larger denominator and a much smaller value than the true ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, William L., ''Modern Inorganic Chemistry'' (McGraw-Hill 1984), p. 196 {{ISBN|0-07-032760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bicarbonate]] ion is an [[amphoteric]] species that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH of the solution. At high [[pH]], it dissociates significantly into the [[carbonate]] ion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;):
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|4.69|e=-11|u=mol/litre}}; p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.329

In organisms carbonic acid production is catalysed by the [[enzyme]], [[carbonic anhydrase]].

=== Chemical reactions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
{{CO2}} is a weak [[electrophile]]. Its reaction with basic water illustrates this property, in which case [[hydroxide]] is the [[nucleophile]]. Other nucleophiles react as well. For example, [[carbanion]]s as provided by  [[Grignard reagent]]s and [[organolithium compound]]s react with {{CO2}} to give [[carboxylate]]s:
:MR  +  {{CO2}}   →   R{{CO2}}M
:where M = [[Lithium|Li]] or [[Magnesium|Mg]][[Bromine|Br]] and R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]].

In [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es, {{CO2}} serves as a [[ligand]], which can facilitate the conversion of {{CO2}} to other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aresta (Ed.) "Carbon Dioxide as a Chemical Feedstock" 2010, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3527324750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction of {{CO2}} to [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction:
:{{CO2}} +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[Photoautotrophs]] (i.e. plants and [[cyanobacteria]]) use the energy contained in sunlight to [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] simple sugars from {{CO2}} absorbed from the air and water:
: ''n'' {{CO2}} + ''n'' {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|(CH|2|O)|''n''}} + ''n'' {{chem|O|2}}

The [[redox potential]] for this reaction near pH 7 is about −0.53 V ''versus'' the [[standard hydrogen electrode]]. The nickel-containing enzyme [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]] catalyses this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Finn | first1 = Colin | last2 = Schnittger | first2 = Sorcha | last3 = Yellowlees | first3 = Lesley J. | last4 = Love | first4 = Jason B. | title = Molecular approaches to the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide | journal = Chemical Communications | volume =  48| issue = 10| pages = 1392–1399 | doi = 10.1039/c1cc15393e | year = 2012 | pmid=22116300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical properties ===
{{details|Carbon dioxide data}}
[[File:Dry Ice Pellets Subliming.jpg|right|thumb|Pellets of "dry ice", a common form of solid carbon dioxide]]
Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations the gas is odorless; however, at sufficiently-high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor.&lt;ref name=AirProductsMSDS&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Dioxide |website=Air Products |url=http://www.airproducts.com/~/media/Files/PDF/company/product-summary-carbon-dioxide.pdf?la=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 1.67 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]].

Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below {{convert|5.1|atm|lk=in}}. At 1 atmosphere (near mean sea level pressure), the gas [[deposition (physics)|deposits]] directly to a solid at temperatures below {{convert|-78.5|C|F K}} and the solid [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] directly to a gas above −78.5&amp;nbsp;°C. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called [[dry ice]].

[[File:Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram.svg|right|thumb|Pressure–temperature [[phase diagram]] of carbon dioxide]]

Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at [[pressure]]s above 5.1 atm; the [[triple point]] of carbon dioxide is about 5.1 [[bar (unit)|bar]] (517 [[kPa]]) at 217&amp;nbsp;K (see phase diagram). The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is 7.38 MPa at 31.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase|title=Phase change data for Carbon dioxide|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kudryavtseva I.V., Kamotskii V.I., Rykov S.V., Rykov V.A., [http://processes.ihbt.ifmo.ru/en/article/10734/Calculation_carbon_dioxide_line_of_phase_equilibrium.htm "Calculation Carbon Dioxide Line of Phase Equilibrium"], Processes and equipment for food production, Number 4(18), 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an [[amorphous]] glass-like solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santoro|first=M.|year=2006|title=Amorphous silica-like carbon dioxide|journal=Nature|volume=441|pages=857–860|doi=10.1038/nature04879|pmid=16778885| last2=Gorelli|first2=FA|last3=Bini|first3=R|last4= Ruocco|first4=G|last5=Scandolo|first5=S|last6=Crichton|first6=WA|issue=7095|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..857S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of glass, called ''[[amorphous carbonia|carbonia]]'', is produced by [[supercooling]] heated {{CO2}} at extreme pressure (40–48 [[GPa]] or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a [[diamond anvil]]. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like [[silicon]] ([[silica|silica glass]]) and [[germanium dioxide]]. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released.

At temperatures and pressures above the critical point, carbon dioxide behaves as a [[supercritical fluid]] known as [[supercritical carbon dioxide]].  In this state it is starting (as of 2018) to be used for [[Supercritical_carbon_dioxide#Power_generation|power generation]].

== Isolation and production ==

Carbon dioxide can be obtained by [[distillation]] from air, but the method is inefficient. Industrially, carbon dioxide is predominantly an unrecovered waste product, produced by several methods which may be practiced at various scales.&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|first = Ronald|last = Pierantozzi|encyclopedia = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher = Wiley|year = 2001|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.0301180216090518.a01.pub2|chapter = Carbon Dioxide|isbn =978-0471238966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[combustion]] of all [[carbon-based fuel]]s, such as [[methane]] ([[natural gas]]), petroleum distillates ([[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[kerosene]], [[propane]]), coal, wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and, except in the case of pure carbon, water. As an example, the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen:
: {{chem|CH|4| + 2 O|2| → CO|2| + 2 H|2|O}}

It is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone, {{chem|CaCO|3}} by heating ([[calcining]]) at about {{convert|850|C}}, in the manufacture of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] ([[calcium oxide]], {{chem|CaO}}), a compound that has many industrial uses:

Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by [[steam reforming]] and the [[water gas shift reaction]] in [[ammonia production]]. These processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas (mainly methane).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham  "Carbon Dioxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major source of food-grade carbon dioxide for use in carbonation of [[beer]] and [[soft drink]]s, and is also used for stunning animals such as [[poultry]]. In the summer of 2018 a shortage of carbon dioxide for these purposes arose in Europe due to the temporary shut-down of several ammonia plants for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CO2 shortage: Food industry calls for government action |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44559669 |agency=BBC |date=Jun 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acids liberate {{CO2}} from most metal carbonates. Consequently, it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], where it is produced by the action of acidified water on [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]. The reaction between [[hydrochloric acid]] and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is shown below:
:{{chem|CaCO|3| + 2 HCl → CaCl|2| + H|2|CO|3}}
The [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|CO|3}}) then decomposes to water and {{CO2}}:
:{{chem|H|2|CO|3| → CO|2| + H|2|O}}
Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both, as the gas is released. They have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams.

Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] in the [[brewing]] of [[beer]], [[whisky]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s and in the production of [[bioethanol]].
[[Yeast]] metabolizes [[sugar]] to produce {{CO2}} and [[ethanol]], also known as alcohol, as follows:
: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → {{chem|2 CO|2| + 2 C|2|H|5|OH}}

All [[cellular respiration|aerobic]] organisms produce {{CO2}} when they oxidize [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and proteins. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to ([[cellular respiration]], [[anaerobic respiration]] and [[photosynthesis]]). The equation for the respiration of glucose and other [[monosaccharide]]s is:

[[Anaerobic organisms]] decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Collecting and using biogas from landfills |publisher= U.S. Energy Information Administration |url= http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=biomass_biogas |date=January 11, 2017 |access-date= 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the type of organic material, the production of gases follows well defined [[chemical kinetics|kinetic pattern]]. Carbon dioxide comprises about 40–45% of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills (termed "[[landfill gas]]"). Most of the remaining 50–55% is methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Landfill Gas |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/benviron/waste/central/lfgfact.pdf |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="kirk" /&gt;
The compound has varied commercial uses but one of its greatest use as a chemical is in the production of carbonated beverages; it provides the sparkle in carbonated beverages such as soda water, beer and sparkling wine.

=== Precursor to chemicals ===
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of [[urea]], with a smaller fraction being used to produce [[methanol]] and a range of other products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter7.pdf|title=IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as metal [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as [[sodium salicylate]] are prepared using {{CO2}} by the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.T.

In addition to conventional processes using {{CO2}} for chemical production, electrochemical methods are also being explored at a research level. In particular, the use of renewable energy for production of fuels from {{CO2}} (such as methanol) is attractive as this could result in fuels that could be easily transported and used within conventional combustion technologies but have no net {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.

=== Foods ===
[[File:Soda bubbles macro.jpg|thumb|Carbon dioxide bubbles in a soft drink.]]
Carbon dioxide is a [[food additive]] used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry. It is approved for usage in the EU&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed as [[E number]] E290), US&lt;ref&gt;US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm091048.htm |title=Food Additive Status List |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed by its INS number 290).

A candy called [[Pop Rocks]] is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0XeSJLflq90C&amp;pg=PA7-IA3&amp;dq=Pop+Rocks+is+pressurized+with+carbon+dioxide+gas#v=onepage&amp;q=Pop%20Rocks%20is%20pressurized%20with%20carbon%20dioxide%20gas&amp;f=false|title=Futurific Leading Indicators Magazine Volume 1|publisher=CRAES LLC|isbn=978-0984767014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at about 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (40 bar, 580 psi). When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop.

[[Leavening agent]]s cause dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=Leavening+agents+cause+dough+to+rise+by+producing+carbon+dioxide#v=onepage&amp;q=Leavening%20agents%20cause%20dough%20to%20rise%20by%20producing%20carbon%20dioxide&amp;f=false|title=Indian Breads: A Comprehensive Guide to Traditional and Innovative Indian Breads|last=Vijay|first=G.

==== Beverages ====
Carbon dioxide is used to produce [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]]s and [[soda water]]. Traditionally, the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British [[Real Ale]], draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen.

==== Wine making ====
[[File:Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.jpg|thumb|Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.]]
Carbon dioxide in the form of [[dry ice]] is often used during the [[cold soak]] phase in [[wine making]] to cool clusters of [[grape]]s quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] by wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the [[sugar]] concentration in the [[grape must]], and thus the [[alcohol]] concentration in the finished wine. Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for [[carbonic maceration]], the process used to produce [[Beaujolais]] wine.

Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other [[storage (wine)|storage]] vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] are preferred for this process by professional wine makers.

====Stunning animals====
Carbon dioxide is often used to "stun" animals before slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andy Coghlan |title=A more humane way of slaughtering chickens might get EU approval |journal=New Scientist |date=Feb 3, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2159895-a-more-humane-way-of-slaughtering-chickens-might-get-eu-approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stunning" may be a misnomer, as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409003755/http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|title=What is CO2 stunning?|publisher=RSPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archie Campbell |title=Humane execution and the fear of the tumbril |journal=New Scientist |date=Mar 10, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23731680-900-humane-execution-and-the-fear-of-the-tumbril-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inert gas ===
It is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for [[welding]], although in the welding arc, it reacts to [[oxidation|oxidize]] most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more [[brittle]] than those made in more inert atmospheres. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as [[argon]] or [[helium]].{{citation needed|reason=why not use nitrogen?|date=July 2015}}  When used for [[MIG welding]], {{CO2}} use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as {{CO2}} can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.

It is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in [[supercritical drying]] of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and in the [[decaffeination]] of [[coffee]] beans.

=== Fire extinguisher ===
[[File:US Army 53023 Fire Prevention Week.jpg|thumb|Use of a {{CO2}} fire extinguisher.]]
Carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.&lt;ref&gt;National Fire Protection Association Code 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as solvent ===
{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}

Liquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]]. Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s. It is used by some [[dry cleaning|dry cleaners]] for this reason (see [[green chemistry]]). It is used in the preparation of some [[Aerogel#Production|aerogels]] because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide.

=== Agricultural and biological applications ===
Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct [[photosynthesis]]. The atmospheres of greenhouses may (if of large size, must) be enriched with additional {{CO2}} to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/141.html |title=Plant Growth Factors: Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Transpiration |website=CMG GardenNotes |first1=David |last1=Whiting |first2=Michael |last2=Roll |first3=Larry |last3=Vickerman |publisher=Colorado Master Gardener Program |date=August 2010 |access-date=2011-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902192633/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/141.html |archive-date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/nature/node21.html |chapter=Carbon dioxide |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/nature/nature.html |title=How Much Land Can Ten Billion People Spare for Nature? |first=Paul E. |last=Waggoner |date=February 1994 |access-date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as [[whitefly|whiteflies]] and [[spider mite]]s in a greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stafford, Ned |title=Future crops: The other greenhouse effect |journal=Nature |volume=448 |date=7 February 2007 |doi=10.1038/448526a |pmid=17671477 |issue=7153 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..526S |pages=526–528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that {{CO2}} from power generation be bubbled into ponds to stimulate growth of algae that could then be converted into [[biodiesel]] fuel.&lt;ref name="csmon"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Clayton|title=Algae – like a breath mint for smokestacks|date=2006-01-11| url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0111/p01s03-sten.html|work =[[The Christian Science Monitor]]| accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical and pharmacological uses ===
In medicine, up to 5% carbon dioxide (130 times atmospheric concentration) is added to [[oxygen]] for stimulation of breathing after [[apnea]] and to stabilize the {{chem|O|2|/CO|2}} balance in blood.

Carbon dioxide can be mixed with up to 50% oxygen, forming an inhalable gas; this is known as [[Carbogen]] and has a variety of medical and research uses.

=== Oil recovery ===
Carbon dioxide is used in [[enhanced oil recovery]] where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] conditions, when it becomes [[miscibility|miscible]] with the oil. This approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by between 7% to 23% additional to [[Extraction of petroleum#Primary recovery|primary extraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=20 Dec 2011 |url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide |chapter-url=http://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/appendix-co2-use |title=Accelerating the uptake of CCS: industrial use of captured carbon dioxide |chapter=Appendix A: {{CO2}} for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) |website=Global CCS Institute |access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground [[crude oil]], significantly reduces its viscosity, and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austell |first=J Michael |year=2005 |title={{CO2}} for Enhanced Oil Recovery Needs – Enhanced Fiscal Incentives |journal=Exploration &amp; Production: The Oil &amp; Gas Review |url=http://www.touchoilandgas.com/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207071349/http://www.touchoilandgas.com/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-1.html |archivedate=2012-02-07 |accessdate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mature oil fields, extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points.

{{main|Carbon capture and utilization}}
A strain of the [[cyanobacterium]] ''[[Synechococcus|Synechococcus elongatus]]'' has been genetically engineered to produce the fuels [[isobutyraldehyde]] and [[isobutanol]] from {{CO2}} using photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v27/n12/abs/nbt.1586.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=27|pages=1177–1180|date=November 2009|author1=Atsum, Shota |author2=Higashide, Wendy |author3=Liauo, James C.|doi=10.1038/nbt.1586|pmid=19915552|title=Direct photosynthetic recycling of carbon dioxide to isobutyraldehyde|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerant ===
[[File:Comparison carbon dioxide water phase diagrams.svg|thumb|upright=2|Comparison of phase diagrams of carbon dioxide (red) and water (blue) as a log-lin chart with phase transitions points at 1 atmosphere]]
Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important [[refrigerant]]s, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called "dry ice" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below −78.5&amp;nbsp;°C at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.

{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50°, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a. Its environmental advantages ([[Global warming potential|GWP]] of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, and heat pump water heaters, among others. [[Coca-Cola]] has fielded {{CO2}}-based beverage coolers and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is interested in {{CO2}} refrigeration and heating technology.&lt;ref name="ccref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/cooling-equipment-pushing-forward-with-hfc-free |title=The Coca-Cola Company Announces Adoption of HFC-Free Insulation in Refrigeration Units to Combat Global Warming |accessdate=2007-10-11 |date=2006-06-05 |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usforces"&gt;{{cite news|title = Modine reinforces its {{CO2}} research efforts|url = http://www.r744.com/news/news_ida145.php|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080210194203/http://www.r744.com/news/news_ida145.php|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2008-02-10|date = 2007-06-28|publisher = R744.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global automobile industry is expected to decide on the next-generation refrigerant in car air conditioning. {{CO2}} is one discussed option.(see [[Sustainable automotive air conditioning]])

=== Coal bed methane recovery ===
In [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]], carbon dioxide would be pumped into the coal seam to displace methane, as opposed to current methods which primarily rely on the removal of water (to reduce pressure) to make the coal seam release its trapped methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |title=Enhanced coal bed methane recovery |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2006-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706232006/http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor uses ===
[[File:Carbon Dioxide Laser At The Laser Effects Test Facility.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|A [[carbon dioxide laser]].]]
Carbon dioxide is the [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in a [[carbon dioxide laser]], which is one of the earliest type of lasers.

Carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the [[pH]] of swimming pools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IWpWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C2%A0%C2%A0Carbon+dioxide+can+be+used+as+a+means+of+controlling+the+pH+of+swimming+pool&amp;dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0Carbon+dioxide+can+be+used+as+a+means+of+controlling+the+pH+of+swimming+pool|title=TCE, the Chemical Engineer|date=1990|publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by continuously adding gas to the water, thus keeping the pH from rising. Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling (more hazardous) acids. Similarly, it is also used in the maintaining [[Reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], where it is commonly used in [[calcium reactor]]s to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over [[calcium carbonate]] in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely where it is used by some [[coral]]s to build their skeleton.

Used as the primary coolant in the British [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] for nuclear power generation.

Carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals. Methods to administer {{CO2}} include placing animals directly into a closed, prefilled chamber containing {{CO2}}, or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of {{CO2}}. In 2013, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] issued new guidelines for carbon dioxide induction, stating that a displacement rate of 10% to 30% of the [[gas chamber]] volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanization of small rodents.&lt;ref name="2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/policies/documents/euthanasia.pdf |title=2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is opposition to the practice of using carbon dioxide for this, on the grounds that it is cruel.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;

Carbon dioxide is also used in several related [[carbon dioxide cleaning|cleaning and surface preparation]] techniques.

While transparent to [[visible light]], carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing and emitting infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies (see the section "Structure and bonding" above).

Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric carbon dioxide traps energy near the surface, warming the surface and the lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.&lt;ref name="ucar_co2_absorb_IR"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scied.ucar.edu/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation | title=Carbon Dioxide Absorbs and Re-emits Infrared Radiation | publisher=UCAR Center for Science Education | date= 2012 | accessdate=2017-09-09| author=UCAR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="know_co2_climate"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=35 | title=How do we know more CO2 is causing warming? | publisher=Skeptical Science | date=July 2015 | accessdate=2017-09-09 | author=dana1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in atmospheric concentrations of {{CO2}} and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.

Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). There is about fifty times as much carbon dissolved in the oceans as exists in the atmosphere. The oceans act as an enormous [[carbon sink]], and have taken up about a third of {{CO2}} emitted by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doney |first=Scott C. |first2=Naomi M. |last2=Levine |title= How Long Can the Ocean Slow Global Warming? |publisher= Oceanus |date= 2006-11-29|url= http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=17726 |accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, the increased uptake of carbon dioxide into the oceans is causing a measurable decrease in the pH of the oceans, which is referred to as [[ocean acidification]]. This reduction in pH affects biological systems in the oceans, primarily oceanic [[calcification|calcifying]] organisms. These effects span the [[food chain]] from [[autotroph]]s to [[heterotroph]]s and include organisms such as [[coccolithophore]]s, [[coral]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[crustacea]]ns and [[mollusca|mollusks]]. Under normal conditions, calcium carbonate is stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at [[supersaturation|supersaturating]] concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, so does the concentration of this ion, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Nienhuis |first1 = S. |last2 = Palmer |first2 = A. |last3 = Harley |first3 = C. |year = 2010 |title = Elevated {{CO2}} affects shell dissolution rate but not calcification rate in a marine snail |journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume = 277 |issue = 1693 |pages = 2553–2558 |pmc = 2894921 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0206 |pmid = 20392726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corals,&lt;ref name=gatt98&gt;

NOAA states in their May 2008 "State of the science fact sheet for [[ocean acidification]]" that:&lt;br&gt;
"The oceans have absorbed about 50% of the carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) released from the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in chemical reactions that lower ocean pH. This has caused an increase in hydrogen ion (acidity) of about 30% since the start of the industrial age through a process known as "ocean acidification." A growing number of studies have demonstrated adverse impacts on marine organisms, including:
* The rate at which reef-building corals produce their skeletons decreases, while production of numerous varieties of jellyfish increases.
* The ability of marine algae and free-swimming zooplankton to maintain protective shells is reduced.
* The survival of larval marine species, including commercial fish and shellfish, is reduced."

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in their Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_synthesis_report.htm Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report], IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
"The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units. Increasing atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations lead to further acidification&amp;nbsp;... While the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their dependent species."

Some marine calcifying organisms (including coral reefs) have been singled out by major research agencies, including NOAA, OSPAR commission, NANOOS and the IPCC, because their most current research shows that ocean acidification should be expected to impact them negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification |title=PMEL Ocean Acidification Home Page |publisher=Pmel.noaa.gov |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents.

== Biological role ==
Carbon dioxide is an end product of [[cellular respiration]] in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars, fats and [[amino acid]]s with [[oxygen]] as part of their [[metabolism]]. This includes all plants, algae and animals and [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] fungi and bacteria. In [[vertebrate]]s, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the skin (e.g., [[amphibian]]s) or the gills (e.g., [[fish]]), from where it dissolves in the water, or to the lungs from where it is exhaled. During active photosynthesis, [[compensation point|plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release]] in respiration.

=== Photosynthesis and carbon fixation ===
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|Overview of photosynthesis and respiration. Carbon dioxide (at right), together with water, form oxygen and organic compounds (at left) by [[photosynthesis|&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/span&gt;]], which can be [[cellular respiration|&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;respired&lt;/span&gt;]] to water and ({{CO2}}).]]

[[File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|thumb|left|upright=1|Overview of the [[Calvin cycle]] and carbon fixation]]
[[Carbon fixation]] is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and ([[cyanobacteria]]) into [[fuel|energy-rich]] organic [[molecule]]s such as [[glucose]], thus creating their own food by [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and [[water]] to produce [[sugar]]s from which other [[organic compound]]s can be constructed, and [[oxygen]] is produced as a by-product.

[[RuBisCO|Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase]], commonly abbreviated to RuBisCO, is the [[enzyme]] involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, the production of two molecules of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] from {{CO2}} and [[ribulose bisphosphate]], as shown in the diagram at left.

RuBisCO is thought to be the single most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhingra A, Portis AR, Daniell H | title = Enhanced translation of a chloroplast-expressed RbcS gene restores small subunit levels and photosynthesis in nuclear RbcS antisense plants | journal = Proc.

[[Phototroph]]s use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the [[biosynthesis]] of more complex organic molecules, such as [[polysaccharides]], [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. These are used for their own growth, and also as the basis of the [[food chain]]s and webs that feed other organisms, including animals such as ourselves.

Plants also emit {{CO2}} during respiration, and so the majority of plants and algae, which use [[C3 photosynthesis]], are only net absorbers during the day. Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of {{CO2}} each year, a mature forest will produce as much {{CO2}} from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g., fallen branches) as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/07/000094946_02081604154234/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603011630/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/07/000094946_02081604154234/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-06-03 |title=Global Environment Division Greenhouse Gas Assessment Handbook – A Practical Guidance Document for the Assessment of Project-level Greenhouse Gas Emissions |accessdate=2007-11-10 |publisher=[[World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral, mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature07276 |title=Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks |year=2008 |last1=Luyssaert |first1=Sebastiaan |last2=Schulze |first2=E.-Detlef |last3=Börner |first3=Annett |last4=Knohl |first4=Alexander |last5=Hessenmöller |first5=Dominik |last6=Law |first6=Beverly E. |last7=Ciais |first7=Philippe |last8=Grace |first8=John |journal=Nature |volume=455 |pmid=18784722 |issue=7210 |bibcode= 2008Natur.455..213L |pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remain valuable [[carbon sink]]s, helping to maintain the carbon balance of Earth's atmosphere.

=== Toxicity ===
{{See also|Carbon dioxide poisoning}}
[[File:Main symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity.svg|thumb|right|Main symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity, by increasing [[volume percent]] in air.&lt;ref name=friedman&gt;Friedman, Daniel. [http://www.inspect-ny.com/hazmat/CO2gashaz.htm Toxicity of Carbon Dioxide Gas Exposure, {{CO2}} Poisoning Symptoms, Carbon Dioxide Exposure Limits, and Links to Toxic Gas Testing Procedures]. InspectAPedia&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about {{cvt|30|km}} altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.041% (410 ppm), depending on the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/carbontracker/ |title=CarbonTracker CT2011_oi (Graphical map of {{CO2}}) |work=esrl.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=what date/year are these figures for?|date=June 2014}}

{{CO2}} is an [[asphyxiant gas]] and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals standards]] of [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] by using the [[OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals]]. In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/fire/co2/co2report.html |title=Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term [[hypercapnia]], a subset of [[Asphyxiant gas|asphyxiation]].

Because it is heavier than air, in locations where the gas seeps from the ground (due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity) in relatively high concentrations, without the dispersing effects of wind, it can collect in sheltered/pocketed locations below average ground level, causing animals located therein to be suffocated. Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed. Children have been killed in the same way near the city of [[Goma]] by {{CO2}} emissions from the nearby volcano [[Mt. Nyiragongo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3215_volcanoc.html Volcano Under the City]. PBS.org (1 November 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for this phenomenon is '[[mazuku]]'.

[[File:Apollo13 apparatus.jpg|thumb|Rising levels of {{CO2}} threatened the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts who had to adapt cartridges from the command module to supply the [[carbon dioxide scrubber]] in the lunar module, which they used as a lifeboat.]]
Adaptation to increased concentrations of {{CO2}} occurs in humans, including [[Respiratory adaptation|modified breathing]] and kidney bicarbonate production, in order to balance the effects of blood acidification ([[acidosis]]). Several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (e.g. a [[submarine]]) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible, as decrement in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days.&lt;ref name="Glatte Jr H.

==== Ventilation ====
Poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive {{CO2}} concentrations in closed spaces. Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions (when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that {{CO2}} concentration has stabilized) are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Higher {{CO2}} concentrations are associated with occupant health, comfort and performance degradation.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1–2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions. Thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm, indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard. Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).

Miners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as "[[blackdamp]]," "choke damp" or "stythe." Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.

The body produces approximately {{convert|2.3|lb|kg}} of carbon dioxide per day per person,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html |title=How much carbon dioxide do humans contribute through breathing? |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202140715/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html |archivedate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing {{convert|0.63|lb|g}} of carbon. {{anchor|partial pressure}} In humans, this carbon dioxide is carried through the [[venous system]] and is breathed out through the lungs, resulting in lower concentrations in the [[arteries]]. The carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the [[partial pressure]], which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Henrickson |title=Chemistry |publisher=Cliffs Notes |year=2005 |isbn=978-0764574191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the blood carbon dioxide contents is shown in the adjacent table:

==== Transport in the blood ====
{{CO2}} is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood).
* Most of it (about 70% to 80%) is converted to [[bicarbonate]] ions {{chem|HCO|3|−}} by the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] in the red blood cells,&lt;ref name="solarnav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |publisher=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the reaction {{CO2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} → {{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|HCO|3|−}}.
* 5–10% is dissolved in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]&lt;ref name="solarnav"/&gt;
* 5–10% is bound to [[hemoglobin]] as [[carbamino]] compounds&lt;ref name="solarnav"/&gt;

[[Hemoglobin]], the main oxygen-carrying molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].

==== Regulation of respiration ====
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.&lt;ref name="solarnav"/&gt;

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.

[[Image:Challenger1MBT.JPEG|thumb|300px|The [[British Army]]'s [[Challenger 1]] was the second main battle tank to use Chobham armour]]

'''Chobham armour''' is the informal name of a [[composite armour]] developed in the 1960s at the British [[tank]] research centre on [[Chobham Common]], [[Surrey]]. The name has since become the common generic term for composite [[Ceramic armour|ceramic]] [[vehicle armour]]. Other names informally given to Chobham Armour include "Burlington" and "Dorchester." "Special armour" is a broader informal term referring to any armour arrangement comprising "sandwich" reactive plates, including Chobham Armour.

Although the construction details of the Chobham armour remain a secret, it has been described as being composed of [[ceramic]] tiles encased within a metal framework and bonded to a backing plate and several elastic layers. Due to the extreme [[hardness]] of the ceramics used, they offer superior resistance against [[shaped charge]]s such as [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds and they shatter [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s.

The armour was first tested in the context of the development of a British prototype vehicle, the [[Chieftain (tank)|FV4211]], and first applied on the preseries of the American M1. Only the [[M1 Abrams]], [[Challenger 1]], and [[Challenger 2]] tanks have been disclosed as being thus armoured. The framework holding the ceramics is usually  produced in large blocks, giving these tanks, and especially their turrets, a distinctive angled appearance.

== Protective qualities ==
Due to the extreme [[hardness]] of the ceramics used, they offer superior resistance against a [[shaped charge]] jet and they shatter [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s (KE-penetrators). The (pulverised) ceramic also strongly [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrades]] any penetrator. Against lighter projectiles the hardness of the tiles causes a "shatter gap" effect: a higher velocity will, within a certain velocity range (the "gap"), not lead to a deeper penetration but destroy the projectile itself instead.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Albert L. and Bodt Barry E., "JTCG/AS Interlaboratory Ballistic Test Program — Final Report", ''Army Research Laboratory – TR-1577 – December 1977'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ceramic is so [[brittle]] the entrance channel of a shaped charge jet is not smooth—as it would be when penetrating a metal—but ragged, causing extreme asymmetric pressures which disturb the geometry of the jet, on which its penetrative capabilities are critically dependent as its mass is relatively low. This initiates a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] as the disturbed jet causes still greater irregularities in the ceramic, until in the end it is defeated. The newer composites, though tougher, optimise this effect as tiles made with them have a layered internal structure conducive to it, causing "crack deflection".&lt;ref&gt;Chan, H.M., "Layered ceramics: processing and mechanical behavior", ''Annu Rev Mater Sci 1997''; '''27''': p. 249–82&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism—using the jet's own energy against it—has caused  the effects of Chobham to be compared to those of [[reactive armour]]. This should not be confused with the effect used in Non-Explosive Reactive Armour: that of sandwiching an inert but soft elastic material such as rubber, between two armour plates. The impact of either a shaped charge jet or [[APFSDS|long-rod penetrator]] after the first layer has been perforated and while the [[rubber]] layer is being penetrated will cause the rubber to deform and expand, so deforming both the back and front plates. Both attack methods will suffer from obstruction to their expected paths, so experiencing a greater thickness of armour than there is nominally, thus lowering penetration. Also for rod penetrations, the transverse force experienced due to the deformation may cause the rod to shatter, bend, or just change its path, again lowering penetration. All versions of Chobham armour have incorporated a large volume of non-energetic reactive armour (NERA) plates either behind hard external armour to weaken the attack, or in front of the rest of the armour array intended to catch the remnants. This is another factor favouring a slab-sided or wedge-like turret: the amount of material the expanding plates push into the path of an attack increases as they are placed closer to parallel to the direction of that attack.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, "Feasibility study of Burlington (Chobham armour) fitted to Chieftain tank – WO 194/1323 – 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, few Chobham armour-protected tanks have been defeated by enemy fire in combat; the relevance of individual cases of lost tanks for determining the protective qualities of Chobham armour is difficult to ascertain as the extent to which such tanks are protected by ceramic modules is undisclosed.

During the second Iraq war in 2003, a [[Challenger 2]] tank became stuck in a ditch while fighting in [[Basra]] against Iraqi forces.  The crew remained safe inside for many hours, the  Burlington LV2 composite armour protecting them from enemy fire, including multiple rocket propelled grenades.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2908679.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Ceramic tiles have a "multiple hit capability" problem in that they cannot sustain successive impacts without quickly losing much of their protective value.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. de Rosset and J.K. Wald, "Analysis of Multiple-Hit Criterion for Ceramic Armor", ''US Army Research Laboratory TR-2861, September 2002''&lt;/ref&gt; To minimise the effects of this the tiles are made as small as possible, but the matrix elements have a minimal practical thickness of about  one inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm), and the ratio of coverage provided by tiles would become unfavourable, placing a practical limit at a diameter of about four inches (ten centimetres). The small hexagonal or square ceramic tiles are encased within the matrix either by isostatically pressing them into the heated matrix,&lt;ref&gt;Bruchey, W., Horwath, E., Templeton, D. and Bishnoi, K.,"System Design Methodology for the Development of High Efficiency Ceramic Armors", ''Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Ballistics, Volume 3, Midrand, South Africa, March 23–27, 1998'', p.167-174&lt;/ref&gt; or by gluing them with an [[epoxy]] resin. Since the early nineties it has been known that holding the tiles under constant compression by their matrix greatly improves their resistance to kinetic penetrators, which is difficult to achieve when using glues.&lt;ref&gt;Hauver, G.E., Netherwood, P.H., Benck, R.F. and Kecskes, L.J., 1994, "Enhanced Ballistic Performance of Ceramics", ''19th Army Science Conference, Orlando, FL, June 20–24, 1994'', p. 1633-1640&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrix has to be backed by a plate, both to reinforce the ceramic tiles from behind and to prevent deformation of the metal matrix by a kinetic impact. Typically the backing plate has half of the mass of the composite matrix.&lt;ref&gt;V. Hohler, K. Weber, R. Tham, B. James, A. Barker and I. Pickup, "Comparative Analysis of Oblique Impact on Ceramic Composite Systems", ''International Journal of Impact Engineering'' '''26''' (2001) p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The assemblage is again attached to elastic layers. These absorb impacts somewhat, but their main function is to prolong the service life of the composite matrix by protecting it against [[vibration]]s. Several assemblages can be stacked, depending on the available space; this way the armour can be made of a modular nature, adaptable to the tactical situation. The thickness of a typical assemblage is today about five to six centimetres. Earlier assemblages, so-called DOP (Depth Of Penetration) -matrices, were thicker. The relative [[interface defeat]] component of the protective value of a ceramic is much larger than for steel armour. Using a number of thinner matrices again enlarges that component for the entire armour package, an effect analogous to the use of alternate layers of high hardness and softer steel, which is typical for the [[glacis]] of modern Soviet tanks.

Ceramic tiles draw little or no advantage from [[sloped armour]] as they lack sufficient toughness to significantly deflect heavy penetrators. Indeed, because a single glancing shot could crack many tiles, the placement of the matrix is chosen so as to optimise the chance of a perpendicular hit, a reversal of the previous desired design feature for conventional armour. Ceramic armour normally even offers better protection for a given [[area density|areal density]] when placed perpendicularly than when placed obliquely, because the cracking propagates along the [[surface normal]] of the plate.&lt;ref&gt;D. Yaziv1, S. Chocron, C.E. Anderson, Jr. and D. J. Grosch, "Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets", ''19th International Symposium of Ballistics, 7–11 May 2001, Interlaken, Switzerland'' '''TB27''' p. 1264&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of rounded forms, the turrets of tanks using Chobham armour typically have a slab-sided appearance.

The backing plate reflects the impact energy back to the ceramic tile in a wider cone. This dissipates the energy, limiting the [[Fracture|cracking]] of the ceramic, but also means a more extended area is damaged. [[Spalling]] caused by the reflected energy can be partially prevented by a [[malleability|malleable]] thin [[graphite]] layer on the face of the ceramic absorbing the energy without making it strongly rebound again as a metal face plate would.

Tiles under compression suffer far less from impacts; in their case it can be advantageous to have a metal face plate bringing the tile also under perpendicular compression. The confined ceramic tile then reinforces the metal face plate, a reversal of the normal situation.

A gradual technological development has taken place in ceramic armour: ceramic tiles, in themselves vulnerable to low energy impacts, were first reinforced by glueing them to a backplate; in the nineties their resistance was increased by bringing them under compression on two axes; in the final phase a third compression axis was added to optimise impact resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Yiwang Bao, Shengbiao Su, Jianjun Yang, Qisheng Fan, "Prestressed ceramics and improvement of impact resistance", ''Materials Letters'' '''57''' (2002) p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; To confine the ceramic core several advanced techniques are used, supplementing the traditional machining and welding, including [[sintering]] the suspension material around the core; squeeze casting of molten metal around the core and spraying the molten metal onto the ceramic tile.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Henry S; McHugh, Kevin M and Lillo, Thomas M, "Manufacturing Encapsulated Ceramic Armor System Using
Spray Forming Technology" ''Publications Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory'', Idaho Falls, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole is placed within the shell formed by the outer and inner wall of the tank turret or hull, the inner wall being the thicker.

=== Material ===
Over the years newer and tougher composites have been developed, giving about five times the protection value of the original pure ceramics, the best of which were again about five times as effective as a steel plate of equal weight. These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or [[metal matrix composite]]s which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix. The latest developments involve the use of [[carbon nanotube]]s to improve toughness even further.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include [[boron carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[aluminium oxide]] ([[sapphire]] or "alumina"), [[aluminium nitride]], [[titanium boride]] and [[Syndite]], a [[synthetic diamond]] composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most expensive and brittle. Boron carbide composites are today favoured for [[ceramic plate]]s protecting against smaller projectiles, such as used in [[body armour]] and armoured [[helicopter]]s; this was in fact in the early sixties the first general application of ceramic armour.&lt;ref&gt;S. Yadav and G. Ravichandran, "Penetration resistance of laminated ceramic/polymer structures", ''International Journal of Impact Engineering'', '''28''' (2003) p. 557''&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon carbide, better suited to protect against larger projectiles{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, was at that time only used in some prototype land vehicles, such as the [[MBT-70]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The ceramics can be created by pressureless sintering or hot pressing. A high density is required, so residual porosity must be minimised in the final part.

A matrix using a [[titanium alloy]] is extremely expensive to manufacture but the metal is favoured for its lightness, strength and resistance to corrosion, which is a constant problem. The Rank company claims to have invented an alumina matrix for the insertion of boron carbide or silicon carbide tiles.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The backing plate can be made from [[steel]], but, as its main function is to improve the stability and stiffness of the assemblage, aluminium is more weight-efficient in light [[armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] only to be protected against light [[anti-tank weapon]]s. A deformable composite backing plate can combine the function of a metal backing plate and an elastic layer.

=== Heavy metal modules ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Depleted uranium]] --&gt;&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Depleted Uranium Armour]] --&gt;
The armour configuration of the first western tanks using Chobham armour was optimised to defeat shaped charges as [[guided missile]]s were seen as the greatest threat. In the eighties however they began to face the improved Soviet 3BM-32, then 3BM-42 [[kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy penetrators]] which the ceramic layer was not particularly effective against: the original ceramics had a resistance against penetrators of about a third compared to that against [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] rounds; for the newest composites it is about one-tenth. A typical example, the 3BM-42 is a segmented projectile which frontal segments are sacrificed in expanding the NERA plates in the front of the armour array, leaving a hole for the rear segment to strike the ceramic with full efficiency. For this reason many modern designs include additional layers of [[heavy metals]] to add more density to the overall armour package.

The introduction of more effective ceramic composite materials allows for a larger width of these metal layers within the armour shell: given a certain protection level provided by the composite matrix, it can be thinner. Because these metal layers are denser than the rest of the composite array, increasing their thickness requires reducing the armour thickness in non-critical areas of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Lakowski, Paul, ''Armor Basics'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They typically form an inner layer placed below the much more expensive matrix,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Clancy|Clancy, Tom]], ''Armored Cav — a guided Tour of an Armored Cavalry Regiment'', New York 1994, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent extensive damage to it should the metal layer strongly deform but not defeat a penetrator. They can also be used as the backing plate for the matrix itself, but this compromises the modularity and thus tactical adaptability of the armour system: ceramic and metal modules can then no longer be replaced independently. Furthermore, due to their extreme hardness, they deform insufficiently and would reflect too much of the impact energy, and in a too wide cone, to the ceramic tile, damaging it even further. Metals used include a [[tungsten]] alloy for the [[Challenger 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Claessen, Luitenant-kolonel A.H.J., ''Tanks &amp; Pantserwagens — De Technische Ontwikkeling'', Blaricum, 2003, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of the [[M1 Abrams|M1A1HA]] (Heavy Armor) and later American tank variants, a [[depleted uranium]] alloy.&lt;ref&gt;''M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies offer [[titanium carbide]] modules.

These metal modules function on the principle of perforated armour (typically employing perpendicular rods), with many expansion spaces reducing the weight by up to one third while keeping the protective qualities fairly constant. The depleted uranium alloy of the M1 has been described as "arranged in a type of armour matrix"&lt;ref&gt;Gelbart, Marsh, ''Tanks — Main Battle Tanks and Light Tanks'', London 1996, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; and a single module as a "stainless-steel shell surrounding a layer (probably an inch or two thick) of depleted uranium, woven into a wire-mesh blanket".&lt;ref&gt;''Armored Cav — a guided Tour of an Armored Cavalry Regiment'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Such modules are also used by tanks not equipped with Chobham armour. The combination of a composite matrix and heavy metal modules is sometimes informally referred to as "second generation Chobham".&lt;ref&gt;Gelbart, Marsh, ''Tanks — Main Battle Tanks and Light Tanks'', London 1996, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and application==

The concept of ceramic armour goes back to 1918, when Major Neville Monroe Hopkins discovered that a plate of ballistic steel was much more resistant to penetration if covered with a thin (1–2 millimetres) layer of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, P.J. (2010), "Sviluppi nel settore delle corazzature ceramiche", ''Rivista Italiana Difesa'', '''5''': 36-44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/1826/5308/1/Hazell_Guest%20editorial_AAC_prepublished.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Germans experimented with ceramic armour in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1214&amp;context=etd&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early sixties there were, in the US, extensive research programmes ongoing aimed at investigating the prospects of employing composite ceramic materials as vehicle armour.&lt;ref&gt;Hanby, K.R., ''Fiber-Reinforced Metal-Matrix Composites-1967'', Defense Metals Information Center DMIC-S-21, MCIC-005839 PL-011311 MMC-700204&lt;/ref&gt; This research mainly focused on the use of an aluminium metal matrix composite reinforced by silicon carbide whiskers, to be produced in the form of large sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Kolkowitz, W. and Stanislaw, T.S., "Extrusion and Hot Rolling - Two Advanced Fabrication Techniques for the Preparation of Whisker-Metal Composites", ''Proceedings of the 14th National Symposium and Exhibit, Vol. 14 - 'Advanced Techniques for Material Investigation and Fabrication', 5-7 Nov 68, Cocoa Beach, Florida, Paper No. 11-4A-3''&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforced light metal sheets were to be sandwiched between steel layers.&lt;ref name="Abrams Main Battle Tank p. 5"&gt;''M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement had the advantage of having a good multiple-hit capability and of being able to be curved, allowing the main armour to benefit from a sloped armour effect. However, this composite with a high metal content was primarily intended to increase the protection against KE-penetrators for a given armour weight; its performance against shaped charge attack was mediocre and would have to be improved by means of a laminate spaced armour effect, as researched by the Germans within the joint MBT-70 project.&lt;ref&gt;Trinks, Walter, "Hohlladungen und Panzerschutz — Ihre wechselweise weiterentwicklung", ''Jahrbuch der Wehrtechnik 8'', 1974, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative technology developed in the US was based on the use of glass modules to be inserted into the main armour;&lt;ref name="Abrams Main Battle Tank p. 5"/&gt; although this arrangement offered a better shaped charge protection, its multiple hit capability was poor. A similar system using glass inserts in the main steel armour was from the late fifties researched for the Soviet ''Obiekt 430'' prototype of the [[T-64]];&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet/Russian Armor and Artillery Design Practices'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; this was later developed into the "[[Combination K]]" type, having a ceramic compound mixed with the [[Silicon dioxide|silicon oxide]] inserts, which offered about 50% better protection against both shaped charge and KE-penetrator threats, compared with a steel armour of the same weight.&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet/Russian Armor and Artillery Design Practices'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; It was, later in several improved forms, incorporated into the glacis of many subsequent Soviet main battle tank designs. After an initial period of speculation in the West as to its true nature, the characteristics of this type were disclosed when the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the introduction of a market system forced the Russian industries to find new customers by highlighting its good qualities;&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet/Russian Armor and Artillery Design Practices'', p. 164-169&lt;/ref&gt; it is today rarely referred to as Chobham armour. Special armour much more similar to Chobham appeared in 1983 under the name of BDD on the T-62M upgrade to the T-62 , was first integrated to an armour array in 1986 on the T-72B, and has been a feature of every Soviet/Russian MBT since. In its original iteration, it is built directly into the cast steel turret of the T-72 and required lifting it to perform repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Military Ordnance – “T-72B MBT – The First Look at Soviet Special Armor”, 2002, pp. 4-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MBT-80 ATR2 drawing.png|300px|thumbnail|left|The British [[MBT-80]] main battle tank was planned to field Chobham armour, before being cancelled in favour of the [[Challenger 1]]]]
In the United Kingdom another line of ceramic armour development had been started in the early 1960s, meant to improve the existing cast turret configuration of the [[Chieftain tank|Chieftain]] that already offered excellent heavy penetrator protection; the research by a team headed by Gilbert Harvey&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Flaherty (1991), ''The Armored Fist — New Face of War'', Time Life Education, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment]] (FVRDE), therefore was strongly oriented at optimising the ceramic composite system for defeating shaped charge attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Orr ''King of the Killing Zone: The Story of the M-1, America's Super Tank'', New York 1989, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The British system consisted of a honeycomb matrix with ceramic tiles backed by ballistic nylon,&lt;ref&gt;Long, D., ''Modern Ballistic Armor — Clothing, Bomb Blankets, Shields, Vehicle Protection'', Boulder 1986, pp. 82-84&lt;/ref&gt; placed on top of the cast main armour.&lt;ref name="Abrams Main Battle Tank p. 5"/&gt; In July 1973 an American delegation, in search of a new armour type for the XM815 tank prototype, now that the MBT-70 project had failed, visited Chobham Common to be informed about the British system, the development of which had then cost about ₤6,000,000; earlier information had already been divulged to the US in 1965 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons, Debates of 11 November 1976, vol. 919 cc272-3W&lt;/ref&gt; It was very impressed by the excellent shaped-charge protection combined with the penetrator impact damage limitation, inherent to the principle of using tiles. The Ballistic Research Laboratory at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], which later became a part of the [[Army Research Laboratory]], initiated the development of a version that year named ''Burlington'', adapted to the specific American situation, characterised by a much higher projected tank production run and the use of a thinner rolled steel main armour. The increased threat posed by a new generation of Soviet guided missiles armed with a shaped charge warhead—as demonstrated in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973, when even older-generation missiles caused considerable tank losses on the Israeli side—made Burlington the preferred choice for the armour configuration of the XM1 (the renamed XM815) prototype.&lt;ref&gt;''M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 11 December 1974 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the US about the common future production of a main battle tank; this made any application of Chobham armour dependent on the eventual choice for a tank type. Earlier in 1974 the Americans had asked the Germans to redesign the existing [[Leopard 2]] prototypes, considered by them too lightly armoured, and had suggested adoption of ''Burlington'' for this purpose, of which type the Germans had already been informed in March 1970; the Germans however in response in 1974 initiated a new armour development programme of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger Walter J., ''Von der Zugmachine zum Leopard 2'', München 1980, p.230&lt;/ref&gt; Having already designed a system that in their opinion offered satisfactory protection against shaped charges, consisting of multiple-laminate spaced armour with the spaces filled with ceramic polystyrene foam&lt;ref&gt;Van Zelm, G. and Fonck B.A., "Leopard-1 Gevechtstank", ''De Tank, Juni 1991'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; as fitted to the [[Leopard 1]]A3, they put a clear emphasis on improving KE-penetrator protection, reworking the system into a perforated metal module armour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A version with added Burlington was considered, including ceramic inserts in the various spaces, but rejected as it would push vehicle weight well over sixty metric tonnes, a weight then seen as prohibitive by both armies.&lt;ref&gt;Claessen, Luitenant-kolonel A.H.J., ''Tanks &amp; Pantserwagens — De Technische Ontwikkeling'', Blaricum, 2003, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army in the summer of 1974 faced the choice between the German system and their own Burlington, a decision made more difficult by the fact that Burlington offered, compared with steel armour, no weight advantage against KE-penetrators:&lt;ref&gt;''Armored Cav — a guided Tour of an Armored Cavalry Regiment'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the total armour system would have a [[Rolled homogeneous armour|RHA]] equivalence against them of about 350&amp;nbsp;mm (compared to about 700&amp;nbsp;mm against shaped charges).&lt;ref&gt;''M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank'', p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; No consensus developing, General [[Creighton Abrams]] himself decided the issue in favour of Burlington.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Orr, ''King of the Killing Zone: The Story of the M-1, America's Super Tank'', New York 1989, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually each army procured its own national tank design, the project of a common tank failing in 1976. In February 1978 the first tanks protected by Burlington left the factory when the first of eleven pilot M1 tanks were delivered by Chrysler Corporation to the US Army.

Beside these state projects, private enterprise in the US during the seventies also developed ceramic armour types, like the Noroc armour made by the Protective Products Division of the [[Norton Company]], consisting of boron carbide sheets backed by resin-bonded glass cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Crow and Robert J. Icks, ''Encyclopedia of Tanks'', p. 75, Barrie &amp; Jenkins, London 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M1-A1 Abrams 1.jpg|300px|thumb|left|US Marine Corps M1A1 on a live fire exercise in Iraq, 2003. It is a modern Main Battle Tank that extensively uses Chobham armour]]

In the United Kingdom application of Chobham armour was delayed by the failure of several advanced tank projects: first that of a joint German-British main battle tank; then the purely British [[MBT-80]] programme. A first directive to prepare Chobham armour technology for application in 1975 was already given in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''Chieftain'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined by a study of a possible Chobham-armour protected [[MICV]] that a completely new design using only Chobham armour for the most vulnerable front and side sectors (thus without an underlying steel main armour) could be 10% lighter for the same level of protection against KE-ammunition, but to limit costs it was decided to base the first design on the conventional Chieftain. The prototype, FV 4211 or the "Aluminium Chieftain", was fitted with a welded aluminium add-on armour, in essence a box on the front hull and front and side turret to contain the ceramic modules, of which box the fifty millimetre thick inner wall due to its relative softness could serve as their backing plate. The extra weight of the aluminium was limited to less than two tonnes and it was shown that it was not overly susceptible to cracking, as first feared.&lt;ref&gt;''Chieftain'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Ten test vehicles were ordered but only the original one had been built when the project was cancelled in favour of the more advanced programmes.&lt;ref&gt;''Chieftain'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Iran]]ian government ordered 1,225 vehicles of an upgraded Chieftain type, the ''Shir-2'' (FV 4030/3), using the same technology of adding Chobham armour to the main cast armour, bringing total weight to 62 metric tonnes. When this order was cancelled in February 1979 because of the [[Iranian Revolution]], the British government, under pressure to modernise its tank fleet to maintain a qualitative superiority relative to the Soviet tank forces, decided to use the sudden surplus production capacity to procure a number of vehicles very close in design to the Shir-2, called the [[Challenger 1]]. On 12 April 1983 the first British tank protected by Chobham armour was delivered to the [[Royal Hussars]].

In France from 1966 [[Nexter|GIAT]] Industries performed experiments aimed at developing a light vehicle ceramic armour, in 1970 resulting in the CERALU-system consisting of aluminium-backed alumina weldable to the vehicle, offering a 50% increase in weight-efficiency against ballistic threats compared to steel plate. An improved version was later applied in helicopter seats.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Strickland, ''Jane's Armour &amp; Artillery Upgrade, 2004-2005'', p 143, London 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of Chobham armour is used on the [[Challenger 2]] (called ''Dorchester armour''), and (though the composition most probably differs) the [[M1 Abrams]] series of tanks, which according to official sources is currently protected by [[silicon carbide]] tiles. Given the publicly stated protection level for the earliest M1: 350&amp;nbsp;mm steel equivalence against KE-penetrators ([[Kinetic energy penetrator|APFSDS]]), it seems to have been equipped with [[alumina]] tiles.{{Or|date=September 2007}}

Though it is often claimed to be otherwise, the original production model of the [[Leopard 2]] did not use Chobham armour,&lt;ref&gt;''Armored Cav — a guided Tour of an Armored Cavalry Regiment'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; but a combined [[spaced armour]] and [[perforated armour]] configuration, cheaper in terms of procurement, maintenance and replacement than a ceramic armour system. For many modern tanks, such the Italian [[Ariete]], it is yet unknown which type is used. There was a general trend in the eighties away from ceramic armour towards perforated armour,&lt;ref name="Chassilan2005"/&gt; but even many tanks from the seventies like the Leopard 1A3 and A4, the French [[AMX-32|AMX 32]] and [[AMX 40]] prototypes used the latter system; the [[Leclerc]] has an improved version.&lt;ref name="Chassilan2005"&gt;Marc Chassillan, (2005); ''Char Leclerc: De la guerre froide aux conflits de demain'', Editions ETAI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerospace applications ==
The first ceramic plates found application in the aerospace sector: in 1965, the helicopter [[Bell UH-1|UH-1 Huey]] was modified with HFC (Hard-Faced-Composite) around the seats of pilot and copilot, protecting them against small arms fire. The plates were in [[boron carbide]], which, though exceedingly costly, due to its superior lightness has remained the material of choice for aerospace applications. An example among many, the modern [[V-22 Osprey]] is protected similarly.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Hazell, RID, May 2010, Sviluppi nel settore delle corazzature ceramiche&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[vacuum]] applications, a '''cold trap''' is a device that condenses all [[vapor]]s except the permanent gases into a liquid or solid.&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book
|author = Laurence M. Harwood, Christopher J. Moody

|ISBN=978-0-632-02017-1 
|date=13 Jun 1989
|publisher=WileyBlackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common objective is to prevent vapors being evacuated from an experiment from entering a [[vacuum pump]] where they would condense and contaminate it.  Particularly large cold traps are necessary when removing large amounts of liquid as in [[freeze drying]].

Cold traps also refer to the application of cooled surfaces or [[Baffle (in vessel)|baffles]] to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will be attached to the inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven [[Peltier effect|Peltier]] element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity.

==Applications==
Pumps that use oil either as their working fluid ([[diffusion pump]]s), or as their lubricant (mechanical rotary pumps), are often the sources of contamination in vacuum systems. Placing a cold trap at the mouth of such a pump greatly lowers the risk that oil vapours will backstream into the cavity.

Cold traps can also be used for experiments involving vacuum lines such as small-scale very low temperature [[distillation]]s/[[condensation]]s.  This is accomplished through the use of a coolant such as [[liquid nitrogen]] or a [[freezing mixture]] of [[dry ice]] in [[acetone]] or a similar solvent with a low [[melting point]].

When performed on a larger scale, this technique is called freeze-drying, and the cold trap is referred to as the condenser.

Cold traps are also used in [[cryopump]] systems to generate hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere ([[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]) into their liquid or solid forms.
{{main|cryopump}}

== Hazards ==
Care should be taken when using a cold trap not to condense [[liquid oxygen]] (a light blue liquid) into the cold trap. Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and this is especially true if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Liquid oxygen can be condensed into a cold trap if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the trap is very cold, e.g. when cooled with [[liquid nitrogen]]. Besides oxygen, many hazardous gases emitted in reactions, e.g. [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chloromethane]], condense into cold traps.

==Construction==
[[File:Wymrażacz ubt.svg|right|thumb]]
Cold traps (C in the figure) usually consist of two parts: The bottom is a large, thick round tube with ground-glass joints (B in the figure), and the second is a cap (A in the figure), also with ground-glass connections. The length of the tube is usually selected so that, when assembled, the total reached is about half the length of the tube.

==Arrangement==

Cold traps should be assembled such that the down tube is connected to the source of gas whilst the cap is connected to the source of vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/z219738?lang=en&amp;region=GB An Aldrich manifold including a preformed cold trap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemglass.com/product_view.asp?pnr=AF-0203 A preformed cold trap from Chemglass]&lt;/ref&gt; Reversing this, connecting the down tube to the source of vacuum, places the inlet of the vacuum directly above the condensate, increasing the chances of vapour phase condensate moving up the (uncooled) down tube (towards the pump) or, should the trap begin to fill to an appreciable volume, liquid phase condensate being pulled into the pump.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">A '''compressor station''' is a facility which helps the transportation process of [[natural gas]] from one location to another.  Natural gas, while being transported through a gas pipeline, needs to be constantly pressurized at intervals of 40 to 100 miles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Siting is dependent on terrain, and the number of gas wells in the vicinity. Frequent elevation changes and a greater number of gas wells will require more compressor stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrm/2012/715017/|title=Gas Compressor Station Economic Optimization|first1=Rainer|last1=Kurz|first2=Matt|last2=Lubomirsky|first3=Klaus|last3=Brun|date=13 August 2018|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Rotating Machinery|volume=2012|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2012/715017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas in compressor stations is normally pressurized by special turbines, motors and engines.

The compressor station, also called a pumping station, is the "engine" that powers an interstate natural gas pipeline.  As the name implies, the compressor station compresses the natural gas (increasing its pressure) thereby providing energy to move the gas through the pipeline.&lt;ref name="ingaa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingaa.org/cms/129.aspx|title=INGAA Website  - Compressor Stations|website=www.ingaa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline companies install compressor stations along a pipeline route.  The size of the station and the number of compressors (pumps) varies, based on the diameter of the pipe and the volume of gas to be moved.  Nevertheless, the basic components of a station are similar.

==Liquid Separators==

As the pipeline enters the compressor station the natural gas passes through scrubbers, strainers or filter separators. These are vessels designed to remove any free liquids or dirt particles from the gas before it enters the compressors. Though the pipeline is carrying “dry gas,” some water and hydrocarbon liquids may condense out of the gas stream as the gas cools and moves through the pipeline.
 
Any liquids that may be produced are collected and stored for sale or disposal.  A piping system directs the gas from the separators to the gas compressor for compression.

==Prime Movers==
[[File:UKZ-KamAZ-63501.jpg|thumb|Mobile compressor station produced by the Ufa Compressor Factory on a KamAZ-63501 chassis]]
There are three commonly used types of engines that drive the compressors and are known as "prime movers":&lt;ref name="ingaa.org"/&gt;

===Turbine / Centrifugal Compressor===

This type of compression unit uses a natural gas-fired turbine to turn a centrifugal compressor.  The centrifugal compressor is similar to a large fan inside a case, which pumps the gas as the fan turns.  A small portion of natural gas from the pipeline is burned to power the turbine.

===Electric Motor/Centrifugal Compressor===

In this type of compressor unit, the centrifugal compressor is driven by a high voltage electric motor.  An electrified compressor may still require an air permit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndhealth.gov/AQ/Policy/Electric%20Compressor%20Policy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as regulations vary by state an applicability analysis should be conducted whenever a compressor station will be constructed. However, a highly reliable source of electric power must be available and near the station.

===Reciprocating Engine/Reciprocating Compressor===

These large piston engines resemble automobile engines, only much larger. Commonly known as “recips,” these engines are fueled by natural gas from the pipeline.  Reciprocating pistons, located in cylinder cases on the side of the unit, compress the natural gas. The compressor pistons and the power pistons are connected to a common crankshaft.  The advantage of reciprocating compressors is that the volume of gas pushed through the pipeline can be adjusted incrementally to meet small changes in customer demand.

In [[vector calculus]], a '''conservative vector field''' is a [[vector field]] that is the [[gradient]] of some [[function (mathematics)|function]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Vector calculus|first1 = Jerrold|last1 = Marsden|authorlink1 = Jerrold Marsden|first2 = Anthony|last2 = Tromba|publisher = W.H.Freedman and Company|edition = Fifth|year = 2003|pp = 550&amp;ndash;561}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conservative vector fields have the property that the [[line integral]] is path independent, i.e., the choice of any path between two points does not change the value of the [[line integral]]. Path independence of the line integral is equivalent to the vector field being conservative. A conservative vector field is also [[Laplace equation for irrotational flow|irrotational]]; in three dimensions, this means that it has vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]. An irrotational vector field is necessarily conservative provided that the domain is [[simply connected]].

Conservative vector fields appear naturally in [[mechanics]]: They are vector fields representing [[force]]s of [[physical system]]s in which [[energy]] is [[conservation of energy|conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;George B. Arfken and Hans J. Weber, ''Mathematical Methods for Physicists'', 6th edition, Elsevier Academic Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; For a conservative system, the [[work (physics)|work]] done in moving along a path in configuration space depends only on the endpoints of the path, so it is possible to define a [[potential energy]] that is independent of the actual path taken.

==Informal treatment==

In a two- and three-dimensional space, there is an ambiguity in taking an integral between two points as there are infinitely many paths between the two points—apart from the straight line formed between the two points, one could choose a curved path of greater length as shown in the figure. Therefore, in general, the value of the integral depends on the path taken. However, in the special case of a conservative vector field, the value of the integral is independent of the path taken, which can be thought of as a large-scale cancellation of all elements &lt;math&gt;d{R}&lt;/math&gt; that don't have a component along the straight line between the two points. To visualize this, imagine two people climbing a cliff; one decides to scale the cliff by going vertically up it, and the second decides to walk along a winding path that is longer in length than the height of the cliff, but at only a small angle to the horizontal. Although the two hikers have taken different routes to get up to the top of the cliff, at the top, they will have both gained the same amount of gravitational potential energy. This is because a gravitational field is conservative. As an example of a non-conservative field, imagine pushing a box from one end of a room to another. Pushing the box in a straight line across the room requires noticeably less work against friction than along a curved path covering a greater distance.

[[File:Pathdependence.png|thumbnail|Depiction of two possible paths to integrate. In green is the simplest possible path; blue shows a more convoluted curve]]

==Intuitive explanation==

[[M. C. Escher|M. C. Escher's]] painting ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' illustrates a non-conservative vector field, impossibly made to appear to be the gradient of the varying height above ground as one moves along the staircase. It is ''rotational'' in that one can keep getting higher or keep getting lower while going around in circles. It is non-conservative in that one can return to one's starting point while ascending more than one descends or vice versa. On a real staircase, the height above the ground is a scalar potential field: If one returns to the same place, one goes upward exactly as much as one goes downward. Its gradient would be a conservative vector field and is irrotational. The situation depicted in the painting is impossible.

==Definition==

A [[vector field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}: U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, is said to be '''conservative''' if and only if there exists a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \nabla \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. When the equation above holds, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''[[scalar potential]]''' for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Helmholtz decomposition|fundamental theorem of vector calculus]] states that any vector field can be expressed as the sum of a conservative vector field and a [[solenoidal field]].

==Path independence==

{{main article|Gradient theorem}}

A key property of a conservative vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is that its integral along a path depends only on the endpoints of that path, not the particular route taken. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a rectifiable path in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; with initial point &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and terminal point &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; scalar field &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a conservative vector field, then the [[gradient theorem]] states that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{P} \mathbf{v} \cdot d{\mathbf{r}} = \varphi(B) - \varphi(A).&lt;/math&gt;

This holds as a consequence of the [[chain rule]] and the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].

An equivalent formulation of this is that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} \mathbf{v} \cdot d{\mathbf{r}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for every rectifiable simple closed path &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Gradient theorem#Converse of the gradient theorem|converse of this statement]] is also true: If the [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; around every rectifiable simple closed path in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a conservative vector field.

==Irrotational vector fields==

[[File:Irrotational vector field.svg|300px|thumbnail|right|The above vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \left( - \frac{y}{x^2 + y^2},\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2},0 \right)&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;U = \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{ (0,0,z) \mid z \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; has zero curl almost everywhere and is thus irrotational. However, it is neither conservative nor does it have path independence.]]

Let &lt;math&gt;n = 3&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}: U \to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; vector field, with &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; open as always.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''irrotational''' if and only if its [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; everywhere in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., if

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{v} \equiv \mathbf{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, such vector fields are sometimes referred to as '''curl-free vector fields''' or '''curl-less vector fields'''.  They are also referred to as [[Helmholtz decomposition#Longitudinal and transverse fields | '''longitudinal vector fields''']].

It is an [[Vector calculus identities#Curl of the gradient|identity of vector calculus]] that for any &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; scalar field &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \varphi) \equiv \mathbf{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, every &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; conservative vector field on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is also an irrotational vector field on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Provided that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[simply connected]], the converse of this is also true: Every irrotational vector field on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; conservative vector field on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

The above statement is ''not'' true in general if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is not simply connected. Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis removed, i.e., &lt;math&gt;U = \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{ (0,0,z) \mid z \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, define a vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(x,y,z) ~ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} ~ \left( - \frac{y}{x^2 + y^2},\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2},0 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; has zero curl everywhere in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is irrotational. However, the circulation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; around the unit circle in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, note that in [[polar coordinates]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{e}_{\phi} / r&lt;/math&gt;, so the integral over the unit circle is

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\phi} ~ d{\phi} = 2 \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; does not have the path-independence property discussed above and is not conservative. (However, in any simply connected open sub-region of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, it is still true that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is conservative. In fact, the field above is the gradient of &lt;math&gt;\arg(x + iy)&lt;/math&gt;. As we know from complex analysis, this is a multi-valued function that requires a branch cut from the origin to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; to be defined in a continuous manner. Hence, in a region that does not go around the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, its gradient is conservative.)

In a simply connected open region, an irrotational vector field has the path-independence property. This can be seen by noting that in such a region, an irrotational vector field is conservative, and conservative vector fields have the path-independence property. The result can also be proved directly by using [[Stokes' theorem]]. In a simply connected open region, any vector field that has the path-independence property must also be irrotational.

More abstractly, in the presence of a [[Riemannian metric]], vector fields correspond to [[differential form|differential &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms]].  The conservative vector fields correspond to the [[closed and exact differential forms|exact]] &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms, that is, to the forms which are the [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;d\phi&lt;/math&gt; of a function (scalar field) &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.  The irrotational vector fields correspond to the [[closed and exact differential forms|closed]] &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms, that is, to the &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  As &lt;math&gt;d^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, any exact form is closed, so any conservative vector field is irrotational.  Conversely, all closed &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms are exact if and only if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[simply connected]].  To see why, note that being simply connected means that the [[fundamental group]] of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.  Because &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, any loop may be straightened to a finite polygonal path, and since such paths have only finitely many self-intersections, the loop is a union of finitely many simple closed curves. It follows that the fundamental group vanishes if and only if the first [[singular homology]] group &lt;math&gt;H_1(U, \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.  It also follows that &lt;math&gt;H_1(U, \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the classes of simple closed curves and is therefore torsion-free.  Hence by the [[universal coefficient theorem]], the singular homology group vanishes if and only if the [[singular cohomology]] group &lt;math&gt;H^1(U, \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.  By [[de Rham's theorem]], the latter group is isomorphic to the first [[de Rham cohomology]] group &lt;math&gt;H^1_{\mathrm{dR}}(U)&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is simply connected if and only if all closed &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms are exact.

==Irrotational flows==&lt;!-- [[Irrotatational flow]] redirects to here --&gt;

{{main article|Vorticity}}

The [[flow velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; of a fluid is a vector field, and the '''[[vorticity]]''' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; of the flow can be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} ~ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} ~ \nabla \times \mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

A common alternative notation for vorticity is &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 7.11, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is irrotational, with &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{v} \equiv \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, then the flow is said to be an '''irrotational flow'''. The vorticity of an irrotational flow is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Elements of Gas Dynamics|first1 = H.W.|last1 = Liepmann|authorlink1 = Hans W. Liepmann|first2 = A.|last2 = Roshko|authorlink2 = Anatol Roshko|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|year = 1993|origyear = 1957|isbn = 0-486-41963-0}}, pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kelvin's circulation theorem]] states that a fluid that is irrotational in an [[inviscid flow]] will remain irrotational. This result can be derived from the [[vorticity transport equation]], obtained by taking the curl of the Navier-Stokes Equations.

For a two-dimensional flow, the vorticity acts as a measure of the ''local'' rotation of fluid elements. Note that the vorticity does ''not'' imply anything about the global behavior of a fluid. It is possible for a fluid traveling in a straight line to have vorticity, and it is possible for a fluid that moves in a circle to be irrotational.

If the vector field associated to a force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is conservative, then the force is said to be a [[conservative force]].

The most prominent examples of conservative forces are the gravitational force and the electric force associated to an electrostatic field. According to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]], the [[gravitational force]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{G}&lt;/math&gt; acting on a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; due to a mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, which is a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; between them, obeys the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{G} = - \frac{G m M}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''unit'' vector pointing from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; toward &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. The force of gravity is conservative because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{G} = - \nabla \Phi_{G}&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{G} ~ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} - \frac{G m M}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[gravitational potential energy]].

For [[conservative force]]s, ''path independence'' can be interpreted to mean that the [[work done]] in going from a point &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to a point &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the path chosen, and that the work &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; done in going around a simple closed loop is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W = \oint_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d{\mathbf{r}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The total [[conservation of energy|energy]] of a particle moving under the influence of conservative forces is conserved, in the sense that a loss of potential energy is converted to an equal quantity of kinetic energy, or vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5458">In [[electrical engineering]], '''current limiting reactors''' can reduce [[short-circuit]] [[Electric current|current]]s, which result from plant expansions and power source additions, to levels that can be adequately handled by existing distribution equipment.&lt;ref name="Source 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=James|title=The how and why of current-limiting reactors|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2095/article-1G1-14794605/and-why-currentlimiting-reactors|work=Highbeam Business|publisher=EC&amp;M Electrical Construction &amp; Maintenance|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They can also be used in high voltage electric power transmission grids for a similar purpose. In the control of electric motors, current limiting reactors can be used to restrict starting current or as part of a speed control system.
[[File:NoxonReactor.jpg|thumb|right| A set of air-core reactors installed outdoors at a substation. Similar reactors are used for current limiting at transmission and distribution voltage levels.]]

== History ==
Current limiting reactors, once called current limiting [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] coils, were first presented in 1915.&lt;ref name="Source 4"&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Use of Current-Limiting Reactors |first1=Walter Melville |last1=Dann |first2=H. H. |last2=Rudd |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu55816380;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=5;num=1 |conference=Meeting of the Society of Mechanical, Electrical, and Steam Engineers |location=Boody House, [[Toledo, Ohio]] |date=June 17–18, 1915 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inventor of the current limiting reactance coil was Vern E. Alden who filed the patent on November 20, 1917 with an issue date of September 11, 1923. The original assignee was [[Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Alden |inventor-first=Vern |country=US |number=1467771 |title=Current Limiting Reactance Coil |assign=Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company |gdate=September 11, 1923 |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1467771 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
A current limiting reactor is used when the [[prospective short-circuit current]] in a distribution or transmission system is calculated to exceed the [[interrupting rating]] of the associated [[switchgear]].  The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear. 
The amount of protection that a current limiting reactor offers depends upon the percentage increase in impedance that it provides for the system.&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Limiting Reactors: Technical Overview and Measurement Procedures|url=http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|publisher=NWL|accessdate=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303231851/http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Current Limiting Reactor.jpg|thumb|Current Limiting Reactor]]

The main motive of using current limiting reactors is to reduce short-circuit currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used. They can also be used to protect other system components from high current levels and to limit the inrush current when starting a large motor.&lt;ref name="Source 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Power|url=http://www.qualitypower.co.in/current-reactors.php|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
It is desirable that the reactor does not go into magnetic saturation during a short-circuit, so generally an air-core [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is used. At low and medium voltages, air-insulated coils are practical; for high transmission voltages, the coils may be immersed in [[transformer oil]]. 
Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.&lt;ref&gt;"Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book", Westinghouse Electr Corporation, Pittsburgh PA , 1950 pp. 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Line reactor==
A '''line reactor''' is an inductor wired between a power source and a load.  In addition to the current limiting function, the device serves to filter out spikes of current &lt;ref&gt;http://www.myronzucker.com/linereactorpg1.html What is a Line Reactor?&lt;/ref&gt;  and may also reduce injection of harmonic currents into the power supply.  The most common type is designed for [[three-phase electric power]], in which three isolated inductors are each wired in series with one of the three line phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228061844/http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |archivedate=2012-12-28 |df= }} Line reactor configurations&lt;/ref&gt; Line reactors are generally installed in motor driven equipment to limit starting current, and may be used to protect [[Variable-frequency drive]]s and motors.:&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_line_reactors_vfds/&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">[[File:Displacement measurement.png|thumb|Measurement of volume by displacement. The amount by which the liquid rises in the cylinder is equal to the volume of the rock.]]

In [[fluid mechanics]], '''displacement''' occurs when an object is immersed in a [[fluid]], pushing it out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured, and from this, the volume of the immersed object can be deduced (the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid).

An object that sinks displaces an amount of fluid equal to the object's volume. Thus [[buoyancy]] is expressed through [[Archimedes' principle]], which states that the [[weight]] of the object is reduced by its volume multiplied by the [[density]] of the fluid. If the weight of the object is less than this displaced quantity, the object floats; if more, it sinks. The amount of fluid displaced is directly related (via Archimedes' Principle) to its volume.

In the case of an object that sinks (is totally submerged), the volume of the object is displaced. In the case of an object that floats, the amount of fluid displaced will be equal in '''weight''' to the displacing object.

Archimedes' principle, a physical law of buoyancy, states that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid (gas or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force the magnitude of which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface of an object partially submerged in a liquid. The weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction; the object neither rises nor sinks. If the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid, the object rises, as in the case of a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a helium-filled balloon that is let loose in the air. An object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces, though it sinks when released, has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In fact, in some accurate weighing, a correction must be made in order to compensate for the buoyancy effect of the surrounding air. The buoyant force, which always opposes gravity, is nevertheless caused by gravity. Fluid pressure increases with depth because of the (gravitational) weight of the fluid above. This increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth. The result is buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/32827/Archimedes-principle|title=Archimedes' principle - physics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of displacement==
This method can be used to [[measurement|measure]] the volume of a solid object, even if its form is not regular. Several methods of such measuring exist. In one case the increase of liquid level is registered as the object is immersed in the liquid (usually water). In the second case, the object is immersed into a vessel full of liquid (called an [[overflow can]]), causing it to overflow. Then the spilled liquid is collected and its volume measured. In the third case, the object is suspended under the surface of the liquid and the increase of weight of the vessel is measured. The increase in weight is equal to the amount of liquid displaced by the object, which is the same as the volume of the suspended object times the density of the liquid.&lt;ref name="StephenWHughes2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes |first1=Stephen W. |year=2005 |title=Archimedes revisited: a faster, better, cheaper method of accurately measuring the volume of small objects |journal=[[Physics Education]] |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0031-9120/40/5/008/ |doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/5/008 |bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..468H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Archimedes' principle]] is that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt;. The weight of the displaced fluid can be found mathematically. The mass of the displaced fluid can be expressed in terms of the density and its volume, {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''ρV''}}. The fluid displaced has a weight {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''mg''}}, where {{math|''g''}} is [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration due to gravity]]. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid can be expressed as {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''ρVg''}}. 

The weight of an object or substance can be measured by floating a sufficiently buoyant receptacle in the cylinder and noting the water level. After placing the object or substance in the receptacle, the difference in weight of the water level volumes will equal the weight of the object.

The '''Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources 2001/77/EC''' is a [[Directive (European Union)|European Union Directive]] for promoting [[renewable energy]] use in [[electricity generation]]. It is popularly known as the RES Directive. 

The directive, which took effect in October 2001, sets national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states. As the name implies, the EU does not strictly enforce these targets. However, The [[European Commission]] monitors the progress of the [[member states of the European Union]] – and will, if necessary, propose mandatory targets for those who miss their goals. 

These objectives contribute toward achieving the overall indicative EU targets, which are listed in the white paper on renewable sources of energy. Regulators want a 12% share of gross renewable [[domestic energy consumption]] by 2010 and a 20% share by 2020.

The directive was superseded by [[EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC|Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC]], published on 23 April 2009.

== National targets ==

The following table lists the indicative targets for each of the 15 original member states, and for comparison the share of renewable electricity in 1997 as well.

'''Eggshell and protein membrane separation''' is a [[recycling]] process. Nearly 30% of the [[Egg (food)|eggs]] consumed each year are broken and processed or powdered into foods such as cakes, mixes, mayonnaise, noodles and fast foods.&lt;ref&gt;Sonenklar C: Famous for Egg Waste. Research/ Penn State 1999, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The US food industry generates 150,000 tons of shell waste a year.&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;Hecht J: Eggshells break into collagen market. New Scientist 1999, 161:6-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disposal methods for waste [[eggshells]] are 26.6% as fertilizer, 21.1% as animal feed ingredients, 26.3% discarded in municipal dumps, and 15.8% used in other ways.&lt;ref name="Fermented"&gt;Daengprok W, Garnjanagoonchorn W, Mine Y: Fermented pork sausage fortified with commercial or hen eggshell calcium lactate. Meat Science 2002, 62:199-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many landfills are unwilling to take the waste because the shells and the attached membrane attract vermin.  Together the calcium carbonate eggshell and protein-rich membrane have no value or use.&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;Wei Z, Li B, Xu C: Application of waste eggshell as low-cost solid catalyst for biodiesel production [electronic resource]. Bioresource Technology 2009, 100:2883-2885.&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of an eggshell and membrane separator has allowed for the recycling of these two valuable products.

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
The rich [[calcium carbonate]] shell has been used in the application for [[Hypocalcaemia|calcium deficiency]] therapies in humans and animals.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  A single eggshell has a mass of six grams which yields around 2200&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium.&lt;ref name="Vlad"&gt;Vlad: Eggshell membrane separation method. In US Patent, vol. 7534909. United States: Biova, L.L.C; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Eggshell particles are used in toothpaste as an anti-tartar agent.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt; Powdered eggshells have been used for bone [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] and growth.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;

=== Food industry ===
Recent applications of eggshells in the form of [[calcium lactate]] has been used as a firming agent, a [[flavor enhancer]], a flavoring agent, a [[leavening agent]], a nutrient supplement, a stabilizer, and thickener.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  Eggshells are also used in as a calcium supplement in orange juice.&lt;ref name="Hecht" /&gt;

=== Other issues ===
Eggshells have been incorporated into [[fertilizer]]s as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;Yoo S, Kokoszka J, Zou P, Hsieh JS: Utilization of calcium carbonate particles from eggshell waste as coating pigments for ink-jet printing paper [electronic resource].

== Methods ==
=== Non-chemical separators ===
Joseph H. MacNeil, Professor of Food Science at [[Penn State University]], developed a machine that uses a delicate multi-bladed knife to scrape the membrane from the surface of shell fragments.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeil JH: Method and apparatus for separating a protein membrane and shell material in waste egg shells. In United States Patent (Foundation TPSR ed., vol. 6,176,376. United States: The Penn State Research Foundation; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention uses a water-based method to separate the eggshell and [[Membrane protein|protein membrane]]. The two products are processed in two streams to yield mm size particles of dry membrane and mm size particles of dried shell.

Another non-chemical separation technique utilizes steam heat, [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]], and a light vacuum to separate the hard eggshell from the protein-containing membranes.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams: Egghell membrane separation method.  In US Patent 7,017,277, United States: ESM Technologies, LLC; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention passes shell fragments obtained from egg-breaking facilities through a series of heated augers.  Once the shell and membrane flakes reach the appropriate moisture content, the vacuum pulls them into a cyclone device.  The cyclonic action further separates the heavier eggshell flakes from the lighter membrane flakes.  This invention has been commercialized and can easily separate multiple metric tons per day, allowing for the production of valuable products including commercial volumes of [[natural eggshell membrane]] or NEM.

Levi New invented a non-chemical and non-thermal separation technique that utilizes airflow to pull egg shells through a venturi.  The material is subjected to pressure waves while passing through the venturi.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;New: Eggshell membrane separation process.  In US Patent 8,448,884 B2, United States; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A PulverDryer machine configured with a venturi sized to process egg shell pulverizes the shell component into fine powder and discharges the membrane as an intact dry flake material.  The two components are separated in post processing by a standard shaker screen table, then the membrane is cleaned via one of several standard washing processes, depending on end use.  Up to several tons of egg shell material can be processed per hour.

=== Dissolved air-flotation separation unit ===
The waste eggshells are put into water and then ground to separate the eggshell from the protein membrane.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;  Then the ground eggshell is placed in a separate vessel where air is injected into the water flow.  The air and water mixture causes the lighter component (protein membrane) to float and the heavier (calcium carbonate eggshells) to sink.  This unit recovers 96% of eggshell membrane and 99% of eggshell calcium carbonate in two hours.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;

=== Water and acetic acid ===
The inventor of this method is Vladimir Vlad.  The machine uses unseparated eggshells that are placed in a fluid tank, applying [[cavitation]] to separate the eggshell membrane from the eggshell. The fluid tank in this case contains [[distilled water]] and [[acetic acid]] to provide continuous processing. Also this invention has a method for collecting separated eggshells to grind them into an eggshell powder.&lt;ref name="Vlad" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38521">{{about|the mobility for electrons and holes in metals and semiconductors|the general concept|Electrical mobility}}

In [[solid-state physics]], the '''electron mobility''' characterizes how quickly an [[electron]] can move through a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]], when pulled by an [[electric field]]. There is an analogous quantity for [[Electron hole|holes]], called '''hole mobility'''. The term '''carrier mobility''' refers in general to both electron and hole mobility.

Electron and hole mobility are [[special case]]s of [[electrical mobility]] of charged particles in a fluid under an applied electric field.

When an electric field ''E'' is applied across a piece of material, the electrons respond by moving with an average velocity called the [[drift velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\, v_d&lt;/math&gt;. Then the electron mobility μ is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt;.

Electron mobility is almost always specified in units of [[square centimetre|cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). This is different from the [[SI]] unit of mobility, [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). They are related by 1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s).

[[Electrical conductivity|Conductivity]] is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration. For example, the same conductivity could come from a small number of electrons with high mobility for each, or a large number of electrons with a small mobility for each. For metals, it would not typically matter which of these is the case, since most metal electrical behavior depends on conductivity alone. Therefore mobility is relatively unimportant in metal physics. On the other hand, for semiconductors, the behavior of [[transistor]]s and other devices can be very different depending on whether there are many electrons with low mobility or few electrons with high mobility. Therefore mobility is a very important parameter for semiconductor materials. Almost always, higher mobility leads to better device performance, with other things equal.

Semiconductor mobility depends on the impurity concentrations (including donor and acceptor concentrations), defect concentration, temperature, and electron and hole concentrations. It also depends on the electric field, particularly at high fields when [[velocity saturation]] occurs. It can be determined by the [[Hall effect]], or inferred from transistor behavior.

==Introduction==

===Drift velocity in an electric field===
{{main|Drift velocity}}
Without any applied electric field, in a solid, [[electron]]s  and [[electron hole|holes]] [[Brownian motion|move around randomly]]. Therefore, on average there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction over time.

However, when an electric field is applied, each electron or hole is accelerated by the electric field. If the electron were in a vacuum, it would be accelerated to ever-increasing velocity (called [[ballistic transport]]). However, in a solid, the electron repeatedly scatters off [[Crystallographic defect|crystal defects]], [[phonons]], impurities, etc., so that it loses some energy and changes direction. The final result is that the electron moves with a finite average velocity, called the [[drift velocity]]. This net electron motion is usually much slower than the normally occurring random motion.

The two charge carriers, electrons and holes, will typically have different drift velocities for the same electric field.

Quasi-[[ballistic transport]] is possible in solids if the electrons are accelerated across a very small distance (as small as the [[mean free path]]), or for a very short time (as short as the [[mean free time]]). In these cases, drift velocity and mobility are not meaningful.

===Definition and units===
{{see also|Electrical mobility}}
The electron mobility is defined by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt;.
where:
:''E'' is the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the [[electric field]] applied to a material,
:''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the electron drift velocity (in other words, the electron drift [[speed]]) caused by the electric field, and
:µ is the electron mobility.
The hole mobility is defined by the same equation. Both electron and hole mobilities are positive by definition.

Usually, the electron drift velocity in a material is directly proportional to the electric field, which means that the electron mobility is a constant (independent of electric field). When this is not true (for example, in very large electric fields), the mobility depends on the electric field.

The SI unit of velocity is [[Metre per second|m/s]], and the SI unit of electric field is [[volt|V]]/[[metre|m]]. Therefore the SI unit of mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). However, mobility is much more commonly expressed in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s).

Mobility is usually a strong function of material impurities and temperature, and is determined empirically. Mobility values are typically presented in table or chart form. Mobility is also different for electrons and holes in a given material.

===Relation to conductivity===
There is a simple relation between mobility and [[electrical conductivity]]. Let ''n'' be the [[number density]] (concentration) of electrons, and let μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; be their mobility. In the electric field '''E''', each of these electrons will move with the velocity vector &lt;math&gt;-\mu_e \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;, for a total current density of &lt;math&gt;n e \mu_e \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; (where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]]). Therefore, the electrical conductivity σ satisfies:&lt;ref name=BVZ&gt;[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_7.htm Chapter 2: Semiconductor Fundamentals]. Online textbook by B. Van Zeghbroeck]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=ne\mu_e&lt;/math&gt;.
This formula is valid when the conductivity is due entirely to electrons. In a [[p-type semiconductor]], the conductivity is due to holes instead, but the formula is essentially the same: If ''p'' is the concentration of holes and μ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the hole mobility, then the conductivity is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=pe\mu_h&lt;/math&gt;.
If a semiconductor has both electrons and [[electron hole|holes]], the total conductivity is&lt;ref name=BVZ/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=e(n\mu_e+p\mu_h).&lt;/math&gt;

Typical electron mobility for [[Silicon|Si]] at room temperature (300 K) is 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ (V·s) and the hole mobility is around 450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ (V·s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/SVA/NSM/Semicond/Si/electric.html Electrical properties of silicon], Ioffe Institute Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric field dependence and velocity saturation==
{{main|Velocity saturation}}

At low fields, the drift velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the electric field ''E'', so mobility ''μ'' is constant. This value of ''μ'' is called the ''low-field mobility''.

As the electric field is increased, however, the carrier velocity increases sublinearly and asymptotically towards a maximum possible value, called the ''saturation velocity'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the value of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; is on the order of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s for both electrons and holes in Si. It is on the order of 6×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s for Ge. This velocity is a characteristic of the material and a strong function of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or impurity levels and temperature. It is one of the key material and semiconductor device properties that determine a device such as a transistor's ultimate limit of speed of response and frequency.

This velocity saturation phenomenon results from a process called ''[[optical phonon]] scattering''. At high fields, carriers are accelerated enough to gain sufficient [[kinetic energy]] between collisions to emit an optical phonon, and they do so very quickly, before being accelerated once again. The velocity that the electron reaches before emitting a phonon is:
:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m^*v_{emit}^2}{2} \approx \hbar \omega_{phonon (opt.)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω&lt;sub&gt;phonon(opt.)&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the optical-phonon angular frequency and m* the carrier effective mass in the direction of the electric field. The value of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;phonon (opt.)&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.063 eV for Si and 0.034 eV for GaAs and Ge. The saturation velocity is only one-half of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt;, because the electron starts at zero velocity and accelerates up to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt; in each cycle.&lt;ref name=Mitin&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Vasilʹevich Mitin|author2=Vi︠a︡cheslav Aleksandrovich Kochelap|author3=Michael A. Stroscio|title=Quantum heterostructures: microelectronics and optoelectronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wzo4IdxS48oC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=2 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63635-3|pages=307–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is a somewhat oversimplified description.&lt;ref name=Mitin/&gt;)

Velocity saturation is not the only possible high-field behavior. Another is the [[Gunn effect]], where a sufficiently high electric field can cause intervalley electron transfer, which reduces drift velocity. This is unusual; increasing the electric field almost always ''increases'' the drift velocity, or else leaves it unchanged. The result is [[negative differential resistance]].

In the regime of velocity saturation (or other high-field effects), mobility is a strong function of electric field. This means that mobility is a somewhat less useful concept, compared to simply discussing drift velocity directly.

==Relation between scattering and mobility==
Recall that by definition, mobility is dependent on the drift velocity. The main factor determining drift velocity (other than [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) is [[scattering]] time, i.e. how long the carrier is [[ballistic transport|ballistically accelerated]] by the electric field until it scatters (collides) with something that changes its direction and/or energy. The most important sources of scattering in typical semiconductor materials, discussed below, are ionized impurity scattering and acoustic phonon scattering (also called lattice scattering). In some cases other sources of scattering may be important, such as neutral impurity scattering, optical phonon scattering, surface scattering, and [[crystallographic defect|defect]] scattering.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book|author=Singh|title=Electronic Devices And Integrated Circuits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aqtlybkFE0C&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=1 March 2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3192-1|pages=77–|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastic scattering means that energy is (almost) conserved during the scattering event. Some elastic scattering processes are scattering from acoustic phonons, impurity scattering, piezoelectric scattering, etc. In acoustic phonon scattering, electrons scatter from state '''k''' to''' k'''', while emitting or absorbing a phonon of wave vector '''q'''. This phenomenon is usually modeled by assuming that lattice vibrations cause small shifts in energy bands. The additional potential causing the scattering process is generated by the deviations of bands due to these small transitions from frozen lattice positions.&lt;ref name="sct"&gt;Ferry, David K. Semiconductor transport. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7484-0865-7}} (hbk.), {{ISBN|0-7484-0866-5}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionized impurity scattering===
Semiconductors are doped with donors and/or acceptors, which are typically ionized, and are thus charged. The Coulombic forces will deflect an electron or hole approaching the ionized impurity. This is known as ''[[ionized impurity scattering]]''. The amount of deflection depends on the speed of the carrier and its proximity to the ion. The more heavily a material is doped, the higher the probability that a carrier will collide with an ion in a given time, and the smaller the [[mean free time]] between collisions, and the smaller the mobility. When determining the strength of these interactions due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential, other impurities and free carriers cause the range of interaction with the carriers to reduce significantly compared to bare Coulomb interaction.

If these scatterers are near the interface, the complexity of the problem increases due to the existence of crystal defects and disorders. Charge trapping centers that scatter free carriers form in many cases due to defects associated with dangling bonds. Scattering happens because after trapping a charge, the defect becomes charged and therefore starts interacting with free carriers. If scattered carriers are in the inversion layer at the interface, the reduced dimensionality of the carriers makes the case differ from the case of bulk impurity scattering as carriers move only in two dimensions. Interfacial roughness also causes short-range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Lattice (phonon) scattering===
At any temperature above [[absolute zero]], the vibrating atoms create pressure (acoustic) waves in the crystal, which are termed [[phonon]]s. Like electrons, phonons can be considered to be particles. A phonon can interact (collide) with an electron (or hole) and scatter it. At higher temperature, there are more phonons, and thus increased electron scattering, which tends to reduce mobility.

===Piezoelectric scattering===
Piezoelectric effect can occur only in compound semiconductor due to their polar nature. It is small in most semiconductors but may lead to local electric fields that cause scattering of carriers by deflecting them, this effect is important mainly at low temperatures where other scattering mechanisms are weak. These electric fields arise from the distortion of the basic unit cell as strain is applied in certain directions in the lattice.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Surface roughness scattering===
Surface roughness scattering caused by interfacial disorder is short range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface. From high-resolution transmission electron micrographs, it has been determined that the interface is not abrupt on the atomic level, but actual position of the interfacial plane varies one or two atomic layers along the surface. These variations are random and cause fluctuations of the energy levels at the interface, which then causes scattering.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Alloy scattering===
In compound (alloy) semiconductors, which many thermoelectric materials are, scattering caused by the perturbation of crystal potential due to the random positioning of substituting atom species in a relevant sublattice is known as alloy scattering. This can only happen in ternary or higher alloys as their crystal structure forms by randomly replacing some atoms in one of the sublattices (sublattice) of the crystal structure. Generally, this phenomenon is quite weak but in certain materials or circumstances, it can become dominant effect limiting conductivity. In bulk materials, interface scattering is usually ignored.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name="ssp"&gt;Ibach, Harald. ; Luth, Hans.

===Inelastic scattering===
During inelastic scattering processes, significant energy exchange happens. As with elastic phonon scattering also in the inelastic case, the potential arises from energy band deformations caused by atomic vibrations. Optical phonons causing inelastic scattering usually have the energy in the range 30-50 meV, for comparison energies of acoustic phonon are typically less than 1 meV but some might have energy in order of 10 meV. There is significant change in carrier energy during the scattering process. Optical or high-energy acoustic phonons can also cause intervalley or interband scattering, which means that scattering is not limited within single valley.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Electron–electron scattering===
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, electrons can be considered as non-interacting if their density does not exceed the value 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or electric field value 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V/cm. However, significantly above these limits electron–electron scattering starts to dominate. Long range and nonlinearity of the Coulomb potential governing interactions between electrons make these interactions difficult to deal with.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=bulusu /&gt;

===Relation between mobility and scattering time===
A simple model gives the approximate relation between scattering time (average time between scattering events) and mobility. It is assumed that after each scattering event, the carrier's motion is randomized, so it has zero average velocity. After that, it accelerates uniformly in the electric field, until it scatters again. The resulting average drift mobility is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Y. Yu|author2=Manuel Cardona|title=Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aBuKYBT_hsC&amp;pg=PA205+|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=30 May 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-00709-5|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{m^*}\overline{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' is the [[elementary charge]], m* is the carrier [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], and {{overline|τ}} is the average scattering time.

If the effective mass is anisotropic (direction-dependent), m* is the effective mass in the direction of the electric field.

===Matthiessen's rule===
Normally, more than one source of scattering is present, for example both impurities and lattice phonons. It is normally a very good approximation to combine their influences using "Matthiessen's Rule" (developed from work by [[Augustus Matthiessen]] in 1864):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm lattice}}&lt;/math&gt;.
where µ is the actual mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm impurities}&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility that the material would have if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm lattice}&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility that the material would have if there was lattice phonon scattering but no other source of scattering. Other terms may be added for other scattering sources, for example
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm lattice}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm defects}} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.
Matthiessen's rule can also be stated in terms of the scattering time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm lattice}} + \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm defects}} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''τ'' is the true average scattering time and τ&lt;sub&gt;impurities&lt;/sub&gt; is the scattering time if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, etc.

Matthiessen's rule is an approximation and is not universally valid. This rule is not valid if the factors affecting the mobility depend on each other, because individual scattering probabilities cannot be summed unless they are independent of each other.&lt;ref name=Takeda/&gt;  The average free time of flight of a carrier and therefore the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the scattering probability.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=pallab /&gt; For example, lattice scattering alters the average electron velocity (in the electric-field direction), which in turn alters the tendency to scatter off impurities. There are more complicated formulas that attempt to take these effects into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio Luque|author2=Steven Hegedus|title=Handbook of photovoltaic science and engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-bCMhl_JjQC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=9 June 2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-49196-5|page=79, eq. 3.58}} [http://www.knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=1081 weblink (subscription only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing temperature, phonon concentration increases and causes increased scattering. Thus lattice scattering lowers the carrier mobility more and more at higher temperature. Theoretical calculations reveal that the mobility in [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, is dominated by [[Phonon|acoustic phonon]] interaction. The resulting mobility is expected to be proportional to ''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−3/2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the mobility due to optical phonon scattering only is expected to be proportional to ''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimentally, values of the temperature dependence of the mobility in Si, Ge and GaAs are listed in table.&lt;ref name=BVZ/&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau }\propto \left \langle v\right \rangle\Sigma &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the scattering cross section for electrons and holes at a scattering center and &lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a thermal average (Boltzmann statistics) over all electron or hole velocities in the lower conduction band or upper valence band, temperature dependence of the mobility can be determined. In here, the following definition for the scattering cross section is used: number of particles scattered into solid angle dΩ per unit time divided by number of particles per area per time (incident intensity), which comes from classical mechanics. As Boltzmann statistics are valid for semiconductors 
&lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle\sim\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

For scattering from acoustic phonons, for temperatures well above Debye temperature, the estimated cross section Σ&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; is determined from the square of the average vibrational amplitude of a phonon to be proportional to T. The scattering from charged defects (ionized donors or acceptors) leads to the cross section &lt;math&gt;{\Sigma }_{def}\propto {\left \langle v\right \rangle}^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is the scattering cross section for "Rutherford scattering", where a point charge (carrier) moves past another point charge (defect) experiencing Coulomb interaction.

The temperature dependencies of these two scattering mechanism in semiconductors can be determined by combining formulas for τ, Σ and &lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, to be for scattering from acoustic phonons 
&lt;math&gt;{\mu }_{ph}\sim T^{-3/2}&lt;/math&gt; and from charged defects &lt;math&gt;{\mu }_{def}\sim T^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=pallab /&gt;

The effect of ionized impurity scattering, however, ''decreases'' with increasing temperature because the average thermal speeds of the carriers are increased.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt; Thus, the carriers spend less time near an ionized impurity as they pass and the scattering effect of the ions is thus reduced.

These two effects operate simultaneously on the carriers through Matthiessen's rule. At lower temperatures, ionized impurity scattering dominates, while at higher temperatures, phonon scattering dominates, and the actual mobility reaches a maximum at an intermediate temperature.

==Measurement of semiconductor mobility==

===Hall mobility===
{{Main|Hall effect}}

[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Holes.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for holes]]
[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Electrons.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for electrons]]

Carrier mobility is most commonly measured using the [[Hall effect]]. The result of the measurement is called the "Hall mobility" (meaning "mobility inferred from a Hall-effect measurement").

Consider a semiconductor sample with a rectangular cross section as shown in the figures, a current is flowing in the ''x''-direction and a [[magnetic field]] is applied in the ''z''-direction. The resulting Lorentz force will accelerate the electrons (''n''-type materials) or holes (''p''-type materials) in the (−''y'') direction, according to the right hand rule and set up an electric field ''ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''. As a result there is a voltage across the sample, which can be measured with a [[High impedance|high-impedance]] voltmeter. This voltage, ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the [[Hall effect|Hall voltage]]. ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative for ''n''-type material and positive for ''p''-type material.

Mathematically, the [[Lorentz force]] acting on a charge ''q'' is given by

For electrons:
:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Hn} = -q(\overrightarrow{v}_n \times \overrightarrow{B}_z)&lt;/math&gt;

For holes:
:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Hp} = +q(\overrightarrow{v}_p \times \overrightarrow{B}_z)&lt;/math&gt;

In steady state this force is balanced by the force set up by the Hall voltage, so that there is no [[net force]] on the carriers in the ''y'' direction. For electron,

:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_y = (-q)\overrightarrow{\xi}_y + (-q)[\overrightarrow{v}_n \times \overrightarrow{B}_z] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow -q\xi_y + qv_xB_z = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; \xi_y = v_xB_z&lt;/math&gt;

For electrons, the field points in the -''y'' direction, and for holes, it points in the +''y'' direction.

The [[Electric current|electron current]] ''I'' is given by &lt;math&gt;I = -qnv_xtW&lt;/math&gt;. Sub ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; into the expression for ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:::&lt;math&gt;\xi_y = -\frac{IB}{nqtW} = +\frac{R_{Hn}IB}{tW}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;Hn&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Hall coefficient for electron, and is defined as
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hn} = -\frac{1}{nq}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\xi_y = \frac{V_H}{W}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hn} = -\frac{1}{nq} = \frac{V_{Hn}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for holes
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hp} = \frac{1}{pq} = \frac{V_{Hp}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

From the Hall coefficient, we can obtain the carrier mobility as follows:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n = (-nq)\mu_n(-\frac{1}{nq}) = -\sigma_n R_{Hn}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;= -\frac{\sigma_n V_{Hn}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly,
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p = \frac{\sigma_p V_{Hp}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the value of ''V&lt;sub&gt;Hp&lt;/sub&gt; (Hall voltage), t (sample thickness), I (current) and B (magnetic field)'' can be measured directly, and the conductivities σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; or σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; are either known or can be obtained from measuring the resistivity.

===Field-effect mobility===
{{See also|MOSFET}}
{{Distinguish|Wien effect}}
The mobility can also be measured using a [[field-effect transistor]] (FET). The result of the measurement is called the "field-effect mobility" (meaning "mobility inferred from a field-effect measurement").

The measurement can work in two ways: From saturation-mode measurements, or linear-region measurements.&lt;ref name=Rost&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Rost-Bietsch|title=Ambipolar and Light-Emitting Organic Field-Effect Transistors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxvt0CkVKaIC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3-86537-535-3|pages=17–}}. This reference mistakenly leaves out a factor of 1/V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; in eqn (2.11). The correct version of that equation can be found, e.g., in {{cite journal|last1=Stassen|first1=A. F.|last2=De Boer|first2=R. W. I.|last3=Iosad|first3=N. N.|last4=Morpurgo|first4=A. F.|title=Influence of the gate dielectric on the mobility of rubrene single-crystal field-effect transistors|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=85|issue=17|pages=3899-3901|year=2004|doi=10.1063/1.1812368|arxiv = cond-mat/0407293 |bibcode = 2004ApPhL..85.3899S |url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:868f9c8e-b994-47e8-b2fd-69cca21b1415}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[MOSFET]] for a description of the different modes or regions of operation.)

====Using saturation mode====
In this technique,&lt;ref name=Rost/&gt; for each fixed gate voltage V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;, the drain-source voltage V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is increased until the current I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; saturates. Next, the square root of this saturated current is plotted against the gate voltage, and the slope m&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured. Then the mobility is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = m_{sat}^2 \frac{2L}{W} \frac{1}{C_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' and ''W'' are the length and width of the channel and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area. This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in saturation mode:
:&lt;math&gt;I_D = \frac{\mu C_i}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{th})^2.&lt;/math&gt;
where V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is the threshold voltage. This approximation ignores the [[Early effect]] (channel length modulation), among other things. In practice, this technique may underestimate the true mobility.&lt;ref name=Rost2&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Rost-Bietsch|title=Ambipolar and Light-Emitting Organic Field-Effect Transistors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxvt0CkVKaIC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=20 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3-86537-535-3|pages=19–}} "Extracting the field-effect mobility directly from the linear region of the output characteristic may yield larger values for the field-effect mobility than the actual one, since the drain current is linear only for very small VDS and large VG. In contrast, extracting the field-effect mobility from the saturated region might yield rather conservative values for the field-effect mobility, since the drain-current dependence from the gate-voltage becomes sub-quadratic for large VG as well as for small VDS."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Using the linear region====
In this technique,&lt;ref name=Rost/&gt; the transistor is operated in the linear region (or "ohmic mode"), where V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is small and &lt;math&gt;I_D \propto V_{GS}&lt;/math&gt; with slope m&lt;sub&gt;lin&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the mobility is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = m_{lin} \frac{L}{W} \frac{1}{V_{DS}} \frac{1}{C_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in the linear region:
:&lt;math&gt;I_D= \mu C_i \frac{W}{L} \left( (V_{GS}-V_{th})V_{DS}-\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, this technique may overestimate the true mobility, because if V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is not small enough and V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is not large enough, the MOSFET may not stay in the linear region.&lt;ref name=Rost2/&gt;

===Optical mobility===
Electron mobility may be determined from non-contact laser [[Photo-reflectance|photo-reflectance]] measurements. A series of photo-reflectance measurements are made as the sample is stepped through focus.  The electron diffusion length and recombination time are determined by a regressive fit to the data. Then the Einstein relation is used to calculate the mobility.&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Terahertz mobility===
Electron mobility can be calculated from time-resolved [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy|terahertz probe]] measurement.&lt;ref name="UlbrichtHendry2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulbricht|first1=Ronald|last2=Hendry|first2=Euan|last3=Shan|first3=Jie|last4=Heinz|first4=Tony F.|last5=Bonn|first5=Mischa|title=Carrier dynamics in semiconductors studied with time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=83|issue=2|year=2011|pages=543–586|issn=0034-6861|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.83.543|bibcode=2011RvMP...83..543U|hdl=10871/15671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd-HughesJeon2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd-Hughes|first1=James|last2=Jeon|first2=Tae-In|title=A Review of the Terahertz Conductivity of Bulk and Nano-Materials|journal=Journal of Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves|volume=33|issue=9|year=2012|pages=871–925|issn=1866-6892|doi=10.1007/s10762-012-9905-y|bibcode=2012JIMTW..33..871L}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Femtosecond laser]] pulses excite the semiconductor and the resulting [[photoconductivity]] is measured using a terahertz probe, which detects changes in the terahertz electric field.&lt;ref name="EversSchins2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evers|first1=Wiel H.|last2=Schins|first2=Juleon M.|last3=Aerts|first3=Michiel|last4=Kulkarni|first4=Aditya|last5=Capiod|first5=Pierre|last6=Berthe|first6=Maxime|last7=Grandidier|first7=Bruno|last8=Delerue|first8=Christophe|last9=van der Zant|first9=Herre S.

==Doping concentration dependence in heavily-doped silicon==
The [[charge carrier]]s in semiconductors are electrons and holes. Their numbers are controlled by the concentrations of impurity elements, i.e. doping concentration. Thus doping concentration has great influence on carrier mobility.

While there is considerable scatter in the [[experimental data]], for noncompensated material (no counter doping) for heavily doped substrates (i.e. &lt;math&gt;10^{18}\mathrm{cm}^{-3} &lt;/math&gt; and up), the mobility in silicon is often characterized by the [[empirical relationship]]:&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Anderson and R. L. Anderson, "Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices, " Mc Graw Hill, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_o + \frac{\mu_1}{1+(\frac{N}{N_\text{ref}})^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the doping concentration (either ''N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''), and ''N&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;'' and α are fitting parameters. At [[room temperature]], the above equation becomes:

Majority carriers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caughey|first1=D.M.|last2=Thomas|first2=R.E.|title=Carrier mobilities in silicon empirically related to doping and field|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=55|issue=12|pages=2192-2193|year=1967|doi=10.1109/PROC.1967.6123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n(N_D) = 65 + \frac{1265}{1+(\frac{N_D}{8.5\times10^{16}})^{0.72}}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p(N_A) = 48 + \frac{447}{1+(\frac{N_A}{6.3\times10^{16}})^{0.76}}&lt;/math&gt;

Minority carriers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Del Alamo|first1=J|title=Measuring and modeling minority carrier transport in heavily doped silicon|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47-54|year=1985|doi=10.1016/0038-1101(85)90209-6 |bibcode = 1985SSEle..28...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n(N_A) = 232 + \frac{1180}{1+(\frac{N_A}{8\times10^{16}})^{0.9}}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p(N_D) = 130 + \frac{370}{1+(\frac{N_D}{8\times10^{17}})^{1.25}}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations apply only to silicon, and only under low field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">An '''environmental management scheme''' is a mechanism by which landowners and other individuals and bodies responsible for [[land management]] can be incentivised to manage their environment.

==Schemes by country==

===Australia===

Several schemes (prgrammes) are or have been in operation in [[Australia]], including:
* [[National Heritage Trust Funds (1 and 2)]]
* [[National Action Plan for Salinity]]
* [[Caring for Our Country]]

Other programmes exist with the various states, for example;
New South Wales - Catchment Action Plan

===United Kingdom===

Several schemes are or have been in operation in the [[United Kingdom]], including:
* [[Countryside Stewardship]]
* [[Environmental Stewardship]]
* [[Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme]]

Currently England operates:

* Entry Level Stewardship
* Higher Level Stewardship
* Organic Entry Level Stewardship
* Higher Level Organic Entry Level stewardship

All of these schemes are adminisitered by Natural England

===Scotland===

In 2007 Scotland adopted the SRDP (Scottish Rural Development Programme - a £1.6 billion programme of economic, environmental and social measures designed to develop rural Scotland. Individuals and groups may seek support to help deliver the Government's strategic objectives in rural Scotland.

===Wales===

Until recently the prevailing agri-environment scheme in Wales was Tir Gofal, which means literally ‘Land Care’. It was the first scheme in Wales, and indeed in Europe, aimed at promoting whole farm conservation and management. It was different from previous schemes, as it brought farming and conservation into a different level of partnership.

It was recently announced that this scheme has ceased, with a bridging payment scheme until its replacement is launched.

===France===

In some countries such as [[France]], such schemes may be initiated by the central government:
* [[Schéma directeur d'aménagement et de gestion des eaux]]

===Switzerland===

Switzerland started reforming its agricultural policies in 1993 and after a referendum in 1996, since 1998 the country has linked the attribution of farm subsidies with the strict observance of good environmental practice. Before farmers can apply for subsidies, they must obtain certificates of environmental management systems (EMS) proving that they: “make a balanced use of fertilizers; use at least 7% of their farmland as ecological compensation areas; regularly rotate crops; adopt appropriate measures to protect animals and soil; make limited and targeted use of pesticides.”&lt;ref name = bsf&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/02/22/publ.Document.77351.pdf Swiss Environmental Statistics Office.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Environmental Press (EEP)''' is a [[Europe]]-wide association of nearly two dozen environmental magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.environmental-expert.com/STSE_ResultEach.aspx?cid=6725&amp;idproducttype=1&amp;level=0 EEP European Environmental Press] from [http://www.environmental-expert.com/index.aspx Environmental Expert website]. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The combined circulation is 800.000. Each member is considered the leader in its country and is committed to building links between 400,000 environmental professionals across Europe in both the [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s. The EEP is unique in bringing together the leading national [[business-to-business]] magazines as an expert network for the dissemination of high-quality environmental information throughout Europe. The target market for EEP is highly educated individuals. It deals with different environmental issues across the board, including water supply, waste management, recycling,remediation of contaminated land, air pollution, noise, energy, and tracking technologies as well as environmental administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vanha.uusiouutiset.fi/eep.htm|title=EEP|last=|first=|date=|website=Uusiouutiset|publisher=|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is highly technologically optimistic and has focused on many technological solutions to environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transnational Identity Politics and the Environment|last=Ignatow|first=Gabriel|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2007|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=66|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Environmental Press presents various companies with awards that relate to creating clever and efficient solutions to environmental problems as well as in their efforts to reduce pollution and contribute to bettering the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transnational Identity Politics and the Environment|last=Gabriel|first=Ignatow|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2007|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=67|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do this in association with Pollutec,a French trade-show company and is endorsed by The European Network of Environmental Professionals (EFAP). Applications are announced and nobody is exempt from the opportunity to participate.A committee gathers and nominates ten winners from all the ones that applied. The committee then decides the winners from the nominated batch. There are three winners,  gold, silver and bronze. The gold winners receive spreads in the EEP magazines and they also get the opportunity to present their projects at various conferences across Europe the most important one being Pollutec. Being nominated is also useful for the companies as their work often gets cited in the magazine, sparking discussion, fundraising and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanlaser.de/wEnglish/news/meldungen/2009-10-14-51996617-meldung.php?navanchor=2110061|title=Nominated for EEP Award 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=Clean Laser|publisher=Clean Laser|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== China and the European Environmental Press ==
The Guardian and the EEP collaborated in May 2010 in recognizing China's efforts at reducing pollution and taking steps towards a more sustainable future. This was also a journalism event, honoring journalists who were doing new and thorough investigations of the country's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/chinas-first-environmental-press-awards|title=China's first Environmental Press Awards praises fresh journalism|last=|first=|date=May 14, 2010|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009).  These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.&lt;ref name=running2011 /&gt;

A '''fuel tax''' (also known as a '''petrol''', '''gasoline''' or '''gas tax''',  or as a '''fuel duty''') is an [[excise tax]] imposed on the sale of [[fuel]]. In most countries the fuel tax is imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home [[heating oil]] which is similar to [[diesel fuel|diesel]] are taxed at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel tax receipts are often dedicated or [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecated]] to transportation projects so that the fuel tax is considered by many a [[user fee]]. In other countries, the fuel tax is a source of general revenue. Sometimes, the fuel tax is used as an [[ecotax]], to promote ecological sustainability. Fuel taxes are often considered {{By whom|date=October 2017}} [[regressive tax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/whys/thm03/les05/media/ws_ans_thm03_les05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in energy policy==

Taxes on [[transportation]] fuels have been advocated as a way to reduce pollution and the possibility of [[global warming]] and conserve energy.  Placing higher taxes on fossil fuels makes petrol just as expensive as other fuels such as natural gas, [[biodiesel]] or electric batteries, at a cost to the consumer in the form of inflation as transportation costs rise to transport goods all over the country.

Proponents advocate that automobiles should pay for the roads they use and argue that the user tax should not be applied to mass transit projects.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the [[International Energy Agency]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]] have called on governments to increase gasoline tax rates in order to combat the social and environmental costs of gasoline consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Michael L.|last2=Hazlett|first2=Chad|last3=Mahdavi|first3=Paasha|title=Global progress and backsliding on gasoline taxes and subsidies|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016201|journal=Nature Energy|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1038/nenergy.2016.201|bibcode=2017NatEn...216201R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2010}}
International pump prices for diesel and gasoline for November 2010 are available at https://web.archive.org/web/20110315151539/http://www.gtz.de/en/themen/29957.htm .  Price history from surveys taken in November of even number years are also available. Price differences mostly reflect differences in tax policy. 

A Nature study has shown that while gasoline taxes have increased in more countries than they have decreased in during the period 2003-2015, the global mean gasoline tax has decreased due to greater consumption in the low tax countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Chinese gasoline taxes have increased the most among the top twenty CO2-emitting countries over the period 2003-2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[China]], fuel tax has been a very contentious issue. Efforts by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] to institute a fuel tax in order to finance the [[National Trunk Highway System]] have run into strong opposition from the [[National People's Congress]], largely out of concern for its impact on farmers.  This has been one of the uncommon instances in which the legislature has asserted its authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====India====
In [[India]], the pricing of fuel varies by state, though central taxes still are part of the pump price of fuel. The Central and state government's taxes make up nearly half of petrol's pump price. The Central govt has different taxes, which amount to about 24–26% of the final cost. The states taxes vary, but on average end up making about 20–25% of the final cost. As a result, approximately 51% of the pump cost goes to the government in the form of different taxes.

For example, in [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Karnataka]] as of May 16, 2011, price of petrol is {{INRConvert|71.09}} per litre. Out of this, {{INRConvert|17.06}} go to [[Govt of India]] in the form of excise and customs tax. {{INRConvert|16.63}} is collected by [[Government of Karnataka|state government]] in the form of sales tax and entry tax. Thus, a total of {{INRConvert|33.69}} is collected due to various taxes (which accounts for around 47% of the total price).&lt;ref name="Half of what you pay for petrol is taxes"&gt;

====France====
Petroleum products destined for utilisation by aircraft engaged in commercial flights outside of the customs territory of continental France are exempt from all customs duties and domestic taxes.&lt;ref&gt;France Customs Code (Code des Douanes) Article 195&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Fuel taxes in Germany are €0.4704 per litre for ultra-low sulphur Diesel and €0.6545 per litre for conventional unleaded petrol, plus Value Added Tax (19%) on the fuel itself and the Fuel Tax. That adds up to prices of €1.12 per litre for ultra-low sulphur Diesel and €1.27 per litre (approximately US$6.14 per US gallon) for unleaded petrol (December 2014).

====Netherlands====
The sale of fuels in the [[Netherlands]] is levied with an [[excise tax]]. As of 2015, petrol excise tax is EUR0.766 per litre and diesel excise tax is EUR0.482 per litre, while LPG excise tax is EUR0.185 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 fuel tax was €0.684 per litre or $3.5 per gallon. On top of that is 21% VAT over the entire fuel price, making the Dutch taxes one of the highest in the world. In total, taxes account for 68.84% of the total price of petrol and 56.55% of the total price of diesel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minfin.nl/Onderwerpen/Belastingen/Kostprijsverhogende_belastingen/Accijnzen_en_verbruiksbelastingen/Feiten_over_belasting_op_brandstof#internelink2 ]{{dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 excise was raised by [[Dutch gulden]] 25 cents (€0.11), the ''Kok Quarter'' (€0.08 raise per litre [[gasoline]] and €0.03 raise per litre [[diesel fuel|diesel]]), by then Prime-Minister [[Wim Kok]] is now specifically set aside by the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] for use in road creation and road and public transport maintenance.

====Norway====
Motor fuel is taxed with both a ''road use tax'' and a ''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tax''. The road use tax on petrol is [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 4.62 per litre and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tax on petrol is NOK 0.88 per litre. The road use tax on auto diesel is NOK 3.62 per litre mineral oil and NOK 1.81 per litre bio diesel. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tax on mineral oil is NOK 0.59 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statsbudsjettet.no/Statsbudsjettet-2011/English/?pid=48921#hopp Main features of the Government’s tax programme for 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
In [[Poland]] half of the end-user price charged at a petrol station goes towards 3 distinct taxes:
* akcyza (meaning [[excise]])
* opłata paliwowa (meaning fuel tax)
* Value-added tax "[[VAT]]" at 23% (from summary of akcyza and opłata paliwowa, and the price of petrol)
Excise and fuel tax are prescribed by [[European Union|European Commission law]], and therefore cannot be lower in any [[European Union|EU]] nation. However it is even higher than this EU minimum in Poland, a policy pursued by the former [[Jan Vincent-Rostowski|Minister of finance]].

*Natural gas: 147 RUR/1000m³ (4 €/1000m³).
*Petroleum gas: no

Excise tax on motor fuel 2008–2009:
*RON &gt;80: 3629 RUR/t. (0.071 €/l = 0.343 $/US gal)
*RON &lt;=80: 2657 RUR/t. (0.052 €/l = 0.251 $/US

Other fuel (like avia gasoline, jet fuel, heavy oils, natural gas and autogas) prices has no excise tax.

Value Added Tax — 18% on fuel and taxes.

Full tax rate is near 55% of motor fuel prices (ministry of industry and energy facts 2006).

====Sweden====
The fuel tax in Sweden comprises a [[carbon tax]] and an [[energy tax]]. The total tax (including [[value added tax]]) is, from July 1, 2018, {{SEK|8.425}} per liter petrol and {{SEK|7.425}} per liter diesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skatteverket.se/foretagochorganisationer/skatter/punktskatter/energiskatter/skattesatserochvaxelkurser.4.77dbcb041438070e0395e96.html|title=Skattesatser på bränslen och el under 2016|website=skatteverket.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Hydrocarbon oil duty}}
From 23 March 2011 the UK duty rate for the road fuels unleaded petrol, diesel, biodiesel and bioethanol is {{GBP|0.5795}} per litre (£2.63 per imperial gallon or £2.19 per U.S. gallon).&lt;ref name=hmrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2011/tiin6330.pdf|title=Hydrocarbon Oils: Duty Rates|publisher=HMRC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523135710/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2011/tiin6330.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Value Added Tax]] at 20% is also charged on the price of the fuel and on the duty. An additional [[vehicle excise duty]], depending on a vehicle's theoretical CO2 production per kilometre, which is applied regardless of the amount of fuel actually consumed, is also levied.

Diesel for use by farmers and construction vehicles is coloured red (Red Diesel) and has a much reduced tax, currently {{GBP|0.1133}} per litre (£0.52 per imperial gallon or £0.43 per U.S. gallon).&lt;ref name=hmrc/&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Motor fuel taxes in Canada}}

[[Fuel taxes in Canada]] can vary greatly between locales. On average, about one-third of the total price of gas at the pump is tax.  [[Excise tax]]es on [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] are collected both federal and provincial governments, as well as by some select municipalities ([[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]); with combined excise taxes varying from 16.2&amp;nbsp;¢/L (73.6&amp;nbsp;¢/imperial gal; 61.2&amp;nbsp;¢/US&amp;nbsp;gal) in the [[Yukon]] to 30.5 ¢/L ($1.386/imperial gal; $1.552/?US&amp;nbsp;gal) in [[Vancouver]].

====United States====

{{Main|Fuel taxes in the United States}}

The first U.S. state to enact a gas tax was [[Oregon]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ball &amp; Moran| title=Penny Lane, Literally: Funding Roads One Vehicle Mile at a Time| journal=Willamette Environmental Law Journal| date=2016| volume=5| page=1| url=https://willamette.edu/law/resources/journals/welj/pdf/2016/2016-f-welj-moran.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states of [[Colorado]], [[North Dakota]], and [[New Mexico]] followed shortly thereafter. By 1929, all existing 48 states had enacted some sort of gas tax.&lt;ref name="Pain at the Pump"&gt;"Pain at the Pump", Rall, Jamie. State Legislatures magazine; June 2013. National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, fuel taxes in the United States vary by state. The United States federal [[excise tax]] on gasoline is 18.4 cents per gallon (4.86&amp;nbsp;¢/L) and 24.4 cents per gallon (6.45&amp;nbsp;¢/L) for [[diesel fuel]]. On average, as of July 2016, state and local taxes add 29.78 cents to gasoline and 29.81 cents to diesel for a total US average fuel tax of 48.18 cents per gallon for gas (12.89&amp;nbsp;¢/L) and 54.21 cents per gallon for diesel (14.37&amp;nbsp;¢/L).&lt;ref name="Motor Fuel Taxes: State Gasoline Tax Reports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/consumer-information/motor-fuel-taxes|title=Motor Fuel Taxes: State Gasoline Tax Reports|date=|year=2016|publisher=API}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state and local tax figures includes fixed-per-gallon taxes as well as variable-rate taxes such as those levied as a percentage of the sales price.  For state-level fuel taxes, nineteen states and the District of Columbia levy variable-rate taxes of some kind.&lt;ref name="Most Americans Live in States with Variable-Rate Gas Taxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itep.org/itep_reports/2016/02/most-americans-live-in-states-with-variable-rate-gas-taxes-2.php|title=Most Americans Live in States with Variable-Rate Gas Taxes|date=|year=2016|publisher=ITEP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other thirty one states do not tie the per-gallon tax rate to inflation, gas prices, or other factors, and the rate changes only by legislation. As of July 2016, twenty one states had gone ten years or more without an increase in their per-gallon gasoline tax rate.&lt;ref name="How Long Has It Been Since Your State Raised Its Gas Tax?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itep.org/itep_reports/2016/06/how-long-has-it-been-since-your-state-raised-its-gas-tax-1.php|title=How Long Has It Been Since Your State Raised Its Gas Tax?|date=|year=2016|publisher=ITEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the fuel tax is universally styled as a "road use" tax, exempting off-road farming, marine, etc. use; states impose a tax on commercial operators traveling through their state as if the fuel used was bought there, wherever the fuel is purchased. While most commercial truck drivers have an agent to handle the required paperwork: what's reported is how much tax was collected in each state, how much should have been paid to each state, the net tax for each state and the combined net tax for all states to be paid by or refunded to the operator by their base jurisdiction where they file. The operator carries paperwork proving compliance. The member jurisdictions, the US states and the CA provinces, transmit the return information to each other and settle their net tax balances with each other either by a single transmittal through a clearinghouse set up by the IFTA and operated by Morgan Stanley, or by separate transfers with the other member jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="IFTA"&gt;[http://www.iftach.org International Fuel Tax Agreement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
The [[Fuel taxes in Australia|fuel tax system in Australia]] is very similar to [[Canada]] in terms of featuring both a fixed and a variable tax, but varies in the case of exemptions including [[tax credits]] and certain excise free fuel.

Since October 2018, the fuel tax in Australia is A$0.412 per litre for petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel (conventional diesel being taxed at A$0.412 per litre) and the excise for LPG is $0.282 per litre. Since 2000, there is also the GST (goods and services tax) on top of the fuel tax and inflation calculated twice a year called CPI (consumer price index) into the fuel tax since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ato.gov.au/business/excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/fuel-excise/excise-rates-for-fuel/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
Fuel taxes in [[New Zealand]] are considered an [[excise]] applied by the [[New Zealand Customs Service]] on shipments brought into the country. A breakdown of the fuel taxes is published by the [http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/Page____12961.aspx  Ministry of Economic Development]. Excise as at 1 August 2012 totals 50.524 cents per litre ($1.89/imperial&amp;nbsp;gal; $1.58/US&amp;nbsp;gal) on petrol. In addition the national compulsory [https://web.archive.org/web/20100602001025/http://www.acc.co.nz/news/PRD_CTRB091172 Accident Compensation Corporation] motor vehicle account receives a contribution of 9.9 cents/litre (37.1¢/imperial&amp;nbsp;gal; 30.9¢/US&amp;nbsp;gal). The ethanol component of bio blended petrol currently attracts no excise duty. This was to be reviewed in 2012. Diesel is not taxed at the pump, but road users with vehicles over 3.5 tonne in Gross Laden Weight and any vehicles not powered wholly by any combination of petrol, LPG or CNG must pay the [http://www.landtransport.govt.nz/commercial/ruc.html Road User Charge] instead. The [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|Goods and Services Tax]] (15%) is then applied to the combined total of the value of the commodity  and the various taxes.

Doman, along with noted German-born aerospace engineer [[Kurt Hohenemser]] (a partner and confidant of the well-known German airplane and helicopter designer [[Anton Flettner]]), maintained that a flexible two-bladed helicopter type wind turbine rotor design that is compliant with the forces of nature was more suitable for producing electricity than the rigid industry standard three-bladed airplane type wind turbine rotors that, by design, can only be constructed to resist the forces of nature.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spera|first1=David A.|title=Wind Turbine Technology: Fundamental Concepts of Wind Turbine Engineering|date=2009|publisher=ASME Press|pages=Chapter 10|ref=Wind Turbine Engineering System Designs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Kurt Hohenemser, Early Helicopter Designer, Dies at 95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/21/us/kurt-hohenemser-early-helicopter-designer-dies-at-95.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anton Flettner|journal=The New York Times|date=December 30, 1961|volume=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohenemser|first1=Kurt H.|title=Letter to Mr. Raven – The Great Nephew of Anton Flettner|date=September 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Glidden Sweet Doman, the son of Albert E. Doman and Ruth Sweet Doman, was born in Syracuse, New York, on January 28, 1921.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orred|first1=Susan R.|title=Local Granby Resident is Pioneer in Helicopter and Wind Turbine Design|url=http://patch.com/connecticut/granby-eastgranby/an--local-granby-resident-is-pioneer-in-helicopter-an96a6cdf30c|website=Granby Patch|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in the small upstate New York village of Elbridge, Doman came from a family of inventors and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; His father Albert and uncles Lewis and George Doman were the first to provide electricity for Elbridge, in 1890.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman's elder half-brother, Carl T. Doman, designed air cooled Franklin engines for Franklin automobiles and for aircraft – including for the pioneering [[Sikorsky VS-300]] helicopter.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

In his teens, Doman built a series of six motorized "go carts", and in 1936, at the age of 15, he built a Soapbox Derby racer, the first to be aerodynamically streamlined.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; He won the regional Soapbox Derby race held in Syracuse and placed well in the national championship race in Akron, Ohio. (2)(4) Doman also attempted to build an airplane, completing much of the fuselage, but was never able to obtain an engine for it.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

In 1938, Doman enrolled at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) College of Engineering, where he majored in aeronautical engineering.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; While at Michigan, Doman joined and later became president of the flying club.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Another member of the flying club, Joan Hamilton, Doman's future bride, was the only female member of the club.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Hamilton obtained her private's pilot license and later during World War II she was invited by the famous aviatrix [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]] to join the WASPs (Women Air Force Service Pilots), but she declined the offer.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;
[[File:R-4 AC HNS1 3 300.jpg|thumb|Sikorsky R-4 (August 14, 1944, the world's first large-scale mass produced helicopter)|300px]]

== First employments ==

Doman graduated from Michigan in June 1942, just six months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; After his graduation, he went to work for the Ranger Aircraft Engine Division of Fairchild Aviation in Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman had prior experience working with engine technologies while employed during summer vacations at the Franklin Engine Company (where his brother Carl worked).&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; At Ranger, Doman gained experience in using strain gauges to analyze the vibratory loads on the rotating parts of engines.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Carl Doman, who knew [[Igor Sikorsky]] due to the Franklin engine's use in the [[Sikorsky VS-300]], invited Doman to attend a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in New York.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; At this event, with Sikorsky as a featured speaker, Doman became interested in the vibratory loads in helicopter rotors.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; As a new and unrefined invention at that time, helicopters were suffering from rotor blades with a very short fatigue life.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; In fact, not long after Doman met Sikorsky, a Sikorsky YR-4 had a blade fracture during a delivery flight to the Army, which stimulated Doman's interest all the more.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

In August 1943, Doman married Joan Hamilton and they immediately moved to Stamford, Connecticut where he commuted to and from work for [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] in Bridgeport, CT.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Doman put strain gages all over the rotor system of a Sikorsky YR-4 to locate the weak points.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; He then figured out where and how to change the rotor system to achieve longer blade life.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman's contributions were so vital that Igor Sikorsky himself appealed to Doman's Draft Board to keep him on the test program instead of sending him into the Army or Navy.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Doman discovered that the design of the rotor hub was the real cause of the blade failures.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; For the duration of World War II, he ran a program to match and balance the blades of all the Sikorsky helicopters before they were delivered.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Throughout his tenure at Sikorsky, Doman was continuously learning about rotor dynamics.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

Doman had one very harrowing experience at Sikorsky when he was flying as a test engineer on a YR-4.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; The pilot had slowed the helicopter to very low speed, and it got into the so-called "vortex ring state" where the blades lose lift and the helicopter thrashes around in an almost uncontrollable fashion.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Fatal crashes from such an event have resulted more than once in the history of rotary wing aviation.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; In this case, however, the pilot somehow got the helicopter flying backwards, which enabled the blades to regain their lifting ability and prevent a crash.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; While at Sikorsky, Doman got to know [[Igor Sikorsky]], and for years afterwards Doman liked to repeat his favorite quote from [[Igor Sikorsky]], "God takes care of helicopters."&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

== The Doman Helicopter company ==

Together with Clinton Frazier, a mathematician and colleague at [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]], Doman left Sikorsky after WW II to further develop and implement his ideas.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman-Frazier Helicopters, Inc. was established in the autumn of 1945.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; The company was initially located in the back of a law office in New York City, but soon moved into a barn in Stratford, Connecticut, not far from the Sikorsky plant.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; With financial assistance from the [[United States Army Air Corps]], Doman obtained a war surplus R-6 Sikorsky helicopter.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikorsky R-6 Doman Conversion (LZ-1A)|url=https://www.neam.org/ac-sikorsky-r6.php|website=New England Air Museum|publisher=The New England Air Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doman and his engineering team modified the R-6 by creating an entirely new rotor system which featured a unique gimbaled rotor hub that was subsequently used in all Doman helicopters.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; After extensive successful flight testing of the modified Sikorsky R-6 (Doman LZ-1A), Doman's team designed and built, in a joint venture with the [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corp., an all-new Doman helicopter, the CW-40.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The CW-40 was followed a couple of years later by the [[Doman LZ-5]]/YH-31.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The many innovative features in this helicopter were soon covered by numerous Doman patents.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Meanwhile, after the departure of Mr. Frazier, the company was renamed Doman Helicopters, Inc. and moved to Danbury, CT.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman Helicopters continued for nearly 20 years, building and testing several helicopters and performing other related aircraft work to sustain the company while it attempted to establish itself as a major helicopter manufacturer.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; The [[Doman LZ-5]]/YH-31 helicopters were extensively tested by the company and by the U.S. Army and Navy.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; They received certification from the United States [[FAA]], and from the equivalent Canadian authority, for sale and commercial use, after passing the rigorous tests necessary for such approvals. [[Doman LZ-5]]/YH-31 helicopters toured the U.S. and were well received by potential customers, especially in the oil industry along the Gulf Coast.  One even toured in France and Italy performing at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Doman helicopters were a technical success but the company was unable to raise sufficient venture capital to set up an assembly line for mass production.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The company ceased operations in 1969 and was legally dissolved shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

== Wind turbines and careers with other companies ==

In January 1970, Doman went to work for [[Boeing Vertol]] – Boeing's helicopter division in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; There he continued his helicopter pioneering, working on U.S. Army funded research and patenting additional design improvements for helicopter speed increases and vibration reductions.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The [[1973 arab oil embargo]] triggered a great interest in wind energy at [[Boeing]] and numerous other companies.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; While continuing his helicopter innovations, Doman began to conduct wind turbine research.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; He adapted computer simulation models designed for helicopters to study wind turbines.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman and his team then built scale-model wind turbines to test them in a wind tunnel normally used for helicopters and airplanes.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Doman soon understood the similarities and key differences between wind turbines and helicopters.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Wind turbine designers with no experience in helicopters might not know the lessons-learned from the history of helicopter technology, but by the mid-1970s Doman had more than 30 years of such learning that was directly applicable to wind turbines.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; [[Boeing]]'s MOD-2 with the Doman-conceived flexible design, two-bladed wind turbine with a teeter hinge, became a flagship achievement in a 7-year [[NASA]] managed wind energy program for the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

In January 1978, Doman returned to Connecticut as Chief Systems Engineer of the wind energy program at [[Hamilton Standard]] division of [[United Technologies]].&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glidden Sweet Doman|url=https://www.neam.org/air-museum-news.php|website=American Helicopter Society|publisher=American Helicopter Society Internationsl|accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Doman's extensive knowledge of rotor dynamics for both helicopters and wind turbines, [[United Technologies]] designed and built two of the largest wind turbines ever built up to that time (i.e. WTS-3, WTS-4).&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Key features of those turbines, in addition to their size, were the use of only two blades (instead of three, which is more common) and the mounting of the blades on a teeter hinge hub.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; This was analogous to Doman's use of the gimbaled hub on his helicopters, which had 4-bladed rotors.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; One turbine (WTS-4) was installed and successfully tested at Medicine Bow, Wyoming, and the other (WTS-3) in Sweden.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; The WTS-4 wind turbine held the world power output record for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt; Throughout all the research studies and the testing of the actual turbines, there was rapid evolution in Doman's thinking on the best design concepts.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; However, when oil prices plummeted in the mid-1980s, United Technologies deemed the wind energy market to be uneconomical and halted the program.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;
[[File:WTS4 wind turbine.jpg|thumb|WTS-4 (4 MW wind turbine in Medecine Bow, Wyoming.  This turbine held the world power output record for over 20 years)|300px]]
The Italian government took notice of Doman's work, and in July 1987, when Doman retired from [[United Technologies]], he was hired by [[Aeritalia]] (the Italian manufacturer later known as [[Alenia Aeronautica|Alenia]]) and moved to Rome to head Italy's wind energy program.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; In this program, Doman applied his latest thinking to a new machine, considerably improved over the WTS-4 and WTS-3 machines he had designed for installation in Wyoming and Sweden respectively.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Under Doman's leadership a team of Italian engineers designed the Gamma 60 turbine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; The Gamma 60 was the world's first [[variable speed wind turbine]] with a teeter hinge.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin|first1=P.W.|last2=Laxson|first2=A.S.|last3=Muljadi|first3=E.B.|title=The History and State of the Art of Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Technology|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28607.Pdf|website=NREL|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=February 1, 2001|ref=NREL/TP-500-28607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Gamma 60 turbines were manufactured, and one was erected and successfully tested for 4 years on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; There had been intentions to build many more Gamma 60 turbines, but Italian politics and a lack of urgency due to relatively low oil prices in the 1990s resulted in the program being cancelled.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

In 2003, Doman and Italian nuclear mechanical engineer Silvestro Caruso formed a new company, Gamma Ventures Inc., and bought two unused turbines, the engineering drawings, and manufacturing rights from the Italian Gamma 60 project.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; In 2007, Gamma Ventures sold a turbine and manufacturing rights to the Dutch company – Blue H Technologies – that was adapting offshore oil platform technology to put wind turbines on floating platforms in deep water far from shore.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Blue H Technologies installed the world's first floating offshore wind turbine in 2008 in the Southern Adriatic Sea with a two-bladed wind turbine.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebbert|first1=Stephanie|last2=Daley|first2=Beth|title=Proposal Could Calm Storm Over Wind Farm|url=http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2008/03/15/proposal_could_calm_storm_over_wind_farm/|website=Boston Globe|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some revisions in corporate structures and plans, the Gamma rights were eventually transferred to a new company, Seawind, which is working on placing turbines with Gamma-type rotors on concrete offshore support structures, aiming to do so in numerous locations around the world.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

== The persistent innovator ==

Doman remained active right up to the end of his life in 2016; thoroughly engaged in business, technical strategies, and analysis toward superior wind turbine performance at less cost in the application of his novel rotor technologies.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; He was also an avid supporter of the [[New England Air Museum]] (in Windsor Locks, Connecticut), where two of his helicopters – the converted R-6 (Doman-LZ1A) and a [[Doman LZ-5]]/YH-31 – are on display.&lt;ref name="thirteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Paul|title=Jane's All the World's Aircraft|date=2016|publisher=Jane's Information Group|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the original 6 helicopter companies in the United States, Doman was the last company founder to pass away.&lt;ref name="four"  /&gt; He was one of the few helicopter pioneers to have transferred rotor dynamics technology from helicopters to wind turbines.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

A Norwegian project announced in February 2017, involving Dr. Techn. Olav Olsen and Seawind, aims to demonstrate the wind energy applications put forth by Glidden Doman, [[Anton Flettner]], and [[Kurt Hohenemser]] in harsh wind and sea conditions.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seawind, Olav Olsen to Jointly Bring Forward 6.2 MW Demo Project|url=http://www.offshorewind.biz/2017/02/21/seawind-olav-olsen-to-jointly-bring-forward-6-2mw-demo-project/|website=offshoreWIND.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Doman worked through to his final days to ensure that one day wind-generated electricity will be produced in great quantities, much less expensively than now, using his advanced rotor technology concepts.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

The '''HVDC Tjæreborg''' is a 4.3 kilometre long bipolar [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) [[electric power transmission]] line for demonstrating and testing DC interconnection of a [[wind park]] to the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[power grid]]. The line was constructed to connect an existing onshore wind park consisting of 4 windmills in Tjæreborg Enge to the grid through an additional DC line. Thus the mills can be connected to the grid by both the new HVDC, the old AC or a combination of both lines.

The HVDC Tjæreborg was commissioned in 2000 and is designed for a voltage of 9 kV and a maximum power rating of 7.2 megawatt.

The technology of HVDC allows a better regulation of power peaks.

{{Electrical Wiring Sidebar}}
'''IEC 60364''' ''Electrical Installations for Buildings'' is the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'s [[international standard]] on ''electrical installations of buildings''. This standard is an attempt to harmonize national wiring standards in an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard and is published in the European Union by [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] as "HD 60364". The latest versions of many European wiring regulations (e.g., [[BS 7671]] in the UK) follow the section structure of IEC 60364 very closely, but contain additional language to cater for historic national practice and to simplify field use and determination of compliance by electrical tradesmen and inspectors. National codes and site guides are meant to attain the common objectives of IEC 60364, and provide rules in a form that allows for guidance of persons installing and inspecting electrical systems.

The standard has several parts:
* Part 1: Fundamental principles, assessment of general characteristics, definitions
* Part 4: Protection for [[electrical safety|safety]]
** Section 41: Protection against [[electric shock]]
** Section 42: Protection against thermal effects
** Section 43: Protection against [[overcurrent]]
** Section 44: Protection against voltage disturbances and [[electromagnetic interference|electromagnetic disturbances]]
* Part 5: Selection and erection of electrical equipment
** Section 51: Common rules
** Section 52: Wiring systems
** Section 53: Isolation, switching and control
** Section 54: [[Earthing arrangements]], protective conductors and protective bonding conductors
** Section 55: Other equipment (Note: Some national standards provide an individual document for each chapter of this section, i.e. 551 Low-voltage generating sets, 557 Auxiliary circuits, 559 Luminaires and lighting installations)
** Section 56: Safety services
* Part 6: Verification
* Part 7: Requirements for special installations or locations
** Section 701: Electrical installations in bathrooms
** Section 702: Swimming pools and other basins
** Section 703: Rooms and cabins containing sauna heaters
** Section 704: Construction and demolition site installations
** Section 705: Electrical installations of agricultural and horticultural premises
** Section 706: Restrictive conductive locations
** Section 708: Electrical installations in caravan parks and caravans
** Section 709: Marinas and pleasure craft
** Section 710: Medical locations
** Section 712: Solar photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems
** Section 713: Furniture
** Section 714: External lighting
** Section 715: [[extra-low voltage|Extra-low-voltage]] lighting installations
** Section 717: Mobile or transportable units
** Section 718: Communal facilities and workplaces
** Section 721: Electrical installations in caravans and motor caravans
** Section 722: Supplies for Electric Vehicles
** Section 729: Operating or maintenance gangways
** Section 740: Temporary electrical installations for structures, amusement devices and booths at fairgrounds, amusement parks and circuses
** Section 753: Heating cables and embedded heating systems

'''Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{lang-ru|Ленинградская атомная электростанция; Ленинградская АЭС}} ({{Pronunciation|Ru-Ленинградская атомная электростанция.ogg}})) is a [[nuclear power plant]] located in the town of [[Sosnovy Bor, Leningrad Oblast|Sosnovy Bor]] in [[Russia|Russia's]] [[Leningrad Oblast]], on the southern shore of the [[Gulf of Finland]], some {{convert|70|km}} to the west of the city centre of [[Saint Petersburg]].  It consists of four nuclear reactors of the [[RBMK]]-1000 type. These reactors are similar to reactors No. 1 and 2 of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. Two units of the [[VVER]]-1200 type are under construction at Power Plant II to replace the current RBMK reactors when they reach the end of their service lives.

On 25 October 2008, Saint Petersburg [[Atomenergoprom|Atomenergoproekt]] began concreting the foundation plate of the reactor building of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant II, Unit 1. Cost of the project is estimated to be almost 70&amp;nbsp;billion [[Russian ruble]] (RUR).&lt;ref name="ros1"&gt;[http://www.rosatom.ru/en/news/12405_27.10.2008 Leningrad NPP-2: Concreting of the foundation plate of the reactor building of the 1st unit started;  27 October 2008]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wnuc"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Construction_starts_at_Leningrad_II-2710084.html Construction starts at Leningrad II; 27 October 2008]:&lt;/ref&gt;  A construction licence was issued on 22 July 2009.&lt;ref name=wnn220709&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Go_ahead_for_second_Leningrad_II_unit-2207095.html | publisher=World Nuclear News

==Incidents and accidents==
[[Image:RIAN archive 894448 Leningradskaya nuclear power plant.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fuel-handling assembly at Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant]]

The first accident at the plant occurred shortly after the first unit came online.  On 7 January 1975 a concrete tank containing radioactive gases from Unit 1 exploded; there were no reported accident victims or radiation releases.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Encyclopedia 1996"&gt;Nuclear Encyclopedia, chief editor A. A. Yaroshinskaya. - Moscow: the Charity Fund of Yaroshinskaya, 1996. - 656p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"&gt;V. M. Kuznetsov, Russian Nuclear Power Engineering Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Opinion of independent expert. - Moscow: National press institute, 2000. - 288 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than one month later, on 6 February 1975, the secondary cooling circuit of Unit 1 ruptured, releasing contaminated water into the environment. Three people were killed, and the accident was not reported in the media.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Encyclopedia 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"/&gt;

On 28 November 1975 a fuel channel in Unit 1 suffered a loss of coolant, resulting in the degradation of a nuclear fuel assembly that led to a significant release of radiation lasting for one month. Immediately after the accident, the radiation level in Sosnovy Bor, {{convert|5|km}} from the affected power unit, was 600 mR/h; in total, 1.5 [[megacurie|MCi]] was released into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=23b64xeqUnEC&amp;pg=PA88 Controlling Technology By Stephen H. Unger, p. 88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The exposed inhabitants of the Baltic region were not notified of the danger. The accident was not reported in the media. (Practically the same accident occurred in Unit 1 of the Chernobyl Power Station in 1982.)&lt;ref name="Nuclear Encyclopedia 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melnikov, N.B. Malevannaya 1999"&gt;V. A. Melnikov, N. B. Malevannaya, Radiological Safety During the Operation of Nuclear Complex in Sosnovy Bor. - presentation at the international conference ENERGY. ECOLOGY. SAFETY, May 25–27, 1999, Sosnovy Bor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1976 and again in September 1979, due to a poor safety culture, fire broke out in a concrete vault containing radioactive waste. Water used in extinguishing the fires was contaminated, leaked into the environment, and entered the water table. This was not reported in the media.&lt;ref name="Melnikov, N.B. Malevannaya 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"/&gt;

On 28 December 1990, during refurbishment of Unit 1, it was noticed that the space between the fuel channels and the graphite stack (contaminated during the 1975 accident) had widened. The contaminated graphite was spilled, and the radiation levels in the space under the reactor increased. Radiation was detected 6&amp;nbsp;km away from the unit, but this was not reported in the media.&lt;ref name="Melnikov, N.B. Malevannaya 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"/&gt;

On 3 December 1991, due to faulty equipment and lax safety rule compliance, 10 new fuel rods were dropped and damaged. The staff tried to conceal the accident from the management.&lt;ref name="V.M. Kuznetsov 2000"/&gt;

In March 1992, an accident at the Sosnovy Bor nuclear plant leaked radioactive gases and [[iodine]] into the air through a ruptured fuel channel. This was the first accident at the station that was announced in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Energy Institute, [http://www.nei.org/corporatesite/media/filefolder/soviet_plant_source_book.pdf Source Book: Soviet-Designed Nuclear Power Plants in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Armenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121211214430/http://www.nei.org/corporatesite/media/filefolder/soviet_plant_source_book.pdf |date=11 December 2012 }}, 5th edition, 1997, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2009, the third unit was stopped when a hole was found in the discharge header of a pump.&lt;ref name="Rosenergoatom-1"&gt;[http://lennpp.rosenergoatom.ru/eng/press/news/article/?article-id=86CC234D-751F-4D89-8561-AB226345008D The third unit of Leningrad NPP has been stopped]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Rosenergoatom]], 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to the automated radiation control system, the radiation situation at the plant and in its {{convert|30|km|adj=on}} monitoring zone was normal.&lt;ref name="Rosenergoatom-1" /&gt; The plant's management refuted rumors of an accident and stated that the third unit was stopped for a "short-term unscheduled maintenance", with a restart scheduled for 31 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lennpp.rosenergoatom.ru/eng/press/news/article/?article-id=34559542-3942-4E44-B035-9C6D139D15CC  Leningrad NPP refutes rumors about accident]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Rosenergoatom]], 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2015, unit 2 was stopped (scrammed) due to a broken steam pipe. No radioactively contaminated material was released.  The situation inside Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant and the industrial area around the station has not changed and the radiation level remains within the limits of natural background values.

'''Maceration''', in [[sewage treatment]], is the use of a machine that reduces solids to small pieces in order to deal with rags and other solid waste.  Macerating toilets use a grinding or blending mechanism to reduce [[human waste]] to a slurry, which can then be moved by pumping.  This is useful when, for example, [[Fluid pressure|water pressure]] is low or one wishes to install a toilet below the [[Sanitary sewer|sewer drain]] pipe.

Maceration can be achieved by using a [[chopper pumps|chopper pump]] in the sewage lift station or at the wastewater treatment plant. It is sometimes referred to as a "rotary biological contacter process".&lt;ref name=antarctica/&gt;

==In Antarctica==
At [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] research stations with an average summer population of more than 30 people, maceration is the minimum treatment level required before sewage can be disposed of in the sea. This procedure is outlined in the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty|Madrid Protocol]], an international treaty outlining environmental practices to be followed in Antarctica. Research stations that do not meet this population threshold are allowed to dump [[Raw sewage|untreated, unmacerated sewage]] directly into the sea.&lt;ref name=antarctica&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Open-Ended Intersessional Contact Group on Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife Report 2 — Practical Measures to Reduce Risk (Draft)'', reproduced as Appendix E in ''Health of Antarctic Wildlife: A Challenge for Science and Policy|year=2009|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Germany|isbn=978-3-540-93922-1|page=424|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWI5H0UQmxcC&amp;pg=PA424#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Australian representatives to the Antarctic Treaty|editor=K. Knowles R. Kerry, Martin J. Riddle|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also allows ships carrying more than ten people to discharge macerated wastewater (including sewage and food waste) directly into the sea, provided that the vessel is more than 12 nautical miles from shore.&lt;ref name=antarctica/&gt;{{rp|280}}

==Other large-scale macerative processes==
In [[food processing]] plants, maceration refers to the use of a chopper pump to create a "blended" slurry of food waste and other organic byproducts. The macerated substance, which can be described as a protein-rich slurry, is often used for animal feed, fertilizer, and for co-digestion feedstock in [[biogas]] plants.

'''Minusheet perfusion culture system''' is used for advanced [[cell culture]] experiments in combination with [[Subculture (biology)#Adherent cells|adherent cells]] and to generate specialized tissues in combination with selected [[biomaterial]]s, special tissue carriers and compatible [[perfusion]] culture containers.

The technical development of the Minusheet perfusion culture system was driven by the idea to create under [[in vitro]] conditions an environment resembling as near as possible the situation of specialized tissues found within the [[organism]]. Basis of this invention is therefore individually selected biomaterials for optimal cell adhesion mounted in Minusheet tissue carriers. Moreover, to always offer fresh [[nutrition]] including respiratory gas and to simulate a tissue-specific fluid environment, the tissue carriers can be inserted into compatible perfusion culture containers. As a result, a variety of publications illustrates that tissues generated by this innovative approach exhibit an excellent and stable quality. Thus, on the one hand the system provides a highly adaptable basis for the culture of adherent cells and the generation of specialized tissues. On the other hand the Minusheet perfusion culture system is bridging a methodical gap between the conventional static 24 well culture plate and modern perfusion culture technology.

==Crucial generation of specialized tissues==
Specialized tissues in culture are urgently needed in [[regenerative medicine]], [[tissue engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], biomaterial research and advanced [[toxicity]] testing of newly developed [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. However, it is often observed that raised tissues do not exhibit expected functional features. Instead [[Cellular differentiation|dedifferentiation]] is observed [1-4]. These cell biological alterations arise after isolation of cells and proceed during static culture in a dish due to suboptimal fluid environment and minor adhesion on biomaterials. Further uncontrolled supply with nutrition and respiratory gas, an overshoot of [[metabolite]]s and paracrine factors or missing [[Rheometry|rheological]] stress can increase the degree of dedifferentiation. In consequence, regarding an optimal generation of specialized tissues a powerful strategy has to exclude as much as possible harmful parameters, while factors supporting the process of tissue development must be intensified [5].

==Selected biomaterials promote development within a tissue carrier==
Under natural conditions a prerequisite for an optimal tissue development is a cell-specific interaction with the extracellular matrix, while under in vitro conditions a substitute for the extracellular matrix has to be selected. However, the crucial problem is that a [[biomaterial]] can influence the development of functional features within a maturing tissue in a good and in a bad sense. In consequence, the suitability of a decellularized extracellular matrix, newly developed synthetic polymers, biodegradable scaffolds, ceramics or metal alloys cannot be predicted but must be tested. 
To meet parameters positively influencing cell adhesion and communication, the technical concept is based on a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1). By the help of this tool cell adhesion and development of tissue can be tested with individually selected biomaterials. These experiments can be performed first under static (Fig. 2) and then under dynamic (Fig. 3) culture conditions [6]. In both cases a Minusheet tissue carrier prevents damage but supports development of contained cells or tissues during experimentation.  
[[File:Minusheet Figure 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 1|Figure 1: Mounting of a Minusheet tissue carrier. (a) First an individual biomaterial measuring 13 mm in diameter is selected. (b) For mounting the biomaterial is placed in the base part of a tissue carrier. (c) After pressing down a tension ring the mounted tissue carrier can be used for cell seeding. For improved provision with medium a tissue carrier rests with protrusions at the bottom of a dish.]]
To stay compatible with a conventional 24 well culture plate a selected biomaterial must be punched in a diameter of 13&amp;nbsp;mm. In this format many materials are also commercially available. Further materials can be applied in form of filters, foils, nets, fleeces and scaffolds (Fig. 1a). For an easy handling and to prevent damage during development the selected specimens are placed in the base part of a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1b). Pressing down a [[tension ring]] the biomaterial is held in position (Fig. 1c). After mounting a tissue carrier is enveloped in a bag and sterilized.

==Cell seeding on a tissue carrier==
For cell seeding the mounted tissue carrier is transferred by a forceps in a 24 well culture plate (Fig. 2). To concentrate cells on top of a tissue carrier culture medium is added to a level so that the selected biomaterial is just wetted. Then an [[wikt:Special:Search/aliquot|aliquot]] of cells is transferred by a pipette to the surface of the mounted biomaterial.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 2|Figure 2: Minusheet tissue carriers including different biomaterials within a 24 well culture plate. Cell seeding is performed in static environment of this dish.]]

A standard culture protocol with a tissue carrier can be initiated by seeding cells onto the upper side. When a tissue carrier is turned, cells can also be seeded on the other side so that co-culture experiments with two different cell types become possible.
Not only single cells but also a thin slice of tissue can be mounted between two pieces of a woven net within a Minusheet tissue carrier. Further flexible materials such as [[collagen]] sheets can be used in a tissue carrier like the skin of a drum. Last but not least excellent results were obtained by mounting a polyester fleece as an artificial [[interstitium]] for spatial [[parenchyma]] development [5,6,8]. It is obvious that for each specialized tissue very individual spatial environments within a tissue carrier can be created.

==Compatible perfusion culture containers==
It has been shown that the static environment within a 24 well culture plate leads to a decrease of nutrition and hormones, an uncontrollable increase of [[metabolite]]s and an overshoot of [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]] factors during time. Due to these reasons a Minusheet tissue carrier with adherent cells is used only for the short period of cell seeding in a 24 well culture plate.
In consequence, after adhesion of cells the tissue carrier is transferred to a perfusion culture container to offer a dynamic fluid environment. To meet the individual requirements of specialized tissues a variety of perfusion culture containers was constructed (Fig. 3).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 3|Figure 3: Variety of perfusion culture containers for insertion of Minusheet tissue carriers.]]
 
Each of the perfusion culture containers has at least one inlet and one outlet for the transport of culture medium. A basic version of a container allows the simple bathing of cells respectively growing tissues under continuous medium transport (Fig. 4a). In a gradient container the tissue carrier is placed between the base and the lid so that both sides can be provided with individual media mimicking a typical environment for [[epithelia]] (Fig. 4b). A further culture container is made of a transparent lid and base allowing the microscopic observation during tissue development (Fig. 4c).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 4.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 4|Figure 4: Use of a Minusheet tissue carrier in perfusion culture containers. (a) A standard perfusion culture container holds six tissue carriers to provide them with always fresh medium. (b) In a gradient perfusion culture container an epithelium is exposed to different fluids at the luminal and basal side. (c) In a microscope container a transparent lid and base allow observation of developing tissue during perfusion culture.]]

In addition, a perfusion culture container can exhibit a flexible [[silicone]] lid. Applying force to this lid by an eccentric rotor simulates a mechanical load as required in [[cartilage]] and [[bone]] [[tissue engineering]]. Shaped tissues such as an [[Ear|auricle]] or different forms of cartilage can be generated with individual scaffolds in a special tissue engineering container. Finally, spatial extension of [[tubule]]s derived from renal stem/progenitor cells is obtained within a perfusion container filled with an artificial interstitium made of polyester fleece. Finally, all of these containers are machined out of a special polycarbonate ([[Makrolon]]®) so that all of them can be [[autoclave]]d for multiple uses.

==Performance of perfusion culture experiments==
To maintain the necessary temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C within a perfusion culture container, a heating plate (MEDAX-Nagel, Kiel, Germany) and a cover lid (not shown) are used during performance of culture experiments over weeks (Fig. 5, 7). The transport of [[culture medium]] is best accomplished using a slowly rotating [[peristaltic pump]] (ISMATEC, IPC N8, Wertheim, Germany). It is able to deliver adjustable and exact pump rates between 0.1 and 5 ml per hour.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 5.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 5|Figure 5: Perfusion culture set-up is working on a laboratory table. A thermo plate maintains the desired temperature of 37°C. During culture a peristaltic pump transports the medium for example with 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side).]]

On the passage from the storage bottle through the perfusion culture container medium is transported along a mounted tissue carrier to provide contained cells. The exact geometrical placement of the tissue carrier within a perfusion culture container guarantees during transport of medium provision with always fresh nutrition and respiratory gas from all sides. At the same time it prevents an unphysiological accumulation of metabolic products and an overshoot of paracrine factors. To maintain for the whole culture period this controlled environment, the metabolized medium is collected in a separate waste bottle. In consequence, medium is not recirculated.

==Stabilization of pH during perfusion culture==
Normally cell culture experiments are performed in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator. Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the complete handling. However, in this case the culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.
Keeping media in a 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0.3%) in atmospheric air.
For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37&amp;nbsp;°C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.

==Availability of oxygen in medium==
To obtain in a perfusion culture experiment a high saturation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a selected medium such as IMDM has to be transported through a gas permeable silicone tube. The use of a silicone tube provides a large surface for [[gas exchange]] by diffusion due to a thin wall (1&amp;nbsp;mm), the small inner diameter (1&amp;nbsp;mm) and its extended length (1 m). For example, analysis of IMDM (3024&amp;nbsp;mg/l NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES) equilibrated against atmospheric air during a standard perfusion culture experiment shows constant partial pressures of at least 160 mmHg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [7].

==Modulation of oxygen content==
It has been shown that growing cells and tissues have very individual [[oxygen]] requirements. Due to this reason it is important that the content of oxygen can be adapted in individual perfusion culture experiments. The technical solution is a gas exchanger module containing a gas inlet and outlet (Fig. 6a). Further a spiral with a long thin-walled silicon tube for medium transport is mounted inside the module. Since the tube is highly gas-permeable, it guarantees optimal diffusion of gases between culture medium and internal atmosphere of the gas exchange module. In consequence, the desired gas atmosphere can be adjusted by a constant flow of a specific gas mixture through the module. This way the content of oxygen or any other gases can be modulated in the medium by diffusion. Applying this simple protocol it became possible to decrease the oxygen partial pressure within the transported medium during long term culture experiments under absolutely sterile conditions [7].
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 6.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 6|Figure 6: Gas exchange and gas expander module for perfusion culture. (a) A gas exchange module is used, when adaption of respiratory gas in perfusion culture has to be performed. By a gas inlet and outlet the desired gas composition is transported to a spiral of silicone tube containing the culture medium. Between the wall of the silicone tube gas is exchanged. (b) A gas expander module is used for the elimination of gas bubbles during transport of culture medium. Medium with gas bubbles is entering at the inlet and has to pass a barrier. Here the medium expands and bubbles are separated. Finally medium is leaving the container bubble-free but gas-saturated.]]

==Elimination of harmful gas bubbles==
Performing perfusion culture experiments it always has to be considered that gas bubbles are forming during slow transport of culture medium. They arise during suction of medium in the storage bottle, during transport within the tube, during distribution within the culture container and during elimination on the way to the waste bottle. Due to unknown reasons gas bubbles accumulate especially at material transitions between tubes, connectors and perfusion containers. First these gas bubbles are so small that they cannot be observed with the human eye, but during ongoing transport of culture medium they increase in size and are able to form an [[embolus]] that massively impedes medium flow. Within a culture container gas bubbles are leading to a regional shortage of medium supply and are causing breaks in the fluid continuum so that massive [[fluid pressure]] changes result. In a gradient perfusion culture container, where two media are transported at exactly the same speed, embolic effects can lead to pressure differences destroying in turn the contained epithelial barrier [5,9].

To avoid the concentration of gas bubbles within a perfusion culture experiment, a gas expander module was developed (Fig. 6b). This module removes gas bubbles from the medium during transport.  When medium is entering the gas expander module, it rises within a small reservoir and expands before it drops down a barrier. During this process gas bubbles are separated from the medium at the top of the gas expander module. In consequence, medium leaving the container is oxygen-saturated but free of gas bubbles [8,9].

A thermo plate maintains the desired temperature of 37°C. To provide the luminal and basal side of the contained epithelium with nutrition and respiratory gas, two channels of a peristaltic pump transport a red and a clear medium at exactly the same rate of 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side). For elimination of gas bubbles during transport of medium a gas expander module is placed before the gradient container.]]

==Broad spectrum of applications==
In the last years numerous papers were published dealing with the Minusheet perfusion culture system. The wide spectrum illustrates that the modular system was applied to generate specialized tissues in excellent cell biological quality used in tissue engineering, [[biomaterial]] research and advanced pharmaceutical [[drug toxicity]] testing. A complete list of these applications is found in the data bank ‘Proceedings in perfusion culture’ (see 'External links').
   
As demonstrated by numerous patents (DE 39 23 279, DE 42 00 446, DE 42 08 805, DE 44 43 902, DE 19530 556, DE 196 48 876 C2, DE 199 52 847 B4, US 5 190 878, US 5 316 945, US 5 665 599, J 2847669, DE 10 2005 002 938, PA 10 2004 054 125.6, PA 10 2005 001 747.9, patents pending) Will W. Minuth has invented the presented Minusheet perfusion culture system.

Numerous pilot experiments with the Minusheet perfusion culture system were performed in the last years by Lucia Denk and Will W. Minuth. The experimental work is presently focusing on the creation of an artificial polyester interstitium to repair injured renal parenchyma.

In 1992 the Minusheet perfusion culture system received the Philip Morris research award ‘Challenge of the Future’ in [[Munich]], Germany. The award was handed over by [[Henry Kissinger]], Hans Joachim Friedrichs and [[Paul Müller (biologist)|Paul Müller]].

To introduce the Minusheet perfusion culture system on the market, Katharina Lorenz-Minuth founded non-profit orientated Minucells and Minutissue Vertriebs GmbH (D-93077 Bad Abbach/Germany).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6187">A '''[[Nevill Francis Mott|Mott]] transition''' is a metal-nonmetal transition in [[condensed matter]]. Due to [[electric field screening]] the potential energy becomes much more sharply (exponentially) peaked around the equilibrium position of the atom and electrons become localized and can no longer conduct a current.

==Conceptual explanation==
In a [[semiconductor]] at low temperatures, each 'site' ([[atom]] or group of atoms) contains a certain number of [[electrons]] and is electrically neutral. For an electron to move away from a site requires a certain amount of energy, as the electron is normally pulled back toward the (now positively charged) site by [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb forces]]. If the temperature is high enough that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac 1 2 k_B T&lt;/math&gt; of energy is available per site, the [[Boltzmann distribution]] predicts that a significant fraction of electrons will have enough energy to escape their site, leaving an [[electron hole]] behind and becoming conduction electrons that conduct [[Electric current|current]]. The result is that at low temperatures a material is insulating, and at high temperatures the material conducts.

While the conduction in an n- (p-) type doped semiconductor sets in at high temperatures because the conduction (valence) band is partially filled with electrons (holes) with the original band structure being unchanged, the situation is different in the case of the Mott transition where the band structure itself changes. Mott argued that the transition must be sudden, occurring when the density of free electrons N and the [[Bohr radius]] &lt;math&gt;a_H&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;N^{1/3} a_H \simeq 0.2&lt;/math&gt;.

Simply put, a Mott Transition is a change in a material's behavior from insulating to metallic due to various factors. This transition is known to exist in various systems: mercury metal vapor-liquid, metal NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solutions, transition metal chalcogenides and transition metal oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cyrot|first=M|title=Theory of mott transition : Applications to transition metal oxides|journal=Le Journal de Physique|year=1972|volume=33|issue=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of transition metal oxides, the material typically switches from being a good electrical insulator to a good electrical conductor. The insulator-metal transition can also be modified by changes in temperature, pressure or composition (doping). As observed by Mott in his 1949 publication on Ni-oxide, the origin of this behavior is correlations between electrons and the close relationship this phenomenon has to magnetism.

The physical origin of the Mott transition is the interplay between the Coulomb repulsion of electrons and their degree of localization (band width). Once the carrier density becomes too high (e.g. due to doping), the energy of the system can be lowered by the localization of the formerly conducting electrons (band width reduction), leading to the formation of a band gap, e.g. by pressure (i.e. a semiconductor/insulator).

In a semiconductor, the doping level also affects the Mott transition. It has been observed that higher dopant concentrations in a semiconductor creates internal stresses that increase the free energy (acting as a change in pressure) of the system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=D. N. |author2=B. Seishu |author3=G. Parthasarathy |author4=E. S. R. Gopal|title=Doping Dependence of Semiconductor-Metal Transition in InP at High Pressures|journal= [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1986|volume=405|issue=1829|pages=345–353 |jstor=2397982|doi=10.1098/rspa.1986.0057 |bibcode = 1986RSPSA.405..345B }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus reducing the ionization energy.

The reduced barrier causes easier transfer by tunneling or by thermal emission from donor to its adjacent donor. The effect is enhanced when pressure is applied for the reason stated previously. When the transport of carriers overcomes a minute activation energy, the semiconductor has undergone a Mott transition and become metallic.

Other examples of [[metal–insulator transition]] include:
* Peierls transition /Charge density wave. Changes in the material symmetry leads to the formation of a band gap at Brillouin zone boundaries.
* Excitonic insulators exhibit very high exciton binding energies driving the transition to the gapped state.
* A [[Mott–Hubbard transition]]. Ti-doped V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes a transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to disordered magnetic conducting state.
* A band crossing transition. EuO orders ferromagnetically from a paramagnetic semiconducting state on cooling below its Curie temperature. Below T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, europium’s valence electrons have enough energy to cross the trap levels due to vacancies on the oxygen sites. This transfer of electrons transforms EuO into the metallic state.&lt;ref name="Magnetism Fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michel Schlenker; Etienne du Trémolet de Lacheisserie; Damien Gignoux |title=Magnetism |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-387-22967-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Mott transition in doped semiconductors, e.g., Si:P, Si:As, Si:B, Si:Ga, etc. Such transitions have been investigated and demonstrated using electronic Raman scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, K., et al., "Electronic Raman scattering and the metal–insulator transition in doped silicon", ''Phys. Rev. B'', Vol. 13, 5448 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory was first proposed by [[Nevill Francis Mott]] in a 1949 paper.&lt;ref&gt;N. F. Mott, ''Proc. Phys. Soc.'' (London) '''A62''', 416 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; Mott also wrote a review of the subject (with a good overview) in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;N. F. Mott, ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''40''', pp. 677–683.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject has been thoroughly reviewed in a comprehensive paper by Imada, Fujimori and Tokura&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=M. Imada  |author2=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">The '''NLGI consistency number''' (sometimes called ''“NLGI grade”'') expresses a measure of the relative hardness of a [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] used for lubrication, as specified by the ''standard classification of lubricating grease'' established by the [[National Lubricating Grease Institute]] (NLGI). Reproduced in standards 
{{nowrap|[[ASTM International|ASTM]] D4950}} ''(“standard classification and specification of automotive service greases”)'' and {{nowrap|[[SAE International|SAE]] J310}} ''(“automotive lubricating greases”)'', NLGI’s classification is widely used. The NLGI consistency number is also a component of the code specified in standard {{nowrap|[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6743-9}} ''“lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Significance of tests for petroleum products
 |editor1-last=Rand |editor1-first=Salvatore J. |publisher=ASTM International |year=2003 |edition=7th |series=“ASTM manual” series, volume 1 |page=166 |isbn=978-0-8031-2097-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FkMrP4Hlw0C&amp;pg=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLGI consistency number alone is not sufficient for specifying the grease required by a particular application. However, it complements other classifications (such as {{nowrap|ASTM D4950}} and {{nowrap|ISO 6743-9}}). Besides consistency, other properties (such as structural and mechanical stability, apparent viscosity, resistance to oxidation, etc.) can be tested to determine the suitability of a grease to a specific application.

==Test methodology==

NLGI's classification defines nine grades, each associated to a range of ASTM worked penetration values, measured using the test defined by standard {{nowrap|ASTM D217}} ''“cone penetration of lubricating grease”''. This involves two test apparatus. The first apparatus consists of a closed container and a piston-like plunger. The face of the plunger is perforated to allow grease to flow from one side of the plunger to another as the plunger is worked up and down. The test grease is inserted into the container and the plunger is stroked {{nowrap|60 times}} while the test apparatus and grease are maintained at a temperature of {{nowrap|25 °C}}.

Once worked, the grease is placed in a penetration test apparatus. This apparatus consists of a container, a specially-configured cone and a [[dial indicator]]. The container is filled with the grease and the top surface of the grease is smoothed over. The cone is placed so that its tip just touches the grease surface and the dial indicator is set to zero at this position. When the test starts, the weight of the cone will cause it to penetrate into the grease. After a specific time interval the depth of penetration is measured.

==Classification==

The following table&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rudnick |first=Leslie R. |title=Synthetics, Mineral Oils, and Bio-Based Lubricants: Chemistry and Technology (Chemical Industries) |publisher=CRC |year=2005 |pages=468 | isbn=1-57444-723-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the NLGI classification and compares each grade with household products of similar consistency.

Common greases are in the range 1 through 3. Those with a NLGI No. of 000 to 1 are used in low [[viscosity]] applications. Examples include enclosed [[gear drive]]s operating at low speeds and [[open gearing]]. Grades 0, 1 and 2 are used in highly loaded gearing. Grades 1 through 4 are often used in [[rolling-element bearing|rolling contact bearing]]s. Greases with a higher number are firmer, tend to stay in place and are a good choice when leakage is a concern.

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

==Branches of natural science==
{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

[[File:Baltimore Maryland Blizzard of 1996.png|thumb|Baltimore Maryland Jeep Stuck in the Snow]]
The '''Blizzard of 1996''' was a severe [[nor'easter]] that paralyzed the [[U.S. East Coast]] with up to {{convert|4|ft|m}} of wind-driven snow from January 6 to January 8, 1996. This storm was a classic example of a Nor'easter, but the storm would not have been as historically significant without the presence of the arctic high pressure system located to the north of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/one-wild-storm-a-look-back-at-the-blizzard-of-96/2013/01/07/89a1242c-5875-11e2-9fa9-5fbdc9530eb9_blog.html|title=One wild storm: A look back at the ‘Blizzard of ‘96’|last=Lipman|first=Don|date=2013-01-07|website=Washington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed by another storm, an [[Alberta Clipper]], on January 12,&lt;ref name="wjla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wjla.com/weather/remembering-the-blizzard-of-96-14186|title=Remembering the Blizzard of '96 |author=Chad Merrill|date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; then unusually warm weather and torrential rain which caused rapid melting and river flooding. Along with the [[1993 Storm of the Century|March Superstorm of 1993]], it is one of only two snowstorms to receive the top rating of 5, or "Extreme", on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]] (NESIS).&lt;ref name="noaa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/rsi/nesis|title=Regional Snowfall Index (RSI)|author=Enloe|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Virginia===
[[File:Blizzard-1996.jpg|thumb|500px|left|A [[NOAA]] snowfall map depicting accumulation in Virginia, after the North American blizzard of 1996. Most of the Shenandoah Valley received two to three feet of snow. ]] 
Most of Virginia was impacted with the more central and western parts receiving one to three feet (300–900&amp;nbsp;mm) of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Springston|first1=Rex|title=From the archive: Who remembers the snowstorm of '96?|url=http://www.richmond.com/weather/article_838db9da-b55e-11e5-a168-b70417c88288.html|accessdate=3 March 2016|agency=Richmond Times dispatch|date=January 8, 1996 &lt;!-- 10:48 am --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roanoke got a record-breaking 23 inches. The heaviest snow fell in Page County, with around 37 inches (940&amp;nbsp;mm). Snowfall reached three feet in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and exceeded two feet in much of the Virginia mountain and Piedmont areas. Gov. [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] declared a state of emergency as power lines went down, people were trapped in their houses, and at least eight weather-related deaths occurred. High winds that accompanied the blizzard caused white out conditions and drifts of up to 10 feet (900&amp;nbsp;mm) in Patrick County.

===Washington, D.C. and Baltimore===
[[File:WMATA Shady Grove accident - Final positions.jpg|thumb|left|Picture taken of the aftermath of a [[Washington Metro]] accident at [[Shady Grove (WMATA station)|Shady Grove]] station during the blizzard, which resulted in the death of a Metro operator.]]
Snow began falling on [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] during the early afternoon of January 6 and continued at a consistent rate until mid-afternoon the next day.  At that time, the metro area received {{convert|13|to|17|in|cm}}, and after a few hours of sleet and then a complete stop for several hours, it seemed the worst was over.  But overnight, as the storm slowly crawled northward, extremely heavy bands of snow came in from the east.  These bands created whiteout conditions as winds gusted past {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}, along with thunder and lightning.
By the morning of January 8, the bands tapered off, and the metro area was left with a blanket of {{convert|15|to|25|in|cm}} of snow.  Baltimore received {{convert|22.5|in|cm}} and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] received {{convert|24.6|in|cm}}.  Many areas north and west in Maryland and West Virginia received well over {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} with a few locations in the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia receiving up to {{convert|4|ft|m}}.

In DC, it was known as the "Blizzard of '96" or the "Great Furlough Storm," because it occurred just after the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995–1996|1996 federal government shutdown]]&lt;ref name="wjla" /&gt; and since the Federal government was closed due to the storm, lengthened the time federal employees were away from their jobs in the DC area.  Because of unseasonably warm weather in mid-January and a warm rain exceeding an inch on Monday, January 15, the snow melted quickly and caused the worst winter flooding in decades for river and stream valleys from Southwest Virginia to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, David, "Flood Waters Leave Widespread Ruin in Their Wake; Mid-Atlantic Region Awash in Mud, Ice," ''The Washington Post'', January 23, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia and Pittsburgh===
30.7 inches (78&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow fell in [[Philadelphia]] (as measured at the official city observation location, [[Philadelphia International Airport]]), the most of any major city in the storm's path. It remains the city's all-time greatest snowstorm, compared to its previous greatest snowstorm which was a "mere" 21.3 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/onward/50724-now-you-know-about-philadelphias-biggest-snowstorms|title=Now you know about Philadelphia's biggest snowstorms|author=Zack Seward|date=8 February 2013|work=Newsworks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of those 30.7&amp;nbsp;inches, 27.6, fell in just 24&amp;nbsp;hours, a new record for the city for the most snow in 24&amp;nbsp;hours. The mayor declared a state of emergency, and only police and other emergency workers were permitted to drive on city streets leaving the city to pedestrians.

For three days, city trucks loaded with plowed snow dumped their contents into the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers eventually causing major problems with the natural flow of the rivers. It is a rare occurrence for trucks to "dispose of snow" in the Philadelphia area, since the snowfall amounts typically do not warrant it. However the snow was so extensive, that plowing would cause massive snow piles. City officials had no choice but to resort to hauling the snow to nearby rivers.  Disposal of snow became a major issue but temperatures quickly returned to normal and began to quickly clear the snow. This resulted in flooding, when on January 19, a jet stream disturbance from the Gulf of Mexico caused a rapid melt, followed by thunderstorms, which both brought three inches of rain, and caused the snow to melt 20 inches in one day; or equivalent to 2 inches of rain. Philadelphia saw its worst flooding in twenty years.  Damages were estimated to reach $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2009.ems.psu.edu/WeatherWorld/summaries/sum1.96.html|title=Weather World Summary for January 1996|work=psu.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528020241/http://www.ems.psu.edu/WeatherWorld/summaries/sum1.96.html|archivedate=2009-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Blizzard of 1996 Reading PA.png|thumb|right|Blizzard of 1996, [[Temple, Pennsylvania]].]]

Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches in Monroe, Carbon and eastern Schuylkill Counties, around 2 feet in Lehigh and Northampton Counties, 24 to 33 inches in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches in Montgomery and Bucks Counties. Other individual accumulations included 33 inches in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), 30 inches in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), 28 inches in Perkasie (Bucks), and 26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester).

26.5 inches (78&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow fell in [[Pittsburgh]] (as measured at the official city observation location, [[Pittsburgh International Airport]]). In 30 hours, 19 inches fell severely. Mayor Tom Murphy had declared Pittsburgh a state of Emergency with only emergency officals allowed to drive in city streets and highways. Snowfall accumulations averaged 17 to 20 inches in Allegheny, Westmorland, and Beaver counties. Butler County had an amount of 27 inches.

===New Jersey===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Snow began falling during the predawn hours of the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning.  Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low pressure.  During the afternoon hours, precipitation in far southern New Jersey changed to sleet and freezing rain as the low brought in warm air at mid-levels, but remained all snow across the rest of the state.  During the evening and overnight hours the snow mixed with sleet as far north as central sections of the state as the low center approached the state from the south.  A lull developed in the precipitation in the pre-dawn hours of the 8th as the low center was just off the New Jersey coast, but wraparound moisture brought another period of snow to the state as the low pulled away during the later morning and early afternoon hours of the 8th.  Accumulations averaged 24 to 27 inches in Sussex County, 20 to 27 inches in Warren County, 23 to 28 inches in Morris County, generally 20 to 30 inches in Bergen, Passaic, Union, Hudson, Essex, Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer, and Monmouth counties, 19 to 32 inches in Middlesex County, 18 to 31 inches in Burlington County, 16 to 24 inches in Salem, Gloucester, and Camden counties, 24 inches inland and 10 to 14 inches at the coast in Ocean County, and 10 to 18 inches in Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May counties.  In addition to the heavy snow, wind gusts reached hurricane force along the coast during the evening of the 7th, with an 81&amp;nbsp;mph gust recorded in Ocean Grove.  While accumulations were lighter along the shore, the strong northeasterly flow produced moderate coastal flooding at the time of high tide on the evening of the 7th, with tides 3 to 4 feet above normal.  The tide reached 7.5 feet above mean low water in Atlantic County and 8.5 feet above mean low water in Cape May County.  Fortunately, winds switched to the northwest before worse flooding could occur at high tide on the morning of the 8th.

The state of [[New Jersey]] recorded its second-largest snowstorm at Edison, where 32&amp;nbsp;inches (81&amp;nbsp;cm) fell (the greatest single storm record being 34&amp;nbsp;inches (86&amp;nbsp;cm) at [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]] in the [[Great Blizzard of 1899]]). [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] also reported 32 inches of snow. [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], the state's largest city, received a record-setting {{convert|27.8|in|cm}}, while [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], the capital, received {{convert|24.2|in|cm|1}}. All roads in the state were closed, including the entire length of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] for the first time in that road's history. Over two-thirds of the state was buried under {{convert|2|ft|cm|0}} of snow, making this storm the state's most paralyzing snowstorm of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. Places such as Roselle and Linden received around 30 inches. New Jersey was, along with other states, put into a state of emergency.

"Two feet of snow was blasted into Greater Trenton by 50 mph winds that created giant drifts, paralyzing the region and the rest of the Northeast for a week, One writer called it the most “sadistic” storm of our century.  
The Blizzard of '96 stranded hundreds of people at Trenton's train station; left thousands without electricity and heat for days; closed most schools and government offices for a week; cut off an estimated $1 billion in Jersey commerce; forced the National Guard into service rescuing state troopers from snowbound police cruisers; and created strife between officials and residents demanding the plowing of their little streets.  In the second week of January 1996, it can be said, many locales across the region looked like they did in the old pictures taken of them during the infamous Blizzard of '88: Houses drifted under; snowed-in main streets that looked like ghost towns; no cars or people on the streets." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1996.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}

[[File:Blizzard of 96 Snow Drifts.jpg|thumb|left|Blizzard of 1996 snowdrifts, [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]
[[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] officially recorded {{convert|20.2|in|cm}} for its fourth-largest single snowfall (records going back to 1869), but many locations in the other boroughs and suburbs recorded over {{convert|30|in|cm}} of snow. Schools in New York City's boroughs closed because of snow for the first time since the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of 1978]], 18 years earlier. While most suburban districts in the area close for snow several times each winter, in the city itself they rarely do because of relatively easy access to underground subways whose ability to run is not appreciably affected by snowstorms of moderate to large accumulation; however, in this snowstorm, the transit network was significantly disrupted. Buses were unable to run, and subway service was limited. Lines that ran in open cut and surface routes were shut down for two days.

===New England===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}

[[Providence, Rhode Island]] received {{convert|24|in|cm}} of snow, while [[Boston]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut]] both received {{convert|18.2|in|cm}}.  Up to {{convert|33|in|cm}} of snow fell in the [[Berkshire Mountains]] of western Massachusetts and the northern hills of [[Connecticut]].  While this was a major snow event for southern New England, the Blizzard of 1996 was not as intense as other recent events, notably the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of 1978]] and the [[Storm of the Century (1993)|March 1993 Superstorm]].  Snowfall amounts decreased sharply as one moved further north, with northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine receiving little more than snow flurries from this event.

==Blizzard status==
Despite the storm's common name as the "Blizzard of 1996", some of the few observing sites to record true [[blizzard]] conditions were [[Trenton-Mercer Airport]] near [[Trenton, New Jersey]] and [[Morristown Municipal Airport]] located east of [[Morristown, New Jersey]], with Morristown recording wind gusts in excess of 63 mph (101 km/h). During the afternoon of January 7, the airports recorded the necessary three consecutive hours of frequent wind gusts of at least {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} combined with a prevailing visibility consistently below {{convert|0.25|mi|m}} along with falling and blowing snow, meeting the official [[National Weather Service|NWS]] standard of a [[blizzard]]. This indicates that the sites experienced some of the worst conditions on the entire East Coast. All other New Jersey observing sites, as well as most sites in neighboring states, failed to observe true blizzard conditions, though many stations did observe blizzard conditions for less than the necessary three consecutive hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">'''Plasma oscillations''', also known as '''Langmuir waves''' (after [[Irving Langmuir]]), are rapid oscillations of the [[electron density]] in conducting media such as [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] or [[metal]]s in the [[ultraviolet]] region. The oscillations can be described as an instability in the [[Drude_model#AC_field|dielectric function of a free electron gas]]. The frequency only depends weakly on the wavelength of the oscillation. The [[quasiparticle]] resulting from the [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] of these oscillations is the [[plasmon]].

Langmuir waves were discovered by American [[physics|physicists]] [[Irving Langmuir]] and [[Lewi Tonks]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~mem4/ap6101/Tonks_Langmuir_PR29.pdf |journal=Physical Review |year=1929 |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=195–210 |title=Oscillations in ionized gases |first1=Lewi |last1=Tonks |first2=Irving |last2=Langmuir|bibcode=1929PhRv...33..195T |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.33.195 |pmid=16587379 |pmc=1085653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are parallel in form to [[Jeans Instability|Jeans instability]] waves, which are caused by gravitational instabilities in a static medium.

== Mechanism ==

Consider an electrically neutral plasma in equilibrium, consisting of a gas of positively charged [[ion]]s and negatively charged [[electrons]]. If one displaces by a tiny amount an electron or a group of electrons with respect to the ions, the [[Coulomb force]] pulls the electrons back, acting as a restoring force.

=== 'Cold' electrons ===

If the thermal motion of the electrons is ignored, it is possible to show that the charge density oscillates at the ''plasma frequency'' &lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{pe}} = \sqrt{\frac{n_\mathrm{e} e^{2}}{m^*\varepsilon_0}}, \left[\mathrm{rad/s}\right]&lt;/math&gt; ([[SI units]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{pe}} = \sqrt{\frac{4 \pi n_\mathrm{e} e^{2}}{m^*}}, [rad/s]&lt;/math&gt; ([[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs units]]),

where ''&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; '' is the [[number density]] of electrons, ''e'' is the [[electric charge]], ''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of the electron, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]]. Note that the above [[formula]] is derived under the [[approximation]] that the ion mass is infinite. This is generally a good approximation, as the electrons are so much lighter than ions.  (This expression must be modified in the case of electron-[[positron]] plasmas, often encountered in [[astrophysics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fu|first=Ying|title=Optical properties of nanostructures|year=2011|publisher=Pan Stanford|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[frequency]] is independent of the [[wavelength]], these [[oscillation]]s have an [[Infinity|infinite]] [[phase velocity]] and zero [[group velocity]].

Note that, when &lt;math&gt;m^*=m_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt;, the plasma frequency, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{pe}}&lt;/math&gt;, depends only on [[physical constant]]s and electron density &lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt;. The numeric expression for angular plasma frequency is

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{pe} = \frac{\omega_\text{pe}}{2\pi}~\left[\text{Hz}\right]&lt;/math&gt; 

Metals are only transparent to light with frequency higher than the metal's plasma frequency. For typical metals such as copper or silver, ''&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt;'' is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, which brings the plasma frequency into the ultraviolet region. This is why most metals reflect visible light and appear shiny.

=== 'Warm' electrons ===

When the effects of the [[electron]] thermal speed &lt;math&gt;v_{\mathrm{e,th}} = \sqrt{\frac{k_\mathrm{B} T_{\mathrm{e}}}{m_\mathrm{e}}}&lt;/math&gt; are taken into account, the electron pressure acts as a restoring force as well as the electric field and the oscillations propagate with frequency and [[wavenumber]] related by the longitudinal Langmuir&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation |last=Andreev |first=A. A. |title=An Introduction to Hot Laser Plasma Physics |year=2000 |publisher= [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=Huntington, New York |isbn=978-1-56072-803-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; wave:

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega^2 =\omega_{\mathrm{pe}}^2 +\frac{3k_\mathrm{B}T_{\mathrm{e}}}{m_\mathrm{e}}k^2=\omega_{\mathrm{pe}}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{\mathrm{e,th}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
called the [[David Bohm|Bohm]]-[[Eugene P. Gross|Gross]] [[dispersion relation]]. If the spatial scale is large compared to the [[Debye length]], the [[oscillation]]s are only weakly modified by the [[pressure]] term, but at small scales the pressure term dominates and the waves become dispersionless with a speed of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} \cdot v_{\mathrm{e,th}}&lt;/math&gt;. For such waves, however, the electron thermal speed is comparable to the [[phase velocity]], i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;
v \sim v_{\mathrm{ph}} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \frac{\omega}{k},
&lt;/math&gt;
so the plasma waves can [[accelerate]] electrons that are moving with speed nearly equal to the phase velocity of the wave. This process often leads to a form of collisionless damping, called [[Landau damping]]. Consequently, the large-''k'' portion in the [[dispersion relation]] is difficult to observe and seldom of consequence.

In a [[bounded function|bounded]] plasma, fringing electric fields can result in propagation of plasma oscillations, even when the electrons are cold.

In a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]], the effect of the [[ion]]s' periodic potential must be taken into account. This is usually done by using the electrons' [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] in place of ''m''.

'''Polyethylene terephthalate''' (sometimes written poly(ethylene terephthalate)), commonly abbreviated '''PET''', '''PETE''', or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is the most common [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] resin of the [[polyester]] family and is used in [[synthetic fibre|fibre]]s for clothing, [[packaging|containers]] for liquids and foods, [[thermoforming]] for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering [[resins]].

It may also be referred to by the brand names '''Terylene''' in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;The name Terylene was formed by inversion of (polyeth)ylene ter(ephthalate) and dates to the 1940s. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Terylene Oxford Dictionary].  Terylene was first registered as a UK trademark in April 1946.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|UK Intellectual Property Office]] {{UK trademark|646992|UK00000646992}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lavsan''' in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and  '''Dacron''' in the US.

The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Li Na|title=Study on Preparation Process and Properties of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.312.406|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|date=June 2013|volume=312|pages=406–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, [[polyester]], whereas the acronym ''PET'' is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP) and [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).

PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) units. PET is commonly [[PET bottle recycling|recycled]], and has the number "1" as its [[resin identification code]] (RIC).

Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a [[semi-crystalline polymer]]. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s) depending on its crystal structure and particle size.

The monomer [[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]] can be synthesized by the [[esterification]] reaction between [[terephthalic acid]] and [[ethylene glycol]] with water as a byproduct, or by [[transesterification]] reaction between [[ethylene glycol]] and [[dimethyl terephthalate]] (DMT) with [[methanol]] as a byproduct.  Polymerization is through a [[polycondensation]] reaction of the monomers (done immediately after esterification/transesterification) with water as the byproduct.

==Uses==
Plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for [[soft drink]]s (see [[carbonation]]). For certain specialty bottles, such as those designated for beer containment, PET sandwiches an additional [[polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVOH) layer to further reduce its oxygen permeability.

[[BoPET|Biaxially oriented PET]] film (often known by one of its trade names, "Mylar") can be aluminized by [[evaporation|evaporating]] a [[thin-film deposition|thin film]] of metal onto it to reduce its permeability, and to make it reflective and opaque ([[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|MPET]]). These properties are useful in many applications, including flexible food [[packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[thermal insulation]] (such as [[space blanket]]s). Because of its high mechanical strength, PET film is often used in tape applications, such as the carrier for [[magnetic tape]] or backing for [[pressure-sensitive tape|pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes]].

Non-oriented PET sheet can be [[thermoforming|thermoformed]] to make packaging trays and [[blister packs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pasbrig|first=Erwin|title=Cover film for blister packs|date=Mar 29, 2007|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20070068842|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; If crystallizable PET is used, the trays can be used for [[TV dinner|frozen dinners]], since they withstand both freezing and oven baking temperatures. Both amorphous PET and BoPET are transparent to the naked eye.  Color-conferring dyes can easily be formulated into PET sheet.

When filled with glass [[aggregate (composite)|particles]] or [[fiber-reinforced plastic|fibres]], it becomes significantly stiffer and more durable.

PET is also used as a substrate in thin film solar cells.

Terylene (a trademark formed by inversion of (polyeth)ylene ter(ephthalate)) is also spliced into bell rope tops to help prevent wear on the ropes as they pass through the ceiling.

PET is used since late 2014 as liner material in type IV composite high pressure [[gas cylinder]]s. PET works as a much better barrier to oxygen than earlier used (LD)PE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plasteurope.com/news/SIPA_t229769/ SIPA: Lightweight compressed gas cylinders have plastic liners / PET provides high oxygen barrier] https://www.plasteurope.com, 18 November 2014, retrieved 16 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

PET is used as a [[3D printing]] filament, as well as in the 3D printing plastic PETG.

==History==
PET was patented in 1941 by [[John Rex Whinfield]], [[James Tennant Dickson]] and their employer the [[Calico Printers' Association]] of [[Manchester]], England. [[DuPont|E. I. DuPont de Nemours]] in Delaware, United States, first used the trademark Mylar in June 1951 and received registration of it in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Whinfield, John Rex and Dickson, James Tennant (1941) "Improvements Relating to the Manufacture of Highly Polymeric Substances", UK Patent 578,079; "Polymeric Linear Terephthalic Esters", {{US Patent|2465319}} Publication date: 22 March 1949; Filing date: 24 September 1945; Priority date: 29 July 1941&lt;/ref&gt; It is still the best-known name used for polyester film. The current owner of the trademark is DuPont Teijin Films US, a partnership with a Japanese company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teijin.com/terms_conditions/trademark.html TEIJIN: Trademarks] "''Mylar and Melinex are the registered trademarks or trademarks of Dupont Teijin Films U.S. Limited Partnership and have been licensed to Teijin DuPont Films Japan Limited''"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union, PET was first manufactured in the laboratories of the Institute of High-Molecular Compounds of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in 1949, and its name "Lavsan" is an acronym thereof ('''ла'''боратории Института '''в'''ысокомолекулярных '''с'''оединений '''А'''кадемии '''н'''аук СССР).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ryazanova-Clarke, Larissa |author2=Wade, Terence |title=The Russian Language Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_OFr8TgcwMC&amp;pg=PA49|date=31 January 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-06587-7|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PET bottle was patented in 1973 by [[Nathaniel Wyeth (inventor)|Nathaniel Wyeth]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyeth, Nathaniel C. "Biaxially Oriented Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Bottle" [https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=hl49AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Biaxially+intitle:Oriented US patent 3733309]&lt;!--Google link by pat.

==Physical properties==
[[File:Thistle dinghy with skipper Terry Lettenmaier sailing downwind.jpg|thumb|[[Sailcloth]] is typically made from PET fibers also known as polyester or under the brand name Dacron; colorful lightweight [[spinnaker]]s are usually made of [[nylon]].]]
PET in its natural state is a colorless, semi-crystalline resin. Based on how it is processed, PET can be semi-rigid to rigid, and it is very lightweight. It makes a good gas and fair moisture barrier, as well as a good barrier to alcohol (requires additional "barrier" treatment) and solvents. It is strong and [[toughness|impact-resistant]]. PET becomes white when exposed to chloroform and also certain other chemicals such as toluene.&lt;ref&gt;NPCS Board of Consultants &amp; Engineers (2014) Chapter 6, p. 56 in ''Disposable Products Manufacturing Handbook'', NIIR Project Consultancy Services, Delhi, {{ISBN|978-9-381-03932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60% crystallization is the upper limit for commercial products{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, with the exception of polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; [[glass transition temperature]] to form an [[amorphous solid]]. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to [[nucleation|nucleate]] and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.

When allowed to cool slowly, the molten polymer forms a more crystalline material. This material has [[Spherulite (polymer physics)|spherulites]] containing many small [[crystallite]]s when crystallized from an amorphous solid, rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses the boundaries between crystallites and the amorphous regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. [[Cold drawing|Fiber drawing]] is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.

===Intrinsic viscosity===

One of the most important characteristics of PET is referred to as [[intrinsic viscosity]] (IV).&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, Ulrich K. (2007) ''Polyester Bottle Resins, Production, Processing, Properties and Recycling'', Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 85 ff, {{ISBN|978-3-9807497-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intrinsic viscosity of the material, found by extrapolating to zero concentration of relative viscosity to concentration which is measured in [[deciliter]]s per gram (dℓ/g). Intrinsic viscosity is dependent upon the length of its polymer chains but has no units due to being extrapolated to zero concentration. The longer the polymer chains the more entanglements between chains and therefore the higher the viscosity. The average chain length of a particular batch of resin can be controlled during [[polycondensation]].

==Drying==
PET is [[hygroscopic]], meaning that it absorbs water from its surroundings. However, when this "damp" PET is then heated, the water [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] the PET, decreasing its resilience. Thus, before the resin can be processed in a molding machine, it must be dried. Drying is achieved through the use of a [[desiccant]] or dryers before the PET is fed into the processing equipment.

Inside the dryer, hot dry air is pumped into the bottom of the hopper containing the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160&amp;nbsp;°C, at which level [[hydrolysis]] would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.

PET can also be dried in compressed air resin dryers. Compressed air dryers do not reuse drying air. Dry, heated compressed air is circulated through the PET pellets as in the desiccant dryer, then released to the atmosphere.

==Copolymers==
In addition to pure ([[homopolymer]]) PET, PET modified by [[copolymer]]ization is also available.

In some cases, the modified properties of copolymer are more desirable for a particular application. For example, [[cyclohexane dimethanol]] (CHDM) can be added to the polymer backbone in place of [[ethylene glycol]]. Since this building block is much larger (6 additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit would. This interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer's melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (Polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified; Eastman Chemical, SK Chemicals Selenis are some PETG manufacturers). PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded, sheet extruded or extruded as filament for [[3D printing]]. It can be colored during processing.

[[File:Phthalic acid isomers.PNG|thumb|Replacing terephthalic acid (right) with isophthalic acid (center) creates a kink in the PET chain, interfering with [[crystallization]] and lowering the polymer's [[melting point]].]]

Another common modifier is [[isophthalic acid]], replacing some of the 1,4-(''para-'') linked [[Terephthalic acid|terephthalate]] units. The 1,2-(''ortho-'') or 1,3-(''[[Arene substitution patterns|meta]]''-) linkage produces an angle in the chain, which also disturbs crystallinity.

Such copolymers are advantageous for certain molding applications, such as [[thermoforming]], which is used for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via [[stretch blow molding]] ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.

==Production==
Polyethylene terephthalate is produced from [[ethylene glycol]] and [[dimethyl terephthalate]](DMT) (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[terephthalic acid]].&lt;ref name=polyesters&gt;{{Ullmann's | title = Polyesters | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a21_227 |volume=A21|pages=233–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former is a [[transesterification]] reaction, whereas the latter is an [[esterification]] reaction.

===Dimethyl terephthalate process (DMT)===
[[File:PET by Transesterification V1.svg|thumb|Polyesterification reaction in the production of PET]]
In [[dimethyl terephthalate]](DMT) process, this compound and excess ethylene glycol are reacted in the melt at 150–200&amp;nbsp;°C with a [[base (chemistry)|basic catalyst]]. [[Methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is removed by distillation to drive the reaction forward. Excess ethylene glycol is distilled off at higher temperature with the aid of vacuum. The second transesterification step proceeds at 270–280&amp;nbsp;°C, with continuous distillation of ethylene glycol as well.&lt;ref name=polyesters/&gt;

The reactions are idealized as follows:
;First step
: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH

;Second step
: ''n'' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [(CO)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

===Terephthalic acid process===
[[File:PET by Polycondensation V1.svg|thumb|Polycondensation reaction in the production of PET]]
In the [[terephthalic acid]] process, esterification of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid is conducted directly at moderate pressure (2.7–5.5 bar) and high temperature (220–260&amp;nbsp;°C). Water is eliminated in the reaction, and it is also continuously removed by distillation:&lt;ref name = polyesters/&gt;

: ''n'' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH → [(CO)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Degradation==
PET is subjected to various types of degradations during processing. The main degradations that can occur are hydrolytic, and probably most important, thermal oxidation. When PET degrades, several things happen: discoloration, chain [[Bond cleavage|scissions]] resulting in reduced molecular weight, formation of [[acetaldehyde]], and [[cross-link]]s ("gel" or "fish-eye" formation). Discoloration is due to the formation of various chromophoric systems following prolonged thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. This becomes a problem when the optical requirements of the polymer are very high, such as in packaging applications. The thermal and thermooxidative degradation results in poor processibility characteristics and performance of the material.

One way to alleviate this is to use a [[copolymer]]. Comonomers such as CHDM or [[isophthalic acid]] lower the melting temperature and reduce the degree of crystallinity of PET (especially important when the material is used for bottle manufacturing). Thus, the resin can be plastically formed at lower temperatures and/or with lower force. This helps to prevent degradation, reducing the acetaldehyde content of the finished product to an acceptable (that is, unnoticeable) level. See [[#Copolymers|copolymers]], above. Another way to improve the stability of the polymer is to use stabilizers, mainly antioxidants such as [[phosphites]]. Recently, molecular level stabilization of the material using nanostructured chemicals has also been considered.

===Acetaldehyde===
[[Acetaldehyde]] is a colorless, volatile substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, it can cause an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300&amp;nbsp;°C or 570&amp;nbsp;°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute to the production of acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then [[diffusion|diffuses]] into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.

===Antimony===
[[Antimony]] (Sb) is a [[metalloid]] element that is used as a [[catalyst]] in the form of compounds such as [[antimony trioxide]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or antimony triacetate in the production of PET. After manufacturing, a detectable amount of antimony can be found on the surface of the product. This residue can be removed with washing. Antimony also remains in the material itself and can, thus, migrate out into food and drinks. Exposing PET to boiling or microwaving can increase the levels of antimony significantly, possibly above USEPA maximum contamination levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20309737|year=2010|author=Cheng, X. |pages=1323–30|issue=7|volume=17|title=Assessment of metal contaminations leaching out from recycling plastic bottles upon treatments|doi=10.1007/s11356-010-0312-4|journal=Environmental science and pollution research international|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drinking water limit assessed by WHO is 20 parts per billion (WHO, 2003), and the drinking water limit in the United States is 6 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.gov/ogwdw/pdfs/factsheets/ioc/antimony.pdf Consumer Factsheet on: Antimony], EPA [https://web.archive.org/web/20030623135029/http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/contaminants/dw_contamfs/antimony.html archive 2003-06-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Although antimony trioxide is of low toxicity when taken orally,&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/antimonysum.pdf Guidelines for drinking – water quality]. who.int&lt;/ref&gt; its presence is still of concern. The Swiss [[Federal Office of Public Health]] investigated the amount of antimony migration, comparing waters bottled in PET and glass: The antimony concentrations of the water in PET bottles were higher, but still well below the allowed maximum concentration. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health concluded that small amounts of antimony migrate from the PET into bottled water, but that the health risk of the resulting low concentrations is negligible (1% of the "[[tolerable daily intake]]" determined by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]). A later (2006) but more widely publicized study found similar amounts of antimony in water in PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/b517844b |title=Contamination of Canadian and European bottled waters with antimony from PET containers |year=2006 |author=Shotyk, William |journal=Journal of Environmental Monitoring |volume=8 |pages=288–92 |pmid=16470261 |issue=2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WHO has published a risk assessment for antimony in drinking water.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

Fruit juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established), however, that were produced and bottled in PET in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7&amp;nbsp;µg/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for [[tap water]] of 5&amp;nbsp;µg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elevated antimony concentrations in commercial juices|journal=Journal of Environmental Monitoring|author=Hansen, Claus |volume=12|issue=4|pages=822–4|year=2010|pmid=20383361|doi=10.1039/b926551a|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1254534/Fruit-juice-cancer-warning-scientists-harmful-chemical-16-drinks.html|title=Fruit juice cancer warning as scientists find harmful chemical in 16 drinks|author=Borland, Sophie |date= 1 March 2010|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodegradation===

At least one species of bacterium in the genus ''[[Nocardia]]'' can degrade PET with an [[esterase]] enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarsresearchlibrary.com/JMB-vol2-iss2/JMB-2012-2-2-248-257.pdf|author1=Sharon, Chetna |author2=Sharon, Madhuri |journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology Research|date=2012|pages=248–257|title=Studies on Biodegradation of Polyethylene terephthalate: A synthetic polymer|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese scientists have isolated a bacterium ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' that possesses two enzymes which can break down the PET into smaller pieces that the bacterium can digest.

Commentary published in ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'' in April 2010 suggested that PET might yield [[endocrine disruptor]]s under conditions of common use and recommended research on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sax, Leonard |title=Polyethylene Terephthalate May Yield Endocrine Disruptors|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|year=2010|volume=118 |issue=4|doi=10.1289/ehp.0901253|pmid=20368129|pmc=2854718|pages=445–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed mechanisms include leaching of [[phthalates]] as well as leaching of [[antimony]].
An article published in ''[[Journal of Environmental Monitoring]]'' in April 2012 concludes that antimony concentration in [[deionized water]] stored in PET bottles stays within EU's acceptable limit even if stored briefly at temperatures up to 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F), while bottled contents (water or soft drinks) may occasionally exceed the EU limit after less than a year of storage at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tukur, Aminu |title=PET bottle use patterns and antimony migration into bottled water and soft drinks: the case of British and Nigerian bottles|journal=Journal of Environmental Monitoring|year=2012|volume=14|issue=4|doi=10.1039/C2EM10917D|pages=1236–1246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottle processing equipment==
[[File:Plastic bottle.jpg|thumb|A finished PET drink bottle compared to the preform from which it is made. Worldwide, 480 billion plastic drinking bottles were made in 2016 (and less than half were recycled).&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Laville and Matthew Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/a-million-a-minute-worlds-plastic-bottle-binge-as-dangerous-as-climate-change "A million bottles a minute: world's plastic binge 'as dangerous as climate change'"], [[TheGuardian.com]], 28 June 2017 (page visited on 20 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are two basic molding methods for PET bottles, one-step and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using [[stretch blow molding]].

In the second step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then inflated against a two-part mold to form them into the final shape of the bottle. Preforms (uninflated bottles) are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some [[Red Cross]] chapters distribute them as part of the [[Vial of Life]] program to homeowners to store medical history for emergency responders.

In one-step machines, the entire process from raw material to finished container is conducted within one machine, making it especially suitable for molding non-standard shapes (custom molding), including jars, flat oval, flask shapes, etc. Its greatest merit is the reduction in space, product handling and energy, and far higher visual quality than can be achieved by the two-step system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Polyester recycling industry==
{{main|PET bottle recycling}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Symbol_Resin_Code_1_PETE.svg|left|50px|title=1-PETE]]

In 2016, it was estimated that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/does-newly-discovered-bacteria-recycle-plastic/ |title=Newly identified bacteria cleans up common plastic |newspaper=[[Ars Technica]] |date= 19 March 2016 |author=Saxena, Shalini |accessdate= 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, [[PET bottle recycling]] is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET has a [[resin identification code]] of 1.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |title=Plastic Packaging Resins |publisher=American Chemistry Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester [[Synthetic fiber|fiber]], strapping, and non-food containers.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

Because of the recyclability of PET and the relative abundance of [[post-consumer waste]] in the form of bottles, PET is rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. [[Mohawk Industries]] released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% post-consumer recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carpet-inspectors-experts.com/old/everstrand-smartstrand.htm everSTRAND™]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Carpet-inspectors-experts.com [https://web.archive.org/web/20080317233830/http://carpet-inspectors-experts.com/everstrand-smartstrand.htm archive 2008-03-17]&lt;/ref&gt; Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplygreencarpet.com/ Simply Green Carpet – A Berkshire Flooring Brand]. simplygreencarpet.com&lt;/ref&gt; produces a BCF (bulk continuous filament) PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% post-consumer recycled content.

PET, like many plastics, is also an excellent candidate for thermal disposal ([[incineration]]), as it is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur). PET has the energy content of soft coal.

When recycling polyethylene terephthalate or PET or polyester, in general three ways have to be differentiated:

#The chemical recycling back to the initial raw materials purified [[terephthalic acid]] (PTA) or [[dimethyl terephthalate]] (DMT) and [[ethylene glycol]] (EG) where the polymer structure is destroyed completely, or in process intermediates like [[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]]
#The mechanical recycling where the original polymer properties are being maintained or reconstituted.
#The chemical recycling where transesterification takes place and other glycols/polyols or glycerol are added to make a polyol which may be used in other ways such as polyurethane production or PU foam production&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makuska|first=Ricardas|date=2008 Vol 19. No 2 P. 29-34|title=Glycolysis of industrial poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste directed to bis(hydroxyethylene) terephthalate and aromatic polyester polyols|url=|journal=CHEMIJA|volume=19|pages=29–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chemical recycling of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines of more than 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only be seen, if at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants have been made in the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.

Mechanical recycling or direct circulation of PET in the polymeric state is operated in most diverse variants today. These kinds of processes are typical of small and medium-size industry. Cost-efficiency can already be achieved with plant capacities within a range of 5000–20,000 tons/year. In this case, nearly all kinds of recycled-material feedback into the material circulation are possible today. These diverse recycling processes are being discussed hereafter in detail.

Besides chemical contaminants and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] products generated during first processing and usage, mechanical impurities are representing the main part of quality depreciating impurities in the recycling stream. Recycled materials are increasingly introduced into manufacturing processes, which were originally designed for new materials only. Therefore, efficient sorting, separation and cleaning processes become most important for high quality recycled polyester.

When talking about polyester recycling industry, we are concentrating mainly on recycling of PET bottles, which are meanwhile used for all kinds of liquid packaging like water, carbonated soft drinks, juices, beer, sauces, detergents, household chemicals and so on. Bottles are easy to distinguish because of shape and consistency and separate from waste plastic streams either by automatic or by hand-sorting processes. The established polyester recycling industry consists of three major sections:

* PET bottle collection and waste separation: waste logistics
* Production of clean bottle flakes: flake production
* Conversion of PET flakes to final products: flake processing

Intermediate product from the first section is baled bottle waste with a PET content greater than 90%. Most common trading form is the bale but also bricked or even loose, pre-cut bottles are common in the market. In the second section, the collected bottles are converted to clean PET bottle flakes. This step can be more or less complex and complicated depending on required final flake quality. During the third step, PET bottle flakes are processed to any kind of products like film, bottles, fiber, filament, strapping or intermediates like pellets for further processing and engineering plastics.

Besides this external (post-consumer) polyester bottle recycling, numbers of internal (pre-consumer) recycling processes exist, where the wasted polymer material does not exit the production site to the free market, and instead is reused in the same production circuit. In this way, fiber waste is directly reused to produce fiber, preform waste is directly reused to produce preforms, and film waste is directly reused to produce film.

===PET bottle recycling===
{{main|PET bottle recycling}}

====Purification and decontamination====
The success of any recycling concept is hidden in the efficiency of purification and decontamination at the right place during processing and to the necessary or desired extent.

In general, the following applies: The earlier in the process foreign substances are removed, and the more thoroughly this is done, the more efficient the process is.

The high [[plasticization]] temperature of PET in the range of {{convert|280|°C|0}} is the reason why almost all common organic impurities such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polylactic acid|PLA]], [[polyolefin]], chemical wood-pulp and paper fibers, [[polyvinyl acetate]], melt adhesive, coloring agents, sugar, and [[protein]] residues are transformed into colored degradation products that, in their turn, might release in addition reactive degradation products.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000&amp;nbsp;µm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower. The influence of the microscopic particles, which—because they are many—increase the frequency of defects in the polymer, is relatively greater.

The motto "What the eye does not see the heart cannot grieve over" is considered to be very important in many recycling processes. Therefore, besides efficient sorting, the removal of visible impurity particles by melt filtration processes plays a particular part in this case.

[[File:Bales of PET bottles 4.png|thumb|Bales of crushed PET bottles sorted according to color: green, transparent, and blue.]]
In general, one can say that the processes to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there isn't just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, and it is difficult to decide for one or other plant design. Nevertheless, there are processes that are sharing most of these principles. Depending on composition and impurity level of input material, the general following process steps are applied.&lt;ref&gt;PET-Recycling Forum; "Current Technological Trends in Polyester Recycling"; 9th International Polyester Recycling Forum Washington, 2006; São Paulo; {{ISBN|3-00-019765-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impurities and material defects====
The number of possible impurities and material defects that accumulate in the polymeric material is increasing permanently—when processing as well as when using polymers—taking into account a growing service lifetime, growing final applications and repeated recycling. As far as recycled PET bottles are concerned, the defects mentioned can be sorted in the following groups:

# Reactive polyester OH- or COOH- end groups are transformed into dead or non-reactive end groups, e.g. formation of vinyl ester end groups through dehydration or decarboxylation of terephthalate acid, reaction of the OH- or COOH- end groups with mono-functional degradation products like mono-carbonic acids or alcohols. Results are decreased reactivity during re-polycondensation or re-SSP and broadening the molecular weight distribution.
# The end group proportion shifts toward the direction of the COOH end groups built up through a thermal and oxidative degradation. The results are decrease in reactivity, and increase in the acid autocatalytic decomposition during thermal treatment in presence of humidity.
# Number of polyfunctional macromolecules increases. Accumulation of gels and long-chain branching defects.
# Number, concentration, and variety of nonpolymer-identical organic and inorganic foreign substances are increasing. With every new thermal stress, the organic foreign substances will react by decomposition. This is causing the liberation of further degradation-supporting substances and coloring substances.
# Hydroxide and peroxide groups build up at the surface of the products made of polyester in presence of air (oxygen) and humidity. This process is accelerated by ultraviolet light. During an ulterior treatment process, hydro peroxides are a source of oxygen radicals, which are source of oxidative degradation. Destruction of hydro peroxides is to happen before the first thermal treatment or during plasticization and can be supported by suitable additives like antioxidants.

Taking into consideration the above-mentioned chemical defects and impurities, there is an ongoing modification of the following polymer characteristics during each recycling cycle, which are detectable by chemical and physical laboratory analysis.

In particular:

*Increase of COOH end-groups
*Increase of color number b
*Increase of haze (transparent products)
*Increase of oligomer content
*Reduction in filterability
*Increase of by-products content such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde
*Increase of extractable foreign contaminants
*Decrease in color L
*Decrease of [[intrinsic viscosity]] or dynamic viscosity
*Decrease of crystallization temperature and increase of crystallization speed
*Decrease of the mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break or [[elastic modulus]]
*Broadening of molecular weight distribution

The recycling of PET bottles is meanwhile an industrial standard process that is offered by a wide variety of engineering companies.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, Ulrich K. (2007) ''Polyester Bottle Resins Production, Processing, Properties and Recycling'', PETplanet Publisher GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 259 ff, {{ISBN|978-3-9807497-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processing examples for recycled polyester===
Recycling processes with polyester are almost as varied as the manufacturing processes based on primary pellets or melt. Depending on purity of the recycled materials, polyester can be used today in most of the polyester manufacturing processes as blend with virgin polymer or increasingly as 100% recycled polymer. Some exceptions like BOPET-film of low thickness, special applications like optical film or yarns through FDY-spinning at &gt; 6000 m/min, microfilaments, and micro-fibers are produced from virgin polyester only.

====Simple re-pelletizing of bottle flakes====
This process consists of transforming bottle waste into flakes, by drying and crystallizing the flakes, by plasticizing and filtering, as well as by pelletizing.
Product is an amorphous re-granulate of an intrinsic viscosity in the range of 0.55–0.7 dℓ/g, depending on how complete pre-drying of PET flakes has been done.

Special feature are: Acetaldehyde and oligomers are contained in the pellets at lower level; the viscosity is reduced somehow, the pellets are amorphous and have to be crystallized and dried before further processing.

Processing to:
*A-PET film for [[thermoforming]]
*Addition to PET virgin production
*[[BoPET]] packaging film
*PET Bottle [[resin]] by SSP
*Carpet yarn
*[[Engineering plastic]]
*Filaments
*[[Non-woven]]
*Packaging stripes
*[[Staple fibre]].

Choosing the re-pelletizing way means having an additional conversion process that is, at the one side, energy-intensive and cost-consuming, and causes thermal destruction. At the other side, the pelletizing step is providing the following advantages:

*Intensive melt filtration
*Intermediate quality control
*Modification by additives
*Product selection and separation by quality
*Processing flexibility increased
*Quality uniformization.

====Manufacture of PET-pellets or flakes for bottles (bottle to bottle) and A-PET====

This process is, in principle, similar to the one described above; however, the pellets produced are directly (continuously or discontinuously) crystallized and then subjected to a solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a tumbling drier or a vertical tube reactor. During this processing step, the corresponding intrinsic viscosity of 0.80–0.085 dℓ/g is rebuild again and, at the same time, the acetaldehyde content is reduced to &lt; 1 ppm.

The fact that some machine manufacturers and line builders in Europe and the United States make efforts to offer independent recycling processes, e.g. the so-called bottle-to-bottle (B-2-B) process, such as BePET,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bepet.com BePET]&lt;/ref&gt; Starlinger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starlinger.com Starlinger]&lt;/ref&gt; URRC or BÜHLER, aims at generally furnishing proof of the "existence" of the required extraction residues and of the removal of model contaminants according to FDA applying the so-called challenge test, which is necessary for the application of the treated polyester in the food sector. Besides this process approval it is nevertheless necessary that any user of such processes has to constantly check the FDA limits for the raw materials manufactured by themselves for their process.

====Direct conversion of bottle flakes====
In order to save costs, an increasing number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing an increasing number of polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through [[polycondensation]] in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.

With regard to the consumption of PET bottle flakes, the main portion of about 70% is converted to fibers and filaments. When using directly secondary materials such as bottle flakes in spinning processes, there are a few processing principles to obtain.

High-speed spinning processes for the manufacture of POY normally need a viscosity of 0.62–0.64 dℓ/g. Starting from bottle flakes, the viscosity can be set via the degree of drying. The additional use of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is necessary for full dull or semi dull yarn. In order to protect the spinnerets, an efficient filtration of the melt is, in any case is necessary. For the time-being, the amount of POY made of 100% recycling polyester is rather low because this process requires high purity of spinning melt. Most of the time, a blend of virgin and recycled pellets is used.

Staple fibers are spun in an intrinsic viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower and that should be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g. In this case, too, the required viscosity can be adjusted via drying or vacuum adjustment in case of vacuum extrusion. For adjusting the viscosity, however, an addition of chain length modifier like [[ethylene glycol]] or [[diethylene glycol]] can also be used.

Spinning non-woven—in the fine titer field for textile applications as well as heavy spinning non-woven as basic materials, e.g. for roof covers or in road building—can be manufactured by spinning bottle flakes. The spinning viscosity is again within a range of 0.58–0.65 dℓ/g.

One field of increasing interest where recycled materials are used is the manufacture of high-tenacity packaging stripes, and monofilaments. In both cases, the initial raw material is a mainly recycled material of higher intrinsic viscosity. High-tenacity packaging stripes as well as monofilament are then manufactured in the melt spinning process.

===Recycling to the monomers===
Polyethylene terephthalate can be depolymerized to yield the constituent monomers. After purification, the monomers can be used to prepare new polyethylene terephthalate. The ester bonds in polyethylene terephthalate may be cleaved by hydrolysis, or by transesterification. The reactions are simply the reverse of those used [[#Production|in production]].

====Partial glycolysis====
Partial glycolysis (transesterification with ethylene glycol) converts the rigid polymer into short-chained oligomers that can be melt-filtered at low temperature. Once freed of the impurities, the oligomers can be fed back into the production process for polymerization.

The task consists in feeding 10–25% bottle flakes while maintaining the quality of the bottle pellets that are manufactured on the line. This aim is solved by degrading the PET bottle flakes—already during their first plasticization, which can be carried out in a single- or multi-screw extruder—to an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.30 dℓ/g by adding small quantities of ethylene glycol and by subjecting the low-viscosity melt stream to an efficient filtration directly after plasticization. Furthermore, temperature is brought to the lowest possible limit. In addition, with this way of processing, the possibility of a chemical decomposition of the hydro peroxides is possible by adding a corresponding P-stabilizer directly when plasticizing.
The destruction of the hydro peroxide groups is, with other processes, already carried out during the last step of flake treatment for instance by adding H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Boos, Frank and Thiele, Ulrich "Reprocessing pulverised polyester waste without yellowing", German Patent [https://www.google.com/patents/DE19503055A1?cl=en DE19503055], Publication date: 8 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The partially glycolyzed and finely filtered recycled material is continuously fed to the esterification or prepolycondensation reactor, the dosing quantities of the raw materials are being adjusted accordingly.

===Total glycolysis, methanolysis, and hydrolysis===
The treatment of polyester waste through total glycolysis to fully convert the polyester to [[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This compound is purified by vacuum distillation, and is one of the intermediates used in polyester manufacture (see [[#Production|production]]). The reaction involved is as follows:

: [(CO)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;rarr; ''n'' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This recycling route has been executed on an industrial scale in Japan as experimental production.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Similar to total glycolysis, methanolysis converts the polyester to [[dimethyl terephthalate]](DMT), which can be filtered and vacuum distilled:

: [(CO)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ''2n'' CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;rarr; ''n'' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Methanolysis is only rarely carried out in industry today because polyester production based on dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) has shrunk tremendously, and many dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) producers have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Fakirov, Stoyko (ed.) (2002) ''Handbook of Thermoplastic Polyesters'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, pp. 1223 ff, {{ISBN|3-527-30113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as above, polyethylene terephthalate can be hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid and [[ethylene glycol]] under high temperature and pressure. The resultant crude terephthalic acid can be purified by [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] to yield material suitable for re-polymerization:

: [(CO)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr;  ''n'' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

This method does not appear to have been commercialized yet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Stoltmann was the author of three books: ''Hiking Guide to the Big Trees of British Columbia'', ''Written by the Wind'', and ''Hiking the Ancient Forests of British Columbia and Washington.''

Stoltmann became an expert on big trees in British Columbia at a young age. He played a key role in the campaign to prevent the logging of the [[Carmanah Valley]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. This led to the establishment of the [[Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park]] in 1990.

In May 1994 Stoltmann was killed when he fell into a crevasse while mountaineering in the [[Kitlope Range|Kitlope]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bivouac.com//UsrPg.asp?UsrId=269 |title=Randy Stoltmann (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Bivouac.com |publisher= |access-date=2017-12-15 |quote=In May of 1994 the news hit the Vancouver mountaineering community that Randy had died in an avalanche while on a several week traverse in the Kitilope area.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The provincial government honoured Stoltmann after his death by naming the Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove in Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park after him. In addition, activists working to preserve the [[Elaho Valley]] north of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] designated this area as the Stoltmann Wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildernesscommittee.org/campaigns/rainforest/lower_mainland/stoltmann_wilderness/reports/Vol17No06/history History of the Stoltmann Wilderness] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050409145326/http://www.wildernesscommittee.org/campaigns/rainforest/lower_mainland/stoltmann_wilderness/reports/Vol17No06/history |date=2005-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loads on both horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are cyclic; that is, the thrust and torque acting on the blades is dependent on where the blade is. In a horizontal axis wind turbine, both the apparent wind speed seen by the blade and the angle of attack depend on the position of the blade. This phenomenon is described as rotational sampling. This article will provide an insight into the cyclic nature of the loads that arise because of rotational sampling for a horizontal axis wind turbine.

Rotational sampling can be divided into two parts: deterministic and stochastic.  Deterministic processes present themselves as spikes on a power spectrum, whereas stochastic processes are broader i.e. spread over a wider frequency range.

==Background==
Analysis of the loads on a wind turbine can be carried out through use of power spectra. A power spectrum is defined as the power spectral density function of a signal plotted against frequency. The power spectral density function of a plot is defined as the Fourier transform of the covariance function.&lt;ref&gt;Remote sensing: models and methods for image processing, R. a. Schowengerdt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Remote Sensing: Models and Methods for Image Processing, Robert A. Schowengerd&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding analysis of loads, the analysis involves time series, in which case the covariance function becomes the [[autocovariance]] function. In the signal processing sense, the autocovariance can be related to the [[autocorrelation]] function.

==Deterministic processes==
===Sources of deterministic processes===
Upon completing a single revolution, a blade has produced an ever-changing torque, and so power. Some of these changes are due to deterministic processes i.e. processes that can be determined and do not require statistical methods. Examples of deterministic processes are listed below:

* Gravitational loading
* Tower shadow &lt;ref&gt;Time-Domain Modeling of Tower Shadow and Wind Shear in Wind Turbines, 
Swagata Das, Neeraj Karnik, and Surya Santoso&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wind shear &lt;ref&gt;Time-Domain Modeling of Tower Shadow and Wind Shear in Wind Turbines, 
Swagata Das, Neeraj Karnik, and Surya Santoso&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gravitational loading====
As a blade sweeps through each cycle, gravity is acting on the blade. Depending on the part of the cycle, gravity might be acting to accelerate the blade, or decelerate it. The additional torque that arises on a blade due to gravity is given by

&lt;math&gt;
T_{grav} = rmg\cos(\Omega_0t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the length of the blade, ''m'' is the mass of the blade, ''g'' is the gravitational field strength, ''t'' is the time, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the blade.

====Tower shadow====
In fluid dynamics, the flow of a fluid is dependent upon boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are influenced by the presence of solid bodies. In a wind turbine, the presence of the tower results in a reduction of the wind speed directly in front of it; that is, the blades experience a reduced wind speed when they pass in front of the tower.

====Wind shear====
In fluid dynamics, there exists the [[No-slip condition|no slip]] boundary condition. This states that the velocity of a fluid at the surface of a solid body, such as the Earth, is zero. A consequence of that is that the wind speed varies with height above ground. This effect is known as wind shear. As a result, a blade at the highest part of its cycle will experience a greater wind speed than that of one at the lowest part of its cycle.

===Power spectral density functions===
====Drivetrain components====
The drive train of a wind turbine comprises the hub, the low speed shaft, the gearbox, the high speed shaft, and the generator. The torque at the hub is strongly influenced by the rotor dynamics. The instantaneous hub torque is found by summing all the torques from all the blades of the wind turbine at any instant in time.

Consider an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bladed wind turbine. Each blade is separated angularly from a neighbouring blade by &lt;math&gt;360/n&lt;/math&gt; degrees. That is, for a 3-bladed wind turbine, the blades are 120 degrees apart.

The torque acting on the blade is defined as the z-component of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''r''' is the radius from the axis of rotation (in this case the hub), and '''F''' is the force acting on the blade. If the torque is defined as the z-component of this cross product, then the torque is simply ''rF''&lt;sub&gt;perp&lt;/sub&gt; where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;perp&lt;/sub&gt; is the force perpendicular to the radius vector, or tangential to the instantaneous velocity of the blade (See figure below)

From the figure above, it can be seen that the torque, ''T'', due to gravitational forces acting on a single blade is given by the following expression:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T_{grav} = \sum_{k}rmg\cos(k\Omega_0t)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''m'' is the mass of the blade, ''g'' is the gravitational field strength, ''k'' is a multiplicative integer, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the blade, and ''t'' is the time.

For an n-bladed rotor, the instantaneous torque at the hub from all ''n'' blades by gravity is determined by summing the effects of all the blades at any one instant. Remembering that the blades are offset from each other by ''360/n'', the instantaneous torque at the hub from gravity is given by the following expression:

&lt;math&gt;
T_{grav} = \sum_k \left(rmg\cos(k\Omega_0t) + rmg\cos(k\Omega_0t - 360/n) + rmg\cos(k\Omega_0t - 2(360/n)) + \dots\right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

Simple trigonometry reveals that only non-zero terms arise when ''k'' is a multiple of ''n''. Thus, the overall effect of gravity on the torque at the hub is

&lt;math&gt;
T_{grav} = n\sum_{k = 1}\cos(nk\Omega_0t)
&lt;/math&gt;

The covariance function of a sum of sinusoids is itself a sum of sinusoidal functions. Thus, the power spectral density function is a set of Dirac delta functions. The locations of these are at multiples of ''n''. Thus, on a power spectrum, deterministic processes such as gravitational loading manifest themselves as spikes. This can be seen from analysing generator torque.

====Blades====
For analysis of torque on a single blade, the spikes occur at &lt;math&gt;k'\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; where ''k''' is 1,2,3,..&lt;ref&gt;Aerodynamics of Wind Turbines, Martin O. L. Hansen&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen from taking the autocovariance of equation 1, and then taking the Fourier transform of this result.

==Structural loads==
Spectral analysis of component loading is useful in fatigue analysis.

The '''S4G reactor''' is a [[United States Naval reactor|naval reactor]] used by the [[United States Navy]] to provide [[electricity generation]] and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propulsion]] on [[warship]]s.  The S4G designation stands for:

* S = [[Submarine]] platform
* 4 = Fourth generation [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] designed by the contractor
* G = [[General Electric]] was the contracted designer

This [[nuclear reactor]] is the shipboard equivalent of the [[S3G reactor]].  It was installed in a dual-configuration on the [[USS Triton (SSRN-586)|USS ''Triton'' (SSRN-586)]] with two reactors and two five-blade propellers, which was the first ship to make a submerged [[Operation Sandblast|circumnavigation]] of the world.

'''Sodium aluminium hydride''' or '''sodium alanate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a white [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] solid that dissolves in [[tetrahydrofuran|tetrahydrofuran (THF)]], but not in [[diethyl ether]] or hydrocarbons.  It has been evaluated as an agent for the reversible storage of hydrogen and it is used as a [[reagent]] for the [[chemical synthesis]] of [[organic compound]]s. Similar to [[lithium aluminium hydride]], it is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] consisting of separated [[sodium]] [[cations]] and tetrahedral AlH{{su|b=4|p=−}} [[anion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Lauher, D. Dougherty P. J. Herley "Sodium tetrahydroaluminate" Acta Crystallogr. 1979, volume B35, pp.1454-1456.  {{doi|10.1107/S0567740879006701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure, preparation, and reactions==
Sodium tetrahydroaluminate adopts the structure of (is isostructural with) [[calcium tungstate]].  As such, the tetrahedral AlH{{su|b=4|p=−}} centers are linked with eight-coordinat Na+ cations.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, D.; Herley, P. J.; Lauher, J. W. "Sodium tetrahydridoaluminate"Acta Crystallographica B (24,1968-38,1982) (1979) 35, p1454-p1456.&lt;/ref&gt;
The compound is prepared from the elements under high pressures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 200&amp;nbsp;°C using [[triethylaluminium]] catalyst:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rittmeyer, Ulrich Wietelmann "Hydrides" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Na  +  Al  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

As a suspension in diethyl ether, it reacts with [[lithium chloride]] to give the popular reagent [[lithium aluminium hydride]]:
:LiCl  +  NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; →   LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaCl

The compound reacts rapidly, even violently, with [[protic solvent|protic]] reagents, such as water, as described in this idealized equation:
:4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; →   "NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;"  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Sodium tetrahydroaluminate can release up to 7.4 wt % of hydrogen when heated at {{convert|200|°C|°F}}. [[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorption]] can be slow, with several minutes being required to fill a tank.  Both release and uptake are catalysed by [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://phys.org/news123307288.html | title = Researchers Solve Decade-Old Mystery of Hydrogen Storage Material | publisher = Phys.Org | date = 2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagent in organic chemistry===
Sodium aluminium hydride is a strong [[reducing agent]], very similar in reactivity to [[lithium aluminum hydride]] (LAH) and, to some extent, [[Diisobutylaluminium hydride]] (DIBAL) in organic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Gugelchuk "Sodium Aluminum Hydride" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001,  John Wiley. {{DOI|10.1002/047084289X.rs039}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more powerful reducing agent than [[sodium borohydride]] due to the weaker and more [[polar bond|polar]] Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond.  Like LAH, it reduces [[ester]]s to [[alcohol]]s.

==Safety==
Sodium aluminium hydride is highly flammable. It does not react in dry air at room temperature but is very sensitive to moisture.  It ignites or explodes on contact with water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">{{Desalination}}
The '''solar humidification–dehumidification method''' ('''HDH''') is a thermal water [[desalination]] method. It is based on [[evaporation]] of [[sea water]] or [[brackish water]] and subsequent [[condensation]] of the generated humid air, mostly at ambient pressure. This process mimics the natural [[water cycle]], but over a much shorter time frame.

==Overview==
The simplest configuration is implemented in the [[solar still]], evaporating the sea water inside a glass covered box and condensing the water vapor on the lower side of the glass cover. More sophisticated designs separate the solar heat gain section from the evaporation-condensation chamber. An optimized design comprises separated evaporation and condensation sections. A significant part of the heat consumed for evaporation can be regained during condensation. An example for such an optimized thermal desalination cycle is the [[multiple-effect humidification]] (MEH) method of desalination.

Solar humidification takes place in every greenhouse. Water evaporates from the surfaces of soil, water and plants because of thermal input. In this way the humidification process is naturally integrated within the architecture of the greenhouse. Several companies like [[Seawater greenhouse]] utilize this inherent feature of a greenhouse in order to conduct desalination inside the atmosphere of the facility.
The [[integrated biotectural system]], or IBTS Greenhouse mimics the natural process of cloud formation respectively desalination exactly.

There are successful small-scale agricultural experimentation done in arid regions such as Israel, West Africa, and Peru. The major difficulty lies in effectively concentrating the energy of sun on a small area to speed up evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trujillo|first=Alan|title=Essentials of Oceanography|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780321668127|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most varieties are [[xerophyte|drought]]- and heat-tolerant, and are especially important in [[arid]] regions, where the grain is one of the [[staple food|staples]] for poor and rural people. These varieties form important components of forage in many tropical regions. ''S. bicolor'' is an important [[food crop]] in [[Africa]], [[Central America]], and [[South Asia]], and is the fifth-most important [[cereal]] crop grown in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/15/sorghum-wonder-grain-american-food-quinoa|title=Move over, quinoa: sorghum is the new 'wonder grain'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 December 2015|author=Tove Danovich|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the plants' growth, some species of sorghum can contain levels of [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[hordenine]], and nitrates which are lethal to grazing animals. When stressed by drought or heat, plants can also contain toxic levels of cyanide and nitrates at later stages in growth.

'''Starfish Hill Wind Farm''' is a [[wind power]] station spread over two hills near [[Cape Jervis, South Australia|Cape Jervis]], [[South Australia]]. It has 23 [[wind turbines]], eight on Starfish Hill itself and 15 on Salt Creek Hill, with a combined [[Electricity generation|generating]] capacity of 34.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] of [[electricity]].

Starfish Hill Wind Farm was commissioned in September 2003, making it the first major wind farm in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RATCH - Australia Corporation|url = http://www.ratchaustralia.com/starfish/about_starfish.html|website = www.ratchaustralia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starfish Hill Wind Farm was developed by Starfish Hill Wind Farm Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Tarong Energy]] at a cost of A$65 million. RATCH Australia (at that time Transfield Services) acquired the wind farm in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RATCH - Australia Corporation|url = http://www.ratchaustralia.com/starfish/about_starfish.html|website = www.ratchaustralia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s Yang Shifang ({{lang|zh-hans|杨世芳}}), head of the People's Government of Ningxiang, planned to build a reservoir for [[irrigation]], flood control, [[electricity generation]] and fish farming. Due to poverty, the government mobilized the masses and used a large amount of human resources to complete the build rather than use [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy construction equipment]].

'''Uranium carbide''', a [[carbide]] of [[uranium]], is a hard [[refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] [[ceramic]] material. It comes in several [[stoichiometric|stoichiometries]] ({{Uranium}}{{Carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), such as uranium methanide ('''UC''', [[CAS number]] 12070-09-6), uranium [[sesquicarbide]] ('''U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', CAS number 12076-62-9),&lt;ref&gt;
Also called diuranium tricarbide, it was  reported by A.E. Austin, Acta Crystallographica, 1959, '''12''', 159-161.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and uranium [[acetylide]] ('''UC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', CAS number 12071-33-9).&lt;ref&gt;
Uranium dicarbide was reported by A.L. Bowman, G.P. Arnold, W.G. Witteman, T.C. Wallace and N.G. Nereson, Acta Crystallographica, 1966, '''21''', 670-671.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[uranium dioxide]] and some other uranium compounds, uranium carbide can be used as a [[nuclear fuel]] for [[nuclear reactor]]s, usually in the form of pellets or tablets. Uranium carbide fuel was used in late designs of [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s.

Uranium carbide pellets are used as fuel kernels for the US version of [[pebble bed reactor]]s; the German version uses [[uranium dioxide]] instead.

As nuclear fuel, uranium carbide can be used either on its own, or mixed with [[plutonium carbide]] (PuC and Pu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The mixture is also labeled as [[uranium-plutonium carbide]] (PuC U).

Uranium carbide is also a popular target material for [[particle accelerator]]s.

[[Ammonia]] synthesis from nitrogen and hydrogen is sometimes accomplished in the presence of uranium carbide acting as a catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Alvin W.

It is named after a former [[Alabama Power]] and [[Southern Company]] board chairman, [[Alvin Vogtle]].

Each unit has a [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), with a [[General Electric]] [[steam turbine]] and [[electric generator]]. 
Units&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;2 were completed in 1987 and 1989, respectively. 
Each unit has a gross electricity generation capacity of 1,215&amp;nbsp;MW, for a combined capacity of 2,430&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="southernco"&gt;{{cite web  | title=Plant Vogtle - Southern Company  | publisher=Southern Company  | url=http://www.southernco.com/southernnuclear/vogtle.asp  | accessdate= 2007-03-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205113659/http://www.southernco.com/southernnuclear/vogtle.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The twin natural-draft [[cooling towers]] are {{convert|548|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and provide cooling to the plant's main condensers. 
Four smaller mechanical draft cooling towers provide nuclear service cooling water (NSCW) to safety and auxiliary non-safety components, as well as remove the decay heat from the reactor when the plant is offline. 
One natural-draft tower and two NSCW towers serve each unit. 
In 2009, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) renewed the licenses for both units for an additional 20&amp;nbsp;years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/06/04/met_526417.shtml| title= Licenses for Vogtle current reactors renewed| last= Pavey | first= Rob | date= June 4, 2009 | work= [[Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=| accessdate= 2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1/16/2047 for Unit 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactors/vog1.html |title= Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1 |date= 2017-02-10 |work= NRC |publisher= [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate= 18 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2/9/2049 for Unit 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactors/vog2.html |title= Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1 |date= 2017-02-10 |work= NRC |publisher= [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate= 18 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional units utilizing [[Westinghouse AP1000]] reactors are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/11/22/bus_556611.shtml| title= Vogtle lays groundwork for first U.S. reactors in decades| last= Pavey | first= Rob | date= November 22, 2009 | work= [[Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=| accessdate= 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Natural-draft type cooling towers were also selected, and the two new cooling towers are nearly {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall. 
The units have suffered several delays and cost overruns. 
The certified construction &amp; capital costs incurred by [[Georgia Power]] for these two new units were originally $4.418 billion which escalated to an estimated $8.77 billion ($12.17 billion including financing costs) according to the Seventeenth Semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in 2017.&lt;ref name="17thReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.psc.state.ga.us/factsv2/Document.aspx?documentNumber=169459|publisher= ''[[Georgia Power]]''|title=Seventeenth Semi-Annual Construction Monitoring Report for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gertner|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/magazine/16nuclear.html|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|title= Atomic Balm?|date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{cite web  |last=Moens  |first=John  |title=U.S. Nuclear Plants - Vogtle  |publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  |date=March 18, 2005  |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/vogtle.html  |accessdate=2007-03-02  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/vogtle.html  |archivedate=July 26, 2018  |df=mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This last report blames the latest increase of costs on the contractor not completing work as scheduled. 
Another complicating factor in the construction process is the bankruptcy of Westinghouse in 2017.&lt;ref name=retuers-rb&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-board-idUSKBN17006K |title= Toshiba's Westinghouse files for bankruptcy as charges jump |website= [[reuters.com]] |first1= Makiko |last1= Yamazaki |first2= Tim |last2= Kelly |date= 29 March 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 costs were estimated to be about $25 billion.&lt;ref name=power-eng-20180809/&gt;
Upon completion of Units&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;4, Vogtle will become the largest nuclear power station in the United States and the largest power plant of any fuel type nationwide by annual net generation.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170324&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-idUSKBN16V04G |title=Toshiba decides on Westinghouse bankruptcy, sees $9 billion in charges: sources |first=Taro |last=Fuse |publisher=Reuters |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power uprate==
In 2008, both reactors were increased in power by 1.7% by an "Appendix&amp;nbsp;K" uprate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050/part050-appk.html|title=NRC: 10 CFR Appendix K to Part 50—ECCS Evaluation Models|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called a Measurement Uncertainty Recapture (MUR) uprate. Measurement uncertainty recapture power uprates are less than 2&amp;nbsp;percent, and are achieved by implementing enhanced techniques for calculating reactor power. This involves the use of state-of-the-art feedwater flow measurement devices to more precisely measure feedwater flow, which is used to calculate reactor power. More precise measurements reduce the degree of uncertainty in the power level, which is used by analysts to predict the ability of the reactor to be safely shut down under postulated accident conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/power-uprates.html|title=NRC: Power Uprates|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the reactor power can now be calculated with much greater accuracy than with the old [[Venturi effect|venturi]] type measurement, the plant can safely run within a tighter margin of error to its limits. The new flowmeter works by comparing the time it takes [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] sound pulses to travel upstream versus downstream inside the pipe, and uses the time differential to figure the flow rate of the water in the pipe.

The NRC approved Vogtle's License Amendment Request (LAR) in March&amp;nbsp;2008. The NRC staff determined that Southern Nuclear could safely increase the reactor’s power output primarily through more accurate means of measuring feedwater flow. NRC staff also reviewed Southern Nuclear’s evaluations showing that the plant’s design can handle the increased power level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2008/08-043.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512132415/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2008/08-043.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 May 2009|title=NRC: News Release - 2008-043 - NRC Approves Power Uprate for Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant|date=12 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unit&amp;nbsp;1 was uprated during its Spring 2008 refueling outage, and Unit&amp;nbsp;2 was uprated in the Fall outage of the same year.

==Incidents and accidents==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
===Loss of power===
A loss of electrical power in the plant occurred on March 20, 1990.

At 9:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., a truck carrying fuel and lubricants in the plant's 230kV switchyard backed into a support column for the feeder line supplying power to the Unit&amp;nbsp;1-A reserve auxiliary transformer (RAT). At the time, the 1-B RAT was de-energized for maintenance and RAT 1-A was powering both trains of emergency electrical power.  The non-emergency electrical trains were being powered by back-feeding from the switchyard through the main step-up transformer to the 1-A and 1-B unit auxiliary transformers (UAT). Additionally, emergency diesel generator (EDG) 1-B was out of service for planned maintenance. After the power loss, EDG 1-A failed to start due to a protective safety trip. The resulting loss of electrical power in the plant's "vital circuits" shut down the residual heat removal (RHR) pump that was cooling the core of Unit&amp;nbsp;1 (which was nearing the end of a refueling outage) and prevented the backup RHR from activating. Even though Unit&amp;nbsp;1 was offline at the time, residual heat from the natural decay of the radioactive fuel must be removed to prevent a dangerous rise in core temperature. While the non-safety power was not interrupted, there was no physical connection between the vital and non-vital electrical trains, preventing the vital trains from receiving power from the unaffected path through the UATs.

At 9:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the plant operators declared a site area emergency (SAE) per existing procedures which called for an SAE whenever "vital" power is lost for more than 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At 9:56&amp;nbsp;a.m., after trying multiple times to start the 1-A EDG normally, plant operators performed an emergency startup of the EDG by activating the generator's emergency start "break-glass" which bypassed most of the EDG's safeties and forced it to start. The startup was successful. RHR-A was then started using power from EDG-A. With core cooling restored, the SAE was downgraded to an alert at 10:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. At 11:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., crews energized RAT 1-B which had been shut down for maintenance, restoring power to the "B" safety electrical train. At 12:57&amp;nbsp;p.m., the "A" safety train was switched from the EDG to RAT 1-B and the EDG was shut down. With both trains receiving offsite power, the alert was terminated at 1:47&amp;nbsp;p.m.

The temperature of the Unit&amp;nbsp;1 core coolant increased from {{convert|90|F|C}} to {{convert|136|F|C}} during the 36&amp;nbsp;minutes required to re-energize the A-side bus. Throughout the event, non-vital power was continuously available to Unit&amp;nbsp;1 from off-site sources. However, the Vogtle electrical system was not designed to permit easy interconnection of the Unit&amp;nbsp;1 vital busses to non-vital power or the Unit&amp;nbsp;2 electrical busses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1990/in90025.html|title=NRC: Information Notice No. 90-25: Loss of Vital AC Power With Subsequent Reactor Coolant System Heat-Up|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this incident, Plant Vogtle has implemented changes to the plant that allow the non-vital electrical buses to transfer power to the vital buses in this type of scenario.

This electrical fault also affected Unit&amp;nbsp;2 by causing breakers in the 230kV switchyard to trip, cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus "B." EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored power to the vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on the Unit&amp;nbsp;2 main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated, opening the transformer's output breaker. This caused a full load rejection to Unit&amp;nbsp;2, leading to a turbine trip and subsequently, a reactor [[scram]]. After Unit&amp;nbsp;2 tripped, the "B" non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B, causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip. Despite this, plant cool-down proceeded safely. At 9:03&amp;nbsp;p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital "B" electrical trains, allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused Unit&amp;nbsp;2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the Unit&amp;nbsp;2 would have remained online.

On August 15, 2006, [[Southern Nuclear]] formally applied for an Early Site Permit (ESP) for two additional units. 
The ESP determined whether the site was appropriate for additional reactors, and this process is separate from the [[Combined Construction and Operating License]] (COL) application process.&lt;ref name="nrc_esp"&gt;{{cite web| title=NRC: Early Site Permits - Licensing Reviews| publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission| url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/esp.html| accessdate= 2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear announced that it had submitted an application for a COL, a process which would take at least 3 to 4 years.&lt;ref name="nrc_col"&gt;{{cite news| title=Southern utilities apply for new nuclear licenses| publisher=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN3143208820080331| accessdate= 2008-04-02| first=Eileen| last=O'Grady| date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On April 9, 2008, Georgia Power Company reached a contract agreement for two [[AP1000]] reactors designed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]]; owned by [[Toshiba]]. 
Westinghouse partnered with the Shaw Group (Baton Rouge, LA) and its Stone &amp; Webster division to manage the project with Westinghouse responsible for engineering, design, and overall management, and Shaw responsible for manufacturing the pre-fabricated component modules and managing the on-site construction.&lt;ref name="contract_1"&gt;{{cite news| title= Westinghouse wins first US nuclear deal in 30 years| publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/10/nuclear.nuclearpower| accessdate= 2008-04-09| location=London| first=Terry| last=MacAlister| date=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contract represented the first agreement for new nuclear development in the United States since the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and it received approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission on March 17, 2009.&lt;ref name="contract_2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Nuclear Reactors Get Green Light |publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution |url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/03/18/nukepsc0318.html |accessdate=2009-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/03/18/nukepsc0318.html |archivedate=July 26, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contract_1" /&gt;

===Construction===
On August 26, 2009, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) issued an Early Site Permit and a Limited Work Authorization. 
Limited construction at the new reactor sites began, with Unit 3 then expected to be operational in 2016, followed by Unit 4 in 2017, pending final issuance of the Combined Construction and Operating License by the NRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = Southern Company Plant Vogtle Media Guide| publisher = [[Southern Company]]| date = June 2011| url = http://www.southerncompany.com/nuclearenergy/SNCmedia/Vogtle_Media_Guide.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227121317/http://southerncompany.com/nuclearenergy/SNCmedia/Vogtle_Media_Guide.pdf| accessdate = November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Vogtle Units Receive NRC Staff Approval for Final Safety Report |publisher=[[Southern Company]] |date=August 9, 2011 |url=http://southerncompany.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2373 |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://southerncompany.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2373 |archivedate=July 26, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These dates have since slipped to 2021 and 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively.

On February&amp;nbsp;16, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] announced $8.33&amp;nbsp;billion in federal loan guarantees toward the construction cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Obama Administration Announces Loan Guarantees to Construct New Nuclear Power Reactors in Georgia| publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-loan-guarantees-construct-new-nuclear-power-reactors| accessdate= 2010-04-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100501141849/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-loan-guarantees-construct-new-nuclear-power-reactors| archivedate= 1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as of December 2013, Georgia Power had not availed itself of those guarantees. 
The expected building cost for the two reactors is $14 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2012-05-11/price-vogtle-expansion-could-increase-900-million |title=Price of Vogtle expansion could increase $900 million |author=Rob Pavey |newspaper=The Augusta Chronicle |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Georgia power's share is around $6.1 billion, while remaining ownership of the two reactors is split among [[Oglethorpe Power|Oglethorpe Power Corp.]], the [[Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia]] (MEAG Power), and Dalton Utilities.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Unveils Loan Guarantees for Nuclear Plant|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069301926799046|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=wsj|date=Feb 16, 2010|author=Henry J. Pulizzi|author2=Christine Buurma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the NRC approved the construction license of the two proposed AP1000 reactors at Vogtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NRC Approves Vogtle Reactor Construction|author=Abernethy, C.|url=http://nuclearstreet.com/nuclear_power_industry_news/b/nuclear_power_news/archive/2012/02/09/nrc-approves-vogtle-reactor-construction-_2d00_-first-new-nuclear-plant-approval-in-34-years-_2800_with-new-plant-photos_2900_-020902.aspx|newspaper=Nuclear Street|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRC Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build and operate the two new nuclear power reactors, citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying, "I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-nrc-idUSTRE8182J720120209  |title=U.S. approves first new nuclear plant in a generation  |author=Ayesha Rascoe | date=Feb 9, 2012  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after Southern Company received the license to begin construction, many environmental and [[anti-nuclear]] groups sued to stop the expansion project, claiming "public safety and environmental problems since Japan's [[Fukushima-Daiichi]] nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/groups-sue-to-stop-1351830.html |title=Groups sue to stop Vogtle expansion project |author=Kristi E.

In February 2013, the project's construction contractor, Shaw, was purchased by Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company (CB&amp;I). On March 12, 2013, construction on Unit&amp;nbsp;3 officially began with the pour of the [[Nuclear island basemat|basemat]] concrete for the nuclear island.&lt;ref name="constr_unit-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2013-03-13/concrete-poured-new-vogtle-reactor-foundation|title=Concrete poured for new Vogtle reactor foundation|author=The Augusta Chronicle|date=March 13, 2013|work=The Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation was completed on March 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southerncompany.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2790 |title=First nuclear concrete placed at Plant Vogtle expansion |author=Mark Williams |date=March 14, 2013 |work=Georgia Power |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://southerncompany.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2790 |archivedate=July 26, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weekend of June 1, 2013, assembly of the containment vessel began with the bottom head of the vessel being lifted into place on the nuclear island.&lt;ref name="constr_unit-3-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2013-06-03/vogtles-heaviest-component-date-moved-place|title=Vogtle's heaviest component to date moved into place|author=Pavey, R.|date=June 3, 2013|work=The Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2013, the construction schedule had been extended by at least 14 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/business/energy-environment/nuclear-powers-future-may-hinge-on-georgia-project.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Atomic Power’s Green Light or Red Flag|author=Matthew L. Wald|date=June 11, 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2013, the basemat pour for Unit 4 was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Construction-underway-of-second-Vogtle-AP1000-2211134.html |title= Construction underway of second Vogtle AP1000 |date= November 22, 2013 |work= World Nuclear News |publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] |accessdate= November 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Department of Energy approved a $6.5 billion loan guarantee for Southern Company subsidiary Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power Corp.  The Department of Energy initially demanded a credit subsidy fee, but the demand was ultimately dropped given the financial strength of Southern Co. and the Vogtle project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/southern-company-subsidiary-doe-finalize-vogtle-nuclear-project-loan-guarantees-2014-02-20|title=Southern Company subsidiary, DOE finalize Vogtle nuclear project loan guarantees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-eng.com/articles/2014/02/doe-finalizes-65bn-loan-guarantee-for-new-plant-vogtle-nuclear-reactors.html|title=DOE finalizes $6.5bn loan guarantee for new Plant Vogtle nuclear reactors|website=www.power-eng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/business/energy-environment/loan-program-for-reactors-is-fizzling.html|title=Loan Program for Reactors Is Fizzling|first=Matthew L.|last=Wald|date=18 February 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further delays and cost increases were incorporated in a revised schedule in early 2015. As a result of the increased delays and cost overruns, contractor CB&amp;I exited the project and Westinghouse took direct control of the project as contractor and hired construction firm [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]] to replace CB&amp;I/Shaw on-site managing the day-to-day work. Westinghouse purchased certain assets of the former Shaw Group from CB&amp;I to allow the project to go forward. In 2016, Southern Company and Westinghouse added construction firm [[Bechtel]] to the project to share construction management responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2015-08-28/plant-vogtle-track-after-schedule-revised|title=Plant Vogtle on track after schedule revised|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent construction milestones include setting the final of the "big six" structural modules for Unit&amp;nbsp;3 (CA-02 and CA-03, which form the walls of a storage tank that is part of the reactor's passive cooling system). The "big six" modules also include the previously installed CA-01, CA-04, and CA-05 in-containment structural modules, as well as the previously installed CA-20 structural module which forms part of the internal structure of the auxiliary building, containing many of the reactor's support systems. CA-02 and CA-03 were placed within the containment vessel in May 2016. The setting of these modules is a fairly significant milestone and allows other construction activities to commence. In June 2016, the final reactor coolant pump for Unit&amp;nbsp;3 was received on site. In November 2016, the reactor vessel for Unit&amp;nbsp;3 was set within the nuclear island. 2017 progress includes the installation of the reactor coolant loop piping and both steam generators at Unit&amp;nbsp;3. Progress has also been made in the turbine, auxiliary, and annex building. Unit&amp;nbsp;4 has also seen progress with the installation of the final two "big six" structural modules.  Construction of both cooling towers is complete, with each nearly {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall.

As of October 2017, recent progress includes completion of a critical 71 hour continuous concrete pour within the Unit&amp;nbsp;3 containment vessel, installation of the CA-33 floor module within Unit&amp;nbsp;3, placement of the Unit&amp;nbsp;4 deaerator within the turbine building, and the setting of the Unit&amp;nbsp;4 CA-03 module within the containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgiapower.com/about-energy/energy-sources/nuclear/overview.cshtml|title=Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 Project Overview {{!}} Energy Sources {{!}} Georgia Power|website=www.georgiapower.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 the [[Georgia Public Service Commission]] (GPSC) requested additional documentation following concerns that design blueprints had not been approved by appropriately licensed engineers, which has legal implications. On December 21, 2017, the PSC approved the continuation of construction on Units&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;4, with conditions that reduced the costs that can be recovered from ratepayers over the life of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://savannahnow.com/news/2017-12-21/plant-vogtle-growth-wins-approval-penalties-public-service-commission|title=Plant Vogtle growth wins approval, penalties from Public Service Commission|last=Corwin|first=Tom|date=December 21, 2017|work=Savannah Morning News|access-date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2018, the Unit&amp;nbsp;3 pressurizer was installed within the containment building.
On March 29, 2018, the Unit 4 reactor vessel was placed inside the Unit 4 containment building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/306-ton-unit-4-reactor-vessel-placed-at-vogtle-nuclear-expansion-300622029.html|title=306-ton Unit 4 Reactor Vessel placed at Vogtle nuclear expansion|last=Power|first=Georgia|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the February 2018 Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report (VCM), GPSC approved November 2021 and November 2022 as the target in-service dates for Units 3 &amp; 4 respectively. The report notes that the project is being completed on an accelerated schedule and is currently tracking ahead of the 2021 &amp; 2022 in-service target dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.georgiapower.com/content/assets/PDFS/VCM-18_Report_Final.pdf|title=Eighteenth Semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report|last=|first=|date=February 2018|website=www.georgiapower.com|access-date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 a $2.3 billion increase in costs was recognised.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180809&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Progress-at-Vogtle,-but-cost-forecast-rises |title=Progress at Vogtle, but cost forecast rises |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost, including financing costs, is estimated at about $25 billion.&lt;ref name=power-eng-20180809&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.power-eng.com/articles/2018/08/vogtle-cost-upgrade-causes-rethinking-of-nuclear-plant-s-future.html |title=Vogtle Cost Upgrade Causes Rethinking of $25B Nuclear Plant's Future |last=Walton |first=Rod |work=Power Engineering |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2018, in order to sustain the project, Georgia Power agreed to pay an additional proportion of the costs of the smaller project partners if the cost of completion went beyond $9.2 billion.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180927&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Vogtle-construction-to-continue |title=Vogtle owners vote to continue construction |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=27 September 2018 |accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5th, 2018 the first reactor coolant pump (RCP) was placed in the Unit 3 containment vessel. The RCPs are critical components of the power generation process in pressurized water reactors. The RCPs circulate the high pressure reactor coolant through the primary reactor loop through the reactor core where it absorbs heat from the nuclear fission and on to the steam generators where the steam is produced in the secondary non nuclear loop. A total of eight RCPs will be placed, four per unit.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-reactor-coolant-pump-placed-at-vogtle-nuclear-expansion-300725268.html |title=First reactor coolant pump placed at Vogtle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westinghouse bankruptcy===
In March 2017, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] due to $9 billion of losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=reuters+bankruptcy+vogtle+march&amp;oq=reuters+bankruptcy+vogtle+march&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1.27820.28868.0.29099.6.6.0.0.0.0.110.576.4j2.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.571.AhkPBhDjygE |title=Toshiba's Westinghouse brings in bankruptcy lawyers; disclosure deadlines loom |date=8 March 2017 |accessdate=7 September 2017  |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government has given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees to help finance construction of the Vogtle reactors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://energy.gov/lpo/portfolio/portfolio-projects |title=Loan Programs Project Under Construction: Vogtle |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a way forward to completing the plant has been agreed upon.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170330&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-board-idUSKBN17006K |title=Huge nuclear cost overruns push Toshiba's Westinghouse into bankruptcy |author=Tom Hals, Makiko Yamazaki, Tim Kelly |publisher=Reuters |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2017 Southern Company division, Southern Nuclear, officially took over construction from Westinghouse and opened a bid for a new construction management contract to manage the day-to-day work on the site. Southern received bids from both Fluor and Bechtel. On August 31, 2017, Southern announced its decision to move forward with Bechtel to be the day-to-day construction manager for the remainder of the project. Bechtel will replace Fluor, who will no longer be involved in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Bechtel-Selected-to-Complete-Construction-of-U-S-Nuclear-Plant-Expansion-1002299131|title=Bechtel Selected to Complete Construction of US Nuclear Plant Expansion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrounding population==
The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of {{convert|10|mi}}, concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about {{convert|50|mi}}, concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power.html|title=NRC: Backgrounder on Emergency Preparedness at Nuclear Power Plants|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 U.S. population within {{convert|10|mi}} of Vogtle was 5,845, a decrease of 16.3 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within {{convert|50|mi}} was 726,640, an increase of 8.8 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Augusta, GA (26 miles to city center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear neighbors: Population rises near US reactors|author=Dedman, B.|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42555888/ns/us_news-life/|newspaper=MSNBC|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to either reactor at Vogtle was 1 in 140,845, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What are the odds?
