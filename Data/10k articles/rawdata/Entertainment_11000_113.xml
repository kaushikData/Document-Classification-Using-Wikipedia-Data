The '''2-step''' also known as '''''Mini Swipe''''' or '''Baby Swipe''' is a footwork sequence in [[breakdance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bboy.org/forums/footwork/82641-2-step-baby-swipe-tutorial.html|title=2-step/baby swipe tutorial |work=bboy |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The 2-step is a fundamental [[dance]] move that is often one of the first [[footwork (dance)|footwork]] sequence learned by breakdancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bboy.org/forums/footwork/82641-2-step-baby-swipe-tutorial.html|title=2-step/baby swipe tutorial |work=bboy |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[breakdance]] moves can begin from the 2-step position. This move sets up the direction of movement and builds up momentum when dancing. This move allows the dancer to stay low and in contact with the ground, which places him in an optimal position for performing other [[dance]] moves. This move is launched from the third step of the basic [[6-step]] and involves the dancer hopping with a crouched leg over the other straightened leg while simultaneously rotating the dancer's body over the swinging leg in a twisting movement similar to a [[swipe (breakdance move)|swipe]]. The move leaves the dancer in a position similar to the fourth step of the [[6-step]], but facing 180 degrees in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.begbboybasics.tk/|title= 2 step |work= Beginner Bboy Basics |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dancing 2-step is often used as a move by itself or as a transition into other moves such as [[powermoves]], [[freezes]], [[toprock]] and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6Ne_-hZ9E|title=How to B-Boy: Footwork/baby swipes aka 2-step |work=Howcast |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Step-by-step==
::''This description is for clockwise rotation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://breakdance.wonderhowto.com/how-to/two-step-baby-swipe-bboy-breakdancing-162424/|title=How to Two Step &amp; Baby Swipe in BBoy breakdancing |work=WonderHowTo |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the name implies, there are a total of two steps in this dance move. A standard version begins in a [[push up]] position. 
# From the [[push up]] position, kick your right leg to the left side as if you were going to a [[3-step]] position.
# Pull your right leg back so that your legs make a v-shape. This should look like step 3 of a [[6-step]]. 
# From that position straighten your left leg and sweep it around your right, when it passes in front of your body shift your weight from your right hand to your left hand. 
# Without stopping after step 3 lower your right hand and use your right leg to force your body upwards into the air, while you are in the air shift your weight onto your right hand while twisting your torso. Extend your right leg forward and you should land at 180 degrees of your previous position.

Once you have these steps down you should combine steps two and three and do the moves simultaneously.

==Variants==
The 2-step is a move based on the [[6-step]].
The 2-step can be down on the knuckles of the hand as well as the palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bboy.org/forums/footwork/82641-2-step-baby-swipe-tutorial.html|title=2-step/baby swipe tutorial |work=bboy |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beauty and the Beast''': is an action-adventure video game developed and published by System 3 Iran in 1996 as a sequel to the 1987 game [[The Last Ninja]]. The development team choose the name [[System 3 (software company)|System 3]] enthusiastically trying to  produce games on the C64 and may have used the name in the hope that [[System 3 (software company)|System 3]] would be interested in publishing the game.

==Summary==
The game graphics was deeply inspired from ''[[Last Ninja 3]]'' as well as creating a lot more according to the plot and game maps. also the game has originally published on Commodore 64 tape. Additionally the disk version has become available a little bit after. The game music, although credited unofficially to Reyn Ouwehand but it actually consists of music from Tusker (Matt Gray), Shadow Of The Beast (Moppe) and various other tunes. This game consists of an introduction, a plot demo, three levels and a final demo.

This was really the first advanced game produced in Iran for commodore 64. The development of the game started from the early 1994 and finally the game was released in 1996 when the producers were all around 16.  This has happened in a country where there were no official references and development sources.  The game was produced for the love of the C64 and because the machine gave them a lot of joy.  The game was pieced together through various sources and learning assembly from a half translated book with many mistakes.

==Levels==
*'''The Village'''
*'''The Wood'''
*'''The Castle'''; with the story ending right after this level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2482">The '''Buchholz system''' (also spelled Buchholtz) is a ranking or scoring system in [[chess]] developed by Bruno Buchholz (died ca. 1958) in 1932, for [[Swiss system]] tournaments {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  It was originally developed as an auxiliary scoring method, but more recently it has been used as a tie-breaking system.  It was probably first used in the 1932 Bitterfeld tournament.  It was designed to replace the [[Neustadtl score]] {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

The method is to give each player a raw score of one point for each win and a half point for each [[draw (chess)|draw]]. When used as an alternate scoring system, each player's Buchholz score is calculated by adding the raw scores of each of the opponents he played and multiplying this total by the player's raw score {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  When used for tie-breaking among players with the same raw score, no multiplying is necessary and the sum of the raw scores of the opponents played is used to break ties {{harvcol|Golombek|1977}}.  When used as a tie-break system, it is equivalent to the [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments#Solkoff|Solkoff system]].

The major criticism of this system is that tie-break scores can be distorted by the set of opponents that each player plays (especially in early rounds). To avoid this problem a version of Buchholz, the '''Median-Buchholz System''' is sometimes used. In the Median-Buchholz System the best and worst scores of a player's opponents are discarded, and the remaining scores summed.

'''Dance hall''' in its general meaning is a [[hall]] for dancing. From the earliest years of the twentieth century until the early 1960s, the dance hall was the popular forerunner of the [[discothèque]] or [[nightclub]]. The majority of towns and cities in the [[Western World|West]] had at least one dance hall, and almost always featured live musicians playing a range of music from strict tempo [[ballroom dance]] music to [[big band]], [[swing (genre)|swing]] and [[jazz]]. One of the most famous dance hall musicians was [[Glenn Miller]].

Other structural forms of dance halls include the '''dance pavilion''' which has a roof but no walls, and the open-air '''platform''' which has no roof or walls. The open air nature of the dance pavilion was both a feature and a drawback. The [[taxi dance hall]] is a dance hall with a specific arrangement, wherein the patrons hire hall employees to dance with them.

Starting in the early 1930s, [[Savoy Ballroom|The Savoy]], a dance hall in [[Harlem]] (a [[African-American neighborhood|black neighborhood]] in New York City) was the first truly integrated building in the United States — for both the dancers and the musicians. "We didn't care about the color of your skin. All we wanted to know was: Can you dance?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Burns|Burns, Ken]]. ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' (2001), TV documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

The early days of [[rock n' roll]] were briefly played out in dance halls until they were superseded by nightclubs.

==Texas==
[[Texas]] has a high concentration of community dance halls, the largest number of them built by [[German people|German]] and [[Czechs|Czech]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Folkins, Gail.

==Sweden and Finland==
In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], open air dance pavilions have been used mostly in summer, but especially in Finland some have also been built to be used throughout the year. Especially formerly the dance pavilions were often built at sites with beautiful landscape, for example by the lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Hakulinen, Kerkko; Yli-Jokipii, Pentti.

This setting is typically used to play on [[stereotypes]] of the people present.  This may refer to their profession, religion or nationality, or the people involved may be famous figures.  The island setting highlights the absurdity of the stereotypical behaviour and prejudices of the protagonists, suggesting that they will find a way to express their own particular foibles even in a hostile setting. 

This setting is also popular in [[cartoons]].&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handy|first1=Bruce|title=A Guy, a Palm Tree, and a Desert Island: The Cartoon Genre That Just Won’t Die|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/history-of-the-desert-island-cartoon|accessdate=22 December 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' attributes the strips, which began appearing in the publication in the 1930s, to the popularity of [[Robinson Crusoe]].

A Scottish Presbyterian is rescued after many years on a desert island. As he stands on the deck of the rescuing vessel, the captain says to him, "I thought you were stranded alone. How come I can see three huts on the beach?"
:"Well," replies the castaway, "that one there is my house and that one there is where I go to church."
:"And the third one?" asks the skipper.
:"Oh, that's my old church."

'''Drama theory''' is one of the [[problem structuring methods]] in [[operations research]]. It is based on [[game theory]] and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played.

Drama theory was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 90s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's [[metagame analysis]] work developed at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book "Paradoxes of Rationality", published by [[MIT Press]]. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT).

== Basics of drama theory ==

A drama unfolds through ''episodes'' in which ''characters'' interact. The episode is a period of ''preplay communication'' between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of ''scene-setting'', ''build-up'', ''climax'' and ''decision''. This is followed by ''denouement'', which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of [[The Prisoner's Dilemma (play)|Prisoner's Dilemma]], a West End play by [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] about the problems of peace-keeping.
 
In the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred ''position'' – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a ''fallback'' or ''stated intention''. This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a ''threatened future'' if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an ''agreement''.

When it is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a ''moment of truth''. Here they usually face ''dilemmas'' arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the [[prisoner's dilemma]] game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the [[game of chicken]]; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character.

Drama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the ''climax'', where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the [http://www.dodccrp.org/events/8th_ICCRTS/pdf/134.pdf 8th International Command &amp; Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003]—from whose site it can be downloaded.

Six dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a ''resolution'' meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a 'game with a focal point' – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves.

== Dilemmas defined in drama theory ==

The dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows.

# A's cooperation dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement B's position.
# A's trust dilemma: A doesn't believe B would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement A's position.
# A's persuasion (also known as Deterrence) dilemma: B certainly prefers the threatened future to A's position.
# A's rejection (also known as Inducement) dilemma: A may prefer B's position to the threatened future.
# A's threat dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its threat not to implement B's position.
# A's positioning dilemma: A prefers B's position to its own, but rejects it (usually because A considers B's position to be unrealistic).

== Relationship to game theory ==

Drama-theorists build and analyze models (called ''card tables'' or ''options boards'') that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model-builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

The relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.

A '''''fabula crepidata''''' or '''''fabula cothurnata''''' is a Latin tragedy with Greek subjects. The genre probably originated in adaptations of [[Greek tragedy]] (hence the names, coming from ''crepida'' = ''sandal'' and ''[[Buskin|cothurnus]]'') beginning in  the early third century B.C. Only nine have survived intact, all by [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca]]. Of the plays written by [[Lucius Livius Andronicus]], [[Gnaeus Naevius]], [[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], [[Lucius Accius]], and others, only titles, small fragments, and occasionally brief summaries are left. [[Ovid]]'s ''Medea'' also did not survive.

'''''Filmspotting''''' is a weekly film [[podcast]] and [[radio programming|radio program]] from [[Chicago]] hosted by Adam Kempenaar and Josh Larsen. The show originally began as a progression from Kempenaar's film blog ''Cinemascoped''. He and his friend, Sam Van Hallgren (then Sam Hallgren), who had become a regular contributor to ''Cinemascoped'' began brainstorming when interest in the blog began to wane.&lt;ref name="Chicagoist"&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Scott |title=Adam Kempenaar and Sam Hallgren, Cinecasters |url=http://chicagoist.com/2005/06/07/interview_adam_kempenaar_and_sam_hallgren_cinecasters.php |publisher=''The Chicagoist'' |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102142802/http://chicagoist.com/2005/06/07/interview_adam_kempenaar_and_sam_hallgren_cinecasters.php |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What resulted was a film-talk podcast. While the whole concept of podcasting at the time was relatively new,   Kempenaar had gotten the idea from an article appearing in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', and he and Van Hallgren decided to give it a try.&lt;ref name="Prairie"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hannon |first=Lisa |title=Adam Kempenaar Interview |url=http://www.prairieden.com/interviews/2007_filmspotting.php |publisher=''Prairie Den'' |date=2007-07-09|accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fledgling show began production in 2005, initially under the title '''''Cinecast''''', but was changed to ''Filmspotting'' in 2006  due to a conflict over the name. Shortly after, the show was picked up by Chicago's [[NPR]] affiliate station, [[WBEZ]].&lt;ref name="Boxoffice"&gt;{{Citation |last=Tunnell |first=Benji |title=Podcasting Challenges Mainstream Media |url=http://boxoffice.com/distribution/2007/11/podcasting-challenges-mainstre.php |publisher=''BoxOffice.com'' |date= |accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former===
*'''Sam Van Hallgren''': Currently resides in [[Davidson, North Carolina]] and previously worked on the [[public radio]] show ''[[This American Life]]''. A graduate of [[Kenyon College]] (where he met Matty Robinson), Van Hallgren left the show as a host in September 2007 to focus on other pursuits and spend more time with his wife, leaving Matty "Ballgame" Robinson to co-host the show with Kempenaar. He has since returned to ''Filmspotting'' as one of the show's co-producers (the other being 'Golden' Joe DeCeault), and occasionally appears on the show as a guest host.
*'''Matty "Ballgame" Robinson''': Originally Van Hallgren's roommate,&lt;ref name="Joy"/&gt; Robinson was initially an occasional contributor, mainly appearing as a special guest or filling in when either Adam or Sam could not record. His first appearance was on episode #64 (Top 5 Villains). In September 2007 when Van Hallgren's departure was announced, the hosts revealed that Robinson would take over the co-hosting duties full-time. Robinson attended [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]] (where he met Sam Van Hallgren) and holds a B.A. in creative writing, as well as an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in acting. On September 24, 2011, during the airing of ''Filmspotting'' episode #365, it was revealed that Robinson would be leaving the show.

===Teaching at the University of Chicago===
In the spring of 2008, Kempenaar and Robinson were given teaching positions at the [[Graham School of General Studies]] (part of the [[University of Chicago]]) for a one-semester film course, focusing on the films of [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[Howard Hawks]].&lt;ref name="Reel"&gt;{{Citation |last=Horsburgh |first=Tim |title="Best and hippest voices" on movie podcast hooks worldwide listeners and gains mainstream acclaim |url=http://www.reelchicago.com/story.cfm?storyID=1952 |publisher=''Reel Chicago'' |date= |accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course, proving a success, was cause for the pair to be subsequently invited back by the university to teach further courses in each of the following three school years. The below table offers a brief summary of these classes:

==Show format==
The show starts with a review of a recently released film, followed by listener feedback. After the feedback segment is "Massacre Theater", a weekly contest that has the hosts performing short scenes of dialogue from various films, with a prize going to one listener who correctly guessed which film it was from. On rare occasions, the hosts will perform the scene with guests, with one notable episode including Kempenaar performing a scene from [[Léon (film)|The Professional]] with [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Simon Pegg]], who were being interviewed to promote their film [[Hot Fuzz]].&lt;ref&gt;Filmspotting #158&lt;/ref&gt;

Each episode ends with the "Top Five" segment, which sees each host picking their top five movies that pertain to a certain topic for the week. The segment was initially inspired by similar scenes in ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'' and the [[Nick Hornby]] novel it was [[High Fidelity (novel)|based on]]. These picks exclude certain "pantheon" choices, which are films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'' or ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' that have been forever excluded from future lists for being too "obvious". They also have their own personal "penalty box" films, which temporarily excludes films that one host has picked too often.

Older episodes included a segment where the hosts each highlighted an overlooked film on DVD to recommend to the listener. However, that segment was later removed from the main show and placed in their short-lived [[video podcast]], ''Cinecast A/V''. The segment was then moved to their weekly e-mail newsletter "The Dope Sheet" before that was also discontinued.

On occasion, particularly when Adam and/or Josh are away from the ''Filmspotting'' studio, or when there is a special edition of the show, guest hosts are sometimes featured. Included among them are Chicago Tribune film critic, [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]], Matt Singer of [[IndieWire]] and Alison Wilmore (formerly of the [[Independent Film Channel]]) -- the latter two hosting a spinoff podcast called ''Filmspotting: Streaming Video Unit (SVU)''

==Marathons==
For the "Movie Marathons", the hosts review six to eight movies from a particular genre or director that they haven't already seen. At the end of their six- to eight-week marathon, they present awards for best film, best director, best actor, etc., for that marathon, naming the award after something related to the genre or director they've just covered.

These marathons, and their associated awards, have been, in order:&lt;ref name=marathons&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.filmspotting.net/marathons/ | title=Filmspotting Marathons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palme d'Or marathon culminated in a screening of [[Afterschool]] at the [[Gene Siskel Film Center]] in Chicago on December 12, 2009 followed by a Q&amp;A with writer/director [[Antonio Campos (director)|Antonio Campos]] and featured actor [[Michael Stuhlbarg]]. "Afterschool" was an [[Un Certain Regard]] selection at the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/Event_Detail.aspx?eventID=1524 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126040545/http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/Event_Detail.aspx?eventID=1524 |archivedate=2009-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
During breaks in the show, "Filmspotting" primarily features music from artists on the Chicago label [[Bloodshot Records]], in addition to artists from [[Messenger Records]], and, even more rarely, [[Merge Records]]. The guitar-driven theme song is "This Machine" by now-defunct Chicago band Age of the Rifle.

==Name change==
The last ''Cinecast'' show was the two-part 100th podcast on May 12–13, 2006, after which the name changed to ''Filmspotting''. The specific reason for the change was not discussed, but there is a company called [[CineCast]] that produces pre-show advertisements in theatres. Adam and Sam originally said the show would be renamed ''The Cinema Show,'' but then solicited suggestions from listeners. Contenders included ''Cinecrack'', ''Cinediction'' and ''Burn, Hollywood, Burn,'' but the hosts announced their final selection on the 8 May 2006 show (Cinecast #98): ''Filmspotting.'' Listener Nicholas Correnti from Florida State University Film School suggested the name Filmspotting and won $50 worth of DVDs for his part in renaming Cinecast.

'''Frank Fenter''' (February 25, 1936 - July 21, 1983) was a music industry executive.

Fenter was the first [[Managing Director]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for Europe, where he helped discover and get signed to Atlantic late-1960s [[British Invasion]] groups, including [[Led Zeppelin]] and the [[progressive rock]] bands [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[King Crimson]].  Frank Fenter was also instrumental in introducing and breaking [[Rhythm and Blues]] music across Europe, with such artists as [[Otis Redding]] and [[Sam and Dave]]. He went on in the 1970s to be a co-founder, co-owner, partner and Executive Vice President of [[Capricorn Records]], the label identified with [[Southern Rock]], led by [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Wet Willie]] and [[Elvin Bishop]]. In 2014, Frank Fenter was posthumously Inducted into The Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

==Early career in London, England. 1958 to 1966==
Frank Fenter was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and moved to London, England, in 1958, at the age of 22, initially determined to become an actor.  Fenter's acting career included a feature role in the BBC's 1963 [[The Big Pull]]; in 1964, he produced, co-wrote and acted in [[Africa Shakes]], the first [[South African]] rock movie, which featured Fenter's music act [[Bill Kimber and the Couriers]]. The movie was the first to have an [[Racial integration|interracial]] cast in [[Apartheid South Africa]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

While doing part-time acting,  Fenter began to book bands around [[London]] in the early 1960s, including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Animals]] and [[Manfred Mann]], long before they had recording contracts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Fenter got his first big break in the music industry in 1964, when he joined [[Chapell Music Publishing]] Co.; he went on to head [[Liberty-Imperial Record Publishing]] and later [[ARC/Chess Music]].

==Atlantic Records. London, England. 1966 to 1969==
In 1966, Frank Fenter was chosen by [[Atlantic Records]] partner [[Nesuhi Ertegun]] to head the label in the United Kingdom. Within six months, Frank Fenter was the [[Managing Director]] in charge of Atlantic Records' operations in all of Europe. Fenter was responsible for making Atlantic Records "the most important American label in promoting British music", according to the late [[Ahmet Ertegun]], co-founder and Chairman of Atlantic Records and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who went on to say, "We wound up with quite a lot of British bands, due in large part to the fact that we had put Frank Fenter in charge of all Atlantic Records activity in Europe" {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In Frank Fenter's capacity and role as Managing Director of Atlantic Records European Operations, he played a vital role in having brought [[Led Zeppelin]] to Atlantic Records and helped discover and sign such British [[progressive-rock]] groups as [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[King Crimson]].

According to Ahmet Ertegun,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Frank Fenter was also "instrumental in breaking [[Rhythm and Blues]] music throughout Europe", having brought the legendary "[[Hit the Road Stax]]" tour abroad in the spring of 1967; the tour included the acts [[Otis Redding]], [[Sam and Dave]] and [[Booker T and the MGs]].  At the start of the European tour, according to renowned producer, [[Tom Dowd]], Fenter suggested he record the live concerts and, with Frank Fenter's direction, [[Stax Records]], a label affiliated with Atlantic Records, experienced a sales jump, with seven of the eleven albums recorded live on the European tour received [[gold certification]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Capricorn Records. Macon, Georgia. 1969 to 1983==
In 1969, Frank Fenter and brothers [[Phil Walden]] and [[Alan Walden]], former co-managers of [[Otis Redding]], [[Sam and Dave]], and other Stax artists, formed [[Capricorn Records]] with a distribution deal from [[Atlantic Records]]. Working with Phil Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]], Frank Fenter negotiated the Capricorn deal with his mentor, [[Ahmet Ertegun]]&lt;ref&gt;Rolling Stone magazine, The Obituary of Phil Walden, co-founder of Capricorn Records. April 24, 2006. https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10107379/southern_rock_pioneer_walden_dies&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Fenter and Phil Walden envisioned a new kind of record company structure that would be [[vertically integrated]]. [[Capricorn Records]] would have loosely held subsidiary companies that encompassed all facets of the music business, including [[artist management]], with Phil Walden and Associates; a [[booking agency]],  the Paragon Agency; a [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] house, No Exit Music; and artist merchandising, with the Great Southern Company.

Frank Fenter took the helm of [[Capricorn Records]] while Phil Walden focused on artist management where they together pioneered and popularized the music genre known as [[Southern Rock]]. At the height of Capricorn Record's success, [[Fortune magazine]], the business periodical, went on to recognize Fenter as a "Promotional Genius".&lt;ref&gt;Fortune, Profile on The rise of Capricorn Records. September, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Singly or together, the two partners discovered and signed such recording artists as [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Elvin Bishop]], [[Wet Willie]], [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]], [[The Dixie Dregs]], [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Billy Thorpe]], [[Stillwater (band)|Stillwater]] and [[Alex Taylor (musician)|Alex Taylor]] and eventually made Capricorn Records one of the most successful independent recording companies in America.

[[Capricorn Records]] declared [[bankruptcy]] in late 1979, but, in 1983, [[Capricorn Records]] was restructured and ready to forge a comeback, however, in the middle of negotiating a distribution deal with [[Mo Ostin]], the [[Chairman]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]], Fenter died of a [[heart attack]] in the Capricorn office; and with his death, the deal with [[Warner Bros.]] fell apart.

Frank Fenter died in [[Macon, Georgia]], at the age of 47.

[[Gambling]], other than betting on [[Horse racing in Thailand|horse races]] or the government-sponsored [[Thai lottery]], is prohibited in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Angus|last2=Christensen|first2=Matthew|last3=Krataykhwan|first3=Ponpun|title=GAMBLING IN THE KINGDOM, Part two|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/376599/|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition dates back to the Gambling Act 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gambling Act B.E.2478 (1935)|url=http://www.krisdika.go.th/wps/wcm/connect/20f4f0804e2b8820999ffb798fdc4669/Gambling+Act,+B.E.2478+(1935).pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=20f4f0804e2b8820999ffb798fdc4669|website=Office of the Council of State|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Playing Cards Act prohibits private ownership of more than 120 playing cards without approval of the government. Nevertheless, illegal gambling in casinos (Thai: บ่อนการพนัน) and other forms of gambling still exist in [[Bangkok]] and some provincial towns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Phongpaichit, P., Piriyarangsan, S. Treerat, N. (1998). ''Guns, girls, gambling, ganja: Thailand's Illegal Economy''. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Gambling has long been a feature of Thai society. Local [[Thai people|Siamese]] partook in more than 100 well known gambling games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Warren, J.A. (2013) ''Gambling: The State and Society in Thailand, c.1800-1945''. Oxford: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Some gambling forms such as betting on [[cockfights]], [[bullfights]] and boat races are native to Siamese culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The late-19th century marked a significant increase in the level of gambling in Siam. People started to gamble more frequently and a variety of games were introduced from foreign traders and [[immigrants]], and gambling started to hit the mainstream. It was during that period that the Huay lottery was introduced from [[China]] and became popular in Siam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Over the course of decades the Government of Thailand allowed legal gambling dens. During the reign of [[King Rama III]], the [[Government of Thailand]] promoted legal gambling dens as a source of revenue. These legal dens were then closed down to dampen criminal activity and bankruptcy related to gambling. During the reign of [[King Rama V]] gambling was forbidden in the south and all the remaining gambling venues were closed on 1 April 1917.

A gambling act was first passed in 1930 and revised in 1935. During the premiership of Khuang Aphaiwong, the ministry of finance was assigned by the government to legalize gambling in [[Pran Buri District]], [[Prachuap Khiri Khan Province]] and became an official promoter of gambling. However, this period of legalization of casinos did not last long. Under attack from the media and public, the government abandoned the attempt to earn additional revenue from casinos and prohibited gambling once again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Forms of gambling==
===Casinos===
Despite laws against gambling, illegal casinos are widespread in Thailand. The first large-scale gambling houses were established in [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] by the government in the late-17th century or early-18th century as a result of the steady growth of Chinese population. During the 19th century the number of gambling houses grew in tandem with the population of Chinese immigrants. To promote the settlement and taxation of the Chinese population in Thailand, the Thai government turned a blind eye to gambling among Chinese immigrants. As a result of this inadvertent endorsement, local Siamese were encouraged to gamble as well. After the gambling act was first passed in 1930 casinos were banned completely and gambling was prohibited in Thai society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Lottery ===
The lottery was introduced to Thailand by Chinese immigrants in 1820. Commonly known to the local as "huay", the term is a direct translation of Chinese word ''huā'' (Chinese:花) :[[flower]]. In the beginning ''huay'' was mainly played among the community of Chinese immigrants in Thailand. It was then officially established during the reign of King Rama III to stimulate the circulation of currency as well as to generate national revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Government lottery===
In the reign of [[King Rama VI]], the government introduced lottery draws as a device for tax collection. In 1939 the government of Luang [[Phibun Songkram]] set up the Lottery Bureau to organize a regular monthly draw in Thailand. It was then extended to twice a month in 1989. Draws normally happen twice a month on the 1st and 16th. There are a total of thirty-eight million tickets per round. 28 percent of the sales value of the lottery ticket is retained as government revenue, 12 percent in administration and management and 60 percent is returned to players as prizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Gambling on sport ===
[[Football]] is the most recent form of illegal gambling in Thailand. As a result of [[technology]] such as online transactions, [[satellite TV]], [[Internet]], and [[mobile phone]] betting systems, football gambling has become widely spread among the population of Thailand. During the 2010 [[2010 FIFA World Cup|South Africa World cup]], over 1,700 people were arrested for gambling offences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Social issues==
There has long been proscription against gambling within Thai society. In [[Buddhism]], gambling is one of four vices which lead to ruin. In Thai this concept is known as ''abaiyamuk'' (อบายมุข), the "portals of hell". For the layperson, gambling is something to be avoided if one wishes to be free from suffering. Thai people often cite an old proverb "Ten lost to fire is not equivalent to one lost in gambling" which reflects the variety of social problems associated with gambling in Thai culture. This may include violent crime, financial problems, and gambling addiction. Despite the prohibition, gambling still remains a major part of Thai life. Thais often gamble in various ceremonies and festivals. According to Alan Klima's study of funeral casinos in present-day Thailand, gambling is used as an attraction for people to keep the deceased spirit company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are only a few psychological services available to those addicted, the such as Ministry of Public Health's Center of Gambling Studies. For Thais, gambling—lotteries, casinos, football betting and other variants—are viewed as entertainment. Very few seek treatment from medical professionals as Thais often view gambling as a social problem rather than a medical issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-8065-2091-4|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comedy about the [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] experience at [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like [[Kent State shootings]], [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam war]], and the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name= "Peterson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Molly | title = ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' | work = [[National Public Radio]] | date = July 29, 2002 | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/animalhouse/ | accessdate = 2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a great [[box office]] success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend.&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

== Gameplay ==
Imperial Hero is a cross-platform game, based on the fictional Ayarr Empire. Players have to register at a website in order to join the game. 

Players choose between three types of "hero" - ranger, warrior and mystic - with respective strengths and weaknesses. The heroes in the game win experience points by defeating foes – humanoids or monsters. The hero has a personal profile and can acquire titles on a weekly basis, which may offer bonuses. Players are encouraged to team up in a "Guild" and help each other in order to survive and prosper in the Ayarr Empire environment. 

Heroes can acquire "sets" of equipment, either crafted or found as loot after battles.

== Buildings ==

'''Tavern'''- Tavern is the place, where all Missions can be found. The Heroes can work there also for gold. The amount of gold they receive depends on the amount of working hours and increases as they raise their levels.

'''Weapon shop'''- In this Shop players can buy and sell different weapons. New items for sell appear every 15 minutes. Players can load instantly new weapons in exchange for diamonds. With every reset they have a chance to buy different and more powerful items. The hero’s equipment also can be repaired in the shop. Equipment durability lowers when used in battle and even greatly when the hero dies in a battle.

'''Armor shop-''' In this Shop players can buy and sell different armor. New items for sell appear every 15 minutes. Players can load instantly new armor in exchange for diamonds. With every reset they have a chance to buy different and more powerful items. The hero’s equipment also can be repaired in the shop. Equipment durability lowers when used in battle and even greatly when the hero dies in a battle.

'''Jewelry shop'''- In this Shop players can buy and sell different jewelries. New items for sell appear every 15 minutes. Players can load instantly new jewelries in exchange for diamonds. With every reset they have a chance to buy different and more powerful items. The hero’s equipment also can be repaired in the shop. Equipment durability lowers when used in battle and even greatly when the hero dies in a battle.

'''Healer'''- The character’s health and spirit can be healed for a fee. There the buyers can buy and sell different healing potions. New items for sell appear every 15 minutes. Players can load instantly new potions in exchange for diamonds. With every reset they have a chance to buy different and more powerful items. The hero’s equipment also can be repaired in the Healer.

'''KVN-49''' ({{lang-ru|КВН-49}}) or '''Kenigson, Warsawskiy, Nikolayevskiy Mk. 1949''' was a [[black-and-white]] [[TV set]] released in 1949 and on the market in the [[USSR]] until 1960, with some minor modifications. It was the first TV set ever [[mass production|mass-produced]] in the USSR.

The '''Kabul Golf Club''' is a nine-hole [[golf course]] located near [[Qargha Reservoir|Qargha]], around 7 miles from the center of [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].

== Overview ==
Different from other golf courses in the Middle East where [[desert]] [[golf]] is a new trend, the greens at the Kabul Golf Club are actually brown to black due to their composition of a mixture of sand and [[oil]] (which keeps the sand from blowing).&lt;ref name="Baldauf"&gt;{{cite news

Mainly affluent Afghans and foreigners frequent the course. The 2005 entrance fee for The Kabul Golf Club (http://www.kabulgolfclub.org) is 750 Afghani ($15 US Dollars) and a year membership is $300 (15,000 Afghani). The club is run by Mohammad Afzal Abdul (also called Mohammed Bashir&lt;ref name="Baldauf"/&gt;), its director and [[golf pro]], who worked as a caddy at the course as a young man before fleeing into exile in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Semple"/&gt; Business has dropped off since opening as international agency staffing has declined.&lt;ref name="Semple"/&gt;

== History ==
Originally six holes,&lt;ref name="Semple"/&gt; the course opened in 1967 &lt;I played there 1958 - 1962 (wife of husband who worked for ICA later named AID)&gt; during the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], was closed in 1978, and reopened in 2004. During these three decades it has undergone several changes. It was relocated to its present site in 1973 after the king was overthrown in a [[coup d'état]] and completely closed following a [[Great Saur Revolution|1978 communist coup]]. It was reopened in 1993 but closed again in 1996 when the [[Taliban]] regime banned sports. After the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the course was used as an area for military training in the removal of [[land mines]]. In the process of restoration to its present state, three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[tank]]s and a [[multiple rocket launcher]] were removed by a nonprofit agency.

In 2004 the Kabul Golf Club was reopened again. During the intervening seven years little has changed.  Play on the golf course has been sporadic, and at the mercy of the local security situation.  Beginning in 2011, a fund-raising effort has been underway with the goal of restoring the golf course and related facilities.  Funds are also being sought to subsidize operations until the war is over, assuming the organization will eventually become a viable business.

A large range of challenges were used throughout the history of the Japanese game show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'', some occurring only once or twice, or others in virtually every show, depending upon their popularity and ease of preparation. Many challenges involve falling into [[water]] or mud on failure.

The below list contains the names of Games in the UK version of the show, and are followed up by their ''[[MXC]]'' names.

==A==
*'''Animuddle''':  Mixed up on the ground are lots of pieces from giant jigsaw puzzles of animals. On the whistle, the contestants all have to run over and grab a piece for themselves. As soon as they have a bit, they must find the other contestants who have a piece that slots correctly into theirs. Each puzzle is made up of four pieces of jigsaw. If the contestants manage to find the three other people who will put together their picture, they have to complete their jigsaw. If they're right, the group sit down with their pieces strapped to their heads, so from above you can see the completed picture of their animal. Whoever is in a group with a completed puzzle when the final whistle blows wins, and goes through to the next game. Any contestants who haven't completed their puzzle are out. There are some jigsaw pieces that won't fit with any others, so whoever picks these are guaranteed to lose. 
*'''Avalanche''': The contestant has to get to the top of a steep uphill channel while avoiding giant boulders being rolled down towards them. In the walls at the side are several gaps. To avoid a boulder, the contestant can try to hide in these gaps until it has passed. This isn't easy though, as there are Guards waiting in the gaps to try and push the contestant back out. Once a contestant has left a gap it closes up, so they can't get back in again. If a contestant manages to get all the way to the fortress at the top of the hill they win, and are through to the next game. However, if they get hit by a boulder, even if it doesn't send them rolling down the hill, they lose. Along with the boulders, the Guards also throw down smaller rocks to make climbing the hill even harder.

==B==
*'''Ball Cupping''': To start the game, the contestant has to hit a ball into the top of a giant pachinko machine. As soon as they've hit the ball they must pick up a bowl and run down the flight of stairs to the side of the machine.  Now the contestant has to wait on a narrow pathway at the bottom, between the machine and a mud pit, for the ball to fall out. The aim is to catch it the ball in their bowl. As they can't see where the ball is getting knocked around too, the General shouts out directions ("left" or "right") to help guide the contestant.  The ball will drop out over the mud pit. The contestant must dive for it, and catch the ball safely in their bowl to win the game. If the ball ends up in the mud, they lose. In the family special version of the game the children hit the ball into the machine and stay up the top to shout directions, while the parents run down the stairs to try and catch the ball. 
*'''Big Bird''': Dressed as a bird, the contestant is pulled along a wire in the air towards a platform opposite to the one they start on. Halfway through their journey is a big rabbit. They have to try and pick up this rabbit with their feet, and hold onto it until they reach a nest just in front of the finish platform. If the contestant manages to drop the rabbit into the nest they win the game. If they miss the rabbit, drop it, or miss the nest, they lose and get a face full of steam. To make things even harder, Popcorn fire balls from the cannon to try and knock the rabbit out of the contestant's feet. Originally no balls were shot at the contestants but the nest they had to drop the rabbit in was smaller. 
*'''Bite The Bun''': Lots of buns, and other bread-based food, are hanging in plastic bags from ropes in the air. The contestants have to pull one off for themselves by only using their mouths. To stop the contestants from using their hands they have a rubber ring around their bodies, keeping their arms pinned to their sides. Later the ring was swapped for a sack that was tied over the contestants to keep their arms inside. The bags are all hanging at different heights, making some of them hard to reach. To get the high up buns contestants have to climb up onto the backs of others. Whoever doesn't have a bun when the time is up loses, and is out of the game. 
*'''Blueberry Hill''' (Regular version): Contestants have to make their way up a ramp, but are only allowed to move when the guard at the top (usually Yousichi/'Dennis') isn't looking. This is made hard by the giant Daruma costumes they are wearing. When the guard is facing the other way he chants "Daruma-san ga koronda" (meaning "The Daruma fell down"). This lets the contestants know how much time they have to move and when they should stop. As soon as the guard finishes the chant he turns around. Anyone he catches moving will be pushed down the hill and are out of the game. Any contestants that manage to get all the way to the goal at the top of the hill, without being spotted moving, wins. Once the game was played downhill, so there was the risk of toppling forwards as you came down to the goal. In the couples' version of the game the pairs are attached to each other by a rope tied around their ankles. This means that both contestants in the pair must make it up the hill without being seen moving; and also means that if one of them falls they'll take the other tumbling down with them. 
*'''Blueberry Hill''' (Parents-Kids version): This game is only played in family specials. Five parents at a time, dressed as giant Darumas, each stand on a remote controlled platform and are driven by their children. The kids have to steer their parents around a track to the finish line. The track has lots of corners to make it more difficult to manoeuvre the platforms around it. There's also a steam spray that goes off when someone is near it, in an attempt try and make the parents lose balance. As the parents are dressed as Darumas, it's hard for them to balance on the moving platforms. If at anytime they fall off they are helped back up onto the platform (the child can't move it while their parent isn't on top), restarting where they fell. The game is played as a race, with fastest contestants to get across the finish line winning the game. 
*'''Boulder Dash''' (V1): 'Boulder Dash' was the first part of 'Uphill Garden' from the first episode of Takeshi's Castle. The contestant has to get straight across a hill to the other side to be able to continue on with the game. If they slip down to the bottom of the hill they lose and are out. To make things difficult, the hill is really muddy so it's very hard to keep your footing and not slide down. The Guards also add a further obstacle by throwing rocks and logs down the hill to try and knock the contestants off their feet. 
*'''Boulder Dash''' (V2): This game is a lot like 'Avalanche'. Three contestants at a time have to try and get to the top of a ramp without getting knocked down by giant boulders being rolled towards them. The ramp is a lot wider than the path in 'Avalanche', so the contestants can dodge the boulders if they're quick enough. Whoever manages to get to the top of the hill wins. 
*'''Brat Sack''': 'Brat Sack' is a family special game. All the children are tied up inside bags with only their arms sticking out. When the game begins, the parents have to find their own kid; but they aren't able to see into the bags. Once they think they've found their own child, the parents must take the bags across the finish line. Only when they're across the line can they open the bag and let, hopefully, their own child out! 
*'''Bridge Ball''': The contestant has to cross a thin wobbly bridge to the other side. While they're on the bridge, Guards will fire balls at them, from a cannon, to try and knock them off. Originally there were two cannons used to shoot at the contestants. In a variation of the game several rocks are attached to the bridge to make crossing even harder. This means that the contestant can't just run straight across - they have to stop and climb around the rocks. Later the rocks were removed and now Guards only fire balls from one cannon. However, now the contestant has to carry their own golden ball. At the beginning of the bridge the contestant has to catch a golden ball, which is shot to them by the General. While crossing the bridge the contestant must hold onto the ball at all times; as if it drops, and they lose it, they can't continue. If the contestant does drop the ball they have to make it all the way back to the General so he can fire them another one. Anyone who makes it across the bridge, with the golden ball in hand, wins. 
*'''Bridge The Gap''': There are two planks, both rotating anti-clockwise in the air. The aim is to walk across both of these to reach the finish platform, without falling off. The contestant has to step onto the first plank and quickly walk across it to the other end. There they must wait for it to move under a row of hanging mats. If they don't make it to the end of the plank quick enough then these mats will knock them off. As soon as it has passed under the mats, the contestant has to run back to the opposite end of the plank again. Here they must wait for the second plank to reach them and quickly, but carefully, step onto it. As the planks are moving past each other in different directions, it's hard to keep your balance as you cross from one to another. Once onto the second plank they must walk to the other end, wait for it to go under another row of hanging mats, go back to the opposite end again and, when it reaches the finish platform, jump off to win the game. The first version is played over foam mats covered in powder, while the second version is played over water. 
*'''Buggy Me''': Six players at a time have to race against each other through an obstacle course. When the starting pistol is fired, the contestants first dash to a mini hurdle and crawl under it. After that, they have to stay low and make their way under a net. Now they must get up and run to a tub of white powder, which they have to stick their heads in to pick up a sponge with their mouth. Once they have a sponge they can grab one of the envelopes that are hanging in the air, and open it. Inside is a number from one to six. This tells the contestant which of six rickshaws they have to pull along to the finish line. There are passengers waiting in the rickshaws. If the contestants are lucky the passenger may only be a cuddly toy; but if they're unlucky they'll pick one with Animal, Kibaji or Strong sitting inside - making it a lot harder to pull along. The first two contestants across the finish line win.

==C==
*'''Catch It (V1)''': A group of contestants are all dressed in giant foam baseball outfits, waiting to catch a baseball. A Guard, usually one half of Popcorn, hits a baseball high into the air over the 'pitch'. Once the ball has been hit, the contestants have to run over to where they think it will land and try and be the one to catch it. They all have a baseball glove to help. The contestant that catches the ball wins. Several balls are hit up for the same group of contestants, so they have more than one chance to win. In special versions of the game the contestants all have nets on long poles. A bigger ball is shot into the air, from a cannon, and they have to try and catch the ball in their net to win. 
*'''Catch It (V2)''': The contestant starts behind a set of saloon doors, at the end of a giant pit of mud. A football is then fired into the air, over the mud, from a cannon. As soon as the ball is shot, the contestant has to run out into the mud pit and try to catch it. The wet mud makes moving quickly very difficult. If the contestant catches the ball they win the game; but if they miss it, or it bounces out of their hands, they lose. Snow Ball: In special episodes the game was occasionally played in snow. Dry Ball: In the Monster special episode the game was played on big mats on dry ground, as the costumes made moving quickly hard enough anyway. 
*'''Cheeze-Berry Hill''': This game is exactly the same as 'Blueberry Hill', except the contestants are dressed as giant potatoes. Contestants have to make their way up a ramp, but are only allowed to move when Yousichi at the top isn't looking. When Yousichi is facing the other way he chants "Jagaimo-san ga koronda" (meaning "The potato fell down"). This lets the contestants know how much time they have to move and when they should stop. As soon as Yousichi finishes the chant he turns around. Anyone he catches moving will be pushed down the hill and are out of the game. The first five contestants that manage to get to the top of the hill, without being spotted moving, win. 
*'''Corn Cob Trip''': 'Corn Cob Trip' is much the same as 'Mushroom Trip', except the contestants have to hold onto a giant corncob. The contestants start on top of a platform, at the edge of a pool of water, where they have to grab onto a giant corncob. When they're holding on, the corncob starts to fly across the water - constantly spinning around as it goes. At the opposite end of the pool is a small platform floating on the water. Once they reach this platform the contestants have to let go and land on it. If they manage to land on the mat, and stay on it, they win the game. There is a small hole in the side of the cob to help the contestants hold on with one of their hands. The female contestants also have a rope to help them grip.

==D==
*'''Deep Float''': From their starting point on the beach, the contestants must run into the water and swim out to a small platform floating in the sea. Once they reach the raft they must climb on and stay on. Whoever is on the platform when the final whistle blows wins, goes through to the next game. Waiting on the raft are two Guards who will try to stop the contestants climbing aboard. There's also a giant statue on top taking up a lot of room. The contestants can throw off whatever they need to make more space for themselves - including the guards! 
*'''Die or Pie''': To begin, the contestant has to roll a giant die. The number they roll tells them which hole in a giant cake they must get into. Hole one is the closest to the 'Pie-Chucker' while hole six is the furthest away. Once in a hole the contestant has to lower the lid so that only their head is sticking out. Now the 'Pie-Chucker' throws a custard pie at them. If they get hit, and covered in cream, they're out. But if the pie misses them, they win! 
*'''Dino Ride''': The contestant has to ride the 'Gettasaurus', a dinosaur version of a Bucking Bronco, as a pink bat moves across the room along a wire in the air. They have to shoot this bat with a water pistol while riding the dinosaur. The bat only flies straight across the room and then back again once. If contestant manages to wet the bat enough it'll drop to the floor and they've won the game. However, if they miss, and don't wet it enough, it'll fly back into the hole it came from and the contestant will lose. They'll also lose if they fall off the dinosaur at anytime during the game. As a punishment for losing, the contestants may get sprayed with steam by Rock-kun. 
*'''Dominoes''': The contestant has to run across the top of a row of 16 giant dominoes to reach the finish platform. They need good balance, but also speed, as the dominoes are very easily toppled. Once one falls it will knock all the rest down too. If a contestant manages to make it across all 16 dominoes they win the game. If they fall off, they lose. In the family version the parents and kids are connected together by a rope. The parent has to run across the top of the 16 dominoes as usual, but now the kid also has to run across 16 smaller dominoes alongside them. As they're tied together, the pair have to both keep good balance and timing to make it across. 
*'''The Dragon Lake''': There are several different versions of 'Dragon Lake'. In any version, the aim is to use a rope to swing from one platform to another. If the contestant manages to land on the second platform they win the game. If they miss, or fall off the rope, they lose. Version one was played in the first episode. The contestant has to swing from one platform to another straight in front of them, over a container of shredded paper. On the other side of the landing platform was a slope. If the contestant slides down here, without landing on the flat part of the platform first, they lose. The game then moved to a wet, muddy pit. The landing platform this time is a small 'tree trunk'. If the contestant manages to land on this trunk they win, then cross a bridge to the next game. The third version actually includes a Dragon and a Lake! The contestant starts off on the Dragon platform and has to swing and land on a small round platform in the middle of a lake. After this the game changed slightly. In 'New Dragon Lake', instead of swinging to a platform straight ahead, the contestant has to swing in a semi-circle to reach the small landing platform to the right of where they start. They get a run-up before swinging off to give them more chance to swing far enough around. A special giant version was played in the sea. Starting from very high up, the contestant has to use a rope to swing over to a small floating platform and drop down onto it. If they manage to hold on they win the game. 
*'''Drop In The Ocean''': 'Drop in the Ocean' is the first half of the starting game for the final episode, which starts on the beach. A helicopter flies over and drops hundreds of coloured balls into the sea. There are eight colours: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, white and black. The colours are later used in the second half of the game, 'Sandscript', but don't matter in this part. The contestants each have to grab a ball for themselves to be able to continue. Anyone who doesn't manage to get a ball before time is up is out of the game.

==E==
*'''End Bell''': The contestant starts on a raft at the top of a slope, which is then pushed down and into the water below. When they've hit the water, the contestant has to keep their balance on top as it glides over the lake towards a slippery slope. At the top of this slope is a belfry. Once at the slope, the contestant has to run up it to try and get into the belfry. If they can manage this they ring the bell inside to signify that they've won the game. But if the contestant falls into the water at any time they lose.
*'''Extinction''': The Guards dress in animals costumes that have big hinged heads. On each contestants' turn, one of these animals wanders across a shooting range. The contestant, who is a few meters away, has to use the General's cannon to fire balls at them - trying to knock off the animal's head. There are a few rocks and trees for the Guards to hide behind, but they usually spend most of their time taunting the contestants. If a contestant manages to shoot off the animal's head they win the game. But if the animal gets to safety on the other side of the shooting range, with its head still in place, the contestant loses and gets locked in a cage.

==F==
*'''Final Fall''': 'Final Fall' is used to further whittle down the remaining contestants before the 'Show Down'. One at a time the contestants run through a tunnel, avoiding the 'Boxing Monster' who is waiting at the exit, to reach five holes in the ground. They have to choose a hole and jump down it. Three of the holes are safe and will take the contestant through to the 'Show Down', but hiding down the other two are Katsuo and Makoto. If a contestant chooses one of these two wrong holes, the Guard down it will stop them getting any further and they'll be out game. 
*'''Fish Food''': The contestant has to balance on a surfboard as it is pulled along a narrow runway. Stood over the runway are four small arch-shaped fish, and two big shark mouths. When they reach a fish the contestant has to jump over it, and land back on the board. When they reach a shark they must duck down low to go through its mouth. Along the journey they'll first come across a fish, then a shark, then two more fish, a second shark, and a final fish before reaching the beach at the end. If the contestant manages to reach the beach, while still on the surfboard, they win the game. 
*'''Flag Down''': A team of contestants play against a team of Guards. Each of them has a pole with a flag on top. When the game begins; half of each group has to try and grab the other team's flag, while the rest of them have to try to protect their own flag and hold their pole upright. The first team to pull down their opponents' flag wins. If the team of contestants pull down the Guard's flag first they win, and move onto the next round. But if the Guards grab the contestants' flag first they lose, and are out of the game. 
*'''Foot Loose''': Laid out on the ground are lots of different pairs of footwear. These range from shoes to sandals, tin can stilts to giant feet. The contestants all run over, grab a pair, and put them on their feet. Once they've got the footwear on, the contestants need to quickly make their way to the finish line. To make things harder, along the way to the goal is a big sticky area. When the contestants step on this they'll get stuck to the ground. The more unconventional the footwear the harder it is to move over this glue. The contestants who are too slow in reaching the finishing line lose, and are out of the game. 
*'''The Fortress''': The contestants all enter a secret garden and have to search for golden balls. The balls are hidden all over the garden, some easier to find than others. Some, for example, are hanging from trees, in a mouldy pond and under boxes, while others are a lot harder to find; buried in the ground, hidden inside trees or even down the costumes of the human Guard-en ornaments. Contestants that have their own golden ball by the end of the game move onto the next round. Anyone who doesn't have one is out.

==G==
*'''The Gauntlet''': 'The Gauntlet' is a real life video game. The contestants need to beat a pink mushroom, which is travelling on a track above the course, to the goal to win. If they fall off at any time it's game over. When the game begins the mushroom timer will start moving. The contestant first has to run past three Ghoulies (Guards there to put them off) to reach a conveyor belt. The belt is moving backwards so the contestant has to move quickly to get along it. While they're crossing, a boulder will be rolled down from above to try and knock them off. Next the contestant has to jump over a rotating centipede turnstile and then bounce off a trampoline, up into a pit of foam pieces. Now they must cross a narrow beam while avoiding being knocked off by a wrecking ball that is swung at them. Then, to cross a gap in the course, they have to step onto a spinning plank and leap off the opposite side to carry on. Penultimately, the contestant has to cross a much longer beam - this time while avoiding three wrecking balls. Finally they need to use a rope to swing across a stretch of water to reach the goal. If the pink mushroom reaches the goal before the contestant, Strong, Animal or Kibaji will come out of their cage and chuck the player in the water and out of the game. In a one-off modified version of the course the conveyor belt was removed, the trampoline was replaced by two 'High Rollers', and the spinning plank was replaced with a row of 16 monkey bars. 
*'''Giant Maze''': This is a giant wooden maze in Kyoto. The contestants all enter at the same time and have to find their way to the exit. Hiding inside are Strong and Kibaji. They'll try to put the contestants off, and also board up the exit when the time is up. All the contestants that manage to make their way out of the exit before the final whistle move onto the next game. Everyone still stuck inside has lost, and is out. 
*'''Go Nuts''' (V1): While wearing an acorn costume, and with their feet tied together, the contestant has to make their way along a narrow curvy path. If they make it safely onto the round platform at the end of the path they win; but if they topple off they lose. 
*'''Go Nuts''' (V2): The contestant has to make their way up a steep hill while avoiding giant nuts that are being rolled down towards them. To make things harder, the contestants are wrapped in padding and a straw mat to make it difficult to move very easily. The hill is also covered in thick foam, which makes it harder to climb. If a contestant manages to make it into the red goal area at the top of the hill they win. But if they end up rolling down the hill, after getting hit by a nut or just by losing balance, they lose. Getting hit by a nut doesn't automatically mean a contestant has lost, but it's likely it will knock them off of their feet anyway. 
*'''The Great Wall''': All the contestants have to try and climb over a tall wall to make it into the castle grounds. Once up, they have to slide down a slope on the other side; sometimes ending up in water traps or pools of mud. Any contestant that hasn't managed to get over the wall before the whistle blows has lost, and is out of the game. 
*'''Grid Iron''': The contestant has to run down a small American football pitch to reach the End Zone, while carrying a ball. Several Guards, dressed in big foam uniforms, will try to stop them on the way. The contestants can't step over the pitch's edge or they'll be out automatically. The game starts in a couple of different ways. In the first regular version the General throws the ball to the contestant. They have to catch it and then start running. In the second version the ball is placed in the middle of the pitch. When the whistle blows, the contestant and a Guard run to grab it. The contestant has to get there first or else they'll have to try and get the ball off of the Guards, which is dangerous as they could get caught. To win, the contestant has to get into the End Zone with the ball. If they get there without the ball they haven't won. If the Guards catch the contestant it's the end of the game, and the player loses. The Guards are slightly hampered by the costumes they're wearing, which makes it a bit easier for the contestant to avoid them. The men face seven (originally eight) Guards, while the women face five. On one occasion the contestants had to pick a card, numbered from one to eight, at random. The number they picked was the number of Guards they had to avoid. The second time and third the game was played, five contestants took part at once. They all had to run and pick up a ball each from the middle of the pitch, and then try to get past 10 guards. The contestants that managed to get to the End Zone, with a ball of their own, won the game. In the family special version the parent and child both run at the same time. They have to keep passing the ball between each other as they go, still while avoiding the Guards.

==H==
*'''High Rollers''': The contestant has to make their way over cylinders that are positioned above water, each slightly higher or lower than the previous one. The rollers aren't fixed still, so will spin around when stepped on. The contestant needs to move quickly, and have good balance, so that they're not rolled off. If they fall into the water they lose. By making it onto the platform at the end of the Rollers the contestant wins the game. To begin with there were only three Rollers that needed to be crossed. This was increased to five, and then to seven. 
*'''Home Run''': The contestant has to cross a tall balancing beam while trying to avoid giant baseballs being swung at them. To make balancing and moving harder, the contestant is dressed in a giant foam baseball uniform. As they cross, Animal will try and knock them off by swinging three giant baseballs, tied on ropes, at them. Even the slightest knock on their giant costume can make the contestant spin and fall, so they need to move carefully. If a contestant reaches the finish platform, at the end of the beam, they win the game. 
*'''Honeycomb Maze''': This is a maze made up of lots of hexagonal shaped rooms, which all look exactly the same. The rooms have six doors, one in each wall, which all open outwards and inwards. However some of the doors in some rooms are dummies, which don't open, as they're against outside walls. The contestant enters the maze at the top right and has to try to find the exit, which is at the bottom left. Waiting inside are two "Black-Handed, Black-Hearted" Guards (usually Strong and Kibaji) who are trying to find the contestant. The contestant needs to avoid the Guards, because if they get caught they'll have their face covered in black paint, get thrown out of the maze, and will have lost the game. There are several exits all along the left and bottom sides of the maze, but only one is correct. If the contestant comes out of the wrong door they'll fall into a pool of water and will have also lost the game. If a contestant manages to make it through the maze, avoiding being caught by the guards, and exits through the correct door they win. The maze began with 12 rooms; 4 x 4. Later the size was increased to 20 rooms, 5 x 4, and a third Guard was added (usually Animal) to increase the difficulty. In family special episodes the children stand on a platform above the maze. They have to shout out instructions to direct their parent through, avoiding the Guards, to the exit. This family variation was later used in regular episodes. This time the General shouts out the directions to the contestants.

==I==
*'''Indestruct-a-ball''': The contestant is curled up and shut inside a big plastic ball. Jo, with the help of the Boxing Monster, then rolls them into a giant pachinko machine. At the bottom of the machine are five skull boxes. If the contestant ends up in one of these boxes they have lost the game; but if they roll down between them, ending up in the goal area underneath, they win. 
*'''In The Sack''': 'In the Sack' is a couples' special game. All the couples are split up into men and women. The men all start behind a sheet on one side, and the women all start behind a sheet on the opposite side. When the starting whistle is blown, everyone has to run out and try to find their partner. Once a couple has been reunited they have to go and lie on a bed. There are only 55 beds, which isn't enough for every couple. Only one couple can be on any one bed, so the contestants have to move quickly to ensure that they grab one for themselves. When all the beds are filled the whistle is blown. All the couples on a bed go through to the next round, while the others that are still standing lose and are out.

==J==
*'''Jetskid''': The contestant lies on a bodyboard at a starting line in the sea. On go, the board is pulled along by a speedboat. The contestant has to try and stay on the board as it is pulled through two lines of buoys, and then up over a ramp. If they manage to hang on, they then have to wait until they reach a floating finish platform and leap off onto it. If the contestant lands safely, and stays on the finish platform, they win. If they fall into the water at anytime they lose the game. The boat pulls the bodyboard at varying speeds. Sometimes it moves extremely fast, but other times very slowly, so good balance is needed at all times.

==K==
*'''[[Karaoke]]''': The contestant has to go into a karaoke bar and step up onto the stage. A song starts to play and they have to sing along. If the contestant entertains the customers and, more importantly, the bar's boss, they win the game and are taken through to the back room by the Bunny/Geisha Girls. But if the boss is unhappy, and doesn't enjoy the performance, he will get his bouncer to throw the contestant out and they'll have lost the game. The contestants don't know what song they'll get before it starts to play, so they might not know the words. If this happens they can try to make up their own lyrics, or just dance along. However, in this case, they'll have to be very good to amuse the boss. In later episodes the boss is replaced by a steaming statue. If a contestant isn't good enough the statue will blow its top and the Black-Handed, Black-Hearted bouncers will storm onto the stage and blacken the contestant's face. 
*'''Knock Knock''' (V1): 'Knock Knock' began as the second half of 'Skipping Stones'. After crossing the lake, the contestants are faced with a wall that has four doors in it. One of the doors is real, but the others aren't. The contestant has to run full-speed at a door. If it's made of paper they will burst through it and will have won the game. If they choose a wrong door, which is solid, they will bounce straight off and lose. A second wall was then added behind the first. If a contestant makes it through the first wall they then have to choose another door in the second wall. If they're lucky again, and they choose a paper door, they'll go through the wall and win. If they choose wrong they won't get through, and they'll have lost. The walls were then removed from 'Skipping Stones' and made into game of their own. The number of walls the contestants have to get through were doubled to four. Now they have to choose four paper doors, one in each wall, to make it all the way through and win. This time not all the wrong doors are solid. Some are made from paper, but have a net fixed behind. If a contestant runs through one of these they'll be caught in the net and also lose the game. If the contestants make it through the second wall they'll usually be confronted with the Boxing Monster (Jumbo Max in earlier episodes). They will need to make their way past him to continue on. If the contestants choose wrong this time they'll end up getting a pummelling from the Monster. 
*'''Knock Knock''' (V2): This is the starting game version of 'Knock Knock'. Here there is a row of ten walls. Each wall has eight doors in it. Behind the tenth wall is a long bath of powder. All the contestants, at the same time, run full-speed at the doors. If they run into a paper door they'll burst through and continue onto the next wall; but if they choose a wrong door they'll bounce off again. By choosing a wrong door the contestant's aren't out - they can continue trying doors until they make it through, or just go through a door that has already been opened. Behind some of the paper doors are nets. If the contestants run through these they'll get trapped and will have to go back out and use another. Also behind some of the correct doors are pools of water. After breaking through, the contestants will end up falling in and getting slowed down. The Emerald Guards are waiting behind the ninth wall to slow the contestants down and push them back into the water pools. After making it through all ten walls the contestants will reach the bath of powder. Buried in the powder are lots of balls. The contestants have to grab a ball for themselves. There aren't enough for everyone though, so the contestants need to make their way to the end as quickly as they can to make sure they get a ball. When the final whistle blows, everyone who has their own ball moves onto the next game. Everyone without one goes out. In the couples' version only the men play the game. The women wait at the end with a pink half of a heart each. In the bath of powder are lots of blue half-hearts. The men have to grab a piece each and then fit it together with their partner's piece. Between them, the couples have to have made a full heart when the whistle blows to move on. If a couple doesn't have a full heart they are out of the game. In the family special version, the walls are split in half. The children run through one side, with four doors, and the parents run through the other side, also with four doors. At the end, the kids have to find a saucer in the powder and the parents have to find a bowl. The pairs must have a bowl and saucer set each to move onto the next round - if not they're out.

==L==
*'''Leap Frog''': The contestant stands on a board at the top of a tall ramp, holding onto a handrail for balance. The board is then pushed down the ramp into the pond below. Floating on the pond is a giant lily pad. As they hit the water, the contestant has to jump off of the board and land on the lily pad. If they make it onto the pad, and stay on, they've won the game. If they fall in the water they have lost. 
*'''Line Up''': Lots of rolled up bibs are hanging from ropes in the air. When the game starts, all the contestants have to run out from behind a set of doors and grab a bib for themselves. They then need to unroll it and put it on. All the bibs have one of six characters on; either "Fu", "un", "ta", "ke", "shi" or "jou". When they're wearing a bib, the contestants have to find five other people, each with a different bib. When they're in a group with a different character each, the contestants have to line up to spell out "Fuun Takeshi Jou" ("Operation Takeshi's Castle"). Once in the right order they must tie their legs together, just like in a three-legged race - except this is a seven-legged version! Then it's a race to the finish line. All the groups that get past the finish line before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Anyone who wasn't quick enough and didn't get into a group, therefore not reaching the finish, has lost and is out.

==M==
*'''Match Maker''': Laid out on the ground are lots of big polystyrene shapes, and lots of mats with matching shapes cut out of them. When the game begins, all the contestants have to run out from behind a set of doors and grab a shape. Once they've got a shape, the contestants have to go over to the mats and try to find the one that their shape fits into. If they can find the matching mat, they slot their shape into the hole and sit on it to signify that they've finished. Everyone who is sitting on their shape, correctly slotted into the right mat, when the final whistle blows goes through to the next round. Anyone who hasn't managed to get their shape into a mat loses and is out of the game. Some shapes don't have a matching mat at all, so if a contestant is unfortunate enough to pick one of these they've got no chance of moving on. In a special episode Match Maker was played on the beach. All the mats were laid out on the sand, while the shapes were placed on a floating children's playground in the sea. On the starting whistle, all the contestants have to swim out to the playground and get a shape each. They then have to swim back to shore with their shape to try and find the matching mat. 
*'''Midoriyama Marathon''': All the contestants begin at the start line in front of the castle. When the General fires the starting pistol the race begins. The contestants first have to dash out of the 'car park' and down onto the road outside. Here the first obstacle is to jump over five small hurdles. Next is a long net on the ground that needs to be crawled under. After the net, lots of tyres are laid out along the road. The contestants have to pick their way through these to reach three sets of mats, which are spaced out along the next section of road. On each of these mats the contestants have to do a forward roll. After these it's a long run around the connecting roads. The roads loop back on their self, so the contestants end up back at the three mats again. Just as before, they have to do a forward roll on each. Then it's back through the tires, and then another crawl under the net. Finally they need to run up a set of steps to reach the finishing line at the top. The contestants who finish the course in fastest time move onto the next round. 
*'''Muddy Waters''': On the starting whistle, all the contestants run up over a hill and down into a giant thick muddy puddle. They need to wade as fast as they can through the water to reach the other side. The slowest contestants to reach other side of the water are out of the game. 
*'''Mudskippers''': All the contestants have to crawl, wade, and drag themselves through the thick mudflats of the Ariake Sea. Halfway through the mud are red and blue banners hanging from wires in the air. The contestants need to reach up and grab one of these to be able to move onto the next round. Anyone who doesn't have a banner by the time the final whistle blows loses, and is out of the game. 
*'''Mud Slide''': 'Mud Slide' is set up like a baseball game. The contestant starts at first base. The ball is pitched, purposely missed by the batter, and caught by the catcher. As soon as the catcher has the ball the contestant has to run to second base. Between the first and second base is a pit of thick mud that the contestant has to run, or slide, through. If they reach the second base before the fielder touches it with the ball they win the game. However, if they're too slow, or get caught in the mud, and don't reach second base before the ball they're forced out and the contestant loses. 
*'''Mushroom Trip''': The contestant starts on a high platform, at the edge of a lake, and has to grab onto the stalk of a giant mushroom. Once they're gripped on, the mushroom starts flying over the lake - constantly spinning around as it goes. The contestant needs to hold on until they reach a platform on the other side of the water. Here they have to let go and drop onto this finish platform. If they manage to land safely, and stay on the platform, they win the game. If they slip off and fall into the water, at any time, they've lost. The first finishing platform was really big, and raised off the ground. This was then changed to a much smaller mat that floats on the water, making it harder to land safely. To help grip on, there is one small handhold hole in the stalk. Women also get a rope to wrap around the stalk for extra grip.

==N==
*'''Nautiball''': 'Nautiball' is volleyball played on a big floating platform in the sea. The contestants play in groups of five. The group begins by picking a card out of a box to find out which team they'll be playing against. The opposing teams, also of five members, include Emerald Guards, a women's volleyball team and women in swimming costumes. The first team to reach three points are the victors; so the contestants need to beat their opponents in order to win the game.

==O==
*'''Oh Deer''': Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. They begin the race on deer-tricycles. First they have to pedal up and over a bridge, and then carry on until they reach a 'Slippery Wall'. Now they have to leave their tricycles behind and try to run up the slope. When they've reached the top of the wall, the contestants have to slide down the other side and pick up a giant bat. Jo places a ball on this bat, which they have to keep balanced on top as they make their way over to a giant hat. If they drop the ball the contestants have to stop, re-balance it, and then carry on. Once at the hat they have to tip the ball into it. Next the contestants run over to a giant maple leaf that has shoulder straps attached to it. They need to put it on their back and then finally walk across a balance beam. If they fall off at any time they have to step back on where they fell. The first contestant to reach the finishing line at the end of the balance beam wins. 
*'''Oh Ma Ha Beach''': Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. They begin on a floating starting mat in the sea. When the whistle blows, the contestants have to leap across a row of six smaller slippery floating platforms. They then must jump into the sea and swim to the shore. When they reach the shore, the contestants need to slip a ring around their waists. Attached to the ring is a big rake, which also has tyres tied to the end during the men's races. They have to run up the beach while dragging the rakes behind them, until they reach a loop of plastic. Now the contestants need to take off the rake and get in the middle of the plastic loop. Inside these they must to roll up the beach (like a tank track) over to a 'Slippery Wall'. Finally the contestants have to climb this wall, which has water running down it, to reach the goal at the top. The first contestant to reach the goal wins. 
*'''On Yer Bike''': In 'On Yer Bike', five contestants race each other around a track on children's tricycles. When the starting flag is waved, the contestants have to cycle along to, and up, a seesaw. When there's enough weight on the other side it will tip down allowing the contestants to carry on along the track. Anyone who hasn't got onto the see-saw will have to wait for it to tip back down the other way to be able to progress. After turning a corner, the track goes uphill and gets very narrow. As contestants pass over the top of the hill, steam blows up from under the track. This fogs the contestants' view, and shocks some, so they need to be careful to keep balance. The track ramps back downhill into a corner. At this corner is a pond. If the contestants come down the ramp too fast they'll end up rolling off of the track and into the water. Finally, the contestants cycle around the rest of the turning track to reach a second seesaw. Again, this will tip up when enough weight is on the raised end, allowing the contestants to reach the finish line. The contestant that reaches the finish line first is the winner.

==P==
*'''Pipe Down''': The contestant starts on a platform raised several stories in the air. Connected to this is a long fabric tube that leads down to the ground. The contestant has to get into the tube and slide down inside it. Near the bottom is an opening in the material. Under this is a platform floating on a lake. When they reach the opening, the contestant has to drop out of it and try to land on the platform. If they time it right, they'll land safely on the platform and win the game. But if they're too fast, or too slow, the contestant will end up in the water and will have lost. 
*'''Poles Apart''': The contestant starts on a high platform at the edge of a lake. In the middle of the lake is a floating mat. Using a pole, the contestant has to volt across the lake and land on the mat. If they judge it right, and land on the mat without falling off, they win the game. If they miss, and end up in the water, they lose. 
*'''Prod''': Before the game, the contestant has to blindly pick a coloured ball out of a box. The colour of ball they pick represents the Guard they'll be fighting against. In the middle of a pool are two small round platforms, a short distance from each other. The contestant stands on one of these platforms while the chosen Guard stands on the other. Each of them has a long lance with a big rounded end on. On the whistle, the contestant and Guard have to push and prod each other with their lances - trying to knock each other off of the platforms. If the contestant manages to push the Guard into the water they win the game; but if the guard pushes them off first, the contestant has lost. 
*'''Puck Over''': Five contestants play this game at once. They all begin by choosing one of five cards at random. The cards are numbered 1 to 5, and the number they pick corresponds to the their position in the game. The contestants sit on a giant puck, and have a snowman-shaped case put over the top of them. The snowmen are arranged in a triangle shape on a round icy platform. 3, 4 and 5 are the back row, with 1 and 2 making the row in front. In front of all of them is one snowman with no one inside. From the top of a slope, which is also covered in ice, Animal pushes down another giant puck towards the snowmen. As it hits the group it will send them sliding around. Any contestants, inside their snowmen, that are knocked off the edge of the platform lose the game. Any contestants fortunate enough to remain on the platform win the game.

==Q==
*'''Quake''': Five contestants at a time, dressed as old people, enter a room and have to sit on a pile of cushions each. When they're all sitting, the room begins to shake. The contestants have to try and stay balanced on their cushions until the 'earthquake' ends. If they fall off at anytime, they lose. Any contestant who has stayed balanced on top of their cushion pile when the game ends has won. In the couples' special version, the women have to kneel on top of the men's backs. If they can stay balanced on their partner, until the room stops shaking, they win the game. In the family version the children have to balance on top of their parents, who are dressed as turtles, for the duration of the earthquake.

*'''Rat Race''': All the contestants at once race through this obstacle course, which is made up of three other Takeshi's Castle games. The contestants begin at the starting line and, when the whistle is blown, have to try and get over a 'Slippery Wall'. Once over the first wall, there is a second one to scale. After the Walls, the contestants enter the 'Honeycomb Maze'. As usual, they have to get from the entrance to the exit while avoiding Kibaji and Animal. To help them through, Jo is standing on top of the maze to shout out directions. Finally, only if they have made it out of the right exit in the maze, the contestants must cross the 'Skipping Stones'. They have to choose the right stones to make it across the lake, avoiding the sinking ones. Any contestant that makes it across the water, without falling in, reaches the finish line and wins the game. 
*'''Rice Bowl Downhill''': The contestant sits in a giant bowl at the top of a wet slope. Two guards at the top of the hill (usually Popcorn) push the bowl down it, towards a pool at the bottom. The contestant has to stay balanced inside the bowl as it slides down the hill and hits the water at the bottom. If they are still inside when the bowl ends up floating in the pool they win the game. If the contestant falls out at any time they lose. In couples' and family special episodes the pairs have to sit in the bowl together. Both of the contestants have to stay inside the bowl at all times to win. 
*'''Ride The Wave''': In 'Ride the Wave', contestants have to ride a bicycle, which looks like a whale, around a track. To make things harder, Guards (Strong and Kibaji, or Popcorn) are constantly firing balls at the bikes, from a cannon, to try and knock the contestants over. When the starting whistle is blown, the contestant rolls down a short ramp and has to cycle around a long snaking path. Once they reach the end they then turn a corner. Around the corner is a straight section with rounded lumps on. The contestant has to be careful to keep their balance as they ride through these. Around the next corner is a longer path. This one is covered in lots of rounded sticks, laid long-ways across the track. If the contestant makes it over this path, they turn a 180-degree corner and have to cycle down another long path, back in the opposite direction to the one they've just ridden down. This path has fewer sticks on it than the previous one. Lastly, it's a final corner turn to reach the finish line. If the contestant manages to reach the end of the track, they win the game; but, if they fall over at any time, or get knocked over by the cannon, they lose. The track was later modified. In the second version the rounded lumps were replaced by several of the sticks across the path. As the contestants cross these, steam is sprayed into their face to try and put them off. Make it past here and the contestants turn the corner into the final straight. Along this path is a seesaw. The contestant has to cycle up it, and then ride it down on the other side to carry on, avoiding some rounded lumps that may be placed after it. Finally they turn a corner to reach the finish line. In a special episode the game was played on an ice rink. This time there is just one long path to cycle down; but because the contestants are riding over ice it is slippery, so hard to stay upright - especially with balls being fired at the bikes. 
*'''Ro-Jim-Bo''': In 'Ro-Jim-Bo', the contestants play Janken-pon (Rock-Paper-Scissors) against an Emerald Guard. The contestant stands on a platform, with the Guard on another next to them. Music begins to play and the contestant and Guard have to dance. When the music ends both of them have to show their chosen sign (a fist for rock, a flat hand for paper or a sideways 'V'-sign for scissors). As in a normal game; rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If the contestant beats the guard they win; but if the guard beats them, the contestant loses and is lowered down into a pit of steam. 
*'''Roller Derby''': Six contestants play at a time. All of them are dressed as horses, and wear roller skates. When the General fires the starting pistol the race begins. The contestants have to skate out from their starting blocks and race to the finish line at the end of the road. The first two contestants to reach the finishing line win the game, the other four lose. In later games four (then reduced to three) small hurdles, each slightly higher than the previous one, were added in the middle of the road. The contestants have to step over these hurdles to carry on, dragging the back legs of their costumes (which are also on wheels) over as they go. 
*'''Roll Out The Barrel''': 'Roll Out the Barrel' is a life-size game of Pop Up Pirate. The contestant sits on a disk on top of a massive barrel, in front of a slide. In the side of the barrel are slots, numbered one to six. The contestant has choose three numbers, one at a time, by standing a numbered card (1 – 6) of their choice in front of them. Once they've chosen a number, Jo will push one of the giant swords into the corresponding slot. Four of the slots are safe, but two of them will end the game. If the contestants have chosen one of the two losing slots, pushing the sword in will cause the top of the barrel to pop-up and the contestant will be tipped down the slide and into the lake at the bottom. If they end up in the water the contestant has lost the game. If the slot they choose is safe, the contestant chooses a second number. Again, if this is wrong they'll slide into the water and lose; but if this is safe too they have to choose one final number. If the third number the contestants choose is also safe they have won the game. In the family special version, the parents sit on top of the barrel while the children choose the slots and push the swords in. The first time the game was played the contestants had to choose four numbers, so had to find all the safe slots to win. 
*'''Roll The Dice''': 'Roll the Dice' is a couples' special game. Before the game, the couple is asked to decide whether they want to roll for an odd or even number. After they've chosen, both contestants get into giant dice. Their helmets stick out the top forming the number ones. The first contestant, inside the dice, is rolled down a slope into the playing area. After they have stopped rolling at the bottom, their partner is pushed down from another slope to the right. The numbers that have been rolled on the two dice are added together, to find out if the total is an odd or even number. If it's odd and the couple chose odd, or if it's even and the couple chose even, they win the game. If the total is the opposite type of number to the one the couple chose, they lose. 
*'''Rope''': 'Rope' is the first version of 'Bridge Ball'. The contestant has to get across a long rope that stretches horizontally across a ravine. If the contestant makes it to the other end of the rope they win the game. If they fall off they lose. In the latter versions of this game, the Guards shoot balls at the contestants, from a cannon, to try and knock them off. 
*'''Roulette''': When the game begins, all the contestants run out from behind a set of doors and over to a bath of powder. Buried in the powder are lots of disks. Written on each disk is either a number from 0 to 36, "Odd", "Even", "Black" or "Red". Once they have a disk, the contestants have to go and sit on the corresponding space on a giant roulette table. When everyone is in place, Jo spins a roulette wheel. The contestants sitting on the chosen number are scraped away and are out of the game. The contestants sitting on red or black and odd or even are also out, depending on what the 'winning' number is. All the other contestants move onto the next round. 
*'''The Run Way''' (V1): The contestant sits in a round sledge at the top of a runway. To begin the game, Popcorn push the sledge down the track. As the contestant is sliding along, several boards are turned around at the side of the runway. Each board has a number or mathematical sign on, so together all the boards make up a long sum. The contestants have to quickly work out the equation as they reach the end of the track. When they stop at the end the contestant has to tell Youshichi the answer to the sum. If they've got the answer right they win the game. However, if they get the answer wrong, or take too long working it out, the end of the runway will collapse and the contestant will be dropped into a pit of powder or mud below and lose the game. 
*'''The Run Way''' (V2): Starting at the beginning of an icy runway, the contestant has to run up and jump on a giant curling rock to slide along on it. They have to make it to, and stop in, the goal at the end of the runway to win the game. Along the way the path gets narrower, wider, and then narrower again; so the contestant has to slide as straight as they can to avoid falling off the edge. Also, as the rock moves along, Katsuo and Makoto sweep the ice in front of it trying to put the contestant off. If the contestant falls off of the runway at any time they lose the game. If they don't push off hard enough they won't reach the goal and will also lose. If they push too hard they'll slide over the goal and fall off the end, again losing the game.

==S==
*'''Samurai Back''': Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. On the whistle, the contestants run out of the stating doors wearing samurai costumes. First they have to walk across a balance beam, which is made more difficult by the long trousers. When they're across the beams, the contestants have to take off the costumes and put a bucket, with shoulder straps, on their back. Balls are shot into the air from a cannon. The contestants have to catch one of the balls in their bucket before they can move on. Once they've got a ball, they take off the bucket and climb over a mini 'Great Wall'. When they've over, they slide down the other side to reach a small hurdle with a plate of food behind it. The contestants need to put their feet on the hurdle and, only using their mouth, pick up the three pieces of food. When the food is in their mouth, the contestants must get up and put a mask on the back of their heads. Finally they run backwards (so the mask is facing forwards) along a track to the finish line. The first contestant to reach the finish line wins.
* '''Sand Flee ''':  All the contestants at once race through this obstacle course on the beach. When the game begins, the contestants have to run over to where lots of buns in bags are hanging from wires in the air. As in 'Bite the Bun', they need to grab a bun with their mouths – although this time there is nothing stopping them from using their hands. Once they have a bun, the contestants must crawl under a long net on the ground. On the other side of the net is a big area of sand where hundreds of silver balls are hidden. When they reach this area, the contestants have to dig in the sand to find a ball for themselves. After they've found one they must run to the finish line with it. When they're at the finish the contestants open up the ball. Inside is a piece of paper. If the paper has a red circle on it the contestants have won the game. However, if they don't get a circle they need to run back to the digging area and try to find another ball. If they do find another they can run back to the finish line and open this one, again repeating the process if needed. All the contestants that have a red circle by the time the final whistle is blown move onto the next round. Everyone who doesn't have one is out of the game. 
*'''Sandscript''': 'Sandscrpit' is the second half of the starting game for the final episode. The contestants are split into eight groups, according to the colour of ball they picked up in 'Drop in the Ocean': red, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, white and black. The General stands on a platform and calls out a Japanese character. He then picks a ball at random from a box. The colour of ball he picks determines which group gets that character. This is done seven times for seven characters: "se", "me", "ru", "ta", "ke", "shi", and "jou". The team that doesn't get picked out of the box automatically moves onto the next round. When the whistle blows, each team has to run over to their giant piece of paper and arrange themselves into the shape of their character. They need to do this correctly so that the phrase "Semeru Takeshi Jou" ("Attack Takeshi's Castle") can be read from above. When the time is up, the teams are judged on their formation by a calligraphy expert. The team determined the worst loses, and is out of the game.
*'''Shoot 'N Loot''': 'Shoot 'N' Loot' was played at the end of the final episode, instead of the 'Show Down'. It was a chance for the last remaining contestants to win prizes, including: a satellite dish, a Game Boy, a suitcase, a CD Walkman, a bike, a camcorder, a trip to Hawaii, and a pair of sandals. To try and win, the contestant has to shoot small balls from a machine at the prizes moving along on conveyor belts. The booby prizes are stuck to boards and move along at the back, making them the easiest to hit. The other prizes are written on smaller boxes; the middle prizes in blue, and the better prizes in red. There is also a million yen on offer. This is written in gold on a small box, and moves along at the back faster than any of the other prizes, making it a lot harder to hit. The contestant wins all of the prizes that they manage to knock off of the conveyor belt. 
*'''Show of Hands''': In the first version of 'Show of Hands' ten contestants play the game at the same time. All the contestants are dressed as hands. Spread out around the playing area are lots of giant cards, each with a different Hiragana character on. The teacher reads out a statement and the contestants have to run and find the correct answer. Once they've found the card with the right answer on they have to fall face-first on top of it. The first person to fall onto the correct mat wins. There are several questions for each group, so the contestants have more than one chance to win. After a few episodes the characters on the cards were replaced with numbers. Now mathematical questions are read out and the contestants have to find the correct answer to the sum. In the second version of the game only five contestants play at once. The other five people are now Emerald Guards, dressed as blue hands. As before, a mathematical question is asked and all the players have to try and be the first to fall onto the correct answer. However, if a Guard gets to the answer first they win and this is one less chance for a contestant to clear the game. In a one-off version, instead of questions being asked, short clips of music are played. The contestants have to identify the song and jump onto the card that shows its correct title. In a special version the game was played in the mud flats of the Ariake Sea. This time, instead of full costumes, the contestants just have a giant foam hand over one of their hands. Ten contestants play at once, and all have to crawl through the mud to reach the right answer. To first person to put their giant hand on the correct mat wins. 
*'''Single Roller''': A big cylinder is laid on a metal track, above water. The contestant stands on top of the cylinder and has to move it along the rails to the end. The track slopes slightly downhill, it then flattens off towards the middle before turning into a steeper slope near the end; so the contestant needs excellent balance to stay on top as the cylinder rolls down. If the contestant manages to stay on the cylinder, until the end of the track, they can leap off onto the finish platform and have won the game. If they fall off at any time they lose. 
*'''Skittles''': Ten contestants play this game at once. Before starting they each pick a card, numbered from one to ten, at random. The number they pull tells the contestants which pin position they will take. The higher the number you pick the further to the back of the group you are - number one being right at the front. All the contestants are dressed as a giant bowling pins and have their legs tied together, to make standing upright harder. Once they're in position on the alley, a giant bowling ball is rolled down a ramp towards the contestants. Any contestant that gets knocked over has lost the game. Anyone who manages to stay standing wins. 
*'''Skipping Stones''': The contestant has to cross a lake by using stepping-stones. All the stones look identical, but only some of them are solid. The other stones aren't supported and will sink when trodden on. If the contestant manages to get across the lake, without falling in the water, they win the game. In some early games a 'Knock Knock' wall is added to the bank on the other side of the lake. If a contestant manages to get across the water they are faced with a wall that has four doors in it. Two of the doors are real, but the other two aren't. The contestant has to run full-speed at a door. If it's made of paper they will burst through it. If not, they bounce straight off and lose. The contestant has to make it through the wall to win the whole game. Later, a second wall was added behind the first. The contestant now had to get through a correct door in both walls to win the game. 
*'''Sling Swing Fling''': The contestant hangs in a harness in the air. When the game begins they are pulled along over a pool. Floating in the middle of the pool is a bowl with a ball in it. When they're near enough, the contestant needs to pull a cord that will drop them down on a bungee rope so that they can grab the ball. If the contestant manages to get the ball, they have to quickly throw it into a giant pot that's positioned at the end of the pool. If the ball goes in they win the game. If they miss, or didn't manage to pick up the ball in the first place, the contestant loses and gets dunked, and their face blackened, by the Sea Goblin. 
*'''Slipped Disks''': This is the second line of defence on the edge of the castle grounds: A bunker with water pistol-wielding Guards inside, in front of, and on top of it. The contestants are all armed with water pistol and have paper rings stuck to their helmets. On go, they all rush over to the bunker and have to climb over the top of it. As they're climbing over, the Guards will try and break the contestants' rings by shooting them with water. If a contestant's ring gets broken they have lost and are out of the game. The guards also have rings that the contestants can try to break. If a Guard's ring does get broken they can't shoot anymore. All the contestants that manage to get over the bunker, without having their ring broken, move onto the next game. 
*'''Slippery Wall''': All the contestants have to try and climb up this steep slippery slope to make it into the castle grounds. There are ropes place at the top of the wall to help, but the contestants have to get most of the way up the slope to reach them. Once up, they have to slide down the slope on the other side; usually ending up in water traps or pools of mud. Any contestant that hasn't managed to get over the wall before the whistle blows is out of the game. The final time this game was played; lots of balls were hanging from wires in the air above the slope on the back of the wall. This time, once the contestants have climbed up, they have to grab a ball on their way down the other side. The contestants need to have a ball of their own to move on. Anyone who doesn't get one loses and is out of the game. 
*'''Slip Way''': 'Slip Away' is a family special game. The child lays on an aeroplane bodyboard at the end of a long platform. The parent has to push the board along the runway to try and get it to stop in the goal area at the end. If the parent pushes too hard they'll slide their child straight off the end of the runway, into the water below, and lose the game. If they don't push hard enough they won't reach the goal, will come up short, and the child will get pushed off into the water by Okada the Evil Crow – also losing the game. If the parent judges the force just right, their child will end up positioned over the goal area and they win the game. There is a board at the end of a long platform. The contestant has to run up and jump on the board to slide along the runway. The aim is to end up on the arrow, or in the goal area, right at the end of the runway. If the contestant pushes off too hard they'll slide straight off the end, into the water below, and lose the game. If they don't push off hard enough they won't reach the goal, will come up short, and will get pushed off into the water by Okada the Sea Goblin – also losing the game. If the contestant judges the force just right, and ends up positioned over the arrow/goal area, they win the game. 
*'''Snow Lane''': Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. On the starting whistle, the contestants have to get down low and pull themselves through tracks in the snow. After this they have to jump down into a big hole, and then climb out again on the other side. Once out there's a second hole to jump into, and climb out of again. Next is a hill made of snow. The contestants have to put on fat, 'Blueberry Hill'-like, fox costumes and run up the hill, trying not to topple over and roll back down again. At the top of the hill the contestants take off the costumes and sit on a rubber doughnut-shaped sledge. They have to slide down the other side of the hill, and keep going until they reach the finish line. The first contestant to reach the finish wins. 
*'''Space Invaders''': Starting at the top of a hill, the contestant sits in a cable car with a laser gun. Positioned down the hill are several Guard-manned stations. All the stations have a sensor on. As the cable car moves down the hill the contestant has to try and shoot a sensor on one of the stations. If the contestant manages to hit one of the Guard's sensors, all the stations will go up in smoke, they win the game and move onto the 'Show Down'. However, the Guards fight back. In the first version there are four active stations, and the Guards on these shoot balls from cannons. On the contestant's cable car are two targets - one on each side. If a Guard hits one of these targets with a ball, the car goes up in smoke and the contestant loses the game. In the second version there are five active stations. The guards on these also have a laser gun each. On the contestant's cable car is a sensor. If a Guard hits the sensor the car will go up in smoke, the contestant loses and is out of the game. The contestants don't need to hit a Guard's sensor to win. If they manage to make it all the way down the hill, without having the target/sensor on their cable car hit, the contestant automatically wins and moves onto the 'Show Down'. 
*'''Square Maze''': The 'Square Maze' is the earlier version of the 'Honeycomb Maze'. The maze is made up 12 square rooms, 4 x 3, that all look exactly the same. The rooms have four doors, one in each wall, which all open outwards and inwards. However some of the doors in some of the rooms are dummies, which don't open, as they're against outside walls. The contestants enter the maze at the top right and have to try to find the exit, which is at the bottom left. Waiting inside are two "Black-Handed, Black-Hearted" Guards who are trying to find the contestant. The contestant needs to avoid the guards, because if they get caught they'll have their faces covered in black paint, get thrown out of the maze, and will have lost the game. If a contestant manages to make it through the maze, avoiding being caught by the Guards, they win the game. Originally there was only the one exit, but later a second was added to the top left room. If the contestant goes through this one they don't win, but lose and end up in a pool of water. A second wrong exit was then added next to this, with the pool extended along to cover this door too. In family special episodes the children stand on a platform above the maze. They have to shout out instructions to direct their parents through, avoiding the Guards, to the exit. In a special one-off version of the game the contestants and Strong (the only guard in the maze) were blindfolded. The game is played as usual, with the contestant having to find their way from the entrance to the exit without being caught. For this blindfold version, four of the doors inside the maze are locked shut so they could not be used. This makes navigating through the maze even tougher and more confusing. 
*'''Stock Pot Racing''': On the whistle, all the contestants have to try and climb over a small slippery slope. Once they've made it up, they slide down the other side. Next there is a long net on the ground that contestants have to crawl under. Standing on top of the net are Guards, trying to stop the contestants moving through. On the other side of the net are a lot of big vegetables. Contestants have to grab one and take it into a giant cooking pot. All the contestants that make it into the pot, with a vegetable of their own, before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Everyone else is out. 
*'''Streets Ahead''': On the whistle, all the contestants have to try and climb over a small slippery slope. Once they've made it up, they slide down the other side. Next there is a long net on the ground that contestants have to crawl under. Standing on top of the net are Guards, trying to stop the contestants moving through. On the other side of the net are a lot of big vegetables. Contestants have to grab one and take it into a giant cooking pot. All the contestants that make it into the pot, with a vegetable of their own, before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Everyone else is out. 
*'''Stuff Diving''': Several contestants play this game at once. A question is asked and the contestants have to dive underwater to find a card or mat with the correct answer on. In the first version, groups of eight contestants play the game in a hot tub. The answers are all written on cards at the bottom of the tub. The first contestant to find the card with the correct answer to the question on wins. In the second version, ten contestants at a time play in a swimming pool. At the bottom of the pool are lots of mats with numbers on. A maths equation is read out and the contestants all have to dive into the pool to and try to find the mat with the correct answer on. The contestant that grabs the right mat and brings it up to the surface wins. To make diving harder, the contestants all have to wear floats around their waists. There is more than one question for each group, so the contestants get several chances at winning the game. 
*'''Sumo Rings''': There are five different coloured sumo rings: red, blue, yellow, green and purple. Each has a different guard inside. To begin, the contestant picks a ball at random out of a box. The colour of the ball they pick corresponds to the colour of a ring, telling them which Guard they have to fight. Now it's a straightforward sumo match. The fighters have to try and get their opponent on the ground or out of the ring to win. Some Guards are a lot easier to beat than others. Regular fighters include 'Spud' (a guard in a big Konishiki Yasokichi head costume) who is the easiest to beat, Shin Suganuma (a weedy little guard), and pro sumo wrestler Shinoburyo (/'Porker', a fat guard) who is the hardest to win against. In the family special version the parent and child fight the chosen guard at the same time. The game was changed once for a special version. After the contestant picks a ball to determine their opponent, both of them have to stand back-to-back on a small round platform in water. When the fight begins, the Guard and contestant have to try and push each other off by only using their bums. If the contestant gets pushed off and into the water they lose the battle. But if they manage to get the Guard off first they win.

==T==
*'''Take It Snow''': Lots of 'snowmen' are positioned between the starting and finishing platforms. The contestant has to get to the finish platform by stepping across the heads of the snowmen. Some of the heads are fixed still, but others are loose so will roll off when trodden on. If the contestant manages to get to the finish platform, without falling to the ground, they win the game. 
*'''Toboggoff''': The contestant sits on a rubber doughnut-shaped sledge at the top of a snow-covered slope, and is then pushed down it. After sliding down the slope the contestant has to stay on the doughnut as it speeds over several bumps to reach the finish line. In a one-off version the game is played down a tall snowy hill, with the goal situated at the bottom. If a contestant falls off at anytime before reaching the goal they lose. If they manage to stay balanced on top until passing the finish line, they win the game and move onto the next round. 
*'''Tug of War''': In the first version of 'Tug of War', contestants play as a team. There are four ropes leading underneath a barrier. The team has to choose one of them without being able to see who is on the other end. Once they've picked a rope the wall is lifted and their opponents are revealed. When the General blows his whistle the tug of war begins. The team that can pull their opponents over the centre line first wins the game. In the second version of the game contestants play one at a time. There are five ropes to choose from, each leading through a set of doors. When a contestant picks a rope the whistle is blown and the war begins, without them knowing who, or what, they're tugging against. The contestant has to try and pull their opponent over a line on the opposite side of the wall. If they succeed in doing this, the whistle is blown again, and they have won the battle. However, if the contestant is pulled over the line on their side of the wall they lose the fight. Once the war is over the door is opened so the contestant can see what they were tugging against.
*'''Turtle Hurtle''': A long bridge of slippery turtle-shaped platforms are floating in the sea. On the whistle, the contestant has to start running over them to try and reach the finish platform at the other end. If the contestant falls in the water at any time they lose the game. A few seconds after the whistle is blown a guard is released from a cage on the starting platform, and takes chase after the contestant. The contestant needs to be quick, as if the guard catches them they'll be thrown into the water. If the contestant manages to make it over all the turtles and onto the finishing platform, without being caught or falling off, they win and move onto the next game. 
*'''Turtle Soup''': 'Turtle Soup' is a family special game. Dressed as turtles, the parent has to crawl along a narrow snake pathway, in the middle of a lake, while carrying their kid on their back. To make this harder, the parent is blindfolded so the kid need to direct them. To begin they crawl down a short ramp. About halfway through the path goes in a big curve and gets even narrower. After this it widens up slightly again, to the width it was before, and ends with another ramp to crawl up to reach the goal. If the parent can make it all the way to the end of the snake, with their child still on their back, they've won the game. However, if the child slips off and into the water, or they fall into the water themselves, they've lost.

==U==
*'''Uphill Garden''': The contestant starts at the bottom of the hill with a water pistol and a paper ring stuck on their helmet. They need to climb up the hill to reach the fort at the top; but coming down the other way, trying to stop the contestant, is a guard dressed in a costume. The guard also has a ring and a water pistol. As they reach each other, the contestant and guard must try and break each other's rings by shooting water at it. If the contestant breaks the guard's ring first they win, and can go through the fort at the top of the hill to move onto the next game. However, if the guard breaks the contestant's ring first they've lost the fight, and are sent back down the hill. In later episodes the rings were moved from the helmets and onto the water pistols. On one occasion all the contestants had to climb the hill together while battling 12 guards. The contestants had to break all the guards' rings to win the game. 
*'''Up The Creek''': The contestant gets into a box that is suspended over a pit of mud. Once inside they have to use a pulley to move themselves along. In the middle of the mud pit is a platform, which the contestant has to try and position their box above. However, because they can't see whereabouts they are its all down to guesswork. Once they think they're over the platform, the contestant has to pull a lever to open the floor. If they're in the right place they'll fall onto the platform and win the game. If they haven't pulled themselves far enough, or have gone too far, they'll drop into the mud and lose.

==V==
*'''Velcro Fly''': The contestant wears a suit with Velcro on the front, and starts on a platform at the side of a pool. On the other side of the pool is a big board covered in fuzzy material. Using a trapeze on a long rope, the contestant has to swing over the lake, let go of the rope, and try to stick themselves onto the board. If the contestant manages to stick on the wall, and stay there, they have won the next game. If they don't stick, or don't even reach the wall, they'll fall into the water and will have lost. As extra humiliation for losing, in most games, a Guard (usually Animal) will blast the losing contestants with a fire hose.

==W==
*'''Walk The Plank''': This game is only played in couples' and family special episodes. There is a row of ten planks floating in a lake. The pairs need to cross the water by stepping from one plank to another. The two contestants have to step on opposite ends of the planks. If weight is just put on just one side of a plank it will tip up; so the contestants need to step onto each plank at the same time as each other to keep it balanced. If the pair make it to the platform at the end of the row of planks, without falling in the water, they win the game. 
*'''Wet Paint''': At the beginning of the game the General spins a wheel, which has ten (eight, the second time the game was played) different kanji characters on it. The contestant fires a crossbow at the wheel as it is spinning. The character that the arrow hits is the one they'll have to draw. Now, the contestant has to pick up a giant brush that has been dipped in paint. On the whistle, the contestant has to run up a slippery slope to reach a white square - in which they have to draw their character. They only have 30 seconds to do this in. If they slip back down, the contestant can keep running back up until they have finished drawing or the time has run out. If the contestant manages to complete the character within the 30 seconds they win, and move onto the next game. If they don't manage to draw it in time the contestant loses and Strong and Kibaji, who are standing at the top of the slope, will wash the drawing, and the contestant, away. 
*'''Whack The Stack''': 'Whack the Stack' is only played in family special episodes. The child sits on top of a stack of three big disks, while the parent stands at the side with a giant mallet. The parent has to first whack the middle disk so that it flies out from the stack. The child needs to jump up as their parent hits the disk - letting it move out without taking the one above with it. If they manage to do this successfully, the top disk will drop down onto the bottom disk and the child will end up back on top. Next, the parent has to knock out the bottom disk. Again the child needs to jump at the right time to allow this to happen. If they get it right again there will just be one disk left, with their child sitting on top, and the pair will have won the game. If the tower falls over, or the child falls off at any time, the game is over and the pair has lost. 
*'''Wipe Out''': From the starting platform; the contestant steps onto a surfboard that circles around, above a lake, in the air. They must balance on the surfboard until they reach a big pink fish. The contestant has to jump over the fish and land back on the moving surfboard. Next, they ride it a bit further until they come to a platform. They must step up onto the platform where a guard (usually Youshichi dressed as Pocahontas) is waiting. The contestant has to quickly get to the other side of the platform and, as soon as the surfboard comes out form underneath, step back onto it. If they don't get back on the board the guard will throw the contestant off, into the water, and out of the game. Once back on the surfboard the contestant has to jump over a second fish, land back on the board again, and then finally leap off onto the finishing platform. If the contestant makes it onto the finish platform they have won the game; but if they fall into the water at anytime they lose. In the couples' version the man completes the first half of the game while the woman waits on the guard's platform. The man has to reach the platform and tag his partner so she can jump onto the board and finish the game.

==Y==
*'''Yellow Brick Road''': There is a row of five doors. The contestant has to choose one of these and go through.  Through the door is a yellow path, which the contestant must follow until they reach a junction with another road leading off of it. Now they have to cross over onto this adjoining path. The contestant has to keep doing this; following the paths and changing direction at every junction they come to, until they reach one of five slides. Now they have to climb up the steps, being chased by Strong and Kibaji to speed them up, and go down the slide.  One of the slides leads to dry land, Hawaiian dancers and the next game. The other four will drop the contestants into pits of mud. If the contestant has ended up at the right slide, they will have won and will be congratulated upon their arrival at the bottom. However, if they've gone down a wrong slide they'll end up deep in a pit of mud and have lost the game.

==End Games==
* '''Show Down''': In Version 1 The contestants that have chosen a safe hole in 'Final Fall' follow the underground tunnel and come out of a hole in the ground in front of the castle. Each contestant is armed with a water pistol and has a paper ring stuck on their helmet.  When the General gives the command, all the contestants have to rush over to the castle, cross the drawbridge, and try to storm it. Their aim is to reach Takeshi at the top of the castle. However, to stop them getting to the top, the Guards are positioned all around the castle. They also have water pistols and rings on their helmets. On their way up, the contestants need to protect their rings to stop the Guards shooting them with their water pistols. If a contestant's ring gets broken they are out of the game and have to leave the castle. The contestants can fight back though. If they break a Guard's ring he cannot shoot anymore.  If any contestant manages to reach the top of the castle, with their ring in tact, they have to try and break Takeshi's own ring to win. Originally Takeshi's ring was also on his helmet, but was much smaller than anyone else's and therefore harder to hit. He then moved into a wheeled turret, with his ring stuck on top of its roof. It is now much bigger than before, but the turret constantly slides from side-to-side making it harder to hit.  If Takeshi's ring is broken the castle has been stormed and the contestant, and the General, has won. But if all the contestants have their rings broken it's the end of the game, and the General and his army have lost. In Version 2 The contestants that have chosen a safe hole in 'Final Fall' follow the underground tunnel and come out the pipe in front of the castle. They then go and board a motorised cart each (or, if there are a lot of contestants through, some must share a cart). Each cart has a paper ring on the front, and every contestant is armed with a water pistol. On the opposite side of the "car park" to the contestants are the Guards. They share five carts of their own, which also have a ring on the front. There are usually two or three Guards in one cart, and every guard has a water pistol. There is one other cart on the Guards' side – Takeshi's cart. Takeshi's cart is much bigger than everyone else's, but also has a ring on the front. The water pistol in this cart is also much bigger and much more powerful than the others. On the General's command the game begins, and the contestants and Guards drive into battle. The contestants' aim is to break the ring on the front of Takeshi's cart with their water pistols, but they need to avoid having their own ring broken in the process. The Guards try to stop the contestants succeeding by aiming at their rings. If a contestant's ring is broken they are out of the game, and have to stop. The contestants can fight back though. If they break a ring on a Guards' cart, that cart has to stop. If a contestant manages to break the ring on the front of Takeshi's cart, the contestant, and the General, wins the game. But, if all the contestants have their rings broken it's the end of the game and the General and his army have lost. In the later episodes the water pistols and rings are replaced with laser guns and sensors. Instead of having a bigger gun, Takeshi's cart now has two regular laser guns. Exactly the same rules as before apply. If a sensor on the front of a cart gets hit, the cart goes up in smoke, and they're out of the game. Again, the contestants have to aim for the sensor on the front of Takeshi's cart. If they manage to hit it the contestant, and the General, wins the game. But if the Guards hit all the contestant's sensors first, the General and his army have lost. In the laser version the General also takes part in his own special cart. If he manages to hit Takeshi's sensor, without having his own sensor hit first, the game is won. In family and couples' specials both contestants in a pair ride in the same cart. One of them drives while the other shoots. Takeshi sometimes tries out different tactics. For example; only sending in one cart at a time, sending out a guard dressed as a cart (complete with sensor and laser gun) to run around shooting, and even sitting in an aeroplane high in the air. When Takeshi is in his plane he can shoot the contestants' sensors down on the ground with his laser gun, but he doesn't have a sensor himself so cannot be stopped. As always, the contestants have to aim for the sensor on his usual big cart, which is still being driven around below, to win. 
*'''Ultimate Showdown''': The 'Ultimate Showdown' is the last game in the obstacle course special episode. When the General blows his whistle, the contestant first has to run through a long pit of thick mud - pushing through hanging mats as they go. Next it's over to 'Skipping Stones', where they have to cross the lake as usual – stepping from one stone to another, trying to avoid the sinking ones. If the contestant falls off they're allowed to swim to the end. Next they have to use a rope to swing over 'Dragon Lake', landing on a platform in the middle. If they miss the platform they can again just swim to the edge and carry on. After this, they have to push a big ball up the 'Uphill Garden' hill and then run over to 'Bridge Ball'. As normal, the contestant has to cross the wobbly bridge while Kibaji and Jo shoot balls at them - this time from two cannons. There is no golden ball to carry. If the contestant falls off at any time they must go back to the start of the bridge and try again. This is the only obstacle that has to be completed properly. After crossing the bridge it's a dash over to the bottom of the 'Rice Bowl' hill. Here the contestant has to strap a big wind-catcher on their back and climb up the hill while a giant fan is blowing towards them. Once at the top of the hill the contestant has to take off the wind-catcher, run all the way back down and then over to the finish line in front of the castle.  The fastest man and fastest woman to complete the course each win a million yen.

The '''''Little Blue Light''''' ({{lang-ru|Голубой огонёк}}, ''Goluboy ogonyok'') was a popular musical [[variety show]] aired on [[Television in the Soviet Union|Soviet television]] since 1962 during  [[Public holidays in the Soviet Union|various holidays]]. The name alludes to the light bluish glare of a [[monochrome|black-and-white]] [[cathode ray tube]] TV screen as well as some traditional Russian expressions relating to friendly visits: заглянуть на огонек (''zaglyanut na ogonyok'') – "to drop in on a light", i. e. to visit someone after seeing a light in their window; посидеть у огонька (''posidyet' u ogon'ka'') – to have a sit by the fire.

The show featured popular artists and various prominent Soviet people: ''[[udarnik]]s'', [[Heroes of Socialist Labor]], [[cosmonaut]]s etc., who sat by the tables in a "TV cafeteria", singing songs, playing sketches, boasting, celebrating the holiday. The idea of the show was that they "dropped in on a light" to every Soviet family to share the festive table beyond the TV glass.

The best-known was the '''''New Year's Little Blue Light''''' ({{lang-ru|Новогодний Голубой огонек}}, ''Novogodniy Goluboy ogonyok''), aired on every [[New Year's Eve]] as a part of the late Soviet tradition: the ''Little Blue Light'' followed the [[New Year's speech]] by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] with congratulations to the [[Soviet people]] followed by the Kremlin midnight chimes and the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]], which was, in turn, preceded by the 1975 film comedy ''[[Irony of Fate]]''.

The ''Little Blue Light'' was devised by [[film director]] [[Aleksey Gabrilovich]], and the first show was aired on 6 April 1962 as a weekly Saturday broadcast. After some time it became a monthly show, and later it was only aired on major holidays.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the ''Little Blue Light'' was revived in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.rtr-planeta.com/prog?rubric_id=985&amp;brand_id=14241 The New Year Little Blue Light at Shabolovka - 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111212030/http://rtr-planeta.com/prog?rubric_id=985&amp;brand_id=14241 |date=2005-01-11 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[trademark]] "Little Blue Light" is now owned by [[Russia 1]], the [[television network]], where it is still seen today. 

In the 1980s the typical New Year's LBL episode lasted an hour and a half, today the telecast begins at 12:05 am MST and lasts for a whole 3 hours.

'''Minnie Emmett''' was a singer and pioneer recording artist active in New York in the 1890s and 1900s. She was not the first woman to make commercial records, but was the first to gain prominence and influence in the field. A July 1898 article in ''Phonoscope'' called her "the most successful and the most popular woman engaged in record making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gallery of Talent Employed for Making Records|journal=Phonoscope|date=July 1898|volume=2|issue=7|page=13|url=https://archive.org/stream/phonoscope13hunt#page/n313/mode/1up|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first recordings, published by the [[United States Phonograph Company]] in 1894 or 1895, were advertised as "the first true records of a high soprano voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of Standard New Jersey Records for the Phonograph|date=c. 1894|publisher=United States Phonograph Co.|location=Newark, N.J.|page=58|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/46bd0510-e01b-0130-1dec-58d385a7b928/book#page/65/mode/2up|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sang popular sentimental and comic songs like "Sweet Marie" and "The Sunshine of Paradise Alley" and remained in the [[United States Phonograph Company|United States]] catalog until joining the [[Columbia Phonograph Company]] in 1898 and adding operatic solos and duets (with Roger Harding) and older standards (Ben Bolt, [[Robin Adair]], [[Stephen Collins Foster|Foster's]] songs) to her repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenz|first1=Kenneth|title=Two-minute Brown Wax and XP Cylinder Records of the Columbia Phonograph Company|date=1981|publisher=Kastlemusick|url=https://archive.org/details/KastlemusickColumbiaCylinders}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued recording into the early 1900s, making discs for [[Columbia Phonograph Company|Columbia]] and [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] of similar material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnie Emmett (vocalist : soprano vocal)|url=http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/6374/Emmett_Minnie_vocalist_soprano_vocal|website=Discography of American Historical Recordings|publisher=UC Santa Barbara|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded a few cylinders for the [[U.S. Everlasting Records|U.S. Everlasting]] company around 1910.

The {{nihongo|'''Okawa Museum of Art'''|大川美術館|Ōkawa Bijutsukan}} is an art gallery in [[Kiryū, Gunma|Kiryū]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], [[Japan]] that concentrates on modern Japanese art.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, the material in this article comes from ''Zenkoku bijutsukan gaido'' ({{nihongo2|全国美術館ガイド}}; Tokyo: Bijutsu Shuppansha, 2006; {{ISBN|4-568-43066-6}}), p.102. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery, which opened in April 1989, presents the collection of the businessman and writer [[Eiji Ōkawa]] ({{nihongo2|大川栄ニ}}, 1924&amp;ndash;2008), who was born in Kiryū, and has about 6500 items. At its core are about eighty works by [[Shunsuke Matsumoto]] ({{nihongo2|松本竣介}}) and [[Hideo Noda]] ({{nihongo2|野田英夫}}); there are many works by other artists associated with these two. The gallery also has a hundred sketches by [[Takeji Fujishima]] ({{nihongo2|藤島武二}}) and two hundred drawings by [[Toshi Shimizu]] ({{nihongo2|清水登之}}).

The museum has exhibitions, which are not limited to Japanese art. For example, in early 1990 it held an exhibition of [[Ben Shahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiryu.co.jp/ohkawamuseum/exhibitionpast01.htm List of past exhibitions], Okawa Museum of Art. {{ja icon}} Accessed 11 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Rendell]] in July 2004.&lt;ref name="bizjournal"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Rendell signs film production tax credit law |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]] |date=July 21, 2004  |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2004/07/19/daily26.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax credit for qualifying productions equals a 25% reduction in Personal Income Tax, Corporate Net Income, Capital Stock/Foreign Franchise Tax.&lt;ref name=revenue /&gt;  However, because most productions filming in Pennsylvania do not incur a tax liability in the state, the credits are fully transferable, which means they can be sold to a company or individual in the state who does have a tax liability. In order to qualify for the tax credit, the production must incur 60% of its total production expenses within Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=revenue&gt;{{cite web| title = Film production Tax Credit | work =  September/October 2004, No. 111 | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Revenue]]| date = 2004-10-25 | url = http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/cwp/view.asp?A=104&amp;Q=237674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credit also applies to individual television shows that are 15 minutes or longer and intended for a national audience.&lt;ref name="bizjournal"/&gt;

Watchdogs, including the [[Common Cause|Pennsylvania Common Cause]] criticized lobbyist Leslie McCombs for failing to properly register as a lobbyist for [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] while lobbying on behalf of the tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bumsted| first = Brad| authorlink= Brad Bumsted| title = Lobbyist cites 'oversight' in registration snafu| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Tribune Review]]| date = September 5, 2007  | url = http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/enterprise2006/s_525748.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 report from the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee in the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] found that the tax credit supported 4,000 jobs and produced  $4.5 million between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Report: Pa.

During the [[Pennsylvania budget impasses|2009 Pennsylvania budget impasse]], the tax credit was in danger of being repealed.&lt;ref name=reduced /&gt; Instead, its total amount was reduced from $75 million to $42 million, with that number increasing to $60 million the next year.&lt;ref name=reduced&gt;{{cite news | last = Schooley| first = Tim | title = Pennsylvania film tax credit reduced in 2010 budget, but survives| newspaper = [[Philadelphia Business Journal]]| publisher = American City Business Journals, Inc.| date = October 13, 2009| url = http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/10/12/daily12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credit was expanded again during the state budget negotiations in summer 2016. $65 million will be available for fiscal year 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;Gigler, Dan,(July 13, 2016) [http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2016/07/13/State-Senate-expands-film-tax-credit-program-by-5-million/stories/201607130221 "Pennsylvania Senate Expands Film Tax Credit Program by $5 Million"], Pittsburgh ''Post-Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax credit brought the production of ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]'', ''[[The Road (2009 film)|The Road]]'', ''[[Shelter (2009 film)|Shelter]]'', ''[[Shannon's Rainbow]]'', ''[[Sorority Row]]'', and ''[[She's Out of My League]]'' to the [[Pittsburgh]] region in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tax credits could end up on cutting room floor |first1=Barbara |last1=Vancheri |first2=Rob |last2=Owen |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=February 21, 2009  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09052/950779-454.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of filming for ''[[I Am Number Four (film)|I Am Number Four]]'' also took place in the greater Pittsburgh area in 2010 due to the tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The East at a glance |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=May 20, 2010 |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10140/1059378-56.stm |accessdate=January 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vandergrift"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vandergrift's architecture lures big-budget film |first=Tom |last=Yerace |newspaper=[[Valley News Dispatch]] |date=April 6, 2010 |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_675095.html |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104103634/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_675095.html |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ra.One''''' is a 2011 Indian [[superhero film]] directed by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and starring Armaan Verma, [[Kareena Kapoor]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Arjun Rampal]], [[Shahana Goswami]] and [[Tom Wu]] in pivotal roles. The script, written by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and [[Kanika Dhillon]], originated as an idea that [[Anubhav Sinha]] got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a [[Motion controller|motion sensor]]-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.

[[Principal photography]] began in March 2010 and took place in [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and was overseen by an international crew. The [[post-production]] involved [[stereoscopy|3-D conversion]] and the application of [[visual effects]], the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among [[Cinema of India|Indian films]]. With a budget of {{INRConvert|150|c|year=2011}},&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/despite-rs-170cr-income-ra-one-not-a-hit/story-yw7lvEwuItuSwHIIBGpFyI.html&lt;/ref&gt; inclusive of publicity costs, ''Ra.One'' was the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Indian film]] at the time of release surpassing the {{INRConvert|132|c|year=2010}} budget of ''[[Enthiran]]''. The producers spent {{INRConvert|130|c|year=2011}} out of a {{INRConvert|52|c|year=2011}} marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and [[viral marketing]].

The film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, ''Ra.One'' was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day [[Diwali]] weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions, with three international premieres being held between 24 &amp; 26 October 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.

Upon release, ''Ra.One'' received mixed reviews, with critics praising the visuals and music, but criticising the script and direction. Commercially, the film became the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 domestically, the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records, though it managed to sustain at the box office after its extended opening weekend. As the film earned more than Rs 170 crores it was considered a Box office Hit&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=28 Ra.One Box Office India]&lt;/ref&gt; and a superhit film as the distributors recovered their investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despite Rs 170 cr income, RA.One not a hit?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/despite-rs-170cr-income-ra-one-not-a-hit/story-yw7lvEwuItuSwHIIBGpFyI.html|website=hindustantimes.com|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects, notably one [[59th National Film Awards|National Film Award]], one [[57th Filmfare Awards|Filmfare Award]] and four [[International Indian Film Academy Awards]].

==Plot==
Aanusmita Sharma ([[Shahana Goswami]]), an employee of London-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices.
Shekhar Subramanium ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), a game designer who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered a number of commercial failures; an irate Barron ([[Dalip Tahil]]) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek ([[Armaan Verma]]), and upon the request of his wife Sonia ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the [[antagonist]] should be more powerful than the [[protagonist]]. His colleague, [[computer programmer]] Aanusmita uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) (Technically ''Good One'' and in Hindi ''Jeevan'', which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically ''Random Access Version One'' and in Hindi ''[[Ravana|Ravan]]'', an ancient demon king)&lt;ref name=sss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |title=''Ra.One'' fails to impress |publisher=''Mid-Day'' |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |author=Shetty-Shah, Shubha |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DcAXtGs?url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend, Aakaashi ([[Tom Wu]]), implements the characters' movements. The game, named ''Ra.One'', contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the ''H.A.R.T'' (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.

When ''Ra.One'' undergoes final tests, Aakaashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID ''Lucifer'' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Aakaashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] to malfunction. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One meanwhile, and Ra.One assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his [[identity card]]. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.

Sonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Aanusmita of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world.  Having killed Aakaashi's mother viciously at her house and assumed and accepted Aakaashi's guise to mask his intentions, Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia  on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.

Subsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model ([[Arjun Rampal]]), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form (having previously impersonated Aakaashi) to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning [[Mumbai Suburban Railway|local train]]. The train crashes into the [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]], but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: "''If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you''". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears.

Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek manages to restore G.One to the real world.

''Ra.One'' was submitted to the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating. The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts. The police and the [[Indian Railways]] security force had made similar objections to the train-based stunts in the film, claiming that youngsters would "blindly imitate them" and hence put their lives at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_ra-one-rubs-mumbai-s-railway-cops-the-wrong-way_1606199 |title=''Ra.One'' rubs Mumbai's railway cops the wrong way |publisher=''Daily News and Analysis'' |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2012 |author=Aklekar, Rajendra |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yJ0S2F?url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_ra-one-rubs-mumbai-s-railway-cops-the-wrong-way_1606199 |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally passed with a [[U (Central Board of Film Certification)|'U' certificate]] without cuts, but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown, stating that the stunts were computer-generated and should not be imitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.com/news/entertainment/raonepasses-the-censor-board-scrutiny-but-20954029-in-1.html |title=''Ra.One'' passes the Censor Board scrutiny, but&amp;nbsp;.. |publisher=In.com |work=Mid-Day |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yFw5cc?url=http://www.in.com/news/entertainment/raonepasses-the-censor-board-scrutiny-but-20954029-in-1.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Board of Film Classification]] rated the film [[British Board of Film Classification#Current certificates|12A]] for "moderate fantasy violence".&lt;ref name=brate /&gt; In March 2012, a ''[[Mid-Day]]'' report alleged that ''Ra.One'' had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2012/mar/170312-Bollywood-Change-in-Censor-Board-panel-irks-Bollywood.htm |title=Change in Censor Board panel irks Bollywood |publisher=''Mid-Day'' |date=17 March 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |author=Kotwani, Hiren |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yLxlvp?url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2012/mar/170312-Bollywood-Change-in-Censor-Board-panel-irks-Bollywood.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism allegations===
The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), the ''[[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan trilogy|Batman]]'' series, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (2010) and ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-raones-inspirations/20110919.htm |title=Has ''Ra.One'' been inspired from this? |publisher=Rediff |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67EVB1kKl?url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-raones-inspirations/20110919.htm |archivedate=27 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Ra.One'' includes a tribute to Rajinikanth |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/RA-One-includes-a-tribute-to-Rajinikanth/Article1-745104.aspx |work=[[Press Trust of India]] |publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]'' |accessdate=13 September 2011 |date=13 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yUfzf5?url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/RA-One-includes-a-tribute-to-Rajinikanth/Article1-745104.aspx |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan denied the allegations, saying, "I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original. In fact, ''Ra.One'' will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Indo-Asian News Service |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/raone-superhero-is-a-family-man-says-srk/193359-8-66.html |publisher=CNN-IBN |title=''Ra.One'' superhero is a family man, says SRK |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67NjpCj1u?url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/raone-superhero-is-a-family-man-says-srk/193359-8-66.html |archivedate= 3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that ''Ra.One'' resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. Patnaik appealed to the [[Bombay High Court]] to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/mumbai/30305855_1_tv-writer-advocates-copyright |author=Thomas, Shibu |title=TV writer seeks stay on ''Ra.One'' |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yaDj8T?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/mumbai/30305855_1_tv-writer-advocates-copyright |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, observing ''prima facie'' evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit {{INRConvert|10|m}} with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film.

===Hacking===
''Ra.One'' also faced cybertheft and hacking issues. On 3 June 2011, three days after its launch, the official website of the film was hacked by suspected Pakistani cyber criminals who stated that the act was in revenge for a similar attack on a [[Karachi]] press club website. The hackers defaced the homepage and left a note threatening the Indian Press Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_shah-rukh-khan-s-ra-one-websites-hacked_1550520 |author=Singh, Divyesh |title=Shahrukh Khan's ''Ra.One'' website hacked |publisher=''[[Daily News and Analysis]]'' |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yWr6js?url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_shah-rukh-khan-s-ra-one-websites-hacked_1550520 |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite precautions, the song "Chammak Challo" was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack.

{{quote box|quote="A film like this requires a year-and-a-half of pre-production, so it's impossible for me to give you a time frame.

Reports of a planned sequel of ''Ra.One'' began surfacing prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted that it would be "presumptuous" to start the sequel before the first film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/SRK-planning-to-make-RA-One-sequel/Article1-754168.aspx |title=SRK planning to make ''Ra.One'' sequel |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |author=Mehta, Shweta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AE7LzBn?url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/SRK-planning-to-make-RA-One-sequel/Article1-754168.aspx |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-05/news-interviews/30363639_1_raone-superhero-film-sequel |title=No plans for ''Ra.One'' sequel: SRK |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AEBgGhx?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-05/news-interviews/30363639_1_raone-superhero-film-sequel |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Ra.One'' won a National Award, an "overjoyed" Khan said that the film's world could be further explored. He stated that the sequel, if made, would be titled ''G.One'' and not ''Ra.Two'', and that he would make it "faster, bigger and better" than ''Ra.One''.&lt;ref name="rrr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/srk-planning-ra-one-sequel_99393.htm |title=SRK planning ''Ra.One'' sequel? |publisher=Zee News |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AEGpu0m?url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/srk-planning-ra-one-sequel_99393.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan was reported to be looking for a script, without a fixed release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Shah-Rukh-Khan-game-for-RA-One-sequel/Article1-823234.aspx |title=Shahrukh Khan game for ''Ra.One'' sequel |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |author=Bhattacharya, Roshmila |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AEEHIES?url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Shah-Rukh-Khan-game-for-RA-One-sequel/Article1-823234.aspx |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Mushtaq Sheikh said that the pre-production of the sequel had begun.&lt;ref name="rrr" /&gt; A number of reports stated that Kareena Kapoor would not be a part of the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-07/news-interviews/30482229_1_raone-sequel-chammak-challo |title=Kareena Kapoor will not be a part of ''Ra.One'' sequel |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AEJcYVM?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-07/news-interviews/30482229_1_raone-sequel-chammak-challo |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Khan's enthusiasm for the idea of a sequel, the film industry expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker [[Rajkumar Gupta]] commented, "It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier." Producer [[Ramesh Taurani]] responded negatively to the idea, saying, "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel "a bad idea." Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer [[Goldie Behl]] brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, "If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." Director [[Kunal Kohli]] also reacted positively, saying, "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?"&lt;ref name="seq" /&gt;

'''''Rampage Puzzle Attack''''' is a puzzle game for [[Game Boy Advance]], developed by [[Finland|Finnish]] development house [[Ninai Games]] and published by [[Midway Games]].

The game is a clone of the puzzle game ''[[Drop Mania]]'' and based on the ''[[Rampage (video game)|Rampage]]'' characters. At the beginning of the game, the three characters from the original game, George, Lizzie and Ralph, are available, but more characters who appeared in other games of the series can be unlocked through the Rescue mode. The characters appear on screen during the game play, climbing the side of the play arena or being caged at the bottom. 

The game uses [[password (video games)|password save]].

It was the first console game to be developed in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grönholm|first=Tuukka|date=February 2002|title=Rampage Puzzle Attack|url=http://www.pelit.fi/index.php?id=62456|journal=[[Pelit]]|issue=2/2002|accessdate=May 17, 2007}} (Note: Web archive only available for magazine subscribers)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

Gameplay-wise, the game is similar to Ninai's earlier games in ''[[Drop Mania]]'' series. Some other games it could be compared to are ''[[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo]]'' and related games.

The basic idea is that the player drops two colored blocks at a time to the playfield. The blocks then merge into contiguous areas. When the player drops a flashing "detoblock" of matching color to touch the area, the entire area is removed and scored. This can lead to chains and combos, and to higher scores.

The game includes a single- and two-player modes. The following modes are available in single-player:
* '''Clear mode''' - Includes various areas that need to be cleared to advance to the next level.
* '''Puzzle mode''' - Similar to Clear mode, but there are only a limited number of blocks.
* '''Rescue mode''' - A cage is added to the bottom of the playfield, and the idea is to remove the blocks on top before the time runs out.
* '''Marathon mode''' - There's no set conditions of win, the game continues until it's impossible to keep going.

Two-player modes include '''Rescue mode''', '''Score mode''' (competition for higher score) and '''Attack mode'''.

'''''Rise of the Triad''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[Interceptor Entertainment]] and published by [[Apogee Software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2013. The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the original ''[[Rise of the Triad|Rise of the Triad: Dark War]]'' published by Apogee in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/08/07/unleashing-ludicrous-gibs-in-the-rise-of-the-triad-revival/|title=Unleashing ludicrous gibs in the Rise of the Triad revival|last=Peele|first=Britton|date=7 August 2012|website=Engadget (Joystiq)|publisher=Oath Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}

The gameplay has been touted as a throwback to classic first-person shooters of the 1990s such as the original ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''. It features non-linear level design, a high rate of player movespeed, multiple playable characters and an arsenal of over the top explosive weaponry recreated from the original game. The game consists of 20 levels (plus four secret levels) spread across four episodes as well as an online multiplayer component which features Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}

The plot is nearly identical to that of the original ''Rise of the Triad: Dark War'' wherein a team of special operatives, known as the H.U.N.T. (High-risk United Nations Task-force) is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate terrorist activity taking place. When their boat is destroyed by patrols, the team soon learns that the 'Triad' cult plans to nuke nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return from whence they came, are left to fight their way into the heart of the island to put a stop to the Triad's activities once and for all.

==Development==
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}

Development of ''Rise of the Triad'' began in January 2012. Originally planned as an HD remake,  [[Interceptor Entertainment]] instead decided to assemble a global virtual team to begin a full re-imagining of the original. The game was revealed for the first time at [[QuakeCon]] 2012 and released one year later at QuakeCon 2013. It is said development was completed on an extremely tight budget and that much of said budget went toward acquiring licenses for [[Apogee Software]]'s ''Rise of the Triad'' IP and [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 3]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Robopet.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Robopet]] --&gt;
The '''Robopet''' is a [[robotic]] dog produced by [[Wow Wee|WowWee]] that is based on the [[biomorphic]] work of [[Mark Tilden|Mark W. Tilden]]. The Robopet has IR, audio and tilt [[sensors]] and is able to wander around [[autonomous]]ly detecting and reacting to objects and sounds. It also performs random 'tricks' such as howling, begging, rolling over and playing dead.

== Hardware and software ==
The Robopet has 5 equal custom [[gearboxes]] using 2 and 3 bit position [[switches]]. The robot runs from a single [[Microprocessor|processor]] [[Circuit Board|board]] in its back and is controlled by autonomous routines and IR ([[Infrared]]) [[Signal (electronics)|signals]] from a thirteen button [[remote control]]. The [[CPU]] is a custom-designed 16bit [[RISC]] processor with 512k  of built in sound and 12k of program space and 128 bytes of onboard RAM.

The [[software]] code is 12k of [[assembly language]] based around an [[operating system]] written in the 1980s by the inventor, Mark Tilden.
The robopet operates on 4 batteries, while the remote needs 3 batteries.

== Features and tricks ==
When left by itself for a few seconds, the Robopet enters its autonomous mode and starts exploring the room, responding to I/R reflected signals from objects and the floor.  

The tricks that Robopet performs are: roll over, play dead, howl, paw, relief, jump, "whoops", rock and scratch. These can be activated by the user via the remote control and are [[randomly]] performed by the Robopet when in its autonomous mode.

The Robopet also features an edge-detection mode which has to be either on or off via the power switch, so it can be placed on a table without falling off.

The 2 axis tilt internal sensor detects whether the robot has fallen over, and it can automatically right itself.

==Colors and special editions==
Robopet is available in yellow ,white, pink, blue, purple, and black. A special "Signature Series" [[Sharper Image]] edition was released, sporting a metallic red color.  Furthermore, a special "Bulldog" version, sporting a re-sculpted head and painted on eyes, was created for sale at [[RadioShack]] stores.

In 2007, after the release of new robots, RoboPets were repackaged to include Mini RoboPets. The Mini RoboPets wind-up and walk. 

(Problems)
RoboPets are extremely Fragile, Legs easily fall off or the plastic chips and breaks over time.
Gearboxes were easily Jammed up.
On the First edition of roboPet the legs were protected just by springs so the legs would fall off

== Programming ==
Like the other WowWee products to date, the Robopet can be [[Computer program|programmed]]. It has 9 remote-control accessible tricks and 5 direction  functions (forward, backward, left, right, and stop) which can be sequentially placed into a 20 step program. 

It also features "Good Dog" and "Bad Dog" buttons which either encourages or discourages it from performing recent "tricks".

'''''Samsara''''' is a 2011 American [[non-narrative film|non-narrative]] [[documentary film]], directed by [[Ron Fricke]] and produced by Mark Magidson, who also collaborated on ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992), a film of a similar vein. ''Samsara'' was filmed over five years in 25 countries around the world. It was shot in [[70 mm film|70 mm]] format and output to digital format. The film premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] and received a [[limited release]] in August 2012.

==Synopsis==

The official website describes the film, "Expanding on the themes they developed in ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) and ''[[Chronos (film)|Chronos]]'' (1985), ''Samsara'' explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of humanity's spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, [[guided meditation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://barakasamsara.com/samsara/about | title = About Samsara | publisher=barakasamsara.com | accessdate=September 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

''Samsara'' is directed by [[Ron Fricke]] and produced by Mark Magidson. The pair had collaborated on ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) and reunited in 2006 to plan ''Samsara''. They researched locations that would fit the conceptual imagery of [[saṃsāra]], to them "meaning 'birth, death and rebirth' or 'impermanence'". They gathered research from people's works and photo books as well as the Internet and [[YouTube]], resources not available at the time of planning ''Baraka''.&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;{{cite news | last=Douglas | first=Edward | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=93727 | title=Interview: The Filmmakers Behind ''Samsara'' | work=[[ComingSoon.net]] | date=August 21, 2012 | accessdate=September 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They considered using digital cameras but decided to film in [[70 mm film|70 mm]] instead, considering its quality superior.&lt;ref name="portrait"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rapold | first=Nicolas | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/movies/samsara-ron-frickes-cinematic-portrait-of-the-globe.html | title=Planetary Poetry, Woven Into a Movie | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricke and Magidson began filming ''Samsara'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hayes | first=Dade | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965240 | title=Fricke directs 'Baraka' sequel | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming lasted for more than four years and took place in 25 countries across five continents.&lt;ref name="nabs"&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118051456 | title=Oscilloscope Labs nabs doc 'Samsara' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years into filming, the pair began assembling the film and editing it. They pursued several [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] shoots to augment the final product.&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt;

The crew used three 70&amp;nbsp;mm cameras for filming; two cameras manufactured by [[Panavision]] and one specialty [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse camera]] designed by Fricke. While the scenes were captured on [[70 mm film|65 mm]] negative film, they were output to [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP), a digital output. Magidson described the process, "We're doing a combination of what we think is the best of both technologies, the best way to image capture and then the best way to output. Once we get into the digital environment, we're able to refine the imagery, we're able to save shots that we'd have to otherwise trash really for various reasons." Where they cut their negatives for ''Baraka'', the negatives for ''Samsara'' were scanned then worked on digitally. The pair used the [[Telecine]] process to format the film to [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]] for the editing process and used [[Final Cut Pro|Final Cut]] for editing.&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt;

The crew filmed from a bird's-eye view a scene of pilgrims surrounding the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca|Mecca, Saudi Arabia]]. A 40-floor building was recently constructed next to the mosque that surrounded the Kaaba, so the filmmakers were able to film the pilgrims with permission of the building's owner.&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt;

===Music=== 
The film's music was composed by [[Michael Stearns]], [[Lisa Gerrard]], and Marcello De Francisci. Stearns collaborated with the filmmakers on ''Baraka'' and ''Chronos'', and Gerrard also collaborated with them on ''Baraka''. Unlike ''Baraka'', ''Samsara'' was edited without music, and the composers worked on numerous sequences as separate pieces. The filmmakers then connected the sequences. Magidson explained of the pieces, "It's a piece of music you can listen to as music as well that interprets their feelings to know that imagery in that sequence visually, so they're kind of interpreting it musically." The scoring process lasted between six and seven months.&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt;

==Themes==

Fricke and Magidson emphasized avoiding a particular political view in assembling the film. Fricke said, "We just try to keep it in the middle and then we form little blocks of content and then we set them aside until we had enough. We did all of this without music or sound effects. We just let the image guide the flow and then we started stringing the blocks together."&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt; Nicolas Rapold of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Samsara's lack of a specific message is "a departure from similarly expansive, globally conscious nonfiction films in vogue now, like the critically acclaimed work of [[Michael Glawogger]] ('[[Workingman's Death]],' which depicts the same sulfur mines as 'Samsara') and [[Nikolaus Geyrhalter]] ('[[Abendland]]') that also serve as probing sociological critique."&lt;ref&gt;Rapold, Nicolas. "Planetary Poetry, Women into a Movie: 'Samsara,' Ron Fricke's Cinematic Portrait of the Globe." New York Times. ''NYTimes.com'', 17 Aug. 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/movies/samsara-ron-frickes-cinematic-portrait-of-the-globe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

''Samsara'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2011. In March 2012, [[Oscilloscope (company)|Oscilloscope Laboratories]] acquired the rights to distribute ''Samsara'' in the United States.&lt;ref name="nabs" /&gt; The film had a limited release in two theaters on {{nowrap|August 24}}, 2012. By its fifth weekend (September&amp;nbsp;14–16), ''Samsara'' had expanded to 60 theaters and achieved the highest-grossing documentary release of 2012.&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/specialty-box-office-sleepwalk-samsara-among-years-best-indie-debuts-obamas-america-soars-to-overall-top-5 | title=Specialty Box Office: 'Sleepwalk,' 'Samsara' Among Year's Best Indie Debuts; 'Obama's America' Soars To Overall Top 10 | publisher=[[IndieWire]] | accessdate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{nowrap|October 14}}, distributor Oscilloscope Laboratories announced that at $1.8 million in box office earnings, ''Samsara'' had become the highest-grossing film in Oscilloscope's (relatively short) history.&lt;ref name="oscope"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscilloscope.net/?p=798 | title=HIT DOCUMENTARY SAMSARA BECOMES OSCILLOSCOPE’S HIGHEST-GROSSING FILM EVER THEATRICALLY | publisher=[[Oscilloscope Laboratories]] | accessdate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 77% based on reviews from 77 critics and reports a rating average of 7 out of 10. It reports the critics' consensus that "it's a tad heavy-handed in its message, but Samsara's overwhelmingly beautiful visuals more than compensate for any narrative flaws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/samsara_2012/ | title=Samsara | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 65% based on 23 reviews, reflecting "generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/samsara | title=Samsara Reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]], reviewing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', called ''Samsara'' "as frustrating as it is beautiful." Turan expressed frustration that the filmmakers did not name the more obscure locations, such as the [[Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center]] in the Philippines. The critic also took issue with some of the film's "disconcerting" images. Turan concluded, "Some of the connections made are too obvious, like following images of ammunition with a portrait of a severely wounded veteran, while others are completely elusive. Shots of the devastation Katrina left behind in New Orleans are beautifully spooky, but does it say anything useful to follow that with images of Versailles? The makers of 'Samsara' want to free our minds, but their technique makes us their prisoners more often than not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Turan | first=Kenneth | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-samsara-review-20120831,0,2338594.story | title=Review: 'Samsara' is a frustrating beauty | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=August 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] awarded ''Samsara'' a full four stars, writing that it provided "an uplifting experience" through its use "of powerful images, most magnificent, some shocking, all photographed with great care in the highest possible HD resolution." Ebert extolled the film's capturing of images of what may eventually be lost to humanity and noted that there were also images that could reflect the reason for these losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120905/REVIEWS/120909994 | title=Samsara | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=September 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katie Walsh, writing for [[indieWire]]'s ''The Playlist'', applauded ''Samsara''{{'}}s "technical achievements" and noted that the film used the "[[Soviet montage theory|intellectual montage]]" technique. Walsh said the film was similar to ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'', but took "the idea to new global and spiritual heights." She said of the film's entirety, "While one can discuss the technical prowess of these shocking and beautiful images, it doesn't do justice to the spiritual cinematic power of this work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Walsh | first=Katie | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/review-samsara-tells-the-story-of-our-world-with-stunning-visuals-spiritual-heft-20120822 | title=Review: 'Samsara' Tells The Story Of Our World With Stunning Visuals &amp; Spiritual Heft | work=The Playlist | publisher=[[indieWire]] | date=August 22, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filming locations==
''Samsara'' was filmed in nearly one hundred locations across 25 countries over the course of five years. Some locations include: [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]]/[[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Mali]], [[Burma|Myanmar]], [[Namibia]], [[Philippines]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://barakasamsara.com/samsara/locations | title = Filming Locations for Samsara | publisher=barakasamsara.com | accessdate=January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shallow diving''' is an [[extreme sport]], whereby enthusiasts attempt to [[Diving (sport)|dive]] from the greatest height into the shallowest depth of water, without sustaining injury. It is typically associated with travelling circuses along with the [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[performing animals]], [[clown]]s and other such attractions.

==Technique==
Divers aim to hit the water horizontally in a manner akin to the [[Belly flop]]. This spreads the impact over the greatest surface area, and achieves the longest time decelerating, before hitting the bottom of the container where the water is held.

==World record==
* [[Professor Splash]] (ne. Darren Taylor) successfully dove from {{convert|11.52|m|ft|disp=flip|abbr=out}} into a paddling pool of depth {{convert|30|cm|ft|disp=flip|abbr=out|sigfig=1}} breaking his record for a successive 20th time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorne|first=Dan|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/2005-highest-shallow-dive-392864 |title=w005:Highest Shallow Dive|publisher=Guinness World Records|website=guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2015-08-18 |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2016}}

[[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' film series, based on [[William Steig]]'s [[Shrek!|book of the same name]], has a large underground Internet fandom that started around 2009. With the fanbase described by some people as an ironic liking towards the series, there have been several sexually explicit memes based on [[Shrek (character)|the title character]]. The most notable example is a 2013 [[metameme]] centered on a video called "''Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life,''" which is based on a post originating on [[4chan]]'s /b/ board. Fans of Shrek are known as "Brogres", a take on the name "[[Bronies]]", the teen and adult fans of the show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]''. A "Shrek Filmmaker" movement of [[Source Filmmaker]] animators making videos based on the Internet's obsession towards the character has also occurred. According to ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', Shrek was "one of the patron saints of the elaborate and complex culture of [[Internet meme|Dank Memedom]]."&lt;ref name = "NYmag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Brian|date=July 19, 2016|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/07/meme-teen-ogre-loads-the-rnc-with-call-for-new-memes.html|title=America Inspired by Teen Protester’s Call at RNC: ‘Make Memes Great Again’|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001&amp;ndash;2012: Background and early history==
The 2001 film ''[[Shrek]]'', based on [[William Steig]]'s [[Shrek!|novel of the same name]], garnered acclaim from critics and won an Oscar, while ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004) was, at the time, the highest-grossing animated film ever at the North American box office. However, Dave Sims of ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''The Wire'' marked the second film as the start of the decline in quality and commercial success of the franchise, writing that none of the sequels was remembered due to the jokes' relying on "cheap topical gags and flimsy celebrity cameos."&lt;ref name = "TheWire"/&gt; He noted that "the joke of Shrek's mediocrity was then filtered through the Internet's many weird joke filters, which end up in a weird mix of sincerity and surrealism."&lt;ref name = "TheWire"/&gt; While fans had been creating and posting their own comics and pictures of Shrek depicted outside of the films on [[DeviantArt]] ever since ''Shrek''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 2001 release, "it took about 11 years for the Internet's Shrek obsession to go from cute to cult-like" as ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' wrote.&lt;ref name = "The Daily Dot"/&gt;

Shrek's official [[Facebook]] page was launched by [[DreamWorks]] on December 1, 2009, and was used to promote the products and spin-offs of the franchise, with the title character "speaking" to his fans through posts. These posts were very popular, garnering 1,000 to 2,000 more views than the typical promotional post at the time.&lt;ref name = "The Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alfonso III|first=Fernando|date=March 27, 2014|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/shrek-is-love-shrek-is-life-meme/|title=A history of the Internet's freakish obsession with Shrek|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the year of the release of ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', a comic on [[DeviantArt]] titled "Shadow begs Shrek” was posted by user camera, and paired Shrek with [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], a character from the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series. A [[Kotaku]] writer stated that a possible reason for the pairing was that both characters "tried to act like they were too cool for 'kid stuff.' Too sophisticated, too edgy. They were made for each other—and approximately one billion people between the ages of 12 and 34."&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, Nathan (August 8, 2016).

==2012&amp;ndash;present: ShrekChan, ''Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life''==
May 2012 marked the launch of ShrekChan, a [[4chan]]-esque [[imageboard]] for fans of Shrek to satirically and occasionally seriously comment on anything related to the ''Shrek'' series. Fans of ''Shrek'' are nicknamed "brogres", which is a take on the name of the young adult fans of ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' known as [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|bronies]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; The board had garnered 500,000 visitors as of March 22, 2014.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; In 2013, Shrek's online popularity went to what ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' described as a "whole new demented level" with a fanmade video called "''Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life.''", an adaptation of a story posted on 4chan describing a sexual encounter between a nine-year-old boy and Shrek after the boy's father reprimands him for his Shrek obsession.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; A [[metameme]] based on this was posted on 4chan's paranormal board on January 31, 2013, which led to many "deranged illustrations" posted online influenced by the post.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot" /&gt; Many duplications of the video were also uploaded, with the video and its replicas garnering over 90 million views as of May 2016.&lt;ref name="TheWire" /&gt;

On March 25, 2014, the video was a "[[Cartoon Brew]] pick",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|date=March 25, 2014|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-brew-pick/shrek-is-love-shrek-is-life-by-airplane-randy-nsfw-97759.html|title='Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life' by Airplane Randy (NSFW)|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the award was number 13 on their "Top 20 Stories of 2014" published on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amidi |first=Amid|date=December 27, 2014|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/the-top-20-stories-of-2014-on-cartoon-brew-107314.html|title=The Top 20 Stories of 2014 on Cartoon Brew|publisher=Cartoon Brew|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was also put by [[Gizmodo]] writer Ashley Feinberg's list of the "11 of the Weirdest Videos on YouTube".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feinberg|first=Ashley|date=May 30, 2014|url=https://gizmodo.com/11-of-the-weirdest-videos-on-youtube-1580781007|title=11 of the Weirdest Videos on YouTube|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ShrekChan was shut down with a message from the board's founder: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Shrek meme is dead, and it's time to stop trying to keep this going. It is inevitable and it has to happen at some point in time. Many of you who truly love the Shrek movies may think that shutting down ShrekChan is a bad idea, but I hope that you may find another website to discuss the love for Shrek.&lt;ref name = "The Week"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A "Shrek Filmmaker" movement in which [[Source Filmmaker]] animators made videos based on the Internet's obsession with ''Shrek'' was described by a ''[[PC Magazine]]'' journalist as "One of the craziest and funniest underground Source Filmmaker movements".&lt;ref name = "PCmag"/&gt; The videos involve the character placed in "glitchy worlds of horrifying imagery and [[All Star (song)|Smash Mouth]] references." These videos have included parodies such as "Shrek It Ralph" and "Shreking Ball", as well as the crossover with [[R. L. Stine]]'s series of novels ''[[Goosebumps (original series)|Goosebumps]]'' "Shrek Gets Spooked", which had close to two million views by October 2015.&lt;ref name = "PCmag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Minor|first=Jordan|date=October 5, 2015|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2492368,00.asp|title=Valve's Movie Brats: Inside the Source Filmmaker Community|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, comedy group 3GI, organizer of Shrekfest, released a [[shot-for-shot]] [[parody film|parody]] [[remake]] of the film ''Shrek'' made by a crew of over 200 artists, titled ''Shrek Retold''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neilan |first1=Dan |title=Shrek is getting the deranged, scene-by-scene remake it deserves |url=https://news.avclub.com/skrek-is-getting-the-deranged-scene-by-scene-remake-it-1830539247 |website=[[The A.V.

==Analysis and reception==
Purposely-bad [[fan art]] and animation of ''Shrek'' and loyalty towards the song "[[All Star (song)|All Star]]" by [[pop rock]] group [[Smash Mouth]], which played in the [[Shrek|first film of the series]], are also considered traits of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek.&lt;ref name = "TheWire"/&gt; Sims wrote that one possible reason of Shrek's Internet fanbase was that the franchise was a depiction of "everything that was initially exciting and then quickly patronizing" about the early 2000s, saying that "It's symbolic of so many things we briefly loved before quickly realizing their emptiness." He also said that with many other memes, [[Occam's razor]] is a factor: "Shrek has a funny, stupid face, and putting that face in a weird place provokes a cheap laugh."&lt;ref name = "TheWire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sims|first=David|url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/05/why-is-the-internet-so-obsessed-with-shrek/371189/ |title=Why Is the Internet So Obsessed With Shrek?|date=May 19, 2014 |work=The Wire ''(''[[The Atlantic]]'')''|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online appreciation of Shrek has also been described as ironic. [[Know Your Meme]]'s former researcher Amanda Brennan described it as a "subversion of brony culture, again taking something relatively childish with good intentions and flipping it to an ironic appreciation."&lt;ref name = "The Daily Dot"/&gt; Sims shared a similar sentiment by noting that, like other memes, it was "one giant agreed-upon joke. No one ever admits that the ''Shrek'' series is a cinematic masterpiece, even though DreamWorks drove it into the ground as hard as it possibly could."&lt;ref name = "TheWire"/&gt;

Alan Hanson, a contributor for [[The Awl]] who made fun of ShrekChan and similar fansites, found the darker side of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek: &lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of Shrek content is him making awful faces, being very leery. Children's movies and fairytales are already inherently very dark, and Shrek on its own tries to show the even darker side of that, so it's almost the natural progression to get into the real "swamp" of Shrek, the "Drek" as they say. If Shrek is love, Drek is everything that's not Shrek/love.&lt;/blockquote&gt; He described a fan's apartment as a "swamp," which "is lovely because it's your place, made of the things that comfort you, even if they're gross and unliked by others." He said that a person who is against loving Shrek can be called a "Farquaad. Then it gets pretty derogatory past that, lot's [sic] of f-words and n-words unfortunately."&lt;ref name = "TheWire"/&gt;

==Early history==
The Singapore Flyer was first conceived in the early 2000s by Patrick MacMahon of Melchers Project Management, a subsidiary of German company Melchers. Formal planning commenced in 2002. A new company, Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd, was formed as the developer, with Melchers Project Management holding a 75% stake, and the remainder held by Orient &amp; Pacific Management.

The project was formally announced and endorsed on 27 June 2003 by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] with the signing of a [[memorandum of understanding]], formalising the understanding between the developer and tourism board with regard to the land-acquisition process. Under this agreement, the tourism board was to purchase the plot of land in Marina Centre from the [[Singapore Land Authority]], and lease it to Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd for 30 years with an option to extend the lease by another 15 years. The land was to be rent-free during the construction phase of the project. In July 2003, [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] was appointed as the real estate advisor. [[Takenaka Corporation|Takenaka]] and [[Mitsubishi]] were selected as the main contractors, and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] as the [[structural engineer]].

Early designs showed a {{convert|169|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall wheel similar to the [[London Eye]], drawing criticism that it lacked originality. The developers pointed out that the design was not finalised and was merely for conceptualisation purposes, though the final project changed little from the early designs. Subsequently, the project was to grind almost to a halt when the developer faced difficulties in sourcing funds to build the wheel. Original plans to complete the wheel by the end of 2005 were thus postponed indefinitely, and there were reports (denied by the Singapore Tourism Board) that the tourism board has set an ultimatum date of 31 March 2005 for the developer to iron out its financial issues and to keep the development going.

By September 2005, the project was revived when funds were successfully sourced from two German banks. Collin William Page, a subsidiary of [[ABN AMRO]], was to provide equity to a maximum of S$100&amp;nbsp;million, with a further S$140&amp;nbsp;million coming from [[HypoVereinsbank]]. With this injection of S$240&amp;nbsp;million, the largest single foreign investment in the Singaporean entertainment industry, construction was slated to begin by the end of the month. The stakeholders then were AAA Equity Holdings, Melchers Project Management, and Orient &amp; Pacific Management.

In August 2007, Florian Bollen, Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd chairman, raised his stake in the Singapore Flyer from 60% to 90% through acquisition of Melchers Project Management's 30% stake. The deal was done via AAA Equity Holdings, a private investment vehicle headed by Bollen. Orient &amp; Pacific Management, which spearheaded the project development management, owns the remaining 10%.

The development has a gross building area of approximately {{convert|16000|m2|sqft|-3|abbr=on}}, built on a {{convert|33700|m2|sqft|-2|abbr=on}} site along the Marina Promenade. Designed by [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] with a capacity of up to 7.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers a year, the normally constant rotation of the wheel means that a complete trip lasts approximately 32 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singaporeflyer.com/about-us/fun-facts-about-the-flyer/|title=Fun Facts about the Flyer|website=Singapore Flyer|access-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324004746/http://www.singaporeflyer.com/about-us/fun-facts-about-the-flyer/|archive-date=24 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flyer's 28 air-conditioned capsules are mounted outboard of the rim of the wheel structure, providing continuously unobstructed views. Each capsule has a floor area of {{convert|26|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and is capable of holding 28 passengers, or up to five wheelchairs and 15 other visitors when booked in advance for use by disabled guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.singaporeflyer.com/about-us/design-concepts/ |title=Design Concepts |website=Singapore Flyer |access-date=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324004853/http://www.singaporeflyer.com/about-us/design-concepts/ |archive-date=24 March 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wheel initially rotated in a counter-clockwise direction when viewed from Marina Centre, but on 4 August 2008 this was reversed on the advice of [[Feng shui]] masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2008/8/8/feng-shui-turns-this-wheel |title=Feng Shui turns this wheel |website=The Straits Times |date= |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804160346/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2008/8/8/feng-shui-turns-this-wheel |archivedate=4 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheelchair ramps and lifts, handicapped toilets, and a dedicated parking lot for the disabled are also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.singaporeflyer.com/en/essential-info-for-visitors/wheelchair-access.html |title=Wheelchair Access - Singapore Flyer |publisher=Singaporeflyer.com |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909124021/http://www.singaporeflyer.com/en/essential-info-for-visitors/wheelchair-access.html |archivedate=9 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The [[groundbreaking]] ceremony was held on 27 September 2005, with [[Mah Bow Tan]], Minister for National Development, as guest of honour. The spindle was fitted on 13 December 2006, and the outer rim was completed on 9 April 2007. Installation of the passenger capsules began on 3 August 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20070803/tap-singapore-flyer-may-open-to-public-e-231650b.html Singapore Flyer may open to public earlier than scheduled]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed on 2 October 2007.&lt;ref name=milestones/&gt;

==Opening==
The Flyer opened in 2008. During [[Chinese New Year]], corporate 'inaugural flights' were held from 11 to 13 February, tickets for which sold out for [[Singapore dollar|S$]]8,888 (US$6,271), an auspicious number in Chinese culture.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt; The first public rides were on [[Valentine's Day]], 14 February, the [[soft launch]] on 1 March,&lt;ref name=channelnewsasia09022008/&gt; and the official opening on 15 April, at which prime minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] was guest of honour.&lt;ref name=milestones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = PM Lee officially opens Singapore Flyer | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 15 April 2008 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/341644/1/.html | access-date = 16 April 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420062040/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/341644/1/.html | archive-date = 20 April 2008 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakdowns and stoppages==
* In July 2008, the Flyer was stopped because of a minor fault in the braking system.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt;
* On 4 December 2008, the wheel was stuck for nearly five hours due to bad weather and some 70 people were stranded.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/398149/1/.html |title=Channel NewsAsia - Singapore Flyer to remain closed pending investigations |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924220133/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/398149/1/.html |archive-date=24 September 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 23 December 2008, the wheel stopped and trapped 173 passengers for about six hours.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7797715.stm|title=Dozens trapped on Singapore wheel|date=23 December 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226023125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7797715.stm|archive-date=26 December 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown was caused by a short circuit and fire in the Flyer's wheel control room, which cut off the air-conditioning in the wheel. Eleven passengers were evacuated via a sling-like device from a few of the capsules, and those stranded were given food and drink. The wheel restarted nearly seven hours after it had stopped and two people were hospitalized. The Flyer was closed indefinitely and an investigation into the cause of the malfunction was launched.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt;  The wheel re-opened on 26 January 2009 after the Singapore Police received the final safety certification report from the Conformity Assessment Board.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/404825/1/.html |title=Channel NewsAsia - Singapore Flyer resumes operation after month-long shutdown |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604192534/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/404825/1/.html |archive-date=4 June 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this breakdown, additional back-up systems costing about $3&amp;nbsp;million were installed.

* On 18 July 2010, the ride was shut after one of its electrical cables supplying power to the air-conditioning systems was struck by lightning, affecting the air-conditioning system. Some 200 passengers had to be evacuated. The Flyer re-opened on 20 July 2010 after repair work was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = S'pore Flyer resumes operations after 2-day closure due to air-con glitch | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 20 July 2010 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1070462/1/.html | access-date = 20 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723020354/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1070462/1/.html | archive-date = 23 July 2010 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial difficulties and acquisition==
In March 2010, [[Great Wheel Corporation]], a consultant for the Singapore Flyer, was one of several companies named in a report alleging embezzlement, lodged with the prosecutor's office in Berlin, Germany. Transfers of €3 million to companies in the Virgin Islands and UK, and monthly payments of €40,000 from the Berlin wheel's project company, [[Great Berlin Wheel]], to its linked company Great Wheel in Singapore, are questioned. A prosecutor's office spokesperson said: "We understand there were false contracts concerning non-existing deals, and these contracts were made to take the money for private concerns."&lt;ref name="straitstimes-probe"&gt;[http://admpreview.straitstimes.com:90/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=9660167c38618210VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=cf70758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD Firm linked to Flyer under German probe]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian Bollen is chairman of both Great Wheel Corporation, registered in Singapore as GWC Holdings, and Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd. A spokesperson for the Singapore Flyer said: "The giant observation wheel in Berlin is separate from the Singapore Flyer and it is separately owned and operated. Great Wheel Corporation is also a separate entity from the Singapore Flyer. Any investigations relating to the Berlin wheel and Great Wheel Corporation have no effect on and no relationship with the Singapore Flyer's operations and finances."&lt;ref name="straitstimes-probe"/&gt;

On 28 May 2013, the Singapore Flyer announced that it was in receivership. Accounting firm Ferrier Hodgson has been appointed as the receiver and manager of the company's charged assets. Ferrier Hodgson said it is looking into identifying investors to manage and enhance the Singapore Flyer, and will ensure smooth operations at the Flyer throughout the receivership.&lt;ref name="Channel News Asia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-flyer-in-receivership/690210.html|title=Singapore Flyer in receivership|publisher=|access-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607052053/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-flyer-in-receivership/690210.html|archive-date=7 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2014, [[Merlin Entertainments]], the British firm behind the famous [[London Eye]] and [[Legoland]] [[theme parks]] abandoned its talks to acquire the [[Singapore dollar|S$]]240-million tourist attraction located in the city of Singapore. The discussions between the receiver, [[Ferrier Hodgson]] and Merlin Entertainments were reported to have begun but the talks between the two parties had broken down. The [[Singapore Tourism Board]] reportedly said that discussions are still ongoing with other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, although it declined to confirm if the talks were with another potential buyer. This crumpled the future for the observation wheel, which have gone through financial difficulties since 2010. &lt;ref name="2014-merlindecline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-flyers-woes-take-new-spin-after-merlin-talks-collapse|title=Singapore Flyer's woes takes a new spin after Merlin talks collapse - TODAYonline|website=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|TODAY]]|last=Tan|first=Weizhen|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=7 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809120625/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-flyers-woes-take-new-spin-after-merlin-talks-collapse|archive-date=9 August 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2014, Straco Leisure Pte. Ltd. announced the acquisition of Singapore Flyer. Straco Leisure Pte. Ltd. is 90% owned by Straco Corporation Limited, a Singapore listed company that operates tourist attractions in [[China]] such as the [[Shanghai Ocean Aquarium]] and Underwater World Xiamen. The remaining 10% is owned by WTS Leisure Pte. Ltd., one of the largest private tour bus operators in Singapore.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==In media==

The text adventure game '''''Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All The Girls''''' is the first installment of the ''[[Spellcasting (series)|Spellcasting]]'' series created by [[Steve Meretzky]] during his time at [[Legend Entertainment]]. All three games in the series tell the story of young Ernie Eaglebeak, a student at the prestigious Sorcerer University, as he progresses through his studies, learning the arcanes of magic, taking part in student life, and meeting beautiful women.

== Story ==
The games take place in a [[fictional world]] called Peloria, which appears like a modern society, however magic has the place of science. Peloria is mostly occupied by the Fizzbuttle Ocean with islands where the player travels throughout the game.

The [[player character]] is Ernie Eaglebeak, a teenager just out of high school living in the town of Port Gecko, pining for his sexy neighbour Lola Tigerbelly and struggling in a seriously bad relationship with his stepfather, Joey Rottenwood. A break-through in his miserable life comes when he gets accepted by the Sorcerer University, a prestigious university of magic. After a dashing escape from Rottenwood's custody, Ernie makes his way to SU and enrolls as a freshman.

The player learns magic, explores the university, reads the (rapidly deteriorating quality of) student newspaper, and can watch the University's (comedically [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]) lectures which provide some backstory concerning the mythology of Peloria. In the meantime, Ernie is interested to know females such as the university president's daughter Gretchen Snowbunny or Hillary, the young wife of his ancient advisor Otto Tickingclock. Suddenly SU gets attacked by mysterious foes who kidnap Tickingclock and take away the Sorcerer's Appliance, a powerful magical device which could become extremely dangerous in inappropriate hands. Ernie has to recover the device.

Equipped with his spell book and a magical guided surfboard, Ernie sets out on a mission to several islands on the Fizzbuttle Ocean in search for items that will aid him in getting into the sinister Fort Blackwand. And everywhere on the way he finds places where the Great Attachments required by the Sorcerer's Appliance to operate used to be located, but are gone now.

The islands visited are:
*The Island of Lost Soles where the player restores the cursed souls of its inhabitants, 
*The Island Where Time Runs Backwards where he has to work hard to avoid destroying the universe with a temporal paradox
*The Island of Horny Women to finds out that there is such a thing as too much female attention
*The Restaurant at the End of the Ocean where he witnesses the six stages of a life of a restaurant and 
*The Island of the Gods to find out that goddesses need love too.

The player can learn spells and obtain items during his quest until Ernie can take on the challenge of the fort and confront the mastermind behind the theft of the Sorcerer's Appliance, who turns out to be Joey Rottenwood, his own stepfather. In a climactic final showdown Ernie manages to shut down the Appliance's self-destruct system by burying it, along with Rottenwood, under a pile of whale dung, and frees all the prisoners, including his presumed-dead real father.

At the epilogue, everybody returns to the University, where Ernie gets scolded for irresponsibility, given a hefty bill and abandoned by Lola, but he still gets to advance a year.

== Technical details ==
[[Image:Spellcasting 101 interface.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Legend Entertainment|Legend]] [[interactive fiction]] interface.]]
''Spellcasting 101'' is a [[text adventure game]]. However, much like all other games of this sort produced by [[Legend Entertainment|Legend]] it runs in graphics mode (up to EGA) and takes advantage of certain EGA capabilities. While the traditional type-your-command approach is still possible, one can also assemble commands from words displayed in lists on the screen by clicking on them with the mouse; second, a graphical representation of the present location is also displayed on the screen and certain operations can be performed by clicking on different parts of the image as well. Finally, a compass rose is visible on the screen at all times, which in addition to enabling movement by clicking on it shows valid movement directions for the present location.

Unlike many text adventure games, ''Spellcasting 101'' uses sound - with sound card support for music and sound effects played over the internal speaker using the [[RealSound]] technology.

=== Sexual content ===

Similar to the famous earlier risqué work of [[Steve Meretzky|Meretzky]], ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'', ''Spellcasting 101'' offers two gameplay modes of differing levels of sexual content. In the default, "nice" mode the females Ernie encounters have to be satisfied by such means as entertaining them, performing chores and so on, whereas in the "naughty" mode, such situations are resolved by sexual intercourse; the latter also replaces some of the images displayed by the game with more graphic (albeit not pornographic) versions.

Some of the sexual content is also present in "nice" mode and sometimes is important to gameplay. For example, at one point of the game, in preparation of a party Ernie receives a spell from a fellow student whose purpose is to increase bust size, and promptly uses it to transform a stone bust into a makeshift ladder.

===Copy protection===
The game features a two-part copy protection system, with the first one involving filling in the gaps in Ernie's enrollment records with information from the registration form and class schedule enclosed with the game, at the time of him enrolling at the university, and the second using the enclosed map to obtain co-ordinates for various locations Ernie must visit on the Fizzbuttle Ocean. The word list interface makes breaking the copy protection by trial and error possible.

== Main characters ==

===Ernie Eaglebeak===
Ernie Eaglebeak is the protagonist. A somewhat nerdy young man in his late teens, he wants to become a sorcerer and win the heart of Lola Tigerbelly. Although inexperienced, he is a good magician, whose passion for the arcane arts is rivaled only by his enormous sex drive. Unlike another [[Don Juan]] of the gaming world, [[Larry Laffer]], most of the time he succeeds at his advances, with his "one true love" being seemingly the only woman he's never managed to get into bed.
Most other characters tend to get Ernie's name wrong, in which he is resembled by another adventure game protagonist, [[Guybrush Threepwood]].

===Lola Tigerbelly===
Lola Tigerbelly is Ernie Eaglebeak's long-time neighbour and one true, secret love. The feeling is not mutual though, as the secrecy aside she is much more interested in athletic, jock-like and ''rich'' types than in her nerdy neighbor. She likes shopping and is very shallow, although beautiful.

===Joey Rottenwood===
Joey Rottenwood is Ernie Eaglebeak's stepfather. He passionately hates Ernie and makes his life as miserable as possible, up to the point of having him be essentially a prisoner at his own home, living in a locked room with a straw mat for bed and a chamberpot for other needs, and planning to thwart Ernie's plan to enroll at the Sorcerer University. Initially portrayed as a run-of-the-mill drunkard hating Ernie just for being another man's son, Rottenwood eventually turns out to be the arch-villain of the game, having sworn revenge against the Sorcerer University after being kicked out for cheating, and his attitude towards Ernie is a result of a prophecy he had once heard stating that young Eaglebeak would foil his plans.
There is much more to Joey Rottenwood than meets the eye. In spite of his superficially bad temper and a tendency to drink too much he appears to have almost infinite patience. Planning his revenge took him 30 years, not to mention the fact he went through the trouble of faking Ernie's father's death and marrying Ernie's mother to keep an eye on Ernie. Moreover, despite his abrupt departure from SU, Joey appears to possess quite good knowledge of magic. Much like [[Biff Tannen]] from the [[Back to the Future]] trilogy, he has a tendency to have his plans thwarted by getting buried under large amounts of dung.

===Gretchen Snowbunny===
Gretchen Snowbunny is a daughter of the SU president Aaron Snowbunny. Having been hit by a number of intoxication spells at a student party she attended, she asks Ernie to escort her somewhere she can rest. At Ernie's room, the two proceed to have sex, but as Gretchen passes out Ernie ceases his advances, being a gentleman. Gretchen has a key to her father's office, and Ernie takes advantage of this fact by stealing it while Gretchen is asleep.

===Otto Tickingclock===
Otto Tickingclock is a professor at the Sorcerer University and Ernie Eaglebeak's advisor. While apparently a great magician, his advanced age tends to get the better of him quite often by making him only loosely attached to reality and prone to falling asleep easily. Married to Hillary, whom he loves dearly.

===Hillary Tickingclock===
Hillary Tickingclock is the wife of Professor Tickingclock, several times younger than him. She has a habit of having sex with her dinner guests once her husband has fallen asleep.

==Development==
Following the closure of [[Infocom]], designer [[Steve Meretzky]] began to work as a remote contractor for other game companies. During this period, [[Legend Entertainment]] founder [[Bob Bates]] contacted him about the possibility of developing a direct [[spiritual successor]] to Meretzky's Infocom title ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'', because of that game's commercial success. Meretzky felt that this was an unwise decision, and talked Bates into applying the comedy of ''Leather Goddesses'' to [[fantasy fiction]], rather than repeating the earlier game's [[science fiction]] theme. ''Spellcasting 101'' was the result of these discussions.&lt;ref name=brenda&gt;{{cite journal | author=Garneau, Brenda | authorlink=Brenda Romero | title=Interview; Steve Meretzky: Der Urvater schenkel klopfender Adventures | date=August 1997 | journal=Power Play | pages=158-163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's interface derived from Bates' work on the canceled Infocom game ''[[The Abyss#Adaptations|The Abyss]]'', in development at the time of Infocom's closure. Legend subsequently chose to build on this foundation in its own games.&lt;ref name=rouse /&gt;

Meretzky personally disliked the interface of ''Spellcasting 101''. He noted in retrospect, "The impetus for the interface was not a particular feeling that this was a good/useful/friendly/clever interface for playing adventure games, but rather a feeling that text adventures were dying, that people wanted pictures on the screen at all times, and that people hated to type."&lt;ref name=rouse&gt;{{cite book | last=Rouse III | first=Richard | title=[[Game Design: Theory and Practice|Game Design: Theory &amp; Practice Second Edition]] | publisher=Wordware Publishing | at=189-191 | year=2005 | isbn=1-55622-912-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

India has over 7,500&amp;nbsp;km (4,600 miles) of coastline, including that of the island groups, and this provides many opportune places for surfing. The largest waves are usually seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and [[monsoon]] season. Some of the spots for surfing in India are [[Mangalore]], [[Manipal]], [[Kaup, Karnataka|Kapu Beach]] and [[Murdeshwara]] in Karnataka, Mahabalipuram, Kovalam (Covelong) and Manapad in Tamil Nadu, Kovalam [[Kovalam]] and Varkala in Kerala, Little Andamans and Lakshadweep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingindia.net/india-surf-spots |title=India Surf Spots |publisher=Surfing India |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand up paddling and surfing as in the current form was not a familiar sport to Indians, until recently when things started to change, starting with the coastal villages and the coastal communities. "The kids here are born and brought up around these waters and this sport comes too easily to them," says Madhumathi of Bay of Life Surf School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anusha Parthasarathy |url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/sea-of-change/article4378387.ece |title=Sea of change |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"You power the board. It does not need any mechanism", And once you start paddling, you will be introduced to the vast eco-system that is right in your backyard. There are mangroves, schools of dolphins; we've even spotted a whale shark once- says Madhumathi Ravi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anusha Parthasarathy |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/riding-the-waves/article2924252.ece |title=Riding the waves |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first surf camp in India happened in 2011 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, organised by Bay of Life in association with The Surfing federation of India marked the beginning of surfing as a popular, organised sport in the country.

"There are, it must be said, big pluses and minuses about surfing in India. The greatest plus point right now about grabbing your surf board and heading to the ocean anywhere in the country, is that you will not have too much company. That was a key factor that attracted Ed Templeton and his wife Sofie, the co-owners of Surf &amp; Soul in Varkala. "The surf was good, the water warm, and the most attractive part was that there was nobody else in the water. Where else in the world do you get that?" says Ed.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120310/jsp/personaltt/story_15230056.jsp#.UPg1ESdHLXs |title=Riding the waves |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2012-03-10 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On most days the waves are likely to be quite gentle—anywhere between 2&amp;nbsp;ft and 5&amp;nbsp;ft. The waters are good enough for most surfers. You can go stand up paddling any time of the year. The best time for surfing is between September and November and then again in March, April and May. June, July and August are only suitable for professionals.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt;

India's beaches does not have a consistent life guard program except few regions like Goa or Kovalam in Chennai (run independently by Bay of Life Chennai) hence it's better you surf with a buddy at all times.
Try already explored surf spots first:
It's sensible to first cover familiar surf spots in India before attempting to search for new ones. This way you get familiar to Indian environments, currents and local knowledge before attempting remote locations.Watch out for Currents:
It's better to familiarise yourself with rips and currents pertaining to the surf spot by asking around and talking to fellow surfers, local fishermen of that area.
Local Culture and Activities: 
Make sure you dress appropriately for different beaches in India, some regions are more orthodox than the others. Drinking on the beach, dressing provocatively might sometime invite unwanted trouble. 
Watch out for that fishing boat!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayoflife.com/content/11-surfing-tips-surf-school-india |title=Surfing Tips Surf School India - Bay of Life Surf &amp; Stand Up Paddling |publisher=Bayoflife.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tawaif''' was a highly sophisticated [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of [[South Asia]], particularly during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era. The tawaifs excelled in and contributed to music, dance ([[mujra]]), theatre, and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mapping cultures | date=2004-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered an authority on [[etiquette]]. Tawaifs were largely a North Indian institution central to Mughal court culture from the 16th century onwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoffield|first1=Katherine Butler|title=The Courtesan Tale: Female Musicians and Dancers in Mughal Historical Chronicles, c.1556–1748|journal=Gender &amp; History|date=April 2012|volume=24|issue=1|pages=150–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became even more prominent with the weakening of Mughal rule in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Fall of a culture|author= |url= http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090920/spectrum/main2.htm|newspaper= Tribune India|date= |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contributed significantly to the continuation of traditional dance and music forms
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsuhSiITjU8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=faiza+bai+singer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U5PzzdU51U&amp;sig=O10HHPFuDSWzBQinyRYGl8Mdilk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijpYX-2onUAhUowFQKHW6zBKoQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=faiza%20bai%20singer&amp;f=false  Dance in Thumri, Projesh Banerji, Abhinav Publications, 1986, p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt; and then emergence of modern Indian cinema. 

==History==
The patronage of the Mughal court before and after the Mughal Dynasty in the [[Doab]] region and the artistic atmosphere of 16th century [[Lucknow]] made arts-related careers a viable prospect. Many girls were taken at a young age and trained in both performing arts (such as [[Kathak]] and [[Hindustani classical music]]) as well as literature ([[ghazal]], [[thumri]]) to high standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A hundred years of unsung love|author= |url= http://www.mid-day.com/articles/a-hundred-years-of-unsung-love/85029|newspaper= Mid Day|date= |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had matured and possessed a sufficient command over dancing and singing, they became a ''tawaif'', high-class courtesans who served the rich and noble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Last Song of Awadh|author= |url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-last-song-of-awadh/502153/0|newspaper=Indian Express |date= |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tawaif's'' introduction into her profession was marked by a celebration, the so-called ''missī'' ceremony, that customarily included the inaugural blackening of her teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxford.academia.edu/ThomasZumbroich |title=Zumbroich, Thomas J. (2015) 'The missī-stained finger-tip of the fair': A cultural history of teeth and gum blackening in South Asia. eJournal of Indian Medicine 8(1): 1-32|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that young [[nawab]]s-to-be were sent to these "tawaifs" to learn "tameez" and "tehzeeb" which included the ability to differentiate and appreciate good music and literature, perhaps even practice it, especially the art of ghazal writing. By the 18th century, they had become the central element of polite, refined culture in North India.

These courtesans would dance, sing (especially [[ghazal]]s), recite poetry ([[shairi]]) and entertain their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Courtesans resisted male dominance|author= |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-12-29/lucknow/27292450_1_male-dominance-oldenburg-lucknow|newspaper= Times of India|date= 29 December 2002|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose among the best of their suitors.

Some of the popular tawaifs were [[Begum Samru]] (who rose to rule the principality of [[Sardhana]] in western UP), [[Moran Sarkar]] (who became the wife of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]), [[Wazeeran]] (patronised by Lucknow’s last nawab [[Wajid Ali Shah]]), [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]] (Wajid Ali's first wife who played an important role in the [[First War of Indian Independence|First War of Independence]]), [[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|Umrao Jaan]] (1981), [[Gauhar Jaan]] (a notable classical singer who sang for India's first-ever record), and [[Zohrabai Agrewali]].

The annexation of Oudh by the British in 1856 sounded the first death-knell for this medieval institution. It soon was not favoured by the British, and the women were branded as prostitutes to defame them. Social reformers opposed them as social decadence.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Classical Dance and the Making of Postcolonial National Identities: Dancing on Empire's Stage,

The '''Teatro Nacional Cervantes''' in [[Buenos Aires]] is the national stage and comedy theatre of [[Argentina]].

==Overview==
Located on [[Córdoba Avenue]] and two blocks north of Buenos Aires' renowned [[opera house]], the [[Colón Theatre]], the Cervantes houses three performance halls. The María Guerrero Salon is the theatre's main hall. Its 456 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4,900&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) stage features a 12&amp;nbsp;m (39&amp;nbsp;ft) rotating circular platform and can be extended by a further 2.7&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft). The Guerrero Salon can seat 860 spectators, including 512 in the galleries. A secondary hall, the Orestes Caviglia Salon, can seat 150 and is mostly reserved for [[chamber music]] concerts. The Luisa Vehíl Salon is a multipurpose room known for its extensive [[gold leaf]] decor.

==History==
The Cervantes Theatre of Buenos Aires owes its existence, in part, to the 1897 relocation to Argentina of Spanish theatre producer [[María Guerrero]] and her company, who popularized professional stage theatre in Argentina. A commercial success at the [[Teatro Odeón]], her adaptations of classics in [[Spanish literature]] took her to theatres nationwide. Following the opening of a number of large, ornate [[opera house]]s and stage theatres in Argentina, Guerrero and her husband, Fernando Díaz de Mendoza, set aside a share of their fortune in 1918 for the creation of their own grand theatre house. The project caught the attention of both local high society and the King of [[Spain]], [[Alfonso XIII]], who collaborated with its construction by commissioning artisanal fixtures, material and elements of [[stagecraft]] for the theatre, built accordingly in [[Spanish baroque]] style and named in honor of Spain's legendary novelist and dramatist, [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. 
[[File:Cervantes.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The stage in the María Guerrero Salon.]]

The Cervantes Theatre was inaugurated on September 5, 1921, with a production of [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''[[La dama boba]]'' (''The Foolish Lady''). The proliferation of theatres in Buenos Aires and the advent of the [[Communications in Argentina#Radio|radio in Argentina]] soon eroded the Cervantes' audience base, however, and in 1926, the couple was forced to auction the institution. Lamenting this turn of events, National Music Conservatory Assistant Director [[Enrique García Velloso]] pesuaded President [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]] (whose wife, [[Regina Pacini]], had been an opera [[chanteuse]] and was an avid patroness of the arts), to create the National Stage Theatre at the ailing Cervantes. The theatre also became home of the National Comedy Theatre in 1933. A massive fire in 1961 nearly destroyed the Cervantes, a misfortune leading to the aging house's extensive modernization, including the construction of a 17-story annex. The main hall itself was rebuilt according to its original specifications and the renovated institution was reopened in 1968. Tireless advocacy on the part of [[Lito Cruz]] (one of the best-known figures in [[Argentine cinema]] and [[Culture of Argentina#Cinema and theatre|theatre]]) led to [[Argentine Congress|Congressional]] passage of a National Theatre Law in 1997, providing yearly subsidies for the art and for the designation of the Cervantes itself as an official entity.

'''''The Mountain Road''''' is a 1960 [[war film]] starring [[James Stewart]] and directed by [[Daniel Mann]]. Set in China and based on the 1958 novel of the same name by journalist-historian [[Theodore H. White]], the film follows the attempts of a [[U.S. Army]] major to destroy bridges and roads potentially useful to the Japanese during [[World War II]]. White's time covering China for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine during the war led to an interview with former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Major Frank Gleason Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/oldtownman/WW2Timeline/Pacific06b.html "The Burma Front (Fronts in the Pacific)."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228013523/http://homepage.mac.com/oldtownman/WW2Timeline/Pacific06b.html |date=December 28, 2011 }} ''Time,'' September 1943. Retrieved: June 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; who served as head of a demolition crew that inspired the story and film.{{#tag:ref|In December 1944, Major Gleason headed up a group that stopped the Japanese advance when the demolition team blew up over 150 bridges and then destroyed over 50,000 tons of munitions in Dushan County, Guizhou.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkula 2010, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Gleason was later hired as an (uncredited) technical consultant for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Evans 2000, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is a rather somber treatment of World War II and includes themes that were taboo for Hollywood during the war years, such as tensions between allies and racism among American troops. The protagonist is a frustrated and morally conflicted U.S. officer unsure about the value of his mission. For these reasons, ''The Mountain Road'' is often labeled [[anti-war]]. But it was made with the cooperation of the Pentagon, and it is much more respectful of the military as an institution than are the well-known anti-war films of the 1960s and '70s.

As a World War II combat veteran, Stewart had vowed never to make a war movie, concerned they were hardly ever realistic.{{#tag:ref|Stewart did not speak publicly of his wartime experiences, and after the war, he had refused to appear in war movies, although he had starred in ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, Geoffrey. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/nov/02/the-jimmy-stewart-story/?pagination=false "The Jimmy Stewart Story."] ''The New York Review of Books,'' November 2, 2006. Retrieved: June 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} ''The Mountain Road'' was the only war movie set during World War II in which he starred as a combatant. Stewart, however, had been featured in a wartime short, ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'' (1942) and in a civilian role in ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949). [[Harry Morgan]], another cast member in ''The Mountain Road'', later said he believed that Stewart made an "exception for this film because it was definitely anti-war."&lt;ref&gt;Munn 2006, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1944, engineer Major Baldwin ([[James Stewart]]) is ordered to blow up an airfield as well as strategic roads and bridges to help American troops in China retreat from the Japanese army. General Loomis ([[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]]) is reluctant to send Baldwin due to his inexperience as a commander, but relents. Baldwin, accompanied by reluctant conscripts, Sergeant Michaelson ([[Harry Morgan]]), Prince ([[Mike Kellin]]), Lewis ([[Eddie Firestone]]), Miller ([[Rudy Bond]]) and Collins ([[Glenn Corbett]]), the demolition team's translator, Baldwin finds out from Colonel Li (Leo Chen), the Chinese commander that the Japanese are about to capture a munitions dump. Colonel Kwan ([[Frank Silvera]]) is assigned to the team but before they can embark, Madame Sue-Mei Hung ([[Lisa Lu]]), the American-educated widow of a Chinese officer, joins them, with Baldwin gradually becoming attracted to the widow.

Baldwin blows up a bridge and pushes a truck over a cliff to keep on pace, trying to reach the munitions dump before the Japanese. Sue-Mei and Baldwin are at odds over his cavalier treatment of the Chinese when he resorts to blowing up a mountain road, leaving thousands of local Chinese refugees trapped. After stopping at a village because Miller is ill, Collins tries to give out the surplus food the team has brought, but is trampled to death by starving villagers. Baldwin is furious and resolute in trying to complete his mission, finally successful in blowing up the munitions storage, but when one of his trucks is stolen by Chinese bandits, Miller and Lewis are also killed. Baldwin exacts revenge by rolling a gas barrel into the bandits' outpost and setting the village on fire. Baldwin asks Sue-Mei to understand why he had to act that way, but there is no reconciliation between them as the gulf of two divergent cultures is too great and she leaves him. Although recognizing his retribution was fundamentally excessive and brutal, Baldwin radios his report to headquarters, and is praised for fulfilling his mission.

==Production==
Although the Japanese invaders were the feared antagonists, they never appear, as ''The Mountain Road'' diverges from the typical World War II actioner in dealing with a more sensitive sub-plot, delving into the cultural misunderstanding and racial prejudice between American soldiers and their Chinese allies. White's original story had a serious message that stemmed from his extended sojourn in China, first as a freelance reporter in 1938 and shortly after as correspondent for ''Time''  magazine. White found his stories depicting the corruption of the Nationalist government and warning of the growing threat of Communism being rewritten by Chinese government officials with the cooperation of editors at his magazine. When he left his post and returned to the United States, in 1946, White and colleague Annalee Jacoby, wrote a best-selling nonfiction book ''Thunder Out of China'', describing the country in wartime. His follow-up novel, ''The Mountain Road'' also reflected his interest in a China in turmoil.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

During planning, a number of actors and production staff were "penciled in" including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert Mitchum]] in the male lead role with Chinese actress Dora Ding as the female lead, [[James Wong Howe]] to be the director of photography, and even adding [[Don Rickles]], then making a name as a "[[Double act|second banana]]" in films. [[Lisa Lu]], who played "Madame Sue-Mei Hung", in her first major role,&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt; recruited P. C. Lee, Leo Chen, Richard Wang and C. N. Hu, faculty members from the Chinese Mandarin Department, Army Language School, to appear in the film.&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;Nixon, Rob. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21043/The-Mountain-Road/articles.html "Article: The Mountain Road."] ''Turner Classic Movies.'' Retrieved: June 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography began on June 9, 1959 with location filming taking place at [[Arizona]] locations. The set for the Chinese village was erected on the Horse Mesa Dam Road, 40 miles east of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]; another set was erected in the vicinity of [[Superstition Mountain]]. The Fish Creek Hill Bridge on the [[Apache Trail]] was revamped to resemble the Chinese wooden bridge that is blown up in the action and the temple set, ammunition and supply station as well as the airfield were erected in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. The battle scenes were filmed at the [[Columbia Ranch]] in [[Burbank, California]]. The extreme heat at the locations caused frequent cases of [[heat prostration]] among the cast and crew. Production wrapped on August 20, 1959.&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21043/The-Mountain-Road/notes.html "Notes: The Mountain Road."] ''Turner Classic Movies.'' Retrieved: June 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although a minor film in James Stewart's repertoire, ''The Mountain Road'' was received favorably, if considered somewhat puzzling. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer, Howard Thompson noted, "Even with its final, philosophical overtones, this remains a curiously taciturn, dogged and matter-of-fact little picture—none too stimulating ... bluntly, and none too imaginatively."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Howard. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502E5D81638EF32A25753C3A9609C946191D6CF "Movie Review: The Mountain Road (1960)."] ''The New York Times,'' June 30, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' focused on Stewart's role, "As played by James Stewart, the American major holds the film together."&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. 1970, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

White himself had mixed feelings about the film. In his memoirs he describes seeing it at a theater in Times Square where a group of teen-agers sitting behind him cheered the explosions and the "mad American destruction" of the village. Then their leader said "The hell with it. That's the best part of the picture. The rest is crap." White wrote that he came to agree, saying that he had written the ending based on his experience as a reporter at the time, "refusing to acknowledge guilt in Asia. . . . " But by the time he wrote his memoirs, he had come to feel that the "reality of the twenty-five-year-long American record in Asia was that of genuine good will exercised in mass killing, a grisly irony which White could master neither in film nor book. Asia was a bloody place; we had no business there; novel and movie should have said just that at whatever risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = White |first = Theodore H.   |year = 1978 |title = In Search of History: A Personal Adventure |publisher = Harper &amp; Row| location = New York |isbn = 0060145994|ref = }}, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ToonTalk''' is a computer programming system intended to be programmed by children.  The "Toon" part stands for cartoon.  The system's presentation is in the form of animated characters, including robots that can be trained by example. It is one of the few successful implementations outside academia of the [[concurrent constraint logic programming]] paradigm.

It runs on any modern web browser and differs from the desktop version of ToonTalk in a few ways. ToonTalk programs can run on any DOM element and various browser capabilities (audio, video, style sheets, speech input and output, and browser events) are available to ToonTalk programs. Web services such as Google Drive are integrated. ToonTalk Reborn is free and open source.

Beyond its life as a commercial product, ToonTalk evolved via significant academic use in various research projects, notably at the [[London Knowledge Lab]] and the [[Institute of Education]] - projects [http://playground.ioe.ac.uk/ Playground] and [http://www.lkl.ac.uk/kscope/weblabs/ WebLabs], which involved research partners from Cambridge ([[Logotron]]), Portugal ([[Cnotinfor]] and the [[University of Lisbon]]), Sweden ([[Royal Institute of Technology]]), Slovakia ([[Comenius University]]), Bulgaria ([[Sofia University]]), Cyprus ([[University of Cyprus]]), and Italy (Institute for Educational Technology of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]). It was also source of academic interest in Sweden, where Mikael Kindborg proposed a static representation of ToonTalk programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

ToonTalk was influenced by the [[Janus (concurrent constraint programming language)|Janus computer programming language]] and the [[Actor model]].  The main communication abstraction in ToonTalk is the bird/nest pair.  When you (the programmer or a robot) give a thing to a bird, she flies to her nest and puts the thing in it, then returns.  If one or more things already occupy the nest, the bird puts the new one underneath the others.

A ToonTalk program is a sequence of rules, where each rule has a head and a tail.  The head is a pattern that can be matched against the argument, which must be a tuple.  In ToonTalk's presentation, a rule appears as a robot, a program as a team of robots, and a tuple as a box that can have any number of holes or compartments in which things may be placed.  The alphabet of things includes number pads, text pads, other boxes, robot teams, birds, nests, and things from some other categories.  A process consists of a box with a team of robots working on it.  If none of the patterns matches the box, the process suspends.  Otherwise, the first rule that matches, fires.  The end of the tail of the rule can either destroy the process, or continue it with the same team.  In case the pattern calls for something other than an empty nest where an empty nest is present, the process suspends until some bird should place something on the nest (usually as a result of the actions of other processes).  A nest with something on it matches the pattern as though the nest were not there, just the (top) something.  The actions in the tail also manipulate the something rather than the whole nest.  Consequently, a nest can be used to program a [[future (programming)|future]].

ToonTalk can be given an imperative reading or a declarative reading.  If we ignore certain constructs designed to facilitate I/O, we can see ToonTalk as not having any shared access to mutable memory.  The bird/nest mechanism resembles the communication in the Actor model, but with the additional power to be able to pass nests around and for a process to hold more than one nest (which is also true in [[Janus (concurrent constraint programming language)|Janus]]).  A difference between communication in the Actor model and in ToonTalk is that ToonTalk preserves the order of the messages; however, ToonTalk can also provide an indeterministic merge of message streams.

'''Vatican Radio''' ({{lang-it|Radio Vaticana}}; {{lang-la|Statio Radiophonica Vaticana}}) is the official [[broadcasting]] service of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].

Set up in 1931 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], today its programs are offered in 47 languages, and are sent out on [[short wave]] (also [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]]), [[medium wave]], [[FM radio|FM]], [[satellite]] and the [[Internet radio|Internet]]. Since its inception, Vatican Radio has been maintained by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Vatican Radio preserved its independence during the rise of [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars#The Fascist regime|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], a week after [[Pope Pius XII]] ordered the programming, Vatican Radio broadcast the news that [[Poles]] and [[Jews]] were being rounded up and forced into [[ghetto]]s.

Today, programming is produced by over two hundred journalists located in 61 different countries. Vatican Radio produces more than 42,000 hours of simultaneous broadcasting covering international news, religious celebrations, in-depth programs, and music. The current general director is Father [[Federico Lombardi]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]

On 27 June 2015, [[Pope Francis]], in a ''[[motu proprio]]'' ("on his own initiative") [[apostolic letter]], established the [[Secretariat for Communications]] in the [[Roman Curia]], which absorbed Vatican Radio effective 1 January 2017, ending the organization's 85 years of independent operation.&lt;ref name=cur&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/kschiffer/vatican-radio-ends-85-years-of-independent-operations|title=Vatican Radio Ends 85 Years of Independent Operations|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1930s===
[[File:PioXI et Pacelliinaugurazioneradiovaticana.jpg|thumb|right|180px|&lt;center&gt; [[pope Pius XI]], &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;his successor [[pope Pius XII|Pacelli]] with [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] at starting of ''Vatican Radio'' [[1931]] &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
Vatican Radio began broadcasting with the callsign HVJ&lt;ref&gt;Matelski, Marilyn J.. ''Vatican Radio: Propagation by the Airwaves''. 1995, Praeger. {{ISBN|0-275-94760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on two shortwave frequencies using 10 [[kilowatts]] (kW) of power on 12 February 1931, with the pontificial message "Omni creaturae" of [[Pope Pius XI]].&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"&gt;Levillain 2002: 1600&lt;/ref&gt; Also in attendance was [[Guglielmo Marconi]] and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who would become [[Pope Pius XII]]&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600" /&gt; Its first director was [[physicist]] [[Giuseppe Gianfranceschi]], who was also the president of the [[Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei]].

In 1933, a permanent [[Microwave radio relay|microwave link]] was established between the [[Vatican Palace]] and the summer residence of the papacy, [[Castel Gandolfo]].&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600" /&gt;

In 1936, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) recognized Vatican Radio as a "special case" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On 25 December 1937 a [[Telefunken]] 25&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter and two [[directional antenna]]s were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600" /&gt;

===World War II===
{{main|Pope Pius XII's Christmas addresses}}
Following a December 1939 report from Cardinal [[August Hlond]] of [[Poznań]] detailing the oppression of the Catholic Church in Poland, Pope Pius XII decided, among other measures, to use Vatican Radio to provide "information regarding the condition of the church in Poland." The German broadcast on 21 January 1940 compared German activities to "what the Communists imposed on Spain in 1936"; the English service noted the attacks on the Church were not limited to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Blet 1999: 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were (like all foreign broadcasts) banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.

While some critics have said Pope Pius XII was too quiet regarding the Holocaust,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Coppa, "Pope Pius XII: From the Diplomacy of Impartiality to the Silence of the Holocaust," ''Journal of Church and State'' (2013) 55#2 pp 286-306.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Adler examined the transcripts of wartime broadcasts over the Vatican Radio. Adler argues that it exposed Nazi persecution of the Church and opposed collaboration with Nazism. It appealed to Catholics to remain true to their faith's injunctions: to defend the sanctity of life and the unity of humankind. In so doing the Pope pursued a policy of spiritual resistance to Nazi ideology and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Adler, "The 'Sin of Omission'? Radio Vatican and the anti-Nazi Struggle, 1940–1942," ''Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History'' (2004) 50#3 pp 396-406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s and 1950s===
In 1948, services expanded to 18 languages.

Because of space purposes, the [[Holy See]] acquired a 400-[[hectare]] area located 18 kilometres north of [[Rome]] at [[Santa Maria di Galeria]] (GC: {{coord|42|2|39|N|12|19|22|E|type:landmark}}). The [[Italian Republic]] granted the site extraterritorial status in 1952.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600" /&gt;

In 1957, a new broadcasting center was placed into operation, with a [[Philips]] 100&amp;nbsp;kW [[shortwave]] transmitter, two 10&amp;nbsp;kW shortwave transmitters, and one 120&amp;nbsp;kW [[mediumwave]] transmitter, with 21 directional and one [[omnidirectional antenna]]. The next phase involved two 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters aimed at Africa and [[Oceania]], a 250&amp;nbsp;kW mediumwave transmitter for Europe, and a 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter for the Far East and Latin America.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600" /&gt;

Radio Vaticana was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1950.

===2000s===
In the 21st century, Vatican Radio has experimented with digital transmission technologies (DRM, T-DAB, T-DMB) and has used electronic newsletters, podcasts, and other new technologies to distribute its programming. Vatican Radio and CTV began their own YouTube channel in 2010, operating in four languages, and operates six Twitter accounts.

In May 2009 it was announced that Vatican Radio would begin broadcasting commercial advertisements for the first time in July. The decision was made so as to meet the radio's rising costs, namely 21.4m [[euro]]s a year. All advertisements would have to meet "high moral standards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8068680.stm "Vatican Radio to air advertising"], BBC, 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican Radio stopped transmitting short- and medium-wave broadcasts to [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Europe]] on Sunday 1 July 2012. The [[Vatican Press Office]] closed [[Vatican Information Service]] in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1202454.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121205205355/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1202454.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 December 2012|title=Catholic News Service|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Michael Gannon, from Ireland, became the first person with Down Syndrome to work at any Vatican office, which he did as an intern at Vatican Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneycatholic.org/news/latest_news/2014/201424_517.shtml|title=Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney - News|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/storico/2014/01/15/vatican_radios_newest_intern/en1-764349|title=Vatican Radio Vatican Radio|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, Vatican Radio had a staff of 355 people who produce more than 66 hours of daily programming in 45 languages on air, and 38 languages on the website. Programs are broadcast via short wave, medium wave, FM and satellite.

Vatican Radio has been losing between €20 and €30 million annually. With its absorption into the Curia's Secretariat for Communications on 1 January 2017 Vatican Radio director Msgr. [[Dario Edoardo Viganò|Dario Viganò]] has indicated that he plans to pare down short-wave radio operations and institute cost control measures in the service's other broadcast operations.

On 24 March 2017, Vatican Radio made its final English-language shortwave transmission to [[Asia]] after 59 years of service. Vatican Radio's English Service for Asia has then continued online.

==Television==
During the 1930s, the station made experimental television broadcasts. However, apart from a brief experimental revival in the 1950s, it was not until the 1990s that a regular 'satellite' television service began. The programs of [[TV2000]] include programming from [[Vatican Television Center]].

==Transmitters==
The signals are transmitted from a large shortwave and medium-wave transmission facility for Radio Vatican. The Santa Maria di Galeria Transmitter was established in 1957 and it is an extraterritorial area in [[Italy]] belonging to the Holy See. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeR7YhuPWjY Vatican Radio's interval signal] is a well-known sound on shortwave radio.

The most interesting aerial is the one for the medium wave frequency 1530&amp;nbsp;kHz, which consists of four 94 metre high grounded free standing towers arranged in a square, which carry wires for a medium wave aerial on horizontal crossbars. The direction of this aerial can be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.drmradio.co.uk/smdg.html |title=General view of the Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site. |access-date=2010-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122014304/http://www.drmradio.co.uk/smdg.html |archive-date=2010-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation controversy==
{{main|Vatican Radio lawsuit}}
The Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the [[non-ionising radiation]] from the site has [[Microwave radiation#Health effects|affected their health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_21_37/ai_72960576|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study {{cn|date=September 2015}} by cancer specialist Dr. Andrea Micheli has suggested{{vague|date=September 2015}} that electromagnetic radiation from the antennas has caused excess risk of [[leukaemia]] and [[lymphoma]]s in children{{where?|date=September 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/07/13/news/onde_elettromagnetiche-5565454|title=Radio Vaticana, una perizia conferma il nesso tra le onde delle antenne e i tumori nei bimbi - Roma - Repubblica.it|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are not accepted by the station and are not peer reviewed.

'''Matilda Alice Powles''' (13 May 1864 – 16 September 1952), was an English [[music hall]] performer who adopted, at age 11, the stage name '''Vesta Tilley''' and who became one of the most famous [[male impersonator]]s of her era. She was a star in both [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]] for over thirty years.

==Early years==
Tilley was born in Commandery Street, [[Worcester]], [[Worcestershire]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Maitland (1986) ''Vesta Tilley'' p14, Virago Press, London {{ISBN|0-86068-795-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, known as Harry Ball, was a comedy actor, songwriter and music hall chairman; with his encouragement, Tilley first appeared on stage at the age of three and a half. At the age of six she did her first role in male clothing, billed as "The Pocket [[Sims Reeves]]", a reference to the then-famous opera singer. She also performed songs from his repertoire, to add to the illusion. She would come to prefer doing male roles exclusively, saying that "I felt that I could express myself better if I were dressed as a boy."&lt;ref&gt;Lady de Frece, ''Recollections of Vesta Tilley'', London: Hutchinson, 1934. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under her father's management, Vesta toured extensively in 'the provinces', as towns and cities outside London were known. While she appeared on stage at St George's Hall in [[Nottingham]] most frequently – her father was the chairman of the hall – she also performed in other towns such as [[Birmingham]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leicester]], [[Derby]] and [[Liverpool]]. Successful from the outset, by age 11 her salary supported her parents and siblings as well.

The first decade of her career saw her billed most often as 'the Great Little Tilley'. The gender ambiguity of her name was causing problems for audiences, however, so she and her manager father were asked to come up with another.&lt;ref&gt;Maitland, Sara. ''Vesta Tilley.'' London: Virago, 1986. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; She was billed as Vesta Tilley for the first time in April 1878, when performing at the [[Weston's Music Hall|Royal Music Hall]] in [[Holborn]], London.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 4 April 1878, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Vesta" referred to both the Roman goddess of hearth and home, and a brand of [[safety matches]]; "Tilley", a diminutive of [[Matilda (name)|Matilda]], was what she was called as a child.

==Repertoire and performance==
Early on, Vesta performed the songs of [[Sims Reeves]] and songs written for her by her father. These included sentimental pieces such as 'Poor Jo', where she played the character of a [[workhouse]] child. Other sentimental songs would follow, such as 'Squeeze Her Gently', 'The Pet of Rotten Row', and 'Strolling along with Nancy', songs made popular by Reeves.

As she grew older, she followed in the footsteps of other male impersonators, performing songs where she portrayed young men behaving either embarrassingly or badly. Among these characters were the titular 'Burlington Bertie' and a clerk on holiday at the seaside ('The Seaside Sultan').  These were intended to be comical and allowed the audience to laugh at the inflated egos of these characters. Equally comical was the play on her identity as a woman and the subject matter of many of her songs. 'When the right girl comes along', 'Following in Father's Footsteps', 'I'm the Idol of the Girls' and 'It's Part of a Policeman's Duty' are a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?nq=1&amp;query_type=author&amp;query=Tilley,+Vesta|title=Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project|last=Collections.|first=University of California, Santa Barbara. Library. Department of Special|date=2005-11-16|website=cylinders.library.ucsb.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the misbehaving boys, she also played a number of military characters, particularly during the [[Boer Wars|Boer War]] and the [[First World War]].

She also played the [[principal boy]] in a number of [[pantomime]]s. She played the role of 'Pertiboy' in 'Beauty and the Beast' at the Birmingham Theatre Royal during the 1881–82 season; she later appeared there in 1885-86 in the title role of 'Robinson Crusoe'. She was best known for her role as the eponymous '[[Dick Whittington]]'; a role she reprised throughout her career. Notably, she also appeared in the [[Drury Lane pantomime]] for the 1882–83 season production of 'Sinbad' (in the role of Captain Tra-la-la) and 1890–91 season's production of 'Beauty and the Beast', where she played the prince.

==Stardom==

A true professional, she would spend months preparing the new character types she wanted to represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class men in her audience. She was wildly popular among women as well, who viewed her as a symbol of independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing room, had been allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even when prices were raised indicates her immense popularity.

As a celebrated [[vaudeville]] star, she laid the foundation stone of the Camberwell Empire and  [[Sunderland Empire Theatre]] in 1906. The Sunderland Empire survives and has a bar named in her honour across the road from the venue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630015143/http://www.btinternet.com/~radical/thefolkmag/vesta.htm ''Vesta Tilley Biography''] accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career reached the US as well, and in 1912 she performed at the first [[Royal Variety Performance]] as 'The Piccadilly Johnny with the Little Glass Eye': "The most perfectly dressed young man in the house".

==Wartime work ==
[[File:Vesta Tilley (photograph).jpg|thumb|Vesta Tilley as a foppish young man]]
Tilley's popularity continued during the [[First World War]], when she and [[Walter de Frece|her husband]] ran a military recruitment drive, as did a number of other music hall stars. In the guise of characters like 'Tommy in the Trench' and 'Jack Tar Home from Sea', Tilley performed songs like "The Army of Today's All Right" and 'Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier'. This is how she got the nickname 'Britain's best recruiting sergeant'&amp;nbsp;– young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p01tcxp4/The_Great_War_Interviews_Katie_Morter/ |title=The Great War Interviews 2: Katie Morter |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was prepared to be a little controversial. Famously, for example, she sang a song "I've Got a Bit of a Blighty One", about a soldier who was delighted to have been wounded because it allowed him to go back to Britain and get away from extremely deadly battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;A blighty one = a wound which sends you back to Britain&lt;/ref&gt;

:"When I think about my dugout / Where I dare not stick my mug out / I'm glad I've got a bit of a blighty one!"

Tilley performed in hospitals and sold [[war bond]]s.

==Cross-dressing==
There were a number of other stars at the time who were women [[cross-dress]]ed as men, including [[Bessie Bellwood]], [[Ella Shields]], [[Hetty King]], [[Rudge Sisters|Millie Hylton]] and Fanny Robina. Once she became a household name, Tilley made an effort to underline her femininity off stage, to protect herself against criticism and allow her to continue to push boundaries in her career. She wore the latest fashions off stage, glamorously clad in fur and jewellery, as befitted her role. Another way she reinforced her feminine image was through her ongoing involvement with children's charities in the towns and cities where she performed (she had no children of her own).

==Retirement==
Vesta's farewell tour took a year to complete between 1919 and 1920. All proceeds were given to a local children's charity in the city where the performances took place, with a guarantee of £500 per city, Tilley making up the difference if necessary. She made her final appearance at the [[Coliseum Theatre]], London, at the age of 56. When she gave up the stage, one of the main reasons she gave was that her husband wanted to become an [[Member of parliament|MP]], and her profession was not really respectable enough for such a milieu; arguably, she was too well known and outshone him as a public figure, which was a concern. For the rest of her life she lived as Lady de Frece, moving to [[Monte Carlo]] with her husband upon his retirement from politics.

==Personal life==
[[File:Vesta Tilley grave Putney Vale 2014.jpg|thumb|alt=A large gravestone of black marble with a patch of green turf in the middle|Grave of Vesta Tilley and her husband [[Walter de Frece]] at [[Putney Vale Cemetery]], London in 2014]]
She married [[Walter de Frece]] at [[Brixton]] Register Office, south London, on 16 August 1890.

Her husband was [[knight]]ed in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, with Tilley becoming Lady de Frece. He was elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in the 1920s and then for [[Blackpool]].

Her autobiography, ''Recollections of Vesta Tilley'', was published in 1934. Vesta Tilley died in London in 1952, aged 88. Her body was buried alongside her husband, at [[Putney Vale Cemetery]] and a black granite memorial marks the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/thequietbusker/7184652730/ |title=Vesta Tilley |author=the quiet busker |publisher=flickr.com |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
