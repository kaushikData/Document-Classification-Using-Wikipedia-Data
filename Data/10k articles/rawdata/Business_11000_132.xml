'''Basell Polyolefins''' was a joint venture between [[BASF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. [[Leonard Blavatnik]]'s [[Access Industries]] acquired it from the venturers for $5.7 billion in August 2005. In 2007, Basell merged with the privately owned US company [[Lyondell Chemical Company]] to form [[LyondellBasell]], which went bankrupt in the US in January 2009 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010.

Basell was the world's largest producer of [[polypropylene]] and advanced [[polyolefins]] products, the world's largest producer of [[polyethylene]], and a global leader in the development and licensing of polypropylene and polyethylene processes, and  a leader{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} in catalysts.

==Company history==

Basell's heritage comes from many companies, including [[BASF]], Hercules, Himont, [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini]], [[Montedison]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. However Basell, and then later [[LyondellBasell]], had its origin in a joint venture between [[BASF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. Spurred on by the work of Nobel Prize-winning scientists [[Karl Ziegler]] and [[Giulio Natta]], these Basell predecessor companies were among the leaders of the polyolefin revolution that began in the late 1930s and 1950s. This transformation is still driving the petrochemicals industry today.  In 2007, driven on by its then owners Access Industries and against the advice of Basell senior management, Basell acquired the privately owned US company [[Lyondell Chemical Company]] to form [[LyondellBasell]], paying far above the market rate for the shares. The main winner was Access, who also held significant shares in Lyondell and was able to realise a massive profit by forcing Basell to overpay. This drove the new company rapidly to file for chapter 11 in the US in January 2009, from which it emerged in May 2010.&lt;br&gt;

A '''bid manager''' is an [[Senior management|executive]] sales role within an [[organization]], responsible for managing [[Bidding|bids]] generally in response to [[request for proposal]]s (RFPs) from customers, but also as proactive pursuits for business. Bid managers orchestrate the creation of the solution and proposal as ‘Bid [[Project Manager]]s’ ensuring compliance with customer requirements while highlighting company value proposition. The role of a bid manager often works with company [[Board of directors|board directors]] and [[Corporate title|C-level management]] (i.e. [[CEO]], [[CFO]]) to bring and deliver strategic approaches to win bids.

==Bid management==

Bid managers are responsible for the proposal of bids to existing or prospective clients for projects. A bid manager will ensure the smooth running of the bid for a project within the correct time and financial parameters, and manage the relationship with the client. Bid managers may work in conjunction with a bid director and often with specialists in the [[construction]] and [[built environment]] industries to create and manage the bid for a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careerstructure.com/careers-advice/profiles/bid-manager|title=Bid Managers|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bid manager's role varies based on the industry and how the individual company has structured their management of sales cycle. A company that depends on short (quick win) sales cycle often relies on proposal managers, where as organisations that depends on longer term, complex sales processes depends on bid managers. In addition to managing bids, bid managers work closely with company board directors and C-level management to set the strategic direction of the business by providing insight into [[Market trend|market trends]] through direct exposure to critical feedback from failed bids and the evolving needs of clients.

Bid managers' salaries differ across the construction industry depending on the company and, moreover, the specific project. According to a survey conducted in 2010 the average salary of a bid manager in the UK construction industry, including a bonus, is £120,250 per annum. Certain projects are more financially beneficial depending on the nature of the project or sector. For example, bid managers working on [[Private sector|private projects]] earn an average salary of £80,000, whilst [[public sector]] projects make a lower figure of £40,000. However, bonuses can be accumulated at a rate of at least 20%-60% of the salary. For example, a salary of £50,000 can be given and depending on performance, a 60% bonus will be given on top of the salary, bringing the total earnings to £70,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salarybenchmarker.careerstructure.com/?WT.mc_id=B_A_EM_SB_GPR|title=Salary Benchmarker|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bid managers and their role in outsourcing==

Bid managers play an important role in [[outsourcing]], where they produce and manage bids for companies structured to take on outsourcing projects from the government and industries. These bids run anywhere between three and 18 months (on average about six months), involve substantial bid budgets (as much as $5 million for very large bids over $100 million in value) and large teams of between 10 and 100 people. The bid manager ensures that all customer-specified milestones are met and all deliverables of the bid are produced as specified. A bid manager's performance is normally evaluated based on the percentage of contracts he or she wins. Bid managers typically work with teams collected together from line functions for the temporary duration of the bid project, and hence need to have strong leadership skills to manage bids successfully. Good bid managers are in strong demand in the outsourcing industry.

==Plot==
At the office where they work together, acting sales manager Evan Sanders talks to his slacker friend and coworker Tim about an upcoming presentation for the Phallucite account. After an awkward moment between Evan and head of HR Amanda in the break room, Tim explains to coworkers Andrew and Mike that Amanda said “I love you” to Evan and Evan’s response was, “no.”

After encounters with the janitor and Frank the security guard, intern Jack is killed while taking trash to the dumpster.

Branch president Ted Plunkett passes over Evan for a promotion and instead hires Max Phillips as the new sales manager. Max went to college with Evan and Tim, but Evan had him kicked out after Max slept with his girlfriend. Max moves into Evan’s office and starts hitting on Amanda.

In the office alone playing video games after hours, Mike is killed in one of the bathroom stalls. Evan finds Mike’s body in the morning, but it is gone by the time he alerts everyone.

Max secretly turns office employee Dave into a vampire. Formerly passive Dave becomes aggressive in demanding that everyone pay what is owed to the office sports betting pool.

Anxious to complete his Phallucite presentation, Evan uses Zabeth, who harbors a crush on him, to retrieve files from the basement. Zabeth is attacked and turned into a vampire.

Evan convinces Andrew to work late with him. Andrew goes to the basement and is attacked by Zabeth. Meanwhile, Evan searches Max’s office, finding photos of Amanda and personnel files where each employee photograph is marked with an x, circle, or check.

Andrew returns upstairs and seemingly drops dead in front of Evan. Evan hides in a supply closet. Determining that Max is behind the murders, Evan calls Amanda with a warning, but Max answers her phone and taunts him. Evan eventually passes out.

Ted, Tim, and Max find Evan in the morning. Andrew returns as a vampire and presents the completed Phallucite presentation to the bosses. Ted admonishes Evan for not finishing it himself. However, Max strangely defends Evan to protect Evan’s job.

Evan tries convincing Tim that vampires have overtaken the office. Tim reveals several odd events he witnessed that corroborate Evan’s wild claim, including watching Max turn administrative assistant Elaine into a vampire. Amanda still refuses to believe that anything supernatural is going on. Evan worries that Max will turn her into a vampire like the other employees.

Evan and Tim go to Frank for help. Frank reveals that he was with Tim when they witnessed the ongoing vampire activity. The three men go to Frank’s car for weapons and discover that Frank’s vehicle was robbed. The janitor reveals he is a vampire by attacking Frank. Frank recovers and stakes the Janitor through his heart, killing him.

Evan, Tim, and Frank return to the office and discover that all of the employees are now productive vampires. The men arm themselves with office supplies before confronting Ted, Max, and Andrew in Ted’s office. Amanda is also present. Ted reveals that he knew Max was turning employees into vampires and that he sanctioned it so that employee performance would improve. Evan reveals that the files he found in Max’s office prove that Max planned to kill Ted. Before Ted can act, Max snaps Ted’s neck.

Max and Andrew allow the three men to leave Ted’s office with Amanda, but they are surrounded by the vampire employees. After a long battle, all of the vampires are killed. Max calls in the legal team, also turned into vampires, as reinforcements. He then compels Amanda back into Ted’s office and leaves the three men to continue fighting.

Andrew kills vampire Dave because he never liked him and ends up in a confrontation with Tim during which they debate how their faceoff should end. Frank dies combating the vampires from Legal. Evan returns to Ted’s office where he and Amanda ultimately kill Max.

Afterwards, Tim finds Evan and Amanda making out amidst the carnage. The three of them calmly leave the building as day breaks. A cleaning woman arrives at the grisly scene and is attacked by Andrew.

Merger discussions between Clifton Gunderson and LarsonAllen commenced in the spring of 2011 and progressed rapidly, so that in the fall of that year they announced plans to merge the two firms. The merger occurred January 2, 2012. The decision to affiliate to Nexia rather than HLB International was taken after the merger.&lt;ref name=nexia-secures/&gt;

CLA emphasizes industry-specific services, as well as a focus on privately held companies and their owners, nonprofits, and governmental entities.&lt;ref name="merger-mania"&gt;{{cite news|title=Entering an era of mergers: Clifton Gunderson example of national trend|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/print-edition/2011/12/23/entering-an-era-of-mergers-clifton.html?page=all|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Business Journal|date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11552">[[File:GreatGoodFriend.jpg|thumb|right|An 1862 letter of condolence from [[Abraham Lincoln]] to [[Queen Victoria]] on the occasion of the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] shows the republican salutation "Great and Good Friend".]]
'''Diplomatic correspondence''' is correspondence between one state and another, usually – though not exclusively – of a formal character. It follows several widely observed customs and style in composition, substance, presentation, and delivery and can generally be categorized into letters and notes.

==Letters==
Letters are correspondence between [[head of state|heads of state]], typically used for the appointment and recall of ambassadors; for the announcement of the [[Demise of the Crown|death of a sovereign]] or an accession to the throne; or for expressions of congratulations or condolence.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt; 

Letters between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation "Sir My Brother" (or "Madame My Sister", in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction "Your Good Brother" (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). In the case where one monarch is of inferior rank to the other (for instance, if the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] were to correspond to the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]]), the inferior monarch will use the salutation "Sire" (or "Madame"), while the superior monarch may refer to the other as "Cousin" instead of "Brother".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;  If either the sender or the recipient is the head-of-state of a [[republic]], letters may begin with the salutation "My Great and Good Friend" and close with the valediction "Your Good Friend"; beneath the signature line will be inscribed "To Our Great and Good Friend [Name and Title of Recipient]".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Letters of credence===

{{Main|Letter of credence}}

[[File:Estonian Ambassador H.E. Mr Andres Unga presents his credentials to the Governor-General of Australia H.E. Ms Quentin Alice Louise Bryce. 28.03.2013 (8597769358).jpg|thumb|right|Estonian ambassador to [[Australia]] Andres Unga presents his letter of credence to Governor-General [[Quentin Bryce]] in 2013.]]

A '''letter of credence''' (''lettres de créance'') is the instrument by which a [[head of state]] appoints ("accredits") ambassadors to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="Foakes"&gt;Joanne Foakes, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kqXFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 The Position of Heads of State and Senior Officials in International Law]'' (Oxford University Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], ''International Law: A Treatise'' (Vol. 1, 2005: ed. Ronald Roxburgh), § 371, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as '''credentials''', the letter closes with a phrase "asking that credit may be given to all that the ambassador may say in the name of his [[Monarch|sovereign]] or Government."&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; The credentials are presented personally to the receiving country's head of state or viceroy in a formal ceremony. Letters of credence are worded carefully, as the sending or acceptance of a letter implies [[diplomatic recognition]] of the other government.&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; Letters of credence date to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Chaplais]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pR58WnXzh-wC&amp;pg=PA246 English Diplomatic Practice in the Middle Ages]'' ([[Hambledon and London]], 2003), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters of recall===

A letter of recall is formal correspondence from one head-of-state notifying a second head-of-state that he or she is recalling his state's ambassador.

===Full powers===
In cases where an envoy is entrusted with unusually extensive tasks that would not be covered by an ordinary permanent legation (such as the negotiation of a special [[treaty]] or convention, or representation at a diplomatic congress), an envoy may be given [[full powers]] (''pleins pouvoirs'') "in [[letters patent]] signed by the head of the State" designing "either limited or unlimited full powers, according to the requirements of the case."&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"/&gt;

According to ''Satow's Diplomatic Practice'', the bestowal of full powers traces its history to the Roman ''plena potestas''; its purpose &lt;blockquote&gt;was to be able to dispense, as far as possible, with the long delays needed in earlier times for referring problems back to higher authority. Their use at the present day is a formal recognition of the necessity of absolute confidence in the authority and standing of the negotiator.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notes==
[[File:Ambassador Kennedy After the Presentation of Credentials Ceremony (10941227714).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caroline Kennedy]], the [[United States Ambassador to Japan|United States ambassador to Japan]], departs [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] after presenting her credentials to [[Akihito]] in 2013.]]

===Note verbale===
{{main|Note verbale}}
A ''note verbale'' is the most formal form of note and is so-named as it originally represented a formal record of information delivered orally. Notes verbale are written in the third person and printed on official letterhead; they are typically [[seal (emblem)|sealed]] with an embosser or, in some cases, a stamp. All notes verbale begin with a formal [[salutation]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The [name of sending state's] Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honor to invite their attention to the following matter.}}

Notes verbales will also close with a formal [[valediction]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The Embassy avails itself of this opportunity of assuring the Ministry of its highest consideration}}

Notes verbales composed by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] are written on blue paper.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Collective note===
[[File:GreatSealPressImprinting.jpg|thumb|right|Formal correspondence originating from the U.S. State Department is sealed with the [[Great Seal of the United States]], which is embossed on a paper wafer using this 1903 letterpress.]]
A collective note is a letter delivered from multiple states to a single recipient state. It is always written in the [[Illeism|third person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acquah-Dadzie|first1=Kofi|title=World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: A Resource for Readers and Writers|date=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=0865164231|pages=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective note has been a rarely used form of diplomatic communication due to the difficulty in obtaining agreements among multiple states to the exact wording of a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|title=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=1137017619|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvarq4iy5MoC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identic note===
An identic note is a letter delivered from a single state to multiple recipient states. Examples include the identic note sent by [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|regarding action against the Barbary Pirates]] and that from the [[United States]] to [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929. In it, the United States called on the other two powers to resolve their differences over the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|Eastern China Railway]] peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murty|first1=Bhagevatula|title=The International Law of Diplomacy: The Diplomatic Instrument and World Public Order|date=1989|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=0792300831|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvoLbSGNBqsC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouts de papier===
A ''bout de papier'' (speaking note) may be presented by a visiting official when meeting with an official from another state at the conclusion of the meeting. Prepared in advance, it contains a short summary of the main points addressed by the visiting official during the meeting and, firstly, serves as a memory aid for the visiting official when speaking. It, secondly, removes ambiguity about the subject of the meeting occasioned by verbal miscues by the visiting official. Bouts de papier are always presented without credit or attribution so as to [[Plausible deniability|preserve the confidentiality]] of the meeting in case the document is later disclosed.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Démarches and aides-mémoire===
{{main|démarche|aide-mémoire}}
[[File:Aide-Memoire_handed_by_Lord_Hardinge_to_M._Briand.png|thumb|right|A British foreign office internal record of a 1921 aide-mémoire delivered to [[Aristide Briand]].]]
A ''[[démarche]]'' (non-paper) is considered less formal than the already informal bout de papier. Officially described as "a request or intercession with a foreign official" it is a written request that is presented without attribution from the composing state and is, therefore, delivered in-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protocol for the Modern Diplomat|date=2013|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|page=30|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/176174.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to a démarche, an ''[[aide-mémoire]]'' is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among multiple states for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved.

==Protocol==
[[File:Graf_Clemens_Metternich.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian foreign minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] threatened to correspond to the United Kingdom in German if it sent diplomatic correspondence to him in English, instead of French.]]
Standard diplomatic protocol varies from country to country, but generally requires clear yet concise translation between both parties.

===Language===
The earliest forms of diplomatic correspondence were, out of necessity, written in [[Latin]], Latin being a [[Lingua franca|common language]] among states of a linguistically diverse Europe. By the early 1800s French had firmly supplanted Latin as the language of diplomacy; on one occasion, in 1817, the British attempted to correspond with the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Imperial Court]] in English, prompting [[Klemens von Metternich]] to threaten retaliatory correspondence in [[German language|German]]. In modern times, French has largely been replaced by English as a diplomatic lingua franca in correspondence between two states that do not share a common tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Keith|title=The Practice of Diplomacy: Its Evolution, Theory, and Administration|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415497647|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
States may sometimes reject diplomatic correspondence addressed to them by returning the original copy to the sending state. This is done as a rebuff of the contents of the correspondence and is typically reserved for cases where the receiving state feels the language used by the sending state is rude, or the subject matter represents an inappropriate intercession into the receiving state's internal affairs.&lt;ref name="satow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Ivor|title=Satow's Diplomatic Practice|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199693552|pages=45–66|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dorice Reid''' (June 1943 – 16 June 2011), also known by the chiefly title '''Te Tika Mataiapo Dorice Reid''', was a [[Cook Islands|Cook Islander]] [[tourism]] official, [[businesswoman]] and judge.&lt;ref name=cin&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Te Tika dies suddenly, Influential woman leaders death shocks Polynesia |url=http://www3.cookislandsnews.com/2011/June/Wed15/te-tika.php |work=[[Cook Islands News]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2011-07-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065341/http://www3.cookislandsnews.com/2011/June/Wed15/te-tika.php |archivedate=2011-08-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Field|title=Star Cook Islander dies |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/5159318/Star-Cook-Islander-dies |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid enjoyed a long career in Cook Island [[business]], politics and [[tourism]] from the 1970s until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

==Biography==
Dorice Reid was born to parents Leo Morrel and Ruby Peyroux (''[[née]]'' Matamua), on [[Rarotonga]], [[Cook Islands]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She moved from Rarotonga to [[New Zealand]] when she was eight years old.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid became very influential among Cook Islanders living in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She initially worked as a sales representative for [[Air New Zealand]], a [[Radio Pacific]] [[talk show host]] and a journalist and reporter for [[South Pacific Television]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; Reid later became the first woman of [[Pacific Island]] descent to be nominated for a seat in the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] by a national political party.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid moved back from New Zealand to her birthplace of Rarotonga in 1983.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She took a position with the [[Cook Islands Tourist Authority]] as a [[sales manager]] and [[marketer]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; In 1985 she and her sister, Jeannine Peyroux, acquired the Little Polynesian Resort in Rarotonga. They renovated the small resort and it won two [[World Travel Awards]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

The members of the Takitumu council, one of the three Vaka councils on Rarotonga, bestowed the chiefly title ''Te Tika Mataiapo'' on Reid during the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; The title, which is named for the Cook Islands warrior Te Tika, was granted to Reid at a ceremony in [[Marae Te Pou Toru]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; Reid declined multiple requests to run for the Cook Islands Parliament, citing incongruity of engaging in politics while bearing a traditional title.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid became an advocate for tourism and the preservation of Cook Islands culture. Reid made several pilgrimages to [[Taputapuatea marae]], a traditional religious center of eastern [[Polynesia]] located in the [[commune]] of [[Taputapuatea]], [[Raiatea]], with other Polynesian [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She was also an active member of the [[Cook Islands Voyaging Society]].  In 1995, Reid served as the only female crew member on board the [[Te Au O Tonga]], which sailed to [[Raiatea]], [[Tahiti]], [[Nuku Hiva]] and [[Hawaii]] during a three and a half month voyage.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; In 2002, she completed a second sailing voyage aboard the ''Te Moana Nui O Kiva'' from her home in Rarotonga to [[Tahiti]], [[Huahine]], [[Raiatea]], [[Tahaa]], [[Bora Bora]] and [[Mitiaro]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Additionally, Reid was a member five separate Cook Islands environmental agencies and served as a judge for the country.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She is credited with the reintroduction of the [[raui system]] to the Cook Islands,&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; a traditional system forbidding access to or use of a resource, such as to a fishing lagoon or shellfish, for a certain period of time.&lt;ref name=nes&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=National Parks and Conservation Areas |url=http://www.environment.gov.ck/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=95 |work=Cook Islands National Environment Service |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010447/http://www.environment.gov.ck/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=95 |archivedate=2011-07-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is traditionally used to preserve scarce food resources and also encourages the protection of the environment.&lt;ref name=nes/&gt;

In April 2011, [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Foreign Minister]] [[Tom Marsters]] announced Reid's appointment as [[High Commissioner]] of the Cook Islands to New Zealand, based in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref name=rnzi&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Cook Islands appoints new High Commissioner to New Zealand |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=60299 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was to take office in July 2011, succeeding [[Mike Mitchell (Ambassador)|Mike Mitchell]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

Dorice Reid collapsed while attending a tourism conference in Auckland,&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; and died at Auckland Hospital at 1 AM on 16 June 2011, aged 67.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;  A resident of [[Kauare]], Rarotonga, she was survived by two nieces and a nephew.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

'''Dragutin Wolf''' (1866&amp;ndash;1927) was a [[Croatia]]n [[Jews|Jewish]] industrialist and founder of the food company [[Koestlin]] in [[Bjelovar]].

Wolf was born in [[Bjelovar]] to a Jewish family. With his wife Irma Wolf he had two sons, Slavko and Otto.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bjelovarac.hr/Novosti/tabid/5421/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/24171/-Nisam-razocarana-mrvicama-koje-sam-na-kraju-dobila-sa-Koestlinova-stola.aspx|title=Nisam razočarana mrvicama koje sam na kraju dobila sa Koestlinova stola|publisher=Gradski list Bjelovarac|language=Croatian|accessdate=March 4, 2013|date=3 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707112042/http://www.bjelovarac.hr/Novosti/tabid/5421/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/24171/-Nisam-razocarana-mrvicama-koje-sam-na-kraju-dobila-sa-Koestlinova-stola.aspx|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf owned a small bakery for bread and cakes in Bjelovar which was founded on November 11, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Radovi Zavoda za znanstvenoistraživački i umjetnički rad u Bjelovaru; Mirela Slukan Altić; ''Razvoj i izgradnja Bjelovara u kartografskim izvorima: Od vojne utvrde do slobodnog i kraljevskog grada'' (The development and building of Bjelovar in cartographic sources: from a military fort to a free royal city); stranica 28, 20. srpanj, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One decade later, Wolf started to focus on the production of baked goods with a prolonged shelf life. In 1905 he founded the food company "Tvornica keksa, dvopeka, biskvita i finih poslastica Dragutina Wolfa i sinova" (''Factory of biscuits, rusks and delicious pastries Dragutin Wolf and sons'') specialized in the [[confectionery]] products. Factory was placed in [[August Šenoa|Šenoa]] street near Wolf family villa. In 1921 company began to produce biscuits and wafers. Wolf lead the business with his sons and soon became one of the wealthiest people in Bjelovar. He owned the first car in Bjelovar and his family villa was most luxurious property in town. Wolf died in 1927 and was buried at a Jewish cemetery in Bjelovar. After his death his sons took over the company. In 1932 Otto and Slavko Wolf agreed cooperation with Koestlin in Hungary, which was founded by Hungarian industrialist Lajos Koestlin at the end of 19th. century, for marketing the products based on their recipes. They were also allowed to distribute the products under the Koestlin brand.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=bl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bjelovarskilist.hr/novosti/isplaceni-nasljednici-osnivaca-koestlina/|title=Isplaćeni nasljednici osnivača Koestlina|publisher=Bjelovarski list|language=Croatian|accessdate=March 4, 2013|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Radovi Zavoda za znanstvenoistraživački i umjetnički rad u Bjelovaru; Mladen Medar; ''Prilog istraživanju povijesti Židova u Bjelovaru'' (The Contribution to Research by Jewish History in Bjelovar); stranica 172, 20. srpanj, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Ruah Hadaša (Glasilo Židovske vjerske zajednice Bet Israel): Željko Karaula: ''Holokaust u Bjelovaru - nestanak Židovske zajednice u Bjelovaru tijekom razdoblja NDH'': stranica 27, broj 11, godina IV, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrepreneurs' Organization''' (EO) is a global [[non-profit organization]], whose stated mission is to "Engage leading entrepreneurs to learn and grow." EO was formerly known as '''Young Entrepreneurs' Organization''' (YEO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where the young and rich gather|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=20001004&amp;id=-1RIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lhQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5337,1018505|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|date=4 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc."/&gt; The organization was founded in 1987.&lt;ref name="Inc."/&gt;

== History ==
In 1987, 22 young [[entrepreneur]]s created an organization whose goal was stated to be "to provide learning and networking opportunities for its members". The Young Entrepreneurs' Organization (YEO) expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Within a few years, membership grew to include chapters in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
In 1996, YEO helped create the World Entrepreneurs’ Organization (WEO), which served as an alumni organization for YEO members who, after the age of 40, wanted to continue their involvement in an entrepreneurial membership organization. In 2005, YEO and WEO merged to form the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) as it is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About EO -- EO Timeline|url=https://www.eonetwork.org/about/eo-timeline|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding members ==
[[Verne Harnish]] is the founder of the Young Entrepreneurs’ Organization and recruited 22 entrepreneurs as founding board members to initially fund the start-up of the organization. [[Kevin_Harrington_(entrepreneur)|Kevin Harrigton]], of Shark Tank fame, was one of the founding board members.

== Additional programs ==

The Entrepreneurs' Organization runs two additional programs: the EO Global Student Entrepreneur Awards &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) Event|url=http://www.business.fau.edu/news-events/news-details/index.aspx?nid=258#.UnNcxuKUU8x|publisher=Florida Atlantic University|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsea.org|title=GSEA – Global Student Entrepreneur Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EO Accelerator Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accelerator.eonetwork.org/Pages/Default.aspx Eonetwork.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723215413/http://accelerator.eonetwork.org/Pages/Default.aspx |date=July 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EO Global Student Entrepreneur Awards (GSEA) is an awards program for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who own and operate a business. EO GSEA operates as an international series of competitions for student entrepreneurs who are attending a recognized high school, college or university, who own a for-profit business, are principally responsible for its operation and have been generating revenue for a minimum of six consecutive months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Lischer]] (23 November 2016);  ‘’[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/the-art-and-science-of-cu_b_13042744.html The Art and Science of Customer Interviews]’’, ''The Huffington Post''
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Entrepreneur Indicator ==

The Global Entrepreneur Indicator (GEI) began in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurindicator.com/about/|title=EO Global Entrepreneur Indicator — About — Entrepreneurs' Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a semi-annual survey of the membership of the Entrepreneurs’ Organization. The Global Entrepreneur Indicator surveys a globally representative sample of entrepreneurs to predict economic trends in a number of areas, including job creation, profits and debt loads, economic forecasting, and the business environment. 
In 2012, the GEI found that approximately 60% of businesses experienced a net profit, while 59% increased their employee headcount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalentrepreneurindicator.com/# Globalentrepreneurindicator.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608221026/http://globalentrepreneurindicator.com/ |date=June 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5226">'''Fredrik Georg Gade''' (4 June 1830 – 16 May 1905) was a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]].

He was born in [[Bergen]] as the son of merchant Fredrik Georg Gade and his wife Anna. His ancestor had migrated to Norway from [[Hannover]] in the second half of the eighteenth century. In February 1854 he married Ingeborg Wallem (1830–1902), a sister of [[Fredrik Meltzer Wallem]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gade, Fredrik Georg|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]]|edition=1st|first=Andreas|last=Paulson|authorlink=Andreas Paulson|year=1929|volume=4|pages=334–335|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gade began working in his father's manufacture business ''F. G. Gade'' around the age of [[Confirmation]], and took over the company in 1849. As he did not acquire burghership until 1853, the company was run by his first cousin [[Herman Baars]] in the first phase. The company eventually went well, and in 1877 Gade retired from business, buying the farm Øvre Fantoft in [[Fana]]. He developed the surrounding area, and even bought a [[stave church]] which stood at Fortun in [[Sogn og Fjordane]], had it moved and re-erected it as [[Fantoft stave church]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; This church burned down in 1993 under gloomy circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Campion|title=In the face of death|date=20 May 2005| publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gade also took much of the initiative to found the [[Nesttun–Os Railway]], and was an important shareholder.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

From 1880 to 1896 Gade was the [[United States|American]] [[consul (representative)|consul]] for all of [[Western Norway]], including the coast up to [[Vardø]] in the north. He also served on Bergen city council from 1880 to 1895, being a member of the movement which would become the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He successfully stood for election in 1882, and served one term in the [[Parliament of Norway]], from 1883 to 1885.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10890|title=Fredrik Georg Gade|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Johan Sverdrup]] became [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] in 1884, Gade was a candidate for a [[government minister]] position, but declined the offer. He wanted to back out of national politics, and only served as a deputy representative during the term 1886–1888.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Gade also founded two insurance companies, [[Vesta (company)|Vesta]] in 1880 and [[Hygea (company)|Hygea]] in 1884 (often branded as the same company, "Vesta-Hygea"),&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Livsforsikringsselskapet Hygea|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|first=|last=|volume=|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.storenorskeleksikon.no/Livsforsikringsselskapet_Hygea|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a board member of both companies until his death.

'''Luis Guillermo Pineda Rodas''' (born 1984, Guatemala) is a global studies expert, social scientist and entrepreneur. He has a MA, MSc from [[Leipzig University]] and [[Roskilde University]]. From 2009-2011 he worked at the [[Center for the Study of Capitalism]] as founder and executive director.

==Education==

Pineda holds a BA degree in international relations with a specialization in international commerce from [[Francisco Marroquín University]] (2008), an MA degree in global studies from the [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~gesi/ Global and European Studies Institute] at [[Leipzig University]] (2013) and a MSc degree in global studies from the Department of Society and Globalisation at [[Roskilde University]] (2013).  He also completed studies for an MA degree in social sciences from [[Francisco Marroquín University]] (2011).  During his studies of a master's degree in social sciences, Pineda founded the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130517084556/http://capitalismo.ufm.edu/index.php/At_a_Glance Center for the Study of Capitalism] in cooperation with his alma mater [[Francisco Marroquín University]].

==Research==

Pineda's scholarly work develops across the disciplines of global studies, urban history, sociology, politics, [[Objectivist philosophy]] and global history. His research has been published in a variety of social science magazines and journals, including ''The National Catholic Reporter'', ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'', etc. He has written non-scholarly articles for the online blogs since 2005.

His MSc research is related to the [http://rudar.ruc.dk/handle/1800/12416 Libertarian Free Cities in a global studies focus].  This project is the first academic research in the field of large scale city-building projects in Latin America.  He has also examined how cultural and national identities are constructed through conflicting collective memories in a political and cultural environment defined by historically changing borders and discourses in Guinea-Bissau and India.

After his MA from [[Leipzig University]], Pineda has engaged various areas of research. He writes and publishes on urban history and city-building from a global studies perspective.

Pineda worked as a teacher of Objectivist philosophy with high school and undergraduate students from 2009-11.  He completed three and a half years of study at the [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_index Objectivist Academic Center].  He has lectured at international conferences on the [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 history of capitalism] and currently does research related to urban anthropology and global studies at Roskilde University. In 2010 he edited an ebook version of Frederic Bastiat's essay ''[[The Law (1850 book)|The Law]]''.

Pineda is principally interested in how social sciences ideas and approaches can inform global political and global social theory in the study of contemporary politics and contemporary history.

In recent work Pineda has sought to develop an anthropological approach to city-building and [[Saskia Sassen]]'s [[global cities]]. In 2013 he published a project studying [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|the military coup]] staged by [[Guinea-Bissau]]’s army on the evening of 12 April 2012 and its linkage to foreign and local drug barons. Pineda proposed in his project that Guinea-Bissau should be recognized as the first legitimate [[narco-state]] in Africa and the world.

Via participation in the yearly held [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 Atlas Summit] in Washington, DC, Pineda has also taken an interest in [[Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand's]] philosophy and the methodological applications of Rand's philosophy to the study of global history and the history of capitalism.

His current research in Denmark involves the history of anthropological thought in the study of urbanism, and the connections between global approaches to social theory.

In 1986, Cartes spent 60 days in jail during a currency fraud investigation. He was accused of making millions of dollars on a central bank loan obtained at a preferential exchange rate and then moving it through his money exchange business before buying farm equipment in the U.S. The case was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name='Servin01'&gt;{{cite news | first = Pedro | last = Servin |author2=Michael Warren | title = Paraguay's new president woos foreign investment | date = 15 August 2013 | url = http://www.chron.com/news/crime/article/Paraguay-s-new-president-was-targeted-by-the-DEA-4734005.php | work = [[Houston Chronicle]] | accessdate = 17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Until 2008 Cartes was uninvolved in politics and he was not registered as a voter.&lt;ref name="brecha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505175930/http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Cartes' "good nose" for winning an election |date=26 April 2013 |publisher=Brecha |language=es |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the center-right Colorado Party in 2009 and said he wanted to counter the swing to the left in Latin American politics. He became known as an efficient politician uncompromised by his party's past support of the military dictatorship of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] who ruled until 1989.&lt;ref name="brecha"/&gt;

In regards to allegation of his connections to the drug trade, as well as being targeted by the [[DEA]],&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; he said during his presidential campaign: "I wouldn't want to be president if I had ties to drug traffickers. Go to the courts and check. There's nothing, not a single charge against me."&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

==President of Paraguay==
===Election===
Cartes was the Colorado candidate in the [[Paraguayan general election, 2013|2013 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brecha"/&gt; The BBC suggested that his convincing points during his campaign were the promises to raise private capital to upgrade the country's infrastructure, to modernise its public enterprises, to attract international investments, and to create jobs. On 21 April 2013, he was elected President of Paraguay with 45.80% of the vote.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  When he took office on 15 August, it marked only the second time in the country's 202 years of independence that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

In regards to the [[impeachment of Fernando Lugo]] and the hostile reception the country was given in the aftermath by Latin American leaders, Cartes said that the country should not withdraw from [[Mercosur]] due to its economic benefits of free trade: "Paraguay in no way should abandon Mercosur...we have to hold on tight while they bash us a little bit and keep low and don’t play to being giants or annoyed. Mercosur is a common market like is Europe and with our neighbours we also have many coincidences. [In a globalised world] all countries are interconnected and it is out of the questions trying to isolate Paraguay from other countries. The [[Organization of American States|OAS]] has already began to understand our politics, that we’re a sovereign country, all was done according to the book and the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/07/13/paraguayan-presidential-hopeful-said-the-country-should-in-no-way-abandon-mercosur |title=Paraguayan presidential hopeful said the country should in no way abandon Mercosur — MercoPress |publisher=En.mercopress.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being sworn in he said: "I'm not in politics to make a career of it or become wealthier. I'm in politics to serve my people, make the future better for new generations and build up our identity as a free, independent and sovereign people."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/paraguays-president-targeted-dea-19965694 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inauguration was attended by fellow conservative South American, Chilean President [[Sebastián Piñera]] who said: "I want to say to President Horacio Cartes that we are very expectant about his future achievements. The slogan of his campaign was 'new directions,' and every country needs new directions and to be confronted with new challenges...the challenge of integration in our Latin America is still a pending challenge and the experience of the [[Pacific Alliance]] was a great experience which has been very fruitful." Other leaders at his inauguration were Argentina's [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], Peru's [[Ollanta Humala]],&lt;ref name="cjile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovechile.cl/2013/08/16/chilean-president-piera-visits-paraguay-inauguration-president-horacio-cartes/89881 |title=Piñera visits Paraguay: Inauguration of President |publisher=Ilovechile.cl |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822125938/http://www.ilovechile.cl/2013/08/16/chilean-president-piera-visits-paraguay-inauguration-president-horacio-cartes/89881 |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's [[Dilma Rousseff]], Uruguay's [[José Mujica]] and Taiwan's [[Ma Ying-jeou]].&lt;ref name="arg"/&gt;

===Cabinet===
Cartes said of his cabinet that the future ministers have the "enormous responsibility" of honouring those who voted for them and gave them a governing mandate. "It will be the beginning of a story that us Paraguayans want, a government for all, an inclusive government, our great obligation is with the citizens...we need all the Paraguayans to help us, to orientate us."&lt;ref name="arg"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromlatinamerica/paraguay-president-elect-horacio-cartes-announces-cabinet/ |title=Paraguay: President-Elect Horacio Cartes Announces Cabinet - The Argentina Independent &amp;#124; The Argentina Independent |publisher=Argentinaindependent.com |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of them have an overwhelmingly technical profile:&lt;ref name="técnicos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/horacio-cartes-apuesta-por-un-gabinete-de-tecnicos-en-paraguay |title= Technocrat cabinet in Paraguay |date=14 August 2013 |publisher=América Economía|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
On May 21, 2018, the Paraguayan embassy moved to [[Jerusalem]], becoming the third country in the world to recognize the city as the diplomatic capital of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/05/21/paraguay-moves-embassy-to-jerusalem|title=Paraguay moves embassy to Jerusalem|last=|first=|date=2018-05-21|work=Euronews|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cartes's successor [[Mario Abdo Benítez]] reversed the decision on September 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/05/paraguay-jerusalem-embassy-moves-to-tel-aviv|title=Outcry from Israel after Paraguay moves its Jerusalem embassy back to Tel Aviv|last=|first=|date=2018-09-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation attempt===
On 22 April 2018, Cartes was elected to a full [[Senate of Paraguay|Senate]] seat, which he ran for in hopes of extending his political influence past his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Servin |first=Pedro |publisher=Star Tribune |title=Paraguay president withdraws resignation and Senate bid |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=http://www.startribune.com/paraguay-president-withdraws-resignation-and-senate-bid/486587181/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Senators would be sworn in on 30 June 2018, six weeks before Cartes's presidential term was scheduled to end, thus the need for Cartes to leave office before the expiration of his term, as the constitution states officials can not hold two offices concurrently. Consequently, on 28 May 2018, Cartes offered his resignation as President, which would have to be agreed to by [[Congress of Paraguay|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Aporrea |title=(VIDEO) Renunció presidente de Paraguay Horacio Cartes |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=https://www.aporrea.org/internacionales/n325762.html |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators were opposed to Cartes resigning and taking up the seat, stating it was unconsitutional. Opposition leaders were successful in blocking Cartes's resignation by boycotting the vote and not allowing a quorum to be present to vote on the resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Telesur |title=Paraguay: Opposition to Boycott Vote on Cartes's Resignation |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Paraguay-Opposition-Boycotts-Session-on-Cartess-Resignation-20180529-0021.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartes withdrew his bid to resign and be sworn in as a senator on 26 June 2018 after not receiving enough political support to carry through his plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Chron |title=Presidente paraguayo Horacio Cartes retira su renuncia |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |language=Spanish |url=https://www.chron.com/espanol/news/article/Presidente-paraguayo-Horacio-Cartes-retira-su-13027039.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial statements==
Leading to the 2013 presidential election, Cartes made controversial statements on the LGBT community, comparing it to "monkeys". He also said he would "shoot myself in the bollocks" if he were to discover a son who wanted to marry another man.&lt;ref name=next/&gt;

On 10 August 2018, when asked by a journalist about his response to a series of citizen protests on [[Yacyretá Dam]] deals and congressmen with pending criminal cases, Cartes responded "[[Rubber bullet]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes: “Balines de goma” |trans-title=Cartes: “Rubber bullets” |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/balines-de-goma-para-estudiantes-1729689.html |newspaper=[[ABC Color]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes sobre manifestantes: "Balines de goma" |trans-title=Cartes on protesters: "Rubber bullets" |url=https://www.ultimahora.com/cartes-manifestantes-balines-goma-n2700843.html |newspaper=[[Última Hora (Paraguay)|Última Hora]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartes later apologized for the remark, stating, "I want to express my apologies to the young people for the published expressions. I always encouraged them to express themselves and my goal is the peace of all Paraguayans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=¿Horacio Cartes no asume su exabrupto? |trans-title=Horacio Cartes does not assume his outburst? |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/al-final-cartes-pidio-disculpas-1729700.html |newspaper=[[ABC Color]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartes se disculpa por sugerir "balines de goma" contra secundarios |trans-title=Cartes apologizes for suggesting "rubber bullets" against high school students |url=https://www.ultimahora.com/cartes-se-disculpa-sugerir-balines-goma-contra-secundarios-n2700850.html |newspaper=[[Última Hora (Paraguay)|Última Hora]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">'''Israel Pollak''' ({{lang-he|ישראל פולק}}; 1909–1993) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born [[Romania]]n, [[Chile]]an and [[Israel]]i textile industrialist. He is best known for founding the Israel-based ''Polgat'' company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19810219&amp;id=cU80AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6GcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5304,1341251 Israel's Top Fashion House Aims for the Middle Class]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Israel Pollak was born to a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] Orthodox family in [[Borşa]], east [[Maramureș]]. In 1925, he moved to [[Gura Humorului]], [[Bukovina]], and later to [[Cernăuţi]]. While in Cernăuţi, he studied at ''[[yeshiva]]'' and at a textile plant. In 1935, he founded an enterprise of its kind in the city.

==Business career==
After [[World War II]], he emigrated to Chile where his brother Marcos had emigrated before the war. There with his brothers and brothers-in-law he founded the "Pollak Hnos." textile company. In 1960, [[Pinhas Sapir]], then Israel's Minister of Industry, invited Pollak to make ''[[aliyah]]'' and to establish a textile plant in [[Kiryat Gat]]. The Pollak's new company, ''Polgat'', grew into the largest textile, clothing and knitwear company in Israel. It eventually became a public corporation whose shares were traded on the [[Tel Aviv]] [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]]. In 1970, the Pollaks founded Bagir, a men's division for suits and jackets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/16/business/israel-couturier-sold-to-a-mass-marketer.html Israel couturier sold to a mass marketer, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1990, Pollak was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for his special contribution to society and the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1990 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashmag/Tashnab_Tashmag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, he was honored by the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In 1993, he was honored by the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] in [[Haifa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14008">'''Lean Higher Education''' (LHE) refers to the adaptation of [[lean thinking]] to higher education, typically with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Lean, originally developed at the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], is a management philosophy that emphasizes "respect for people" and "continuous improvement" as core tenets. Lean encourages employees at all organizational levels to re-imagine services from a customer's point of view, removing process steps that do not add value and emphasizing steps that add the most value. While the concept of "customers" and "products" is controversial in higher education settings, there are certainly diverse stakeholders who are interested in the success of colleges and universities, the most common of which are students, faculty, administrators, potential employers and various levels of government.

Lean in higher education has been applied both to administrative and academic services. Balzer&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) described such initiatives within university settings, including the critical factors for success and ways to measure progress. He noted that LHE can be effective to  respond to higher education's heightened expectations, reducing expenses in an era of rising costs, meeting demands of public accountability, and leveraging institutional resources to fulfill the educational, scholarship, and outreach missions of higher education. A comprehensive literature review examining Lean's impact on higher education has been published.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W.K., Francis, D., Krehbiel, T. &amp; Shea, N. (2016). A review and perspective on Lean in higher education. Quality Assurance in Education. 24(4). http://hdl.handle.net/2374.MIA/5995&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that Lean has a significant and measurable impact when used to improve academic and administrative operations. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout an entire institution. However, the authors noted that implementing Lean is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning.

Though the application of Lean management in higher education is more prevalent in administrative processes (e.g., admissions, registration, HR, and procurement) it also has been applied to academic processes (e.g., course design and teaching,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"]&lt;/ref&gt; improving degree programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,"]&lt;/ref&gt; student feedback,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/PI/sustainable-futures/Documents/RIEStudent%20Feedback_Briefing_050110_01.pdf Edinburgh Napier University "SUSTAINABLE FUTURES BRIEFING: RAPID IMPROVEMENT EVENT (RIE) – Student Feedback (Business School)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and handling of assignments) in an increasing number of cases.

Pioneering academic institutions who have implemented Lean include: [[Cardiff University]] (Wales), [http://www.napier.ac.uk/about/management/sustainable-futures/Pages/Sustainable-Futures.aspx Edinburgh Napier University] (Scotland), [http://www.mtu.edu/improvement/ Michigan Technological University] (USA), [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (USA), [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/governance/business-improvement-1228.php University of Aberdeen] (Scotland), [[University of Central Oklahoma]] (USA), [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/lean/ University of St. Andrews] (Scotland), [[Winona State University]] (USA) and others. A group of universities in the U.K. have formed LeanHEHub [http://www.leanhehub.ac.uk/]. In Scotland, the [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Scottish-Higher-Education-Improvement-Network-4913702/about Scottish Higher Education Improvement Network] (SHEIN)  is a collaborative network of HE professionals working within the area of continuous improvement. SHEIN exists to encourage the sharing of resources and best practice, online and face-to-face.

==Lean Principles==

Of great importance in the application of Lean management in any organization is the recognition and daily practice of the Lean principles: "Continuous Improvement" and "Respect for People." The "Respect for People" principle is challenging for management to implement, because most managers have risen to their level of responsibility based on their superior "fire-fighting" skills. With Lean, managers are coaches who guide their employees through a problem solving process. The employee learns how to ask themselves the questions that enable them to solve problems on their own, with the same or better quality that the manager would have achieved. Problems occur when managers cannot relinquish control, resulting in zero-sum (win-lose) outcomes for people and inferior results. In other words, one party gains at another party's expense, and the losers are much less willing to participate in continuous improvement. This outcome impedes teamwork and information flows, and discourages daily efforts by administration, faculty, and staff to improve processes. In order to function properly, Lean management must be understood and practiced in a plus-sum (win-win) manner. The "Respect for People" principle is required in order to sustain continuous improvement [http://leanprofessor.com/blog/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/].

==Lean Practices==

The origins of Lean practices date from late 19th- and early 20th-century industrial engineering. Lean practices have evolved over the decades since then to become much easier for non-specialists to understand and use. It is now common for people with backgrounds and interests far from industrial engineering to become highly competent Lean management practitioners. Therefore, the Lean management system has the benefit that everyone in an organization can apply the practices without the need for specialists.

Seminal work in the application of Lean to academic processes was done by Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani's faculty home page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413184757/http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; |date=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the early 2000s and is described in two papers: M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,".&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The former paper describes what individual faculty can do to improve their courses and delivery using Lean principles and practices. The latter paper describes what teams of faculty, staff, administrators, students, alumni, and employers can do to improve their courses using [[kaizen]] (literal translation: "change for the better"). Prof. Emiliani also produced a Kaizen Team Leader's Manual for improving academic courses and programs based on his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanprofessor.com/blog/resources/ Bob Emiliani, "Improving Higher Education" (2009), unpublished work]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Lean practices in academic processes are described in two papers written by Prof. Emiliani cited above (Refs. 2,3), and in the book ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences Between Lean in Higher Education and Lean in Other Sectors==

Lean in HE follows the same principles and practices of [[Lean management]] as applied in service, manufacturing, or government sectors. Lean management readily takes into account the unique governance structures of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/edu/2009/06/baldrige-national-quality-program/how-to-launch-lean-in-a-university.pdf Alisa Salewski (2009) "How to Launch Lean in a University", ASQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Lean management is responsive to the needs of multiple stakeholders in a non-zero-sum fashion and is therefore well-suited for the governance and ongoing improvement of HEIs.

The business of teaching in, or the back office administration of, Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) is similar to Lean management practiced in other service sectors because teaching and administration consist of repeatable transactional processes, in whole or part. Guidance for Lean implementation in HE administration, and, to a lesser extent in teaching, is presented in the book ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Balzer (2010) ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes'', Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Lean in Higher Education==

The impact of Lean in HE (namely in academic activities), have been studied and found to be potentially beneficial. The benefits include lead-time reduction, increase in throughput, lower cost, increased student satisfaction scores, etc. Reports analyzing Lean in higher education indicate that Lean principles are being successfully applied.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://standrewslean.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2016/10/Tobias-Langer-Dissertation.pdf Tobias Langer(2011) "The Application of Lean thinking for Improving Processes in Higher Education Institutions; Evidence from three UK case studies", Queens University Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.R. Parasmal, (2009) "Application of Lean Thinking in Higher Education", Strategum Consulting, India [http://www.strategum.in/component/option,com_ionfiles/fileid,13/func,download/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Radnor &amp; Giovanni Bucci (2011) "Analysis of Lean Implementation in UK Business Schools and Universities", Association of Business Schools [http://www.wbs.ac.uk/downloads/news/2011/03/abs-lean-report-exec-summary-march-2011-13008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Various HE stakeholders will likely perceive their organization to be substantially different or possess unique characteristics compared to other service organizations or businesses using Lean management. These reports, as well as a wide range of empirical results, show such perceptions to be erroneous.

==Criticisms of Lean Management==

The principal criticisms of Lean management are well known, relatively few in number, and have been constant over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2014/03/05/six-criticisms-lean/ Emiliani (2014) "Same Six Criticisms of Lean"]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers may view Lean management as undesirable if it is incorrectly implemented, because it could make them work harder, they might have less time to spend with customers, and, ultimately, they could lose their jobs. These criticisms, which will surely be voiced by faculty and staff in HE, are predictable &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/ Emiliani (2013) "Lean Must Do No Harm"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the result of zero-sum (win-lose) application of Lean management by senior managers.

Supporters of Lean might assert that Lean management can be conducted in a non-zero-sum (win-win) manner—the criticism is simply a result of misapplication of the central concepts.

During the 1970s, LexisNexis pioneered the electronic accessibility of legal and journalistic documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203721704577157211501855648?KEYWORDS=lexisnexis | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | first=Stephen | last=Miller | title=For Future Reference, a Pioneer in Online Reading | date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.&lt;ref name=twosix/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:LexisNexis.JPG|thumb|LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]
Currently a division of [[RELX Group]] (formerly Reed Elsevier),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/business/the-media-business-reed-elsevier-building-big-presence-in-the-us.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Edward A. | last=Gargan | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Reed-Elsevier Building Big Presence in the U.S. | date=October 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twosix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/12/01/Lexis-Nexis-founder-Don-Wilson-dies/UPI-36121164992489/ |title=Lexis-Nexis founder Don Wilson dies |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the [[Mead Paper|Mead Corporation]]. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.

On April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the capital letters in the name; it was then standard to capitalize the names of online services.&lt;/ref&gt;  LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt; In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Macmillan-Agrees-to-Sell-Michie-to-Mead/id-c5740ca1895b2bc50f15e9f481161d1d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] launched the [[Lexus]] line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for [[trademark infringement]] on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse "Lexus" with "Lexis". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word "Lexis". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division.&lt;ref&gt;A far greater number, although by no means a majority, thought of a television character; most thought of nothing at all.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-04/business/fi-194_1_lexus-cars |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Distinctiveness of 'Lexis' Trademark Cited Toyota Can't Call Car 'Lexus,' Judge Says |date=January 4, 1989 |author=James Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mead Data Cent. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.'' 702 [[F.Supp.]] 1031 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]] held that there was little chance of consumer confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554 Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales]'' 875 [[F.2d]] 1026 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called "Win a Lexus on Lexis!"

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.  The U.S. state of [[Illinois]] subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court.  On April 15, 2008, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dep't. of Revenue]]'', 553 U.S. 16 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a "unitary" business.

In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/03/business/company-news-nexis-agrees-to-purchase-of-riskwise-international.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; NEXIS AGREES TO PURCHASE OF RISKWISE INTERNATIONAL | date=June 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Barringer| first = Felicity| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 1998-04-28| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, [[Quicklaw]]. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anderson Publishing - LexisNexis Company Information| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/anderson.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder [[Michael Brauser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14giuliani.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giuliani Firm Stood to Benefit From U.S. Deals, Florida Company’s Files Show | date=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/business/company-news-reed-elsevier-to-acquire-seisint-for-775-million.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; REED ELSEVIER TO ACQUIRE SEISINT FOR $775 MILLION | date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seisint housed and operated the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX).

On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/09/news/midcaps/lexisnexis/index.htm | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis customer IDs stolen | date=2005-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that number greatly increased to over 310,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/12/technology/personaltech/lexis/?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis acknowledges more ID theft | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first1=Caleb | last1=Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased [[data aggregator]] [[ChoicePoint]] (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion.  The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/ |title=LexisNexis Risk Solutions |publisher=LexisNexis.com |accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141113/NEWS/311139944|author=Adam Rubenfire|title=LexisNexis to acquire Health Market Science|work=Modern Healthcare|date=13 November 2014| accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal content offerings==
LexisNexis services are delivered via two websites that require separate paid [[subscription]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9906/04/college.idg/index.html?iref=allsearch |work=CNN |title=Surf your way into college |date=June 4, 1999 |author=Jennifer Peltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a company news release, LexisNexis hosts over 30 [[terabyte]]s of content on its 11 mainframes (supported by over 300 midrange UNIX servers and nearly 1,000 Windows NT servers) at its main [[datacenter]] in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |title=Data Center Facts for LexisNexis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110101452/http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |website=Lexisnexis.com |date=2014-03-19 |archive-date=2006-10-10|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lexis database contains current [[United States]] statutes and laws and a large volume of published case opinions dating from the 1770s to the present, as well as publicly available [[Non-publication|unpublished]] case opinions from 1980 onward. In 2000, Lexis began building a library of briefs and motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |publisher=Business Network |title=LexisNexis Litigation Services Enhanced with Briefs, Motions, Pleadings |date=February 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119164740/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |archivedate=November 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, Lexis also has libraries of statutes, case judgments and opinions for jurisdictions such as [[France]], [[Australia]], Canada, [[Hong Kong]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as well as databases of law review and legal journal articles for countries for which materials are available.

Previously, LexisNexis had a stripped-down free version (known as LexisOne) but this has been discontinued
and replaced by Lexis Communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/portal/ LexisNexis® Legal Newsroom]. Lexisnexis.com (2013-08-05). Retrieved on 2013-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides news and blogs across a variety of legal areas.

===LexisNexis UK===
The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) .&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk |title=LexisNexis UK – Butterworths – Tolley Innovative Business, Legal Solutions |website=Lexisnexis.co.uk |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]], [[Coventry]]. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle [[Joseph Butterworth]], the great law bookseller of [[Fleet Street]]. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by [[International Publishing Corporation]] in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = FOB: Firms Out of Business| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/fob_search_results.cfm?FOBFirmName=Butterworths&amp;FOBNote=&amp;fob-submit.x=0&amp;fob-submit.y=0&amp;fob-submit=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = –| last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the [[Reed Elsevier]] Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the "LexisNexis", "Butterworths" and "Tolley" trade marks. Such publications include ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' and the ''[[All England Law Reports]]'', amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems ("CRMs"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"/&gt;

Pursuant to instructions from Chinese authorities, in 2017 LexisNexis withdrew Nexis and LexisNexis Academic from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=LexisNexis withdrew two products from Chinese market |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-censorship-journal-lexisnexis-idUSKCN1B21D6 |first=Kate |last=Holton |editor-first=Louise |editor-last=Heavens |date=August 27, 2017 |access-date=August 29, 2017 |quote=“Earlier this year LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions in China was asked to remove some content from its database,” LexisNexis said in a statement. “In March 2017, the company withdrew two products (Nexis and LexisNexis Academic) from the Chinese market.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''limit price''' (or '''limit pricing''') is a price, or [[pricing strategies|pricing strategy]], where products are sold by a supplier at a price low enough to make it unprofitable for other players to enter the market.

It is used by [[monopoly|monopolists]] to discourage entry into a [[Market (economics)|market]], and is illegal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Milgrom]] and [[Donald John Roberts|John Roberts]], 1982.  "Limit Pricing and Entry under Incomplete Information: An Equilibrium Analysis," ''Econometrica'', 50(2).  pp. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/archive/refs4245.pdf 443-459.]&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity produced by the incumbent firm to act as a deterrent to entry is usually larger than would be optimal for a monopolist, but might still produce higher [[economic profits]] than would be earned under [[perfect competition]].

The problem with limit pricing as strategic behavior is that once the entrant has entered the market, the quantity used as a threat to deter entry is no longer the incumbent firm's [[best response]]. This means that for limit pricing to be an effective deterrent to entry, the threat must in some way be made credible. A way to achieve this is for the incumbent firm to constrain itself to produce a certain quantity whether entry occurs or not.  An example of this would be if the firm signed a union contract to employ a certain (high) level of labor for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Carlton"&gt;Dennis W. Carlton and Jeffery M. Perloff, 2004. ''Modern Industrial Organization'', 4th edition,  [http://www.lavoisier.fr/notice/frSWORK23A3RW32O.html Description.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is to build excess production capacity as a commitment device.

It is important to note that due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a market monopoly. When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring.

==Simple example==
In a simple case, suppose industry [[demand]] for good X at market price P is given by:

 &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Q^D} = a - bP&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose there are two potential producers of good X, Firm A, and Firm B. Firm A has no [[fixed costs]] and constant [[marginal cost]] equal to &lt;math&gt; c &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Firm B also has no fixed costs, and has constant marginal cost equal to &lt;math&gt;gc&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (so that Firm B's marginal cost is greater than Firm A's).

Suppose Firm A acts as a monopolist. The profit-maximizing monopoly price charged by Firm A is then:

 &lt;math&gt;p^M = \frac{a + cb}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

Since Firm B will never sell below its marginal cost, as long as &lt;math&gt;p^M \le gc&lt;/math&gt;, Firm B will not enter the market when Firm A charges &lt;math&gt;p^M&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the market for good X is an effective monopoly if:

 &lt;math&gt;g \ge \frac{a + cb}{2cb}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose, on the contrary, that:

 &lt;math&gt;g &lt; \frac{a + cb}{2cb}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, if Firm A charges &lt;math&gt;p^M&lt;/math&gt;, Firm B has an incentive to enter the market, since it can sell a positive quantity of good X at a price above its marginal cost, and therefore make positive profits. In order to prevent Firm B from having an incentive to enter the market, Firm A must set its price no greater than &lt;math&gt;gc&lt;/math&gt;. To maximize its profits subject to this constraint, Firm A sets price &lt;math&gt;p^L = gc&lt;/math&gt; (the limit price).

'''Linda Lee Thomas''' (November 17, 1883 – May 20, 1954) was an American socialite and the wife of [[musical theatre]] composer [[Cole Porter]].

==First marriage==
She was born Linda Belle Lee to the prominent [[Lee family]] of Virginia. Her father was Louisville banker William Paca Lee and her mother Lily Lee (née Hill). Friends introduced her to [[Edward Russell Thomas]], a son of [[Union Army]] general Samuel Thomas and owner of the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' (and who later became the first [[United States|American]] to kill someone in a [[car accident]]). They married on June 29, 1901, at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. She was 17. They lived a life of luxury, with houses in Palm Beach, Manhattan, and Newport. It was said that her favorite "department store" was [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]]. They divorced on October 26, 1912,&lt;ref name="ertobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1926/07/07/archives/-e-r-thomab-noted-sportsm-xis-was-an-owner-of-the-morning-telegraph.html E. R, THOMAS, NOTED SPORTSMAN, DIES], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (July 7, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly due to his abuse.

==Marriage to Porter==
Thomas and Cole Porter met on January 30, 1918, at the wedding of Henry Potter Russell to heiress Ethel Borden Harriman, daughter of railroad and investment banking tycoon [[J. Borden Harriman]] and his wife, née [[Florence Jaffray Harriman|Florence "Daisy" Hurst]], at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]].

Linda and Cole were married on December 18, 1919, in the city hall of the [[18ème arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mcbrien | first = William | title = Cole Porter | publisher = Knopf | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-394-58235-7 |page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 to 1939 the Porters lived at 13 rue Monsieur, a house next door to [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and with a garden adjoining the future residence of [[Nancy Mitford]]. They were married 34 years, and although they had no children born of their marriage, Linda conceived and miscarried. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Cole Porter, Linda Lee Thomas, Bernard Berenson, and Howard Sturges in gondola, 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Cole Porter, Linda Lee Thomas, Bernard Berenson, and Howard Sturges in gondola, 1923]]

Linda died from [[emphysema]] in 1954, in the couple's apartment in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Towers]].  She left an estate of over $1.5 million (over ${{Inflation|US|1.5|1954|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in which Cole inherited a lifetime interest.  She was buried in the Porter family plot at Mount Hope Cemetery in [[Peru, Indiana]].

==Portrayals==
Thomas is portrayed by [[Alexis Smith]] in the 1946 film ''[[Night and Day (1946 film)|Night and Day]]'' and by [[Ashley Judd]] in the 2004 film ''[[De-Lovely]]''.
A one-woman show about Linda's life with Porter, ''[[Love, Linda: The Life Of Mrs. Cole Porter]]'', starring jazz vocalist [[Stevie Holland]], ran [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[York Theatre]], in 2013.

'''Logic-based therapy''' (LBT) is a proposed modality of [[philosophical counseling]] developed by philosopher Elliot D. Cohen beginning in the mid-1980s. It is a philosophical variant of [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT), which was developed by psychologist [[Albert Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raabe|first=Peter B.|title=Philosophical Counseling: Theory and Practice|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Schlomit|title=Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Use of Syllogism in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=[[Journal of Counseling &amp; Development]]|year=1987|volume=66|issue=1|pages=37–39|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1987.tb00779.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been no independent, controlled studies to measure its therapeutic value or advantages over classical REBT.

== Overview ==

According to the theory of LBT, people decide to make themselves upset emotionally and behaviorally by deducing self-defeating emotional and behavioral conclusions from irrational premises.&lt;ref name=robertson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Donald|title=REBT, Philosophy, and Philosophical Counseling|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2000|volume=3|series=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title='Philosophical Counseling: Some Roles of Critical Thinking'. In Ran Lahav &amp; Maria Da Venza Tillmans (ed.) Essays in Philosophical Counseling|year=1995|publisher=University Presses of America|location=New York|pages=121–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBT retains the theoretical base of the cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, insofar as it contends emotional and behavioral problems to be rooted in malignant and maladaptive thought processes and patterns. LBT considers itself not only a type of philosophical counseling, but a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the same time, LBT remains firmly planted in philosophy by way of the use of [[formal logic]], [[informal logic]], phenomenological [[intentionality]], and philosophical antidotes in conceptualizing and treating [[mental disorder]]s and psychosocial difficulties.

In contrast to classical REBT, LBT recasts REBT's [[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Theoretical assumptions|A-B-C model]] of psychological disturbance into [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Syllogizing RET: Applying Formal Logic in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive Behavior Therapy|year=1992|volume=10|series=1|pages=235–252|doi=10.1007/BF01062377|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to classical REBT, there are three psychological points: Point A (Activating event), Point B (Belief system), and Point C (behavioral and emotional Consequence). Ellis argued that the Activating event itself does not cause people to be upset (C); they require also a set of Beliefs that, in conjunction with the event, causes a self-defeating behavioral and emotional Consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors|year=2001|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not just having recently been divorced (Point A) that causes a depression (point C), but also the belief that this event is awful and the worst thing that could have happened. Thus, according to Ellis, by finding the particular Activating event and Belief, one can find out what is causing one's depression (C). Clients can then work on changing their Belief system and their behavior to overcome the depression.

LBT translates the A-B-C model of psychological disturbance into a form of [[deductive logic]], in particular, syllogistic logic. According to its logic-based approach, the causal model Ellis advanced is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Principles of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2006|volume=6|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression is not caused by events that occur inside (Point B) and outside (Point A) one's subjective world. Instead, one decides to feel depressed by deducing a conclusion from a set of premises.&lt;ref name=robertson/&gt; For example, one may depress oneself by setting up this syllogism:

# If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.
# I was divorced.
# So, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.

== Syllogistic logic ==

A [[syllogism]] is a [[deductive]] form of reasoning having two premises and a conclusion. The idea that the reasoning behind our [[emotions]] and behavior can be so ordered in terms of a syllogism was in fact an insight of Aristotle, who called this kind of syllogism a "[[practical syllogism]]." The distinctive feature of this type of deductive reasoning is that the conclusion prescribes something. That is, it evaluates or rates the thing in question instead of merely describing it. For example, in concluding that something is terrible, a person is negatively rating it, and therefore will act or tend to act and feel negatively toward it. In fact, Aristotle went so far as to claim that the conclusion of a practical syllogism was always an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKeon|first=Richard|title=The Basic Works of Aristotle|year=1941|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LBT, by syllogizing one's behavioral and [[emotional reasoning]] in terms of the practical syllogism, one is in a better position to find one's irrational premises, refute them, and replace the unsound reasoning with sound "antidotal" reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=What Would Aristotle Do? Self-Control Through the Power of Reason|year=2003|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amhert, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the first premise in the above syllogism is irrational because one is exaggerating just how bad the divorce is (thinking of it as though it were on the level of a catastrophic disease or natural disaster).

== Intentional objects and their ratings ==

LBT also accepts the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] thesis that every mental state, including emotions, has a so-called "intentional object" or "[[object of the mind]]." That is, there is always an object to which a mental state refers or is about. Thus, if one is depressed, then one is depressed ''about'' something. This intentional object is represented in the descriptive minor premise of the emotional reasoning, for example, the premise "I was divorced" in the aforementioned syllogism.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Critical Thinking Unleashed|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the syllogisms comprising emotional reasoning always rate the emotional object or some aspect of it.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; For example, in the aforementioned syllogism, one rates one's divorce as being "terrible". This rating element is represented in the consequent (then clause) of the major premise of the syllogism, as in the premise "If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead." Accordingly, the syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be constructed by first finding the intentional object (O) of one's emotion; and second, by finding the rating (R) of the emotion. As such, the valid, hypothetical structure of a syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be symbolized as follows:

# If O then R
# O
# Therefore R

Further, according to LBT, all emotions can be uniquely identified by their specific object (O) and rating (R) elements.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; For example, the O of anger is always an action; and the rating is a strong negative evaluation of the action itself or the individual performing the action. In depression, the O is an event or state of affairs; and the R is a strong negative rating of the said event or state of affairs, on the basis of which one strongly negatively rates one's own existence. Thus, one may rate one's divorce as terrible, on the basis of which one gives one's own existence a strongly negatively evaluation.

== Higher order premises &lt;!--Section linked from [[Coherence therapy]] and [[List of maladaptive schemas]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt; ==
{{See also|Coherence therapy#Hierarchical organization of constructs}}
LBT permits clients to trace their inferences to higher order premises that might be at the root of an emotional and behavioral disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Process of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Pratiche Filosofiche|year=2003|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by questioning why having been divorced is so bad, another higher level syllogism can be uncovered:

# If I was divorced, then that makes me a worthless loser.
# If that makes me a worthless loser then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.
# So, if I was divorced, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.

Even higher order premises at the root of the behavioral and emotional disturbance can be uncovered, for example, by asking why being divorced makes one a worthless loser. For example, this higher order syllogism might be uncovered:

# I must always be perfect and never fail at anything.
# If I must always be perfect and never fail at anything, then if I was divorced, that makes me a worthless loser.
# So, if I was a divorced then that makes me a worthless loser.

In this way, the [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be traced back to a demand for perfection from which a person is deducing their own worthlessness, from which they are in turn deducing the horribleness of what happened.

In contrast to classical REBT, LBT identifies positive [[virtue]]s that can be used to guide a person in overcoming his or her irrational beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tukiainen|first=Arto|title=Philosophical Counselling as a Process of Fostering Wisdom in the Form of Virtues|url=http://www.practical-philosophy.org.uk/journal/pdf/10-1%20047%20Tukiainen%20-%20Fostering%20Virtues.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rational&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The New Rational Therapy: Thinking Your Way to Serenity, Success, and Profound Happiness|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to LBT, all basic irrational beliefs ("cardinal fallacies") identified by REBT theorists and philosophers are related to "transcendent virtues" that can overcome them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Mike w.|title=Happiness, Virtue, and Truth in Cohen's Logic-Based Therapy|journal=[[International Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|year=2007|volume=21|series=1|pages=129–133|doi=10.5840/ijap200721122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart displays each such irrational belief and its respective trumping virtue:&lt;ref name=rational /&gt;

== LBT's positive psychology ==

LBT thereby includes a "[[positive psychology]]" in addition to the classical REBT emphasis on refuting irrational beliefs. As a philosophical counseling approach, LBT also applies philosophical antidotes derived from the philosophies of antiquity to help clients strive toward their transcendent virtues.&lt;ref name=rational /&gt; For example, the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]] that says to "treat oneself and others as ends in themselves and not as mere means" can be used as an antidote to damnation of self or others, and thus as a sort of recipe to attaining the transcendent virtue of respect for self and others. Similarly, [[Frederich Nietzsche]]'s theory about human suffering, which says that suffering can make one stronger and nobler, can be used as an antidote to catastrophic thinking ("Awfulizing") about personal loss, thereby building courage in confronting the loss and using it to create new positive meanings and values in one's existence.

== Cultivation of willpower ==

LBT also emphasizes willpower in changing and redirecting beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Logic-Based Therapy: The New Philosophical Frontier for REBT|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/logic.html/|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it makes no commitment to the existence of free will in any metaphysical sense, it recognizes the practical value of building "willpower muscle" as a means to overcoming [[cognitive dissonance]] and working towards one's transcendent virtues. LBT emphasizes and promotes the power one has to change the way in which an event or situation is interpreted by altering one's thought patterns.

== Logic-based therapy and psychotherapy ==

While LBT is a form of philosophical counseling, since it addresses client's emotional problems and provides systematic ways of resolving them it can also be considered a form of [[psychotherapy]]. More specifically, because its focus on the client's cognitions and behaviors in relation to emotional functioning and relationship with REBT it is also a type of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, LBT differentiates itself from some other forms of CBT by emphasizing how premises about emotions are deduced and inferred from experiences in the world: LBT suggests that all emotional responses have a logical structure to them. The fact that emotions contain logical structures which can be subject to investigation and revision was also supported in the philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]]'s cognitivist theory of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=R. C.|title=The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life|origyear=1976|year=1993|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
LBT further differs from other forms of psychotherapy. For example, [[psychoanalytic]] or psychodynamic traditions will look for the underlying causes of emotional problems. These approaches will explore the client's early relationships with significant others (e.g., parental figures) and their effect on current relationships and resultant emotional and behavioral disturbances. Interpretation is utilized to provide the client with insights into their psychic organization. In contrast (but like other types of CBT), LBT does not place any particular emphasis on past relationships or the causes of problems and is even less concerned with interpretation. Instead, LBT remains philosophical insofar as it examines reasoning and logical structures created by client. The emphasis is not on the "why" of a problem, but on the "how"; that is, how the person deduces their emotional position and ways in which to alter it for more adaptive thinking and functioning.

LBT's emphasis on the "willpower muscle" suggests the ability of agency and choice in regard to therapeutic change. Based upon the rejection of a [[deterministic]] causative framework in favor of a nondeterministic perspective, LBT maintains compatibility with [[existentialism]] and [[existential psychotherapy]]. This position of choice is central to existentialist philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s thinking on human freedom and responsibility, which is one of existential psychotherapist [[Irvin Yalom]]'s "existential givens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yalom|first=I.|title=Existential Psychotherapy|year=1980|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, clients are encouraged to confront their inherent freedom by way of choosing how to interpret situations. As philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] and others have suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2008|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |authorlink=David D. Burns |date=1999 |origyear=1980 |title=Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy |edition=Revised and updated |location=New York |publisher=Avon |isbn=9780380810338 |oclc=42712412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruno |first=Frank Joe |date=1993 |title=Psychological Symptoms |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=047155281X |oclc=26353314}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients can become a "master over moods" by taking responsibility for their moods and emotions and subsequently revising them. Furthermore, this can lead to different ways of thinking about and experiencing the world with the accompanied creation of new [[Meaning (existential)|meanings in life]].

== Criticisms and limitations ==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
LBT emphasizes the client's used of deductive logic in their emotional reasoning, which places focus on the cognitive aspect of emotion. As such, it ignores the importance of physiological states and bodily sensations to emotional life, and might be an overly cognitive approach and a way to "control" emotions. However, LBT contends that it is the entire experience that contributes to the person's emotional reasoning. This includes the experienced event, any thoughts or beliefs related to the event as well as physiological reactions.

With a LBT counselor's knowledge of deductive logic, a power differential may be created between the counselor and the client. This could result in the client seeking the "correct" way of deducing premises and develop an overreliance on the LBT counselor. However, the goal is to create more flexible and open ways of interpreting the world and extinguish "absolutist" thinking or unrealistic expectations as a result of a collaborative [[therapeutic relationship]]. However, understanding and changing one's inferences and logical structures requires a certain level of intellectual ability, and consequently, may limit the application.

Although an activating event, such as a divorce or loss of a job, objectively is not on the same level as a catastrophic event, rushing to the conclusion that it is irrational for the client to think that way is potentially invalidating the intensity of the client's subjective emotional experience. Regardless, [[Empathy|empathic understanding]] and the building of therapeutic rapport is an important component to all psychotherapies and counseling methods and is no less important in LBT.

While LBT may be conceptually sound and have firm theoretical roots, much of psychotherapy and counseling research emphasizes the importance of [[evidence-based practice]], that is, interventions and therapeutic approaches that have scientific evidence for their efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodheart|first=C. D.|title=Evidence-based Psychotherapy: Where Practice and Research Meet|year=2006|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|location=Washington D. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this, to establish LBT's efficacy and effectiveness empirical validation must occur through psychotherapy research methodology if it is to be considered valid by the psychotherapeutic or counseling communities. Although no such evidence is available, anecdotal evidence for LBT's effectiveness as well as its close relationship with CBT presents it as a possible therapeutic modality.

Management is a type of labor but with a special role-coordinating the activities of inputs and carrying out the contracts agreed among inputs, all of which can be characterized as "decision making."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://business.illinois.edu/josephm/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%205/Fama%20(1980).pdf|title = Agency Problems and the Theory of the Firm|last = Fama|first = Eugene|date = 2008-08-24 &lt;!--  12:58 --&gt; |journal = The Journal of Political Economy|access-date = 2015-10-30|doi=10.1086/260866|volume=88|issue = 2|pages=288–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers usually face disciplinary forces by making themselves irreplaceable in a way that the company would lose without them. A manager has an incentive to invest the firm's resources in [[asset]]s whose value is higher under him than under the best alternative manager, even when such investments are not value-maximizing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X89900998|title = Management entrenchment: The case of manager-specific investments|last = Shleifer|first = Andrei|date = November 1989|journal = Journal of Financial Economics|access-date = 2015-10-30|doi=10.1016/0304-405X(89)90099-8|volume=25|pages=123–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managerial entrenchment theory ==
When managers hold little [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and shareholders are too dispersed to take action against non-value maximization behavior, insiders may deploy corporate actions to obtain personal benefits, such as shirking and perquisite consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dividend Policy, Corporate Governance and the Managerial Entrenchment Hypothesis: An Empirical Analysis|journal = Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1468-5957|pages = 1173–1209|volume = 30|issue = 9–10|doi = 10.1111/j.0306-686X.2003.05624.x|first = Jorge|last = Farinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ownership and control is divided within a company, [[agency costs]] arise. However [[agency costs]] decline if the ownership within the company increases as managers are responsible for a larger cost of these [[shares]]. On the other hand, given ownership to a manager within a company may translate into greater voting power which makes the manager's workplace more secure. Hence, they gain protection against takeover threats and the current managerial market.

=== Examples of entrenchment strategies ===
There are a variety of entrenchment practices that managers may employ, such as poison pills, super majority amendments, anti-takeover devices, or the so-called golden parachutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/handle/10016/6611/indemwp0901.pdf?sequence=5|title = IS MANAGERIAL ENTRENCHMENT ALWAYS BAD?

* Poison pills - There are two types of poison pills:  1. A "flip-in" allows existing shareholders (except the acquirer) to buy more shares at a discount.  2. A "flip-over" allows stockholders to buy the acquirer's shares at a discounted price after the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poison Pill Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Golden parachutes are contracts given to key executives and can be used as a type of antitakeover measure taken by a firm to discourage an unwanted takeover attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Golden Parachute Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenparachute.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-takeover devices-Companies have many different options for preventing takeovers. Continuous provisions include stipulations in the corporate covenant and issues of participating preferred stock. The sporadic measures include the pac-man and macaroni defenses, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-Takeover Measure Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anti-takeovermeasure.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corporate amendment in a company's charter requiring a large majority (anywhere from 67-90%) of shareholders to approve important changes, such as a merger.  This is sometimes called a "supermajority amendment". Often a company's charter will simply call for a majority (more than 50%) to make these types of decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supermajority Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supermajority.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managerial entrenchment and capital structure decision ==

=== Associations between the two ===
There are associations between managerial entrenchment and capital structure decisions which mostly result on the fact that [[CEO]]s are reluctant to go into [[debt]] when funding an investment. The capital structure is the way that the company chooses to fund its own operations and growth. Debt comes in the form of [[bond issues]] or long-term notes payable, while equity is classified as [[common stock]], [[preferred stock]] or [[retained earnings]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capital Structure Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US|date = 2004-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many models suggest that the manager keeps the [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] level according to where the firm mostly maximizes its value. The efficient choice of debt (optimal for shareholders) generally differs from the entrenchment choice (optimal for managers whose objective is to maximize tenure).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Research ===
[[Cross-sectional studies]] suggest that there is low leverage on firms where the CEO has characteristics associated with entrenchment. A characteristic would be if the CEO has years of experience in the same company. Low leverage was also persistent in companies which had no pressure or strong discipline over their CEOs. Events like the involuntary departure of the CEO and the arrival of a new large [[stockholder]] would gradually increase the levels of leverage comparing to before the events were to occur. Leverage also increases after CEOs are subjected to greater performance incentives in the form of increased inventories of [[stock options]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Managerial Entrenchment and Capital Structure Decisions on JSTOR|jstor = 2329441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, during takeover threats, managers tend to increase debt in order to increase the firm's value, making it more difficult for the takeover to occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the manager's job is secure. In a sample of target firms that levered up the most, 37 percent of the managers lost their jobs within a year of the failed takeover attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Managerial Turnover and Leverage under a Takeover Threat|journal = The Journal of Finance|date = 2002-12-01|issn = 1540-6261|pages = 2619–2650|volume = 57|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/1540-6261.00508|first = Walter|last = Novaes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
According to the above research, there are three possible actions managers could take to entrench themselves in association with the [[gearing ratio]]:
* Managers are reluctant towards leverage as it concerns the firm's growth and activity. At the same time, they have the tendency to protect under-diversified human capital.
* Managers increase leverage above optimal point to increase their voting power of their stocks/shares with the aim of minimizing placement attempts.
* Managers sometimes allow excess leverage which is a temporary sign that assets are being sold and reorganized. This prevents attempts from outsiders as they might have different projects on how the company should grow.

== Managerial entrenchment and corporate governance  ==

=== Corporate governance and firm value ===
Corporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of the many stakeholders in a company - these include its shareholders, employees,  management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporate Governance Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger corporate governance is associated with a higher firm valuation and corporate governance mechanisms can be classified into a number of categories such as regulatory mechanisms, disclosures, shareholder rights, ownership structures, and board monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://thejournalofbusiness.org/index.php/site/article/viewFile/228/228|title = Governance, Managers' Entrenchment and Performance: Evidence in French Firms Listed in SBF 120|last = Moussa|first = sonia|date = 2009|journal = The Journal of Business|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 04/11/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However through management entrenchment, ownership structure (one of the corporate governance mechanisms) changes in that way which benefits the managers. We already know from the above information that managers have a greater voting power while they are entrenched. A study carried out by Mock et al. on the relationship between manager ownership and firm's value found that as manager ownership increases, the firm's value increases as well, however not in the case where the manager is entrenched. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis suggests that a firm's market valuation should rise as its management owns an increasingly large portion of the firm. On the other hand, the entrenchment hypothesis suggests that as management increases its ownership, the incentive to maximize value declines as market discipline becomes less effective against a larger shareholding manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is your Management Aligned with Shareholders or Entrenched?|url = http://www.fusioninvesting.com/2011/04/is-your-management-aligned-with-shareholders-or-entrenched/|website = Fusion Investing and Analysis|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the entrenchment effect will dominate the incentive effect only for medium concentrated levels of management ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kinds of ownership structures in large firms|url = http://e.viaminvest.com/A5OwnershipStructures/Exhi_MorckEtAl.asp|website = e.viaminvest.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate governance in credit unions ===
[[Credit union]]s have a different approach towards management entrenchment and [[corporate governance]]. Since credit unions lack principal-agent governance between shareholders and other members, managers already enjoy benefits and job entrenchments that are not based on their performance. Given the theoretical predictions of Fudenberg and Tirole (1995) and the empirical research by Kanagaretnam, Lobo and Mathieu (2003) we predict that credit union managers with higher comparative levels of salary and [[perquisites]] (and limited outside opportunities) will aggressively engage in accounting manipulations when job security is threatened.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMSYMPOSIUM/2005/papers/40-Allan_Hodgson_paper.pdf|title = MANAGEMENT ENTRENCHMENT, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE and ACCOUNTING ARBITRAGE|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-11|website = |publisher = |last = Hodgson|first = Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Why managers engage in accounting manipulations ===
But to what extent are these managers willing to manipulate when [[capital requirements]] of credit unions are not met?

Triggering regulations to meet capital requirements for a credit union is very costly, but censuring accounting arbitrage is very costly at the same time. However,  some argue the expected costs of regulatory violation are larger than the reputation costs of censure from capital management.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Therefore, managers have three good reasons to involve and censure their accounting manipulations:
# Credit unions lack [[equity capital]].
# Lack of opportunities to increase raw capital because managers are unwilling to rise earning as in [[credit unions]] it is against their philosophical background ([[non-profit organisations]])
# Weak agency relationship between shareholders, members, boards etc.
Nowadays, there are several articles and essays on how to accomplish a proper entrenched management exercise without hurting shareholders, yet not abuse them–for example–when a board of directives is given the power to take corporate decisions in certain matters, where the corporation will be protected against hostile takeovers. Nonetheless, this form of corporate governance may cause distinct reaction on shares prices, which is why entrenchment management is not an easy concept to accomplish. Along with corporate governance, entrenchment management requires a lot of research and good management from the corporate market.

== Unions vs. entrenched managers ==
In practice, entrenched CEOs tend to get higher salary than non-entrenched CEOs. A survey has been conducted. which results suggest that entrenched CEO give higher salaries to their workers compared to non-entrenched CEOs. Because [[cash flow]] rights ownership by the CEO and better [[corporate governance]] are found to mitigate such behaviour, we interpret the higher pay as evidence of agency problems between [[shareholder]]s and managers affecting workers' pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do Entrenched Managers Pay Their Workers More?|ssrn = 883717|date = 2005-12-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Henrik|last = Cronqvist|first2 = Fredrik|last2 = Heyman|first3 = Mattias|last3 = Nilsson|first4 = Helena|last4 = Svaleryd|first5 = Jonas|last5 = Vlachos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very real sense, [[Trade union|unions]] and managers compete to offer benefits to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unions, Executive Pay, and Management Entrenchment|url = http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2006/11/unions-executive-pay-and-management-entrenchment.html|website = ProfessorBainbridge.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since entrenched CEO pay their workers high salaries, the CEO-worker relationship improves, making workers less likely to unionize. Often workers perceive managers' benefits to be more beneficial for them than unions. This leads us to the conclusion that entrenched CEOs have the characteristic of being very competitive when it comes to work loyalty.

'''Mandas Tuladhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: मानदास तुलाधर) (1900-1975) was a Nepalese [[Buddhist]] scholar, [[Nepal Bhasa]] activist and pioneer publisher. He collected and published ancient hymns and folk songs which is his finest contribution to the preservation of Nepalese cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}.

==Early life==

[[Tuladhar]] was born to a merchant family at [[Asan, Kathmandu|Asan]] Kamalachhi, [[Kathmandu]]. His father was Ratna Das and mother Laxmi Shobha Tuladhar. When he was 16 years old, he was married to Dhan Maya, the daughter of Dharma Sundar Tuladhar of Dhalasikwa, Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death in 1921, the burden of running the household fell on him, and he went to [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]] to take over the family shop. It wasn't very successful, so he returned to Kathmandu. Later, he moved to [[Kalimpong]] and then [[Sikkim]] in [[India]] and engaged in various businesses. He returned to Nepal after a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Prem Shanti (ed.), Tuladhar (2010). ''Newa: Folklore.'' Yala: Central Department of Nepal Bhasa, Tribhuvan University. {{ISBN|978-9937-524-15-5}}. Page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1931, Tuladhar and a group of other liberal-minded people including poet [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]] started a movement to reform traditional religious customs. They were arrested and publicly flogged for their activities by the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime. They were then brought before the prime minister and released after a warning "not to indulge in such mischievous activities again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sthavir| first =Dharmalok| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/regmi/pdf/regmi_09.doc| title =A Journey to Great China| work = Regmi Research Series| publisher = Regmi Research| date=1 December 1977| accessdate = 30 March 2012}} Pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Tuladhar teamed up with his nephew poet [[Chittadhar Hridaya]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Todd T. and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). ''Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534182-9}}. Page 349.&lt;/ref&gt; and opened a bicycle shop named Mandas Chittadhar. It gradually transformed into a book store as both uncle and nephew were keen readers. Access to education and books was difficult at the time, and their book store became a hub for students and writers. Subsequently, Tuladhar established two publishing firms named Mandas Sugatdas&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Bowker Company (1980). ''International literary market place.'' Bowker. {{ISBN|0835212947}}, 9780835212946.&lt;/ref&gt; and Himalaya Pioneer Publication to promote writers and expand the country's corpus of books.

Tuladhar's other interest was Nepal Bhasa poetry, and he spent 48 years collecting hymns, folk songs and sacred texts in an effort to preserve Nepal's literary, cultural and musical heritage. He toured the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and gathered thousands of Hindu and Buddhist hymns in Nepal Bhasa and 275 [[Sanskrit]] songs, becoming an authority on old songs.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried and Malla (King of Lalitpur), Siddhinarasimha (1995). ''The divine play of Lord Krishna: a Krishnalīlā painting from Nepal.'' VGH Wissenschaftsverlag. {{ISBN|3882800526}}, 9783882800524. Page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He has published a number of anthologies that have proved valuable for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major achievement of this quest was his discovery of the original manuscript of the play ''Mahasattva'' (महासत्व) written by King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Shah Dev, Nepaleshwar Maharajadhiraj Shree Shree Shree Rajendra Bikram (1967). ''Mahasatwa.'' Kathmandu: Mandas Sugatdas.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is based on a Buddhist story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Li| first =Guishan (tr.)| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://monkeytree.org/dunhuang/tiger.html| title =A Prince Gives His Life to a Tiger| work = Story from Frescoes and Fables: Mural Stories from the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang| publisher = | date=| accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1997, Tuladhar's son Sugatdas set up the Mandas Buddha Bodhigyana Foundation with the aim of continuing his work of publishing and preserving Buddhist books. The foundation also operates the Bodhigyana Library which opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Bhasa Jawa Mandas Tuladhar wa Mandas Buddha Bodhigyan Foundation |url= |accessdate=|newspaper= Uday Sama|date=26 July 2003}} Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''marketing supply chain''' is the chain of suppliers that an organization relies on to produce marketing materials (print, [[promotional products]] and [[point of sale]]) to market their products and services.

The marketing [[supply chain]] is often made up of partners inside and outside of the organization – such as brand managers, marketing services, agencies, direct sales teams, buyers, printers, fulfillment houses and many others.

From product brochures and promotional flyers to point-of-sale systems and store signage, each of these supplies must be acquired, managed and distributed to customers, sales teams, branch offices, retail outlets, dealers, distributors and other key audiences around the world.

==Flow==
Similar to manufacturing environments, marketing supply chains are primarily governed by a process or "flow" that typically involves:
* Creation – identifying and developing marketing materials to meet customer need and/or to support sales initiatives,
* Production – getting materials in their final form either through sourcing, printing or [[Web development]],
* Warehousing – technology, storage strategy, planning,
* Fulfillment – order management, service standards, shipping and tracking use/consumption – how materials are used and displayed in the field and stored based on seasonality or product/service availability,
* Feedback – collecting information for continuous refinement; from inventory reporting, management metrics, field/customer feedback.

==Technology==
The technology field for meeting the needs to the entire marketing supply chain is still a bit disconnected. A new breed of comprehensive [http://www.propago.com Marketing Management Platforms] are on their way to the market. These platforms enable marketers to give access to their marketing materials to anyone that is responsible for promoting the brand. This could include sales teams, employees, vendors, partners, affiliates or anyone else the marketer determines needs the access. In general these platforms are tasked with the following features:
* Protect the brand, protect the budget and protect the inventory: As marketers open up the access for people to pull marketing materials through automated methods there must be controls in place to ensure they are being used in compliance with the corporate directives.
* Promote the brand; Physically, Digitally and Socially: The platforms must be able to support a number of different mediums to be able to truly handle the entire marketing supply chain.
* Propagate the materials; Quickly, Easily and Efficiently: With complex supply chains these technologies must be able to connect to multiple vendors/manufacturers and ensure they have the ability to quickly produce, procure and fulfill the materials to the targeted destination.


Over time, most supply chains can grow cumbersome and unwieldy as new partners, new products and new technologies are added, resulting in increased cost, decreased service levels and an overall loss of control. Some of the world’s largest consulting firms estimate that up to 60% of marketing costs are related to non-product ancillary areas (distribution, people, freight, storage, obsolescence, technology, [[Inventory|inventory management]], etc.).

Companies have tackled cost reduction from a "largest spend first" philosophy. As a result, some very substantial cost savings opportunities are often overlooked, such as indirect materials and supplies – those products and services that are not a core or direct part of the company’s finished product.

By taking a complete marketing supply chain approach, identifying inefficiencies and developing best business practices, companies can improve their marketing supply chain process. Outsourcing the process can help manage total marketing supply chain cost, and can provide an opportunity for measurement in marketing, one of the major challenges in the profession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5277">'''Martin Helmut Wiggers''' (born July 31, 1963) is a German economist, editor, author and businessman.

==Education==
In the 1980s Wiggers studied [[Business Administration]] at the Munich School Of Strategic Management of the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Strategische Unternehmensführung No 1, 1999. München, St. Gallen 1999, ISSN 1436-5812&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basel II==
Long before the implementation of [[Basel II]] [[George W. Stroke]] and Wiggers pointed out that a [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial and economic crisis]] will come, because of its systemic dependencies on a few rating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strategische Unternehmensführung (Magazine)|Strategische Unternehmensfuehrung]] Nr. 1, 1999. Munich, St. Gallen 1999, {{ISSN|1436-5812}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the breakout of the crisis [[Alan Greenspan]] agreed to this opinion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/alan-greenspan-die-ratingagenturen-wissen-nicht-was-sie-tun-1464553.html|title=Alan Greenspan: "Die Ratingagenturen wissen nicht was sie tun"|author=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=22 September 2007|work=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|Financial Crisis Inquiry Report]] confirmed this point of view in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Official Government Edition, Washington 2011, S XXV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Official Government Edition, Washington 2011, S 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DaimlerChrysler==
In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] and [[Chrysler Corporation]] announced a merger, valued at {{USD}}38 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DaimlerChrysler dawns|url=http://money.cnn.com/1998/05/07/deals/benz/|work=CNN Money|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=7 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a change in company name to "DaimlerChrysler AG". The merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggers Martin H.: Sternstunden, [[Strategische Unternehmensführung (Magazine)|Strategische Unternehmensfuehrung]] Nr. 2, 2000. Munich, St. Gallen 2000, ISSN 1436-5812&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the [[Chrysler Crossfire]], which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the [[Dodge Sprinter]]/[[Freightliner Sprinter]], a re-badged [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] van.

Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In May 2007 [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] for US$6 billion. Two years later Chrysler's [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|bankruptcy was filing in the United States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10709">'''Online counseling''' is the provision of professional [[mental health]] counseling services through the Internet. Services are typically offered via [[email]], [[Online chat|real-time chat]], and [[video conferencing]].&lt;ref name=Mallen1 /&gt;  Some clients use online counseling in conjunction with traditional [[psychotherapy]], or nutritional counseling, and a growing number of clients are using online counseling as a replacement for office visits.&lt;ref name=Mallen1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallen|first=Michael J.|author2=David L. Vogel|title=Introduction to the Major Contribution Counseling Psychology and Online Counseling|journal=[[The Counseling Psychologist]]|date=November 2005|volume=33|issue=6|pages=761–775|doi=10.1177/0011000005278623|url=http://tcp.sagepub.com/content/33/6/761.abstract|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some form of [[Telephone counseling|tele-psychology]] has been available for over 35 years,&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallen|first=Michael J.|author2=Vogel|author3=Rochlen|author4=Day|title=Online Counseling Reviewing the Literature From a Counseling Psychology Framework|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=November 2005|volume=33|issue=6|pages=819–871|doi=10.1177/0011000005278624|url=http://tcp.sagepub.com/content/33/6/819.abstract|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of internet video chat systems and the increasing penetration of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] has resulted in a growing movement towards online therapy. Many of the methods used to facilitate online therapy sessions include a multimedia access platform such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online Therapy. Both of which enable users to receive initial treatment and therapy in a safe and discreet manner. Clients are using videoconferencing, live chat and email with professional [[psychologists]] in place of or in addition to face-to-face meetings.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

== History ==
Since the beginning of the internet in 1972, several creative people perceived the potential of the internet for the therapeutic communication. In 1972, computers from Stanford and UCLA simulated a psychotherapy session that was considered the very beginning of online counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=Ardiran|last2=Zack|first2=Jason|title=Counseling and the Internet|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=48|issue=4|page=434-446|doi=10.1177/0002764204270280}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the internet went public, this launch went hand in hand with the development of the first [[Self-help groups for mental health|self-help groups]] on the internet who were, in that time, very popular. In 1995, Martha Ainsworth had a couple of psychological complaints where she wanted to get rid of it, so she began searching for a competent therapist. Because her travel requirements made it difficult for her to consult a face-to-face therapist, she searched for an effective alternative online, but only found a dozen webpages that offered online treatment for psychological complaints. Afterwards, Martha Ainsworth wanted to reach the general public with her experiences and founded a sort of clearinghouse for mental health websites, named Metanoia. This database seemed to be a very efficient store-room and by the year 2000, this clearinghouse contained over 250 websites of private practices, and more than 700 online clinics where a therapist could be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alleman|first=James R.|title=Online counseling: The Internet and mental health treatment|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|volume=39|issue=2|pages=199–209|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.39.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to metanoia.org, the first service to offer online mental healthcare was "Ask Uncle Ezra", created by staff of Cornell University in 1986 for students.&lt;ref name=matanoia/&gt; By mid-1995 several fee-based online services offering mental health advice had appeared.&lt;ref name=matanoia&gt;{{cite web|last=Ainsworth|first=M|title=E-therapy: History and survey|url=http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/history.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 2002, a group of trained volunteer crisis counselors called "[[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]]", began providing suicide prevention services via email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kraus|editor-first=Ron|title=Online counseling: a handbook for mental health professionals|date=2004|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0124259553|author1=Zack, Jason |author2=Stricker, George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

A growing body of research into online counseling has established the efficacy of online therapy with treatment outcomes at least equal to traditional in-office settings.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freeonlinetherapy.org/online-therapy-study/ |title=7 out of 10 People Say Online Therapy Helps Reduce Their Depression |last= |first= |date=August 2018 |website=Free Online Therapy |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The number of missed appointments is much less than with in-person therapy.&lt;ref name=Glueckauf1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glueckauf|first=R.L.|author2=Fritz|author3= Ecklund-Johnson|author4=Liss|author5=Dages|author6=Carney|title=Videoconferencing-based family counseling for rural teenagers with epilepsy|journal=[[Rehabilitation Psychology (journal)|Rehabilitation Psychology]]|year=2002|volume=47|pages=49–72|doi=10.1037/0090-5550.47.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online counseling is also filling the unmet need for clients located in areas traditionally under-served by traditional counselors. Rural residents and [[expats]] along with under-served [[minorities]] often have an easier time finding a suitable therapist online than in their local communities.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;  

Online counseling has also been shown to be effective for clients who may have difficulty reaching appointments during normal business hours.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Change|first=T.|author2=Yeh, Krumboltz|title=Process and outcome evaluation of an on-line support group for Asian American male college students|journal=[[Journal of Counseling Psychology]]|year=2001|volume=48|pages=319–329|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.48.3.319|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research is demonstrating that online counseling may be useful for [[disabled]] and rural people that traditionally under-utilize clinical services.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

Studies have shown the efficacy of online therapy despite the controversy of cost.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} Online Platforms such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online, offer case by case specific therapy methods including "groups" as well as one on one sessions. Such methods of online therapy can be sustainable means of getting therapy to the right people and at their own location. One of the key aspects of online therapy is that it can be done at the convenience of the user as well as in a place which the user deems safe and is able to follow through with the therapy.

==Effectiveness==

Research from G.S. Stofle and J. suggests that online counseling would benefit people functioning at a moderately high level.&lt;ref name=Stofle_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Stofle|first=G.S.|title=Choosing an online therapist|year=2001|publisher=White Hat Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suler|first=J|title=Psychotherapy in cyberspace: A 5 dimensional model of online and computer-mediated psychotherapy|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2000|volume=3|pages=151–160|doi=10.1089/109493100315996|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe situations, such as [[suicidal ideation]] or a [[psychotic episode]], might be better served by traditional face-to-face methods,&lt;ref name=Zelvin_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Zelvin|first=E.|title=Online Counseling Skills Part I: Treatment Strategies and Skills for Conducting Counseling Online|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although further research may prove otherwise.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

Cohen and Kerr conducted a study on the effectiveness of online therapy for treatment of [[anxiety disorders]] in students and found that there was no difference in the level of change for the two modes as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=G.E.|author2=Kerr, B.A.|title=Computer-mediated counseling: An empirical study of a new mental health treatment|journal=Computers in Human Services|year=1998|volume=15|pages=13–26|doi=10.1300/J407v15n04_02|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the main goal of counseling is to alleviate the distress, anxiety or concerns experienced by a client when he or she enters therapy, online counseling has strong efficacy under that definition.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;  Client satisfaction surveys tend to demonstrate a high level of client satisfaction with online counseling, while the providers sometimes demonstrate lower satisfaction with distance methods.&lt;ref name=Dongier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dongier|first=M.|author2=Templer, R. |author3=Lalinec-Michaud, M. |author4=Meuneir, D. |title=Telepsychiatry: Psychiatric consultation through two-way television: A controlled study|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=31|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrition counseling specific to conditions is available by many consultants online using Skype or another face-to-face program. This is especially effective for people with a busy work schedule, and others who can't make it to an office regularly. Online consulting for imbalances in [[blood lipid]] levels, [[blood sugar regulation]], and other health conditions make it easier to manage when using nutritional approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.22319/abstract|title=Best nutrition counseling practices for the treatment of anorexia nervosa: A Delphi study|first1=Anne M.|last1=Mittnacht|first2=Cynthia M.|last2=Bulik|date=1 January 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=48|issue=1|pages=111–122|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/eat.22319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mittnacht, A.

==Controversy==

There is a split within the counseling field on the validity of online counseling. Some [[Psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner|practitioners]] have suggested that online counseling cannot be considered quality psychotherapy.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''Panapasa Balekana''', [[MBE]],&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; [[Solomon Islands Medal|SIM]],&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; (1929 – 22 January 2009) was a Fijian-born [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islander]] who [[Composer|composed]] the [[national anthem]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], ''[[God Save Our Solomon Islands]]'', with his wife, [[Matila Balekana]]. Panapasa Balekana [[songwriter|co-wrote]] the anthem's [[lyrics]] with his wife while he composed the accompanying music.

The anthem was adopted by the country upon its independence in 1978 following a government competition.&lt;ref name=stimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Solomons National Anthem Composer Dies in Honiara |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3439|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Balekana was originally from [[Kadavu Island|Kandavu]], Fiji.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He moved to the [[Solomon Islands]] in 1953 to work as a [[mechanic]] for the government, which was under British colonial administration at the time.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He was unmarried when he first moved to the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He eventually married a Fijian woman, [[Matila Balekana]]&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; and resided in the Solomon Islands for most of his adult life.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; The couple had two children, a son and a daughter.

Balekana "fell in love" with the Solomon Islands and decided to stay in the country rather than return to [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name=sstar&gt;{{cite news |title=State funeral today for late Balekana |url=http://solomonstarnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6088&amp;Itemid=26|work=[[Solomon Star]]|date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, Balekana publicly called the Solomon Islands "my home".&lt;ref name=stimes2&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna|last=Sireheto|title=State Funeral for Composer of National Anthem  |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3446|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balekana and his family joined the Wesley United Church in [[Honiara]]. He remained heavily involved with the congregation, serving as a church pastor&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; and choirmaster.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

==National anthem==
In the run-up to independence on 7 July 1978, the government of the Solomon Islands decided that it needed a [[national anthem]] for the occasion. The government announced on the radio that it would accept submissions from the general public for a new anthem.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Panapasa Balekana and his wife, [[Matila Balekana]], decided to jointly enter the competition as a team.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; The couple agreed that the new anthem should be in the form of a prayer, asking God to support and guide the new island nation.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Balekana claimed in interviews to have received his [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for the anthem in a dream.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; After he woke up from the dream, Balekana and his wife immediately began writing words and lyrics, as well as composing the tune.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Panapasa and Matila Balekana co-wrote the lyrics for the anthem, while Panapasa Balekana composed the accompanying music. The couple credited prayer and God for their success in creating the anthem, noting how well the song came together.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Once the lyrics and music had been composed, Panapasa and Matila Balekana received help recording the prospective anthem from the Wesley United Church choir at the couple's own congregation.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; The choir sang the song for the first time, which was recorded on tape and submitted to competition officials.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

The Balekanas' submission, ''[[God Save Our Solomon Islands]]'', won the competition, and became the national anthem of the Solomon Islands.  It was sung on the country's first independence day, 7 July 1978. Balekana was overjoyed and explained the importance of the anthem and its meaning, ''"Solomon Islands national anthem was written in a form of prayer asking God for safe keeping and protection of our new nation. By the power and grace of God, we may receive joy, peace, progress and prosperity, if only we can be able to work together in harmony. These may be the foundation of building our nation, as we can be rest assured that we will reach our destination- stands forever more."''&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

==Later life==
Panapasa Balekana retired from his work as a government mechanic in 1988.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; Following his retirement he became the manager and director of a Solomon Islander soft drink company, Szetu Enterprise.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt;

In 2000, Panapasa was asked by police to leave the country with his family for his own safety due to the [[History of the Solomon Islands#Civil war|ethnic unrest]] sweeping the Solomon Islands at the time.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Panapasa refused to seek refuge from the violence abroad explaining his loyalty to his adopted country, ''"I refused and told them that this is my home and should anything happen, this is where I'm supposed to die, this is the place – my home."''&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Panapasa continued to work as the Wesley United Church choir director until he became too weak in his later years.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; His son took over the position.

==Death==
Panapasa Balekana died on 22 January 2009, at his home in [[Henderson, Solomon Islands]], which is located east of the capital city of [[Honiara]].&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; He was 79 years old.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; He was survived by his wife, daughter, son and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt;

Balekana was given a [[state funeral]] by the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; Balekana's body was [[laid in state]] in the main chamber of the [[National Parliament of the Solomon Islands]] in the morning of 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; VIPs were allowed to lay [[wreaths]] in honour of Balekana at the Parliament.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

Diginitaries attending the viewing and funeral included the [[Governor-General of the Solomon Islands]] [[Nathaniel Waena]].&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Governor-General Waena and Lady Waena led the viewing procession.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; Other leading officials at the viewing, by [[order of precedence]], included Prime Minister Dr. Derek Sikua and his wife, Doris Sikua; [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker to Parliament]] Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] his wife, Lady Kenilorea; the Chief Justice Sir Albert Palmer; and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Fred Fono and his wife.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; Several former Governors-General, [[cabinet members]], opposition leaders, members of parliament, the [[diplomatic corps]], and the Mayor of Honiara [[Andrew Mua]] also attended the state viewing and funeral.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

A procession, which included members of the general public, went from Parliemant to the Wesley United Church in Honiara for the funeral in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; The national anthem, ''God Save Our Solomon Islands'', was performed during the funeral service in Balekana's honour.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

A police escort brought Balekana's body from the church to the cemetery at Number 3, near the Honiara High School, for burial.&lt;ref name=stimes3&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna|last=Sireheto|title=Solomons Honour National Anthem Composer   |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3454|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wreaths were laid by the public before the [[casket]] was lowered into the [[gravesite]].&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

'''Rachel Larimer Mellon Walton''' (January 8, 1899{{spaced ndash}}March 2, 2006) was an American [[philanthropist]].

==Biography==
Walton was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] the daughter of [[William Larimer Mellon]] (1868&amp;ndash;1949), of the banking family, and himself a founder of [[Gulf Oil]]. Her mother was Mary "May" Taylor Mellon. Walton was educated at the Dobbs Ferry School in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]]. In 1922, she married John Fawcett Walton, Jr. (1893&amp;ndash;1974) and together they raised four children at their home in the East End of Pittsburgh.

Rachel Mellon Walton was a major benefactor to the arts, music, medicine, education, conservation, and the welfare of women. Among her endowments was major financial support for the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, founded by her brother, Dr. William Larimer Mellon Jr., in Deschapelles, [[Haiti]]. Walton also endowed the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]]; the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt at the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]]; the [[Carnegie Mellon]] [[Tepper School of Business]]; and the Women's Center and Shelter of Pittsburgh. In the 1970s Walton donated land to the [[Western Pennsylvania Conservancy]] for the [[Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve]]. 

She died in her [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland, Pennsylvania]] residence on March 2, 2006, at 107 years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_432411.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dekeyser was born in [[Leuven]], Belgium, the eldest son of entrepreneurs who divorced when he was young.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/en/company/bobby-dekeyser.html | title = Bobby Dekeyser | publisher = DEDON | accessdate = 17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in [[Belgium]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], he recalls his childhood as "chaotic", leaving him with a deep-seated longing for harmony.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/prominente/article106350569/Das-neue-Leben-des-gescheiterten-Bayern-Torwarts.html | title = Das neue Leben des gescheiterten Bayern-Torwarts |trans-title=The new life of a failed Bayern Goalkeeper | language = German | publisher = Welt Online | date = 21 May 2012 | accessdate = 16 November 2012 | first = Inga | last = Griese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-described rebel and school truant, he turned to football as a source of discipline and self-esteem.&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='D&amp;F'&gt;[http://dfacademy.org/about/bobby 'Bobby', ''D&amp;F Academy: About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dfacademy.org/about/bobby | title = Just follow your Dreams! | publisher =  D&amp;F Academy | accessdate = 17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 14, he won a talent contest, earning himself a place at the [[New York City|New York]] soccer camp of his idol, the Brazilian striker [[Pelé]], whom he credits with encouraging him to "follow your dreams".&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='D&amp;F'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2012/07/P-Dekeyser | title = Möbelfabrikant Bobby Dekeyser: Gefühl statt Kalkül |trans-title=Furniture-maker Bobby Dekeyser: Sensation instead of Calculation | language = German | publisher = Die Zeit | date = 14 February 2012 | accessdate = 16 November 2012 | first = Jens | last = Tönnesmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdf.de/ZDF/zdfportal/programdata/e6945324-1cb6-3c02-8b90-3874ee0f4b2d/7953972?noDispatch=1 | title = Markus Lanz | language = German | publisher = ZDF | date = 23 May 2012 | accessdate = 16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, having attended nine different schools, Dekeyser stood up in English class and announced that he was dropping out to become a professional footballer.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='FA'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name='DW'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,5292781,00.html |title=Talking Germany—The German Way of Life: Presenter Peter Caven talks to Bobby Dekeyser about dreams, fast-track school leaving exams and goalkeepers |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232059/http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,5292781,00.html |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football career==
In 1980, at the age of 16, Dekeyser joined the Junior A-League team [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] as goalkeeper, staying with them until 1982, when he was called up for military service in Belgium. On his release, in 1984, he joined [[R.U. Saint-Gilloise|Royal Union Saint-Gilloise]] in Belgium's second division.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='weltfussball'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldfootball.net/spieler_profil/bobby-dekeyser/ | title = Robert Dekeyser | publisher = worldfootball.net | accessdate = 16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='fussballdaten'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/dekeyserrobert/1992/ | title = Robert Dekeyser | language = German | publisher = fussballdaten.de | accessdate = 16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rund-magazin.de/news/417/46/Der-Moebelwart/ | title = Der Möbelwart | language = German | publisher = Rund: Das Fußball-Magazin | date = 4 June 2008 | accessdate = 16 November 2012 | first =  Christian | last = Litz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, on the recommendation of the [[FC Bayern Munich]] goalkeeper [[Jean-Marie Pfaff]], Dekeyser was brought in as a replacement for the team's reserve keeper, who was sidelined with a long-term injury. A year later he was transferred to another [[Bundesliga]] team, [[1. FC Nürnberg]], where he continued to serve as reserve goalkeeper.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='weltfussball'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='fussballdaten'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'/&gt;

After a season at Belgium's first-division [[KRC Genk]], Dekeyser transferred in 1989 to [[TSV 1860 München]], where he served as starting goalkeeper.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='weltfussball'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='fussballdaten'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'/&gt; In his sixteenth appearance for the team, he was seriously injured by an elbow blow to the face and spent several weeks in hospital. While in hospital, he learned from the newspapers that he had been replaced as goalkeeper.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'/&gt; Despite his anger at the manner of his dismissal, Dekeyser was persuaded to make a three-game comeback for 1860 Munich when the replacement goalkeeper himself was injured.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; He describes these as the "best three games of my career".&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; Although numerous offers from first and second division teams followed, he retired from professional football at the end of the 1990–1991 season.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'/&gt;

==Business career==
Dekeyser founded his first company, DEDON, while recovering from a facial injury in hospital.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; He readily admits that he had no business plan or clear idea of what DEDON would do or sell.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt; His motivation was "to have fun working with family and friends", which he has since described as a motto of the company.&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; DEDON's first products were hand-painted [[ski]]s, 80 pairs of which were sold, 50 of them later returned. It was only after a stint selling [[raffia]] [[giraffes]] imported from [[Madagascar]] that the company changed its focus to [[outdoor furniture]].&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='rundmag'/&gt;

In the late 1980s Dekeyser first began to develop his idea of an "outdoor living room", furnished with the attention to comfort, quality and aesthetics usually reserved for indoor living rooms.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt; Following his retirement from professional soccer, he worked closely with his uncle, an [[engineer]] and expert at [[plastics]] [[extrusion]], to create a durable, weather-resistant [[synthetic fiber]] (known today as DEDON Fiber) with a natural look and feel.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt; Unsure of how to take his idea of the "outdoor living room" further, however, he put it on hold.&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;

Then during a visit to the [[Imm Cologne|Cologne furniture fair]] in 1991, Dekeyser met a furniture manufacturer from [[Cebu]], a Philippine island known for the craftsmanship of its [[Weaving|weavers]].&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonStory'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/en/company/the-dedon-story.html | title = The DEDON Story | publisher = DEDON | accessdate = 17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='PhilStar2'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=365814 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130131105305/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=365814 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 31 January 2013 | title = DEDON Furniture: From Cebu to the World… In Style | publisher = The Philippine Star | date = 29 October 2006 | accessdate = 17 November 2012 | first = Doreen G. | last = Yu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturer agreed to help him produce woven [[rattan]] furniture using DEDON Fiber. Soon thereafter Dekeyser moved his family to Cebu where he spent six months developing DEDON's first woven products.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonStory'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='PhilStar2'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Real'&gt;{{cite web | url =http://realallthingsrealestate.com/2011/06/dedon-outdoor-furniture-michael-bush/  | title = DEDON Outdoor Furniture | publisher = REAL Magazine | date = 20 June 2011 | accessdate = 17 November 2012 | first = Michael | last = Bush}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Germany he and his wife, Ann-Kathrin, purchased an old farm on [[Lüneburg]] Heath, close to [[Port of Hamburg|Hamburg Harbor]], where DEDON furniture would then be shipped from the Philippines.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Real'/&gt;

In its first decade the company, which consisted of a small group of family and friends sharing business duties and chores on the farm, grew slowly.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonStory'/&gt; A converted chicken coop served as Dekeyser's office.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://robbreport.com/Home-Taking-It-Outside.aspx | title = Home: Taking It Outside | publisher = RobbReport | date = 1 July 2008 | accessdate = 17 November 2012 | first = Jorge S. | last = Arango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture deliveries were stored in the barn.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt; In 2000 DEDON opened its own production facility on Cebu so as to better control the design and quality of its furniture.&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='DedonStory'/&gt; This, along with the adoption of powder-coated [[aluminum]] frames, the introduction of more contemporary designs, and the development of innovative marketing campaigns, helped DEDON to grow rapidly.&lt;ref name ='DedonBobby'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='PhilStar2'/&gt; Over the next five years, sales increased by more than 1,300 percent.&lt;ref name ='DW'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Tagesspiegel'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/das-bobby-prinzip/625784.html | title = Das Bobby-Prinzip |trans-title=The Bobby Principle | language = German | publisher = Der Taggesspiegel | date = 20 July 2005 | accessdate = 17 November 2012 | first = Stephan | last = Krücken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within eight years, the Cebu staff expanded from seven to 3,600 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zeelifestylecebu.com/a-journey-to-paradise/ | title = A Journey to Paradise | publisher = zee Lifestyle | date = 9 May 2012 | accessdate = 17 November 2012 | first = Melo  | last = Esguerra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the buyback, Dekeyser took steps to restore DEDON's atmosphere and values.&lt;ref name ='Interview'/&gt; He also sought to revitalize the brand's communication, releasing photography campaigns, short films and a limited-edition book all shot by American fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], whom Dekeyser has described as "very much on our wavelength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Camp DEDON | first =  Matthias | last = Ehiert | journal = Architectural Digest | date = May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.whitewallmag.com/2010/06/24/coming-home/ | title = Coming Home | publisher = Whitewall Magazine | date = 24 June 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Elizabeth | last = Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yatzer.com/Coming-Home-Bruce-Weber-for-DEDON | title = Coming Home: Bruce Weber for DEDON | publisher = Yatzer | date = 14 June 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Marcia | last = Argyriades}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other communications initiatives included the launch of the DEDON Tour du Monde catalog shoot, described as an ongoing, around-the-world journey to discover "unique places and moments under the open skies".&lt;ref name ='Tour'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/de/blogazine/posts/tour-du-monde/its-time-for-the-dedon-tour-du-monde.html | title = What is the DEDON Tour du Monde? | publisher = DEDON: Blogazine | date = 16 February 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Alex | last = Marashian}}&lt;/ref&gt; By spring 2012 the Tour du Monde included stops in [[Kenya]], [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Mexico]], [[South Africa]], the [[Seychelles]], [[New York City]], [[Megève]] in [[France]] and the Philippine island of [[Siargao]].&lt;ref name ='Tour'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Dem Wohlgefühl verflechtet |trans-title=Interweaving Well-being | publisher = ICON | date = September 2010 | pages = 52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/de/blogazine/posts/tour-du-monde/dedon-tour-du-monde-a-never-ending-story.html | title = EDON Tour du Monde: A Never Ending Story | publisher = DEDON: Blogazine | date = 31 August 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Alex | last = Marashian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dekeyser established relationships with several new designers after the buyback, most notably with [[Philippe Starck]], who launched ''Play'', his first collection for DEDON, at the 2010 [[Milan Furniture Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/en/blogazine/posts/collection/philippe-starck-play-with-dedon.html | title = Collections: Philippe Starck — Play With DEDON | publisher = DEDON: Blogazine | date = 14 April 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://viacomit.net/2010/04/29/dedon-x-starck/ | title = DEDON x Starck | publisher = Via Com It | date = 29 April 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a promotional video made at the time, Starck is quoted as saying "Everybody loves Bobby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86bL9ndsgm0 | title = DEDON: Play by Philippe Starck interview | date = 9 November 2011 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other designers associated with Dekeyser include [[Jean-Marie Massaud]] and Stephen Burks, the latter of whom appeared in a video with Dekeyser to promote the launch of his ''Dala'' collection for DEDON at the 2012 Milan Furniture Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECJqyvJ5NPs/ | title = DALA — The Mission | date = 17 April 2012 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/en/blogazine/posts/dedon-designers/design-talk-jean-marie-massaud.html | title = DEDON Designers — Design Talk: Jean-Marie Massaud | publisher = DEDON: Blogazine | date = 11 February 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, less than a year after Dekeyser's return, DEDON opened a wholly owned [[United States|US]] subsidiary, DEDON USA, followed by the launch of DEDON's first US showroom, located in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dwell Magazine | publisher = DEDON | date = April 2011 | page = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dedon.de/de/blogazine/posts/company/soho-here-we-come.html  | title = SoHo — Here We Come! | publisher = DEDON: Blogazine | date = 14 December 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first= Julia | last = Chaplin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/garden/25open.html?_r=1 | title = In SoHo, a New Outpost for High-Style Outdoor Furniture | publisher = The New York Times | date = 24 November 2010 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Rima | last = Suqi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Los Angeles]] showroom was opened in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.californiahomedesign.com/blog/2012/02/06/design-buzz-hanging-out-dedons-killer-outdoor-collection/ | title = Design Buzz: Hanging Out with DEDON's Killer Outdoor Collection | publisher = California Home + Design | date = 2 June 2012 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Kira | last = Coplin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to DEDON's growing activities in the US, Dekeyser spent an increasing amount of time in New York City.&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt;

In the spring of 2012 the company opened DEDON ISLAND, a luxury resort with a "barefoot state of mind" on the Philippine island of Siargao.&lt;ref name ='Vogue'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Build'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.vogue.it/en/magazine/books-and-travel/2012/05/dream-makers-in-paradise/ | title = Dream makers in paradise | publisher = VOGUE Italia | date = May 2012 | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | first = Sophie | last = Djerlal | page = 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping back from operations in 2014, Dekeyser sold his remaining stake in DEDON in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moebelmarkt.de/beitrag/dedon-dekeyser-verkauft-seine-anteile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2009 Dekeyser co-founded the [[Dekeyser&amp;Friends Foundation|''Dekeyser&amp;Friends'']] Foundation, which is based in Geneva and with a stated purpose "to inspire young people to follow their dreams and bring about change in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dekeyserandfriends.com/ | title = Our Mission | publisher = [[Dekeyser&amp;Friends Foundation]] | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the foundation has brought young people aged 18 to 28 together for encounters with [[Mentorship|mentors]], or 'friends', such as German Olympic double gold medalist skier [[Markus Wasmeier]] and Turkish traditional dance troupe leader Mustafa Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dfacademy.org/friends/ | title = Inspire the next generation – become a D&amp;F Friend! | publisher = D&amp;F Academy | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121108121244/http://dfacademy.org/friends | archivedate = 8 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D&amp;F2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dekeyserandfriends.org/what-we-do/df-academy/ | title = What We Do | publisher = [[Dekeyser&amp;Friends Foundation]] | accessdate = 18 November 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121123165949/http://www.dekeyserandfriends.org/what-we-do/df-academy/ | archivedate = 23 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One initiative of the foundation was the Hamburg-based ''[[D&amp;F Academy]]'', described as a "platform where knowledgeable and inspiring personalities can pass on their experience to young people from around the world in hands-on learning projects".&lt;ref name = D&amp;F2/&gt;&lt;ref name ='D&amp;FAcademy'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dfacademy.org/about/about_us/ | title = About Us | publisher = D&amp;F Academy | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academy's inaugural program was led by British anthropologist and environmentalist [[Jane Goodall]], its second program by the former German national team and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]].&lt;ref name ='D&amp;FAcademy'/&gt;

One of the foundation's longest-running and most comprehensive projects is the Compostela Village Project, which began in 2009 on Cebu. This rehousing project has provided a new home to around 500 people (primarily families) who until then had been living on a dumpsite on Cebu.&lt;ref name ='Vogue'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dekeyserandfriends.org/what-we-do/philantrophy/ | title = What We Do - Philantrpoy | publisher = [[Dekeyser&amp;Friends Foundation]] | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; So that they can build thriving and independent lives, the residents learn skills such as farming, animal husbandry, weaving, jewelry-making, and sewing.&lt;ref name ='Vogue'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/156859/weaving-training-for-scavengers-held/ | title = Weaving training for scavengers held | publisher = The Philippine Daily Inquirer | date = 6 March 2012 | accessdate = 18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
While on a business trip to the Philippines in 2010, Dekeyser received the news that Ann-Kathrin, his wife of more than 20 years, was in a coma back in Germany. She died before he could make it home.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; The story serves as the prologue of ''Unverkäuflich ('Not For Sale')'', Dekeyser's autobiography, published by Ankerherz Verlag in May 2012.&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt; Dekeyser credits family and old friends with helping him recover after an eight-month period he describes as a "hole that could not be deeper or blacker".&lt;ref name ='BobbyBook'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='Welt'/&gt;

As of 2015, he was dating American actress [[Gina Gershon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://pagesix.com/2015/12/21/gina-gershon-and-bobby-dekeyser-are-in-a-long-distance-relationship/ | title = Gina Gershon and Bobby Dekeyser are in a long-distance relationship | website = Page Six | date = 21 December 2015 | access-date = 15 May 2018 | first = Carlos | last = Greer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Owen Lehman, Sr.''' (September 29, 1891 – August 9, 1969) was an [[United States|American]] banker, head of [[Lehman Brothers]] for decades, and a notable race-horse owner, art collector, and philanthropist.

==Life and career==
Lehman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[New York City]]. He was the son of [[Philip Lehman]] (1861&amp;ndash;1947), son of [[Emanuel Lehman]], cofounder of [[Lehman Brothers]] [[investment bank]], and Carrie Lauer (1865&amp;ndash;1937).&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=6752 The Frick Collection website: "Lehman, Philip, 1861-1947"] retrieved April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Hotchkiss School]] in 1908&lt;ref name=AlumniAchievements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx|title=Alumni Accomplishments|publisher=The Hotchkiss School|date=2004|accessdate=March 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310133421/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx|archivedate=March 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a 1913 graduate of [[Yale University]] and member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Phi chapter).  When his father retired in 1925, "Bobbie" Lehman assumed the leadership role of the family-owned business.  He took over the bank during a time when Lehman Brothers, like its competitors [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]], was essentially a one-office firm.

While sound financial principles were essential, Robert Lehman was often quoted as saying that he "bet on people." One of those people he believed in was [[Juan Trippe]] who would build [[Pan American World Airways]] into an industry powerhouse. Robert Lehman understood that to maximize Lehman Brothers' growth he needed additional investor capital. While still maintaining voting control, he was the first to invite non-family members to become partners. He understood too that the right partners could expand the company's opportunities through interlocking directorships. As such, he sold an interest in Lehman Brothers to [[John D. Hertz]] who had sold his [[Yellow Cab Company]] and [[The Hertz Corporation]] for a fortune and who sat on the board of directors of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]. Under Robert Lehman, the bank concentrated on rapidly developing consumer industries with financing deals arranged in retailing, airlines, and the entertainment business notably with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theatre group 1928 deal that sold the majority of its stock to [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] which led to the creation of [[RKO]] motion picture studios. And, when Lehman put together start-up financing for [[Paramount Pictures]], John D. Hertz would be their connection on Paramount's board.

Robert Lehman guided his company through the perils of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock-market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Post-war, he grew the company substantially, expanding to [[Paris]], [[France]] to meet the financial needs of his clients with international operations. In the process, he made himself one of the wealthiest people in the United States.

==Thoroughbred horses==
A lover of horses and a [[polo]] enthusiast, Robert Lehman played on a polo team with [[W. Averell Harriman]], [[Jock Whitney]] and [[Tommy Hitchcock, Jr.]]. He was also a [[thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] owner and breeder who had five horses compete in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. His horses, most trained by [[Ralph Kercheval|Ralph G. Kercheval]], won numerous important [[stakes race]]s including the [[Correction Handicap]] and the [[Long Island Handicap]] at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]], and the [[Bernard Baruch Handicap]] at [[Saratoga Race Course]].

==Art collection==
For six decades he built upon an art collection begun by his father in 1911 and devoted a great deal of time and energy as a long-time member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and finally becoming the first chairman of the board at the Metropolitan in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, Lansing. "Tom Hoving and the Met Builds", People magazine, Nov. 17, 1975. [http://people.com/archive/tom-hoving-of-the-met-builds-buys-and-makes-much-of-the-art-world-bilious-vol-4-no-20/].&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of his collection became such that in 1957, nearly three hundred works were used for a solo exhibit at the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum's]] [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in the [[Tuileries Gardens]] in Paris. At that time, his was the only private American collection to be given that honor. In 1968 he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Yale University for having "enhanced the civic life, the culture, and the artistic development of our civilization."

After his death in 1969, the Robert Lehman Foundation donated close to 3,000 works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Housed in the Robert Lehman Wing, which opened to the public in 1975, the museum has called it "one of the most extraordinary private art collections ever assembled in the United States". To this day, his Foundation remains active, operating the Robert Lehman Art Lecture Fund and sponsoring exhibitions in museums, both around the U.S. and worldwide. Other [[philanthropic]] activities include support for [[PBS]] television programming. The Robert Lehman Art Center at [[Brooks School]] in [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]], Massachusetts, is named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Robert's first marriage—to Ruth S. (née Lamar) Rumsey (born 1902) in May 1929 in Montreal, Canada—ended in a divorce about 1931. Previous to her marriage to Robert, Ruth Lamar had been married to John Williams "Jack" Rumsey (1877-1960), who was owner of the Embassy Club (a nightclub in NYC) and president of the American Play Company (an old established literary agency located at 532 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0913FC3854167A93CAA8178ED85F4D8285F9 New York Times: "Mrs. Ruth Rumsey Weds Robert Lehman; Quietly Married to New York Banker in Montreal--Couple Sail on the Olympic"] May 1929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19340626&amp;id=lNBKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sOkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2185,6939898 Schenectady Gazette: Daughter of Ruth Bryan Owen marries Lehman cousin"] June 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert's second marriage, which occurred on June 25, 1934 in Washington, D. C., was to Ruth "Kitty" (Leavitt) Meeker (1904–1984), daughter of [[William Homer Leavitt]] and [[Ruth Bryan Owen]], and granddaughter of [[United States Secretary of State]], [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Robert and Ruth Meeker had one son, cinematographer and director, [[Robin Lehman|Robert "Robin" Owen Lehman Jr.]] Meeker had three daughters from her first marriage to William Painter Meeker (1902–1983) whom she divorced in 1933: Ruth Meeker, Helen Meeker, and Kathrine Meeker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salemil.angelfire.com/iBryanWilliamJennings.html History and Families of Marion County Illinois: William Jennings Bryan] retrieved April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and Ruth Meeker's marriage also ended in divorce in 1951.

Robert's third marriage—to Lee "Elena" (Anz) Lynn (1919-2006)—occurred on July 10, 1952 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Suu9yUKdA8IC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=Ruth+Owen+Meeker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vISmUNLNJ2&amp;sig=fXxnbQLCJBdv5yMe2IoRLCGq1oc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=42B6T7a2J9Sx0QHDypX2BQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruth%20Owen%20Meeker&amp;f=false Biographical Dictionary of U.S. Business Leaders By John N. Ingham]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died August 9, 1969 and is interred in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">'''Sim Wong Hoo''' ({{zh|c=沈望傅|p=Shěn Wàng Fù}}; born 1955) is the founder, [[CEO]] and Chairman of [[Creative Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creative.com Creative Technology Pte Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; a designer and manufacturer of products for personal computers and personal digital entertainment devices. Creative is notable for products such as the [[SoundBlaster]] audio card and the [[Creative ZEN]] range of audio and media products.

==Early life and career==
Sim Wong Hoo was born in [[Singapore]] to a Zhao'an Hokkien family and is an alumnus of [[Bukit Panjang Government High School]]. He graduated from the Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering faculty of [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]] (then known as Ngee Ann Technical College) in 1975, after which he worked in the private engineering sector.

On 1 July 1981, with a capital outlay of US$6,000, Sim (along with former schoolmate [[Ng Kai Wa]]) founded Creative Technology in the form of a computer repair shop in Pearl's Centre, in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]. There he developed and sold an add-on memory board for the [[Apple II]] computer. Later, Creative began creating customized PCs adapted for the Chinese language, including enhanced audio capabilities that allowed the devices to produce speech and melodies. The success of this audio interface led to the development of the stand-alone [[sound card]] [[Sound Blaster]]. It was among the first dedicated audio processing cards widely available to general consumers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Creative dominated the PC audio market until the 2000s, when OEM PCs began to be built with integrated sound boards in the motherboard. Sound Blaster then found itself reduced to a niche product.

==Achievements and Recognition==
Sim Wong Hoo has won accolades from industry and government for his innovations. This includes winning Singapore’s Public Star Medal [[Bintang Bakti Masyarakat]] in 2001 for outstanding achievements in the business field. He was named in second spot as Asia’s Businessman of the Year in January 2001 by Fortune Magazine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}. He won the Lifetime Achievement Award from organisers of the European DVD summit in April 2000;{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}. He was also appointed Chairman of Singapore’s Technopreneurship 21 Private Sector Committee in March 1999.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

At age 45, he became the youngest [[billionaire]] in Singapore.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He was also the first person to be named Singapore's Businessman of the Year twice, in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: Back at the Lab...|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1997.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 2002, he was named Person of the Year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scs.org.sg/ITLA_simwh.php SCS IT Leader Awards 2003, Person of the Year] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909055640/http://www.scs.org.sg/ITLA_simwh.php |date=2012-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Singapore Computer Society in recognition of his contribution to the IT industry. Sim is considered to be the star entrepreneur of Singapore, and he currently chairs Singapore's Technopreneurship 21 Private Sector Committee. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1999, Sim Wong Hoo released a book entitled ''''Chaotic Thoughts From The Old Millennium'''', in which he coined and popularized the term "[[No U-turn syndrome]]" to describe the stereotypical [[Singapore]]an mindset of requiring permission from higher authorities before taking any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sim|first=Wong Hoo|title=Chaotic Thoughts from the Old Millennium|publisher=Creative O Pte Ltd|location=Singapore|year=1999|isbn=981-04-2383-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Sim Wong Hoo, announced his creation of a new invention, the HanZpad, at a news conference in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_786506.html |title=Creative's Sim Wong Hoo is back |author=Grace Ching |publisher=The Straits Times |date=April 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newnation.sg/2012/04/sim-wong-hoo-rises-up-like-a-phoenix/ |title=Sim Wong Hoo rises up like a phoenix |publisher=Newnation |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trend''''' is an [[Austria|Austrian]] weekly business magazine headquartered in [[Vienna]]. The magazine is one of the oldest publications in its category in the country.

==History and profile==
''Trend'', based in Vienna, was established in 1969 by [[Oscar Bronner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=profil|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=1572|accessdate=7 October 2013|work=Euro Topics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015224308/http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=1572|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dhaus&gt;{{cite web|title=Despite Everything: The Oscar Bronner Story|url=http://deutscheshaus.as.nyu.edu/object/dh.event.DespiteEverythingTheOscarBronnerStory051513|work=Deutsches Haus|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kz&gt;{{cite news|title=Oscar Bronner, "Standard"-Gründer, im Porträt|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/allgemein/tribuene/3217119/gruender-maler-demokrat.story|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=Kleine Zeitung|date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the first independent business magazine in Austria.&lt;ref name=char&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlotte Natmeßnig|title=Business Press in Austria|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers2/Natmessn.pdf|work=Helsinki.fi|format=Conference Paper|date=2006|accessdate=12 December 2014|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 ''Trend'' was sold to the [[News (publishing)|Verlagsgruppe NEWS]].&lt;ref name=kz/&gt;&lt;ref name=ble/&gt; The magazine was published monthly&lt;ref name=rustel&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Markets: Austria Country Overview|url=http://oldtelecoms.kondrashov.ru/world/austria.html|publisher=Russian Telecom|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Eric Solsten|title=Austria: A Country Study|date=1994|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|location=Washington|url=http://countrystudies.us/austria/127.htm|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a size of 210 x 280 mm.&lt;ref name=ble&gt;{{cite web|title=Trend|url=http://www.bleispa.com/_uploads/Testate/Approfondimenti/pfdApprofondimentoT11600904app324.pdf|work=Bleispa|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It targets senior executives, [[entrepreneurs]] and decision-makers&lt;ref name=ble/&gt; as well as Austria's [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref name=char/&gt; It is among the pioneers of [[investigative journalism]] in the country&lt;ref name=char/&gt; and publishes a list of Best Workplaces in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles J.

''Trend'' merged with its sister magazine ''[[Format (magazine)|Format]]'', another business magazine, in December 2015.&lt;ref name=tas&gt;{{cite news|title=Business magazines Format and Trend will merge to form one title: Trend|url=http://www.publicitas.com/global/media-news-events/news-detail/?no_cache=1&amp;newsid=126190&amp;title=austria-business-magazines-format-and-trend-will-merge-to-form-one-title-trend#.V_uZs5OLT6Y|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=Publicitas|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time its frequency was switched to weekly from 22 January 2016.&lt;ref name=tas/&gt;

==Circulation==
In the mid-1980s ''Trend'' had a circulation of 72,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dick Hendrikse|title=It Pays to Regionalize|journal=Folio: the Magazine for Magazine Management|date=March 1986|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-4155076/it-pays-to-regionalize|accessdate=16 August 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly had a circulation of 68,000 copies in 2003.&lt;ref name=rustel/&gt; Its circulation was 50,000 copies in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anne Austin et. al.|title=Western Europe Market &amp; Media Fact|url=http://conan.lib.muohio.edu/ebooks/Western_Europe_Market_MediaFact_2008/Western%20Europe%20Market%20&amp;%20MediaFact%202008.pdf|work=ZenithOptimedia|accessdate=8 April 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of the magazine was 60,067 copies in 2010.&lt;ref name=ble/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Western Europe Media Facts. 2011 Edition|url=http://conan.lib.muohio.edu/ebooks/Western_Europe_Market_MediaFact/2011/Western%20Europe%20Market%20&amp;%20MediaFact%202011.pdf|work=ZenithOptimedia|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decreased to 47,248 copies during the first half of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of represented titles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15218">'''Unstructured data''' (or '''unstructured information''') is information that either does not have a pre-defined [[data model]] or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically [[plain text|text]]-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and [[ambiguities]] that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or [[annotation|annotated]] ([[Tag (metadata)|semantically tagged]]) in documents.

In 1998, [[Merrill Lynch]] cited a rule of thumb that somewhere around 80-90% of all potentially usable business information may originate in unstructured form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shilakes |first1=Christopher C. |last2=Tylman |first2=Julie |title=Enterprise Information Portals |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175845/http://ikt.hia.no/perep/eip_ind.pdf |website=Merrill Lynch |date=16 Nov 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule of thumb is not based on primary or any quantitative research, but nonetheless is accepted by some.&lt;ref name="Clarabridge"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grimes |first1=Seth |title=Unstructured Data and the 80 Percent Rule |url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule |website=Breakthrough Analysis - Bridgepoints |publisher=Clarabridge |date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have reported similar or higher percentages of unstructured data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gandomi|first=Amir|last2=Haider|first2=Murtaza|date=April 2015|title=Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=35|issue=2|pages=137–144|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007|issn=0268-4012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2016/05/biggest-data-challenges-might-not-even-know/|title=The biggest data challenges that you might not even know you have - Watson|date=2016-05-25|work=Watson|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html|title=Structured vs. Unstructured Data|website=www.datamation.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The earliest research into [[business intelligence]] focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=Seth|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|website=B Eye Network|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1958, [[computer science]] researchers like [[Hans Peter Luhn|H.P. Luhn]] were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the [[SAS (software)|SAS]] Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD) to reduce a [[Dimensional Analysis|hyper-dimensional]] textual [[space (mathematics)|space]] into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis.&lt;ref name="SVD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albright|first1=Russ|title=Taming Text with the SVD|url=ftp://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/EMiner/TamingTextwiththeSVD.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical and technological advances sparked by [[machine learning|machine]] textual analysis prompted a number of businesses to research applications, leading to the development of fields like [[sentiment analysis]], [[voice of the customer]] mining, and call center optimization.&lt;ref name="Applications"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desai|first1=Manish|title=Applications of Text Analytics|url=http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.com/2009/08/applications-of-text-analytics.html|website=My Business Analytics @ Blogspot|accessdate=June 24, 2016|date=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Big Data]] in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as [[predictive analytics]] and [[root cause analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakraborty|first1=Goutam|title=Analysis of Unstructured Data: Applications of Text Analytics and Sentiment Mining|url=https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings14/1288-2014.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues with terminology ==
The term is imprecise for several reasons:
# [[Structure]], while not formally defined, can still be implied.
# Data with some form of structure may still be characterized as unstructured if its structure is not helpful for the processing task at hand.
# Unstructured information might have some structure ([[semi-structured data|semi-structured]]) or even be highly structured but in ways that are unanticipated or unannounced.

== Dealing with unstructured data ==
Techniques such as [[data mining]], [[natural language processing]] (NLP), and [[text analytics]] provide different methods to [[pattern recognition|find patterns]] in, or otherwise interpret, this information. Common techniques for structuring text usually involve manual [[Tag (metadata)|tagging with metadata]] or [[part-of-speech tagging]] for further [[text mining]]-based structuring. The [[UIMA|Unstructured Information Management Architecture]] (UIMA) standard provided a common framework for processing this information to extract meaning and create structured data about the information.&lt;ref name = "IBMContentAnalytics"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Holzinger |first2=Christof |last2=Stocker |first3=Bernhard |last3=Ofner |first4=Gottfried |last4=Prohaska |first5=Alberto |last5=Brabenetz |first6=Rainer |last6=Hofmann-Wellenhof |year=2013 |chapter=Combining HCI, Natural Language Processing, and Knowledge Discovery – Potential of IBM Content Analytics as an Assistive Technology in the Biomedical Field |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39146-0_2 |pages=13–24 |editor1-first=Andreas |editor1-last=Holzinger |editor2-first=Gabriella |editor2-last=Pasi |title=Human-Computer Interaction and Knowledge Discovery in Complex, Unstructured, Big Data |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-39146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software that creates machine-processable structure can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure that exist in all forms of human communication.&lt;ref name="IntelligentEnterprise"&gt;{{cite web |title=Structure, Models and Meaning: Is "unstructured" data merely unmodeled? |url=http://www.intelligententerprise.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=59301538 |website=InformationWeek |language=en |date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of "unstructured data" may include books, journals, documents, [[metadata]], [[health record]]s, [[Sound|audio]], [[video]], [[Analog device|analog data]], images, files, and unstructured text such as the body of an [[e-mail]] message, [[Web page]], or [[word-processor]] document. While the main content being conveyed does not have a defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as "unstructured data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malone |first1=Robert |title=Structuring Unstructured Data |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/04/04/teradata-solution-software-biz-logistics-cx_rm_0405data.html |website=Forbes |language=en |date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[HTML]] web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. [[XHTML]] tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.

Since unstructured data commonly occurs in [[electronic document]]s, the use of a [[content management|content]] or [[document management]] system which can categorize entire documents is often preferred over data transfer and manipulation from within the documents. Document management thus provides the means to convey structure onto [[text corpus|document collections]].

[[Search engines]] have become popular tools for indexing and searching through such data, especially text.

=== Approaches in natural language processing ===
Specific computational workflows have been developed to impose structure upon the unstructured data contained within text documents. These workflows are generally designed to handle sets of thousands or even millions of documents, or far more than manual approaches to annotation may permit. Several of these approaches are based upon the concept of [[Online analytical processing|online analytical processing, or OLAP]], and may be supported by data models such as text cubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lin|first=Cindy Xide|last2=Ding|first2=Bolin|last3=Han|first3=Jiawei|last4=Zhu|first4=Feida|last5=Zhao|first5=Bo|date=December 2008|title=Text Cube: Computing IR Measures for Multidimensional Text Database Analysis|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781199/?reload=true|journal=2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/icdm.2008.135|isbn=9780769535029|citeseerx=10.1.1.215.3177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once document metadata is available through a data model, generating summaries of subsets of documents (i.e., cells within a text cube) may be performed with phrase-based approaches.&lt;ref name = "textcubes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Dimensional, Phrase-Based Summarization in Text Cubes |url=http://sites.computer.org/debull/A16sept/p74.pdf |last=Tao|first=Fangbo | last2=Zhuang|first2=Honglei | last3=Yu|first3=Chi Wang| first4=Qi|last4=Wang | first5=Taylor|last5=Cassidy | first6=Lance|last6=Kaplan | first7=Clare|last7=Voss| last8=Han | first8=Jiawei | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches in medicine and biomedical research ===
Biomedical research generates one major source of unstructured data as researchers often publish their findings in scholarly journals. Though the language in these documents is challenging to derive structural elements from (e.g., due to the complicated technical vocabulary contained within and the domain knowledge required to fully contextualize observations), the results of these activities may yield links between technical and medical studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Nigel|last2=Nazarenko|first2=Adeline|last3=Baud|first3=Robert|last4=Ruch|first4=Patrick|date=June 2006|title=Recent advances in natural language processing for biomedical applications|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=75|issue=6|pages=413–417|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.06.008|issn=1386-5056|pmid=16139564}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clues regarding new disease therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Graciela H.|last2=Tahsin|first2=Tasnia|last3=Goodale|first3=Britton C.|last4=Greene|first4=Anna C.|last5=Greene|first5=Casey S.|date=January 2016|title=Recent Advances and Emerging Applications in Text and Data Mining for Biomedical Discovery|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–42|doi=10.1093/bib/bbv087|issn=1477-4054|pmc=4719073|pmid=26420781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent efforts to enforce structure upon biomedical documents include [[self-organizing map]] approaches for identifying topics among documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skupin|first=André|last2=Biberstine|first2=Joseph R.|last3=Börner|first3=Katy|date=2013|title=Visualizing the topical structure of the medical sciences: a self-organizing map approach|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e58779|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058779|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3595294|pmid=23554924}}&lt;/ref&gt; general-purpose [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised algorithms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiela|first=Douwe|last2=Guo|first2=Yufan|last3=Stenius|first3=Ulla|last4=Korhonen|first4=Anna|date=2015-04-01|title=Unsupervised discovery of information structure in biomedical documents|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1084–1092|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btu758|issn=1367-4811|pmid=25411329}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an application of the CaseOLAP workflow&lt;ref name = "textcubes" /&gt; to determine associations between protein names and [[cardiovascular disease]] topics in the literature.&lt;ref name="caseolapCV"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liem|first=David A.|last2=Murali|first2=Sanjana|last3=Sigdel|first3=Dibakar|last4=Shi|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Xuan|last6=Shen|first6=Jiaming|last7=Choi|first7=Howard|last8=Caufield|first8=John H.|last9=Wang|first9=Wei|last10=Ping|first10=Peipei|last11=Han|first11=Jiawei|date=Oct 1, 2018|title=Phrase mining of textual data to analyze extracellular matrix protein patterns across cardiovascular disease|journal=American Journal of Physiology.
