      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3092">The '''1804 rebellion in [[Mtiuleti]]''' was a conflict in the former [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] (eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), at that time part of the [[Georgia Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. It was the first major Georgian rebellion directed against the [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian administration]].{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} 

==Background==
In 1801, the Russians capitalized on the moment, and annexed the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. The entity was then reduced to the status of a [[guberniya|Russian region]] (Georgia Governorate). Though the Russian administration brought some peace, Kartli-Kakheti remained troubled.{{sfn|Suny|1994|pages=68-70}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|pages=263-264}}

==Rebellion==
It broke out at a vulnerable spot, to the west of the [[Darial Gorge|Darial Pass]].{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} A number of local [[Ossetians]] had complained about the grain and meat demands of [[Cossacks]] stationed in the area.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} They were thrown into a pit.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} The Cossacks then proceeded to punish more locals; peasants were put to forced labour, two men were killed by whip lashing, women were mistreated, and cattle was worked to death.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}}

The people of the [[Aragvi River|Aragvi valley]] then attacked the troops of Dmitri Mikhailovich Volkonsky, killing several of them.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} They then proceeded to occupy several of the forts on the nearby main road.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} In the summer of 1804, 4,000 [[Georgians|Georgian]] and Ossetian rebels requested [[Prince Parnaoz of Georgia|Prince Parnaoz]] to lead them.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} On 3 August 1804, the rebels and Russian forces clashed at Lomisi; the Russian forces reportedly only escaped defeat due to the "timidity" of the Kakhetian nobles and the return of Russian General [[Pavel Tsitsianov]], who had just [[Siege of Erivan (1804)|unsuccessfully besieged Erivan]].{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} The rebellion was eventually crushed; hundreds of highlanders were [[bayonet]]ed or imprisoned.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}} It would take eight years before more anti-Russian violence erupted.{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=263}}{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=70}}

A part of the Georgian nobles participated in the 1804 Mtiuleti rebellion.{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=70}}

'''Abdirahman Mahdi''' is the current [[Foreign Affairs Secretary]] and one of the founders of the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF), a political movement determined to allow the people of [[Ogaden]] to exercise their right to self-determination in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The ONLF is considered a terrorist organisation by the  government of [[Ethiopia]].

In addition, Mahdi is also a member of the central committee and executive council, highest decision-making bodies, of the ONLF. Furthermore, he is the current vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/18354 |title=XII UNPO GA Adopts General Resolution and Elects New Presidency|date=8 July 2015|publisher= Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO), elected at its XII General Assembly held at the Flemish Parliament in Brussels on 4 July 2015.

Mahdi founded the ONLF on August 15, 1984, along with five other prominent Ogadeni activists: Mohamed Ismail Omar, current vice chairman of the ONLF; Sheikh Ibrahim Abdalla Mohamed, former chairman of the ONLF (1991–1998); Abdi Ibrahim Ghehleh, former trade unionist; Abdirahman Yusuf Magan, former [[WSLF]] member; and Abdullahi Muhammed Sa'adi, former WSLF representative in [[Kuwait]]. The ONLF is currently led by Chairman Mohammed Omar Osman, who was elected to the post at a 1998 national convention.

The Somali region of  Ethiopia is self-administered by ethnic Somalis.

[[File:Adarsh Housing.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Adarsh Housing.|Adarsh Housing Society in July 2011.]]
The Adarsh Housing Society is a posh, 31-storey building constructed on prime real estate in [[Colaba]], [[Mumbai]], for the welfare of war widows and personnel of [[Ministry of Defence (India)|India's Ministry of Defence]]. Over a period of several years, politicians, bureaucrats and military officers allegedly conspired to bend several rules concerning land ownership, zoning, floor space index and membership getting themselves flats allotted in this [[cooperative society]] at below-market rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/criminal-conspiracy-in-mumbai-highrise-army-officers-could-be-involved-defence-probe/704533/0 | title= Criminal conspiracy in Mumbai highrise, Army officers could be involved: Defence probe | work= Press Trust of India |publisher= Indian Express |date= Oct 29, 2010| accessdate= April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/newswallah-a-brief-history-of-corruption-in-the-ministry-of-defense/| title= A Brief History of Corruption in the Ministry of Defense | author= Neha Thirani|publisher= New York Times |date= April 2, 2012| accessdate= April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scam was unearthed in November 2010 which forced the then [[Chief Minister of Maharashtra]], [[Ashok Chavan]], to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/corruption-allegations-prompt-slew-of-political-resignations-in-india/ | title= Corruption Allegations Prompt Slew of Political Resignations in India | author= Malavika Vyawahare |publisher= New York Times |date= June 26, 2012 | accessdate= April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a report of the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] (CAG) said, "The episode of Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society reveals how a group of select officials, placed in key posts, could subvert rules and regulations in order to grab prime government land – a public property – for personal benefit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society, Mumbai |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_compliance/2011_12/Defence_Services/Report_11/Adarsh_Defence.pdf |publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General of India |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803071611/http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_compliance/2011_12/Defence_Services/Report_11/Adarsh_Defence.pdf |archivedate=3 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the [[Government of Maharashtra|Maharashtra government]] set up a two-member judicial commission to inquire into the matter. The commission was headed by retired High Court judge Justice J A Patil, with N N Kumbhar acting as member secretary. After deposing 182 witnesses over 2 years, the commission submitted its final report in April 2013 to the [[Government of Maharashtra|Maharashtra government]]. The report highlighted 25 illegal allotments, including 22 purchases made by [[Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988|proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/adarsh-housing-scam-commission-submits-its-final-report-356037| title= Adarsh Housing scam commission submits its final report | work= Press Trust of India |publisher= NDTV |date= April 19, 2013 | accessdate= April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also [[indict]]ed four former [[Chief Minister of Maharashtra|chief ministers of Maharashtra]]: [[Ashok Chavan]], [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]], [[Sushilkumar Shinde]] and [[Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil]], 2 former urban development ministers: [[Rajesh Tope]] and [[Sunil Tatkare]] and 12 top bureaucrats for various illegal acts. The allottees included [[Devyani Khobragade]].&lt;ref name="Adarsh panel indicts four Maharashtra ex-CMs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maharashtra Govt Rejects Adarsh Scam Report"/&gt;

The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), the [[Taxation in India#Income Tax Department|Income Tax Department]] and the [[Enforcement Directorate]] (ED) are currently investigating allegations that three former [[Chief Minister of Maharashtra|chief ministers of Maharashtra]] – [[Sushilkumar Shinde]], [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]] and [[Ashok Chavan]] – were involved in the scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/mumbai/31110130_1_adarsh-probe-adarsh-cooperative-housing-society-adarsh-members | work=The Times of India | title=HC slams ED, CBI for tardy Adarsh probe | date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTVlist"&gt;{{cite news

==Alleged violations==
The Adarsh Society high-rise was constructed in the [[Colaba]] locality of [[Mumbai]]. This is considered a sensitive coastal area by the Indian Defence forces and is the location of various Indian defence establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The scam is notable for the fact that it was enacted over a period of ten years and required the active involvement of successive officials in many crucial posts. Rules and regulations across many departments and ministries, both at the Centre and the state of Maharashtra,  were flouted or bent to allow for the construction of the building. Some of the more blatant transgressions included: obtaining a [[No Objection Certificate]] (NOC) from the Army towards construction of the building in a sensitive zone, getting the [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority]] (MMRDA) development plan modified, and obtaining another NOC for residential development in a [[Coastal Regulation Zone]], often through manipulation of records and misrepresentation of facts. Efforts by honest officers to bring this to the notice of top officials were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deshpande|first=Alok|title=Seniors diluted my objections to Adarsh housing society: Saurav Ray|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_seniors-diluted-my-objections-to-adarsh-housing-society-saurav-ray_1615697|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=Daily News and Analysis|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was first raised in a newspaper report in 2003 but did not evoke any official reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halarnkar|first=Samar|title=Officer in CBI net ropes big fish for prime Mumbai plot|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/28841/|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=3 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was again raised by [[media in India|various newspapers and TV channels]]. Questions were raised about the manner in which apartments in the building were allocated to bureaucrats, politicians and army personnel who had nothing to do with the [[Kargil War]] and the way in which clearances were obtained for the construction of the building of the Adarsh Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some of the current allottees of the flats in the Adarsh co-operative society building have offered to return their flats, denying allegations that they were allotted flats because they influenced or helped, in some manner, the construction of the society by violating the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In an interview to [[The Hindu]] published on 26 March 2012, General [[Vijay Kumar Singh|VK Singh]], the [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of Army Staff]] ascribed many of the attempts to malign him during his tenure to, amongst others, those he described as "the Adarsh lobby", those directly connected to the scam, as well as those who were affected by his efforts to rid the army of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Subramanium|first=Vidya|title=Sack the general, did you say?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article3269586.ece|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 April 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state of investigation==
Several inquiries have been ordered by the army and the Government to probe into the irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adarsh Society: Army setting up court of inquiry |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article863396.ece |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFbxHzr3?url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article863396.ece |archivedate=15 November 2010 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bombay High Court monitoring of CBI investigation ===
{{See also|Public-interest litigation (India)}}

There was a spate of petitions filed in [[Bombay High Court]] seeking to monitor CBI investigation. The petitions are Criminal [[Public-interest litigation (India)|PIL]] No. 34 of 2010 by former Journalist Ketan Tirodkar, Criminal Writ Petition No. 3359 of 2010 by Simpreet Singh and Criminal PIL No. 36 of 2010 by Mahendra Singh. Ref. Bombay High Court order dated 17th Feb. 2011 [http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/generatenewauth.php?auth=cGF0aD0uL2RhdGEvY3JpbWluYWwvMjAxMS8mZm5hbWU9Q1JQSUwzNDEwMTcwMjExLnBkZiZzbWZsYWc9Tg==]. By this order High Court asked CBI to amend the F.I.R. by adding Benami Properties Transaction Act section 4. Also, the High Court transferred the missing filed probe from Mumbai Police to CBI. Praveen Wategaonkar filed Criminal PIL later seeking invoking of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into the case. So it has been invoked and Enforcement Directorate came into picture.&lt;ref name="Bombay High court order on 28 Feb 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bombay High court order on 28 Feb 2012 |url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/data/criminal/2012/WP335910280212.pdf |publisher=Bombay High Court |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055647/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/data/criminal/2012/WP335910280212.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bombay High court order on 12 March 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bombay High court order on 28 Feb 2012 |url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/data/criminal/2012/CRPIL2011120312.pdf |publisher=Bombay High Court |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060731/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/data/criminal/2012/CRPIL2011120312.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to these petitions and based on the slow pace of the investigation in the last two years, [[Bombay High Court]] severely castigated [[Enforcement Directorate]] for its failure to initiate any probe in the matter on 28 February 2012. Expressing its unhappiness the court observed,  ''"It is unfortunate that ED has remained a mute spectator. There is a serious lapse on the agency's part for not probing into money laundering offence. ED has not moved an inch. It reflects a sorry state of affairs. We are summoning the director as there has been no assistance from his department to the court."'' The Court also rapped the CBI for the tardiness in its  investigations (begun in January 2011).&lt;ref name="Bombay High court order on 28 Feb 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adarsh scam probe: Bombay HC pulls up ED"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/maharashtra/adarsh-scam-probe-bombay-hc-pulls-up-ed_761118.html | title=Adarsh scam probe: Bombay HC pulls up ED | work=Zee News | date=28 February 2012 | accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adarsh housing scam: Bombay HC slams ED, CBI, warns of forming SIT "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Adarsh-housing-scam-Bombay-HC-slams-ED-CBI-warns-of-forming-SIT/articleshow/12068967.cms | title=Adarsh housing scam: Bombay HC slams ED, CBI, warns of forming SIT | work=Times of India | date=28 February 2012 | accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court,  again on 12 March 2012, severely castigated the CBI for not arresting any of the accused in spite of having evidence and ordered it to take action without fear or favour.&lt;ref name="Bombay High court order on 12 March 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Why no arrests in Adarsh scam, court asks CBI"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2572885.ece | title=Why no arrests in Adarsh scam, court asks CBI | date=12 March 2012 | accessdate=12 March 2012 | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ED having registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, has decided to launch attachment proceedings of the flats after going through the latest chargesheet filed by CBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/ED-to-attach-Adarsh-assets/Article1-885981.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125064712/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/ED-to-attach-Adarsh-assets/Article1-885981.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=ED to attach Adarsh assets |date=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrests ===
Following the Court's criticism, the CBI carried out eight arrests including two retired [[Major General]]s TejK Kaul and AR Kumar, retired brigadier MM Wanchoo, former General Officer Commanding(GOC) of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa, Adarsh promoter Kanhaiyalal Gidwani and Pradeep Vyas, the then city collector and currently, finance secretary (expenditure) in the [[Govt. of Maharashtra]]. Accordingly, on 22 March 2012, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, [[Prithviraj Chavan]] announced in the legislative assembly that the two [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] officers whose names have figured in the scam, Pradeep Vyas and [[Jairaj Phatak]] have been suspended from government service.&lt;ref name="Adarsh Scam: CBI Arrests Retd Brigadier, 3 Others"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=756408 |title=Adarsh Scam: CBI Arrests Retd Brigadier, 3 Others |work=outlook India |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321092804/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=756408 |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adarsh Scam: IAS Officer, 2 Retd Maj Generals Arrested"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=756595 |title=Adarsh Scam: IAS Officer, 2 Retd Maj Generals Arrested |work=outlook India |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322130207/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=756595 |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to newspaper reports, many of the arrested hold more than one flat in the society in fictitious names. Former Congress MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani was reported to have as many as ten flats, which he had bought on behalf of top politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raja|first=Aditi|title=CBI probe reveals former Cong minister owns 10 flats in Adarsh   |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kanhaiyalal-gidwani-biggest-share-tainted-adarsh-flats/1/179676.html|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=India Today|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gidwani and his son had been earlier arrested on 6 March 2012, by the CBI for trying to influence CBI officials investigating their alleged involvement in the Adarsh scam. In a further twist to the case, the CBI officers arrested their own lawyers, J K Jagiasi and Mandar Goswami. Jagiasi allegedly asked an Air India (AI) official, one of the accused in the case, to pay a bribe of Rs 5&amp;nbsp;million in exchange for diluting charges levelled against him. The petty cash books maintained by Jagiasi helped unearth the conspiracy. In addition, Rs 2.5&amp;nbsp;million was allegedly paid to Goswami. He was the Special Counsel in the Ministry of Law and Justice and at present is working as Retainer Counsel for CBI. According to CBI sources, the tainted AI official approached the CBI for dilution of the case filed against him.&lt;ref name="Adarsh Scam: CBI Arrests Own Lawyer, Ex-Cong MLC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=754366 |title=Adarsh Scam: CBI Arrests Own Lawyer, Ex-Cong MLC |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502151002/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=754366 |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jairaj Phatak]] and Ramanand Tiwari were arrested by the CBI on 3 April 2012, for their alleged involvement in receiving illegal gratification in the Adarsh Housing Society Scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Bail ===
On 29 May 2012, a special CBI court granted bail to seven of the nine arrested accused in the Adarsh scam since the CBI failed to file a [[chargesheet]] within the stipulated 60 days from the time it took them in custody. Those granted bail include Maj. Gen. ([[Retired]]-retd) A.&amp;nbsp;R. Kumar, Maj. Gen. (retd) T. K. Kaul, Brig. (retd) M. M. Wanchu, IAS officer and former Mumbai [[district collector]] Pradeep Vyas, former Defence Estate officer R. C. Thakur, IAS officer P. V. Deshmukh and former Congress member of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Council]] Kanhaiyalal Gidwani (the chief promoter of Adarsh). The bail was set at ₹500,000 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] (US$7,700). They have been directed to attend the CBI office every Tuesday and Thursday between 10&amp;nbsp;am and 12&amp;nbsp;pm. The court also told the accused to deposit their passports and not tamper with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven get bail in Adarsh scam|url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/seven-get-bail-in-adarsh-scam-1|publisher=MSN India|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Maharashtra Governor K Sankaranarayanan===
In spite of CBI having a strong 'quid pro quo' case against ex Maharashtra CM [[Ashok Chavan]], Maharashtra Governor [[K. Sankaranarayanan]] refused to grant permission to prosecute Chavan.

'''Case Time Lines''' 

Jan 2014: Sessions court refuses to delete Ashok Chavan's name as accused in the case on request made by CBI.

Mar 2015: Bombay High Court also dismisses Ashok Chavan's petition seeking deletion of his name from the case.

Oct 2015: CBI submits fresh evidence to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao seeking sanction once again.

Feb 2016: Governor Rao grants the CBI permission to prosecute Ashok Chavan. Chavan approaches HC challenging Governor's order.

''Dec 22, 2017: HC allows Chavan’s petition and quashes and sets aside Governor’s order granting sanction to prosecute him.''

== Inquiry by a Judicial Commission ==

On 9 January 2011, [[Government of Maharashtra]] appointed a two-member judicial commission, under the [[Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952]],&lt;ref name="Chavan appoints judicial inquiry into Adarsh scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chavan appoints judicial inquiry into Adarsh scam|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article1073153.ece|accessdate=6 October 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 January 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate alleged irregularities and corruption. It was decided that the commission would be led by a retired [[Bombay High Court]] judge [[JA Patil]]&lt;ref name="Profile of J.A. Patil at High Court of Bombay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of J.A. Patil at High Court of Bombay|url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/jshowpuisne.php?auth=cGFnZW5vPTMz|publisher=High Court of Bombay|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former State Chief Secretary P Subramanian would be the member.

The Commission's terms of reference were to investigate all aspects, including land ownership and allotment, permissions given to Adarsh. The Commission was given three months' time to complete the investigation.&lt;ref name="State govt appoints 2-member panel to probe Adarsh scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=State govt appoints 2-member panel to probe Adarsh scam|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/state-govt-appoints-2-member-panel-to-probe-adarsh-scam/421220/|accessdate=6 October 2012|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2012, while deposing before the two-member panel probing the scam, [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]], Union Minister and former chief minister of Maharashtra contended that land was allotted to the housing society after getting clearance from the Revenue Department, passing the buck to his successor, [[Ashok Chavan]] who headed the department then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/adarsh-probe-vilasrao-deshmukh-blames-ashok-chavan-for-land-allotment-236698?pfrom=home-india| title= Adarsh probe: Vilasrao Deshmukh blames Ashok Chavan for land allotment| date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the commission submitted its final report to the [[Government of Maharashtra]] but it refused to table it in the assembly.[[Government of Maharashtra]] deliberately adopted delay tactics and it was only after queries from the [[Bombay High Court]] that the Government tabled the report purposely on the very last day of Assembly's Winter Session in December 2013 so that the Adarsh report cannot be discussed in the Winter session of 2013. The report that was tabled was conveniently rejected the Maharashtra Cabinet led by [[Prithviraj Chavan]].&lt;ref name="Maharashtra Govt Rejects Adarsh Scam Report"&gt;{{cite news|title=Maharashtra Govt Rejects Adarsh Scam Report |url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=821762 |accessdate=21 December 2013 |date=20 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221015010/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=821762 |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report [[indict]]ed 4 former chief ministers: [[Ashok Chavan]], [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]], [[Sushilkumar Shinde]] and [[Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil]], 2 former urban development ministers: [[Rajesh Tope]] and [[Sunil Tatkare]] and 12 top bureaucrats.&lt;ref name="Adarsh panel indicts four Maharashtra ex-CMs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adarsh panel indicts four Maharashtra ex-CMs|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Adarsh-panel-indicts-four-Maharashtra-ex-CMs/articleshow/27694093.cms|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=21 December 2013|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said [[Ashok Chavan]] and other bureaucrats gave permissions and clearances in exchange for flats. It found 25 of the society's 102 members ''ineligible''. The report also said Adarsh enjoyed the "political patronage" of Late Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde, Chavan, Sunil Tatkare and Rajesh Tope. The report revealed that 22 [[Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988|benami transactions]] took place and that the Adarsh society never sought any environmental clearances.&lt;ref name="panel report slams former chief minister Ashok Chavan"&gt;{{cite news|title=panel report slams former chief minister Ashok Chavan|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/adarsh-housing-society-scam-panel-report-slams-former-chief-minister-ashok-chavan-461213|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report mentioned that [[Devyani Khobragade]] (who was in the news for a visa fraud allegation by [[United States Government]] around the same time the report was released), was an illegal beneficiary of a flat allotted to her.&lt;ref name="Adarsh Scam: Khobragade Among Illegal Beneficiaries"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adarsh Scam: Khobragade Among Illegal Beneficiaries |url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=821793 |accessdate=21 December 2013 |date=20 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221015027/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=821793 |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Rahul Gandhi]] and [[Sonia Gandhi]] publicly disapproved of Maharashtra cabinet's decision to reject judicial report, [[Prithviraj Chavan]] convened a cabinet meet to review the decision. The report was partially accepted by the state cabinet. It was decided that the 12 officials named in the report will face departmental inquiry for violating the service conduct rules  but appeared going soft on politicians named by the commission for political patronage.The cabinet has also decided to initiate proceedings against 22 benami transactions, adding the commission had recommended action against allottees of such flats as they were found to be in violation of the Benami Transactions Prohibition Act.

==CBI special court rejects CBI plea==
Governor of Maharashtra K. Sankaranarayan; in a latest development rejected the proposal of Central Bureau of Investigations to grant sanction to prosecute former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan for having favoured Adarsh Society by way of allotment of additional Floor Space Index  illegally. It is stated in the C.B.I. proposal that Mr. Chavan grabbed two apartments in the tainted society for these illegal decisions.

Acitivist Ketan Tirodkar moved Bombay High Court seeking direction to C.B.I. to proceed against Ashok Chavan without sanction on the basis of Supreme Court Judgement stating that sanction to prosecute is not required in cases that are monitored by Court.[Application 27 of 2013 in Cr.PIL 34 of 2010]. The application states that Governor Mr. Sankarnarayan was Union Minister with father of Ashok Chavan and Ashok met governor on later's birth-day 15 October; 2013; at Raj Bhavan; official residence of the Governor. This meet lasted for an hour; as stated in the application after which Governor rejected the CBI plea of sanction. The application in High Court seeks direction to CBI to proceed with prosecution of Ashok Chavan &amp; Governor. [http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/city-briefs-adarsh-housing-scam-plea-in-hc-against-guv-order-on-ashok-chavan/1210802/][http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/application-challenges-governors-refusal-to-allow-chavans-prosecution/article5494514.ece]
CBI, acting like a caged parrot, conveniently ignored the Supreme Court judgement on the aspect of Sanction to Prosecute being Not Required in cases monitored by Court; and moved the Special CBI court to drop Mr. Ashok Chavan from the process of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No immediate review of governor's opinion on Ashok Chavan: CBI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-15/india/46223770_1_bhagvati-sharma-sister-in-law-seema-ashok-chavan|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=15 January 2013|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the special court rejected the CBI's plea to drop his name from the list of accused in the Adarsh scam case.Special CBI court observed even though governor K Sankaranarayanan had rejected CBI's plea for sanction to prosecute Chavan, he could still be tried under the Prevention of Corruption act as he has been accused of criminal misconduct. Special CBI Public Prosecutor Bharat Badami himself admitted in the court that the CBI would be "very happy" to prosecute the former chief minister but "our hands are tied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= CBI plea for dropping Ashok Chavan's name in Adarsh scam rejected|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/CBI-plea-for-dropping-Ashok-Chavans-name-in-Adarsh-scam-rejected/articleshow/29000811.cms|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=18 January 2013|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another Public Interest Litigation has been moved by activist Ketan Tirodkar seeking to prosecute State Cabinet for having rejected Judicial Commission findings pertaining to Adarsh housing scam.[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-24/mumbai/45539153_1_adarsh-case-adarsh-report-cbi].

== Issues ==

Adarsh Housing Society has defended its actions as similar to other housing societies such as ''Samata'', "Nyay Sagar" &amp; likes in which "serving and retired judges already owned homes in Mumbai but transferred these in names of their children to become eligible for apartments in Samata &amp; Nyay Sagar.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/adarsh-has-a-defence-there-are-so-many-like-us/733999/0 Adarsh has a defence, there are so many like us - Indian Express]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, Nyay Sagar Society is constructed upon a plot of land reserved for Housing the War Disabled.

A codified system of racial stratification began to take form in South Africa under the [[Dutch Empire]] in the late-eighteenth century, although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between Dutch colonists and a creolised, ethnically diverse slave population.&lt;ref name=Glaser&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Daryl|title=Politics and Society in South Africa|date=2001|pages=9–12|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0761950172}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rapid growth and industrialisation of the [[British Cape Colony]] in the nineteenth century, racial policies and laws became increasingly rigid.

The first apartheid law was the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949]], followed closely by the [[Immorality Act|Immorality Amendment Act]] of 1950, which made it illegal for most South African citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=F.

== Precursors ==
{{Main|History of South Africa (1815–1910)|History of South Africa (1910–1948)}}
Under the 1806 Cape Articles of Capitulation the new [[British Empire|British]] colonial rulers were required to respect previous legislation enacted under [[Roman Dutch law]]&lt;ref name="Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoro00leeruoft |title=Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law |accessdate=27 March 2011 |author=R.W Lee |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this led to a separation of the law in South Africa from [[English law|English Common Law]] and a high degree of legislative autonomy. The governors and assemblies that governed the legal process in the various colonies of South Africa were launched on a different and independent legislative path from the rest of the [[British Empire]].

In the days of [[slavery]], slaves required passes to travel away from their masters. In 1797 the [[Landdrost]] and Heemraden of [[Swellendam]] and [[Graaff-Reinet]] extended [[pass laws]] beyond slaves and ordained that all [[Khoikhoi]] (designated as ''Hottentots'') moving about the country for any purpose should carry passes.&lt;ref name="Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents"&gt;{{cite book |title=Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents |author=A. Du Toit, H.B. Giliomee |isbn=978-0-520-04319-0 |work=|publisher=University of California Press |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by the British Colonial government in 1809 by the Hottentot Proclamation, which decreed that if a Khoikhoi were to move they would need a pass from their master or a local official.&lt;ref name="Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents" /&gt;  Ordinance No. 49 of 1828 decreed that prospective black immigrants were to be granted passes for the sole purpose of seeking work.&lt;ref name="Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents" /&gt; These passes were to be issued for Coloureds and Khoikhoi, but not for other Africans, who were still forced to carry passes.

The United Kingdom's [[Slavery Abolition Act]] 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished slavery throughout the British Empire and overrode the Cape Articles of Capitulation. To comply with the act the South African legislation was expanded to include Ordinance 1 in 1835, which effectively changed the status of slaves to [[indentured labourer]]s. This was followed by Ordinance 3 in 1848, which introduced an indenture system for [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] that was little different from slavery. The various South African colonies passed legislation throughout the rest of the nineteenth century to limit the freedom of unskilled workers, to increase the restrictions on indentured workers and to regulate the relations between the races.

{{Main|South African general election, 1948}}

[[File:DFMalanPortret.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daniel François Malan]], the first apartheid-era prime minister (1948{{ndash}}1954)]]

The Union of South Africa had allowed social custom and law to govern the consideration of multiracial affairs and of the allocation, in racial terms, of access to economic, social, and political status.&lt;ref name="zastudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Irving|title=Area Handbook for the Republic of South Africa|pages=1–86|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED056947.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[white South African]]s, regardless of their own differences, accepted the prevailing pattern. Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were occasional gaps in the social structure, whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid economic development of World War II attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or social services.&lt;ref name="zastudy" /&gt; Overcrowding, spiking crime rates, and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support a new generation of leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the [[Atlantic Charter]]. Whites reacted negatively to the changes, allowing the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (or simply [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]) to convince a large segment of the voting bloc that the impotence of the United Party in curtailing the evolving position of nonwhites indicated that the organisation had fallen under the influence of Western liberals.&lt;ref name="zastudy" /&gt; Many [[Afrikaners]], whites chiefly of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent but with early infusions of [[Germans]] and [[Huguenot|French Huguenots]] who were soon assimilated, also resented what they perceived as disempowerment by an underpaid black workforce and the superior economic power and prosperity of white English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brits, ''Modern South Africa'': Afrikaner power, the politics of race, and resistance, 1902 to the 1970s (Pretoria, University of South Africa Press, 2007), p37&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Jan Smuts, as a strong advocate of the [[United Nations]], lost domestic support when South Africa was criticised for its colour bar and the continued mandate of [[South West Africa]] by other UN member states.&lt;ref name="O'Meara"&gt;O'Meara, Dan. ''Forty Lost Years : The National Party and the Politics of the South African State'', 1948–1994. Athens: [[Ohio University Press]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrikaner nationalists proclaimed that they offered the voters a new policy to ensure continued white domination.&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;M. Meredith, ''In the Name of Apartheid'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-06-430163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was initially expounded from a theory drafted by [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] and was presented to the National Party by the [[Sauer Commission]].&lt;ref name="zastudy" /&gt; It called for a systematic effort to organise the relations, rights, and privileges of the races as officially defined through a series of parliamentary acts and administrative decrees. Segregation had thus been pursued only in major matters, such as separate schools, and local society rather than law had been depended upon to enforce most separation; it should now be extended to everything.&lt;ref name="zastudy" /&gt; The party gave this policy a name{{snds}}''apartheid'' (apartness). Apartheid was to be the basic ideological and practical foundation of Afrikaner politics for the next quarter of a century.&lt;ref name="Meredith" /&gt;

The National Party's election platform stressed that apartheid would preserve a market for white employment in which nonwhites could not compete. On the issues of black urbanisation, the regulation of nonwhite labour, influx control, social security, farm tariffs, and nonwhite taxation the United Party's policy remained contradictory and confused.&lt;ref name="O'Meara" /&gt; Its traditional bases of support not only took mutually exclusive positions, but found themselves increasingly at odds with each other. Smuts' reluctance to consider South African foreign policy against the mounting tensions of the [[Cold War]] also stirred up discontent, while the nationalists promised to purge the state and public service of communist sympathisers.&lt;ref name="O'Meara" /&gt;

First to desert the United Party were Afrikaner farmers, who wished to see a change in influx control due to problems with squatters, as well as higher prices for their maize and other produce in the face of the mineowners' demand for cheap food policies. Always identified with the affluent and capitalist, the party also failed to appeal to its working class constituents.&lt;ref name="O'Meara" /&gt; Populist rhetoric allowed the National Party to sweep eight constituencies in the mining and industrial centres of the [[Witwatersrand]] and five more in [[Pretoria]]. Barring the predominantly English-speaking landowner electorate of the [[Natal Province|Natal]], the United Party was defeated in almost every rural district. Its urban losses in the nation's most populous province, the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], proved equally devastating.&lt;ref name="O'Meara" /&gt; As the voting system was [[Malapportionment|disproportionately weighted]] in favour of rural constituencies and the Transvaal in particular, the 1948 election catapulted the Herenigde Nasionale Party from a small minority party to a commanding position with an eight-vote parliamentary lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blSAApartheidFAQ.htm|publisher=about.com|title=Apartheid FAQ|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sahistory-1948election"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/1948-election.htm |title=The 1948 election and the National Party Victory |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=South African History Online| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080816015132/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/1948-election.htm| archivedate= 16 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel François Malan]] became the first nationalist prime minister, with the aim of implementing the apartheid philosophy and silencing liberal opposition.&lt;ref name="zastudy" /&gt;

When the National Party came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation. The "[[baasskap]]" (white domination or supremacist) faction, which was the dominant faction in the NP, and state institutions, favoured systematic segregation, but also favoured the participation of black Africans in the economy with black labour controlled to advance the economic gains of Afrikaners. A second faction were the "purists", who believed in "vertical segregation", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. A third faction, which included Hendrik Verwoerd, sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation.&lt;ref name="Kuperus1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

=== Legislation ===
{{Apartheid legislation in South Africa}}
{{Main|Apartheid legislation}}

NP leaders argued that South Africa did not comprise a single nation, but was made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, Coloured and Indian. Such groups were split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and [[Afrikaans]] language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups.

The state passed laws that paved the way for "grand apartheid", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. This strategy was in part adopted from "left-over" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the [[Boer republics]] in the [[Anglo-Boer war]]. This created the black-only "townships" or "locations", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, "petty apartheid" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;Alistair Boddy-Evans. [http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsalaws.htm African History: Apartheid Legislation in South Africa], [[About.com]]. Retrieved 5 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first grand apartheid law was the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1950, which formalised racial classification and introduced an identity card for all persons over the age of 18, specifying their racial group.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy-Evans, Alistar. [http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidlaws/g/No30of50.htm Population Registration Act No 30 of 1950]. [[About.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Official teams or boards were established to come to a conclusion on those people whose race was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar, Sanford (1989). ''Africa: the people and politics of an emerging continent.'' Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused difficulty, especially for Coloured people, separating their families when members were allocated different races.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Ian (1987). ''Making race: the politics and economics of Coloured identity in South Africa.'' Longman. p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second pillar of grand apartheid was the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy-Evans, Alistar. [http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidlaws/g/No41of50.htm Group Areas Act No 41 of 1950]. [[About.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which was used in later years as a basis of forced removal.&lt;ref&gt;Besteman, Catherine Lowe (2008). ''Transforming Cape Town''. University of California Press. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act, 1951|Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act]] of 1951 allowed the government to demolish black [[shanty town]] slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy-Evans, Alistar. [http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsalaws.htm Apartheid Legislation in South Africa]. [[About.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races, and the [[Immorality Act]] of 1950 made [[Miscegenation|sexual relations with a person of a different race]] a [[criminal offence]].

Under the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]] of 1953, municipal grounds could be reserved for a particular race, creating, among other things, separate beaches, buses, hospitals, schools and universities. Signboards such as "whites only" applied to public areas, even including park benches.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Roger B. (2000). ''The history of South Africa.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 128. {{ISBN|978-0-313-30730-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Black South Africans were provided with services greatly inferior to those of whites, and, to a lesser extent, to those of Indian and Coloured people.&lt;ref name=crdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/fr/ev-91102-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=The economic legacy of apartheid |publisher=Centre de recherches pour le développement international |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426042410/http://www.idrc.ca/fr/ev-91102-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |archivedate=26 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further laws had the aim of suppressing resistance, especially armed resistance, to apartheid. The [[Suppression of Communism Act]] of 1950 banned any party subscribing to [[Communism]].  The act defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposed government policy risked being labelled as a Communist.  Since the law specifically stated that Communism aimed to disrupt racial harmony, it was frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government.

[[Education in South Africa|Education]] was segregated by the 1953 [[Bantu Education Act]], which crafted a separate system of education for black South African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class.&lt;ref name="byrnes"&gt;{{cite book|last= Byrnes|first=Rita M.|title=South Africa: A Country Study|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1996| location=Washington|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 separate universities were created for black, Coloured and Indian people. Existing universities were not permitted to enroll new black students. The Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 required the use of [[Afrikaans]] and English on an equal basis in high schools outside the homelands.&lt;ref name="afrikaans_medium_decree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsaJune16decree.htm|title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree|accessdate=14 March 2007|publisher=About.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225005315/http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsaJune16decree.htm| archivedate= 25 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bantu Authorities Act, 1951|Bantu Authorities Act of 1951]] created separate government structures for blacks and whites and was the first piece of legislation to support the government's plan of separate development in the [[bantustan]]s. The Promotion of Black Self-Government Act of 1959 entrenched the NP policy of nominally independent "homelands" for blacks. So-called "self–governing Bantu units" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of [[autonomy]] and [[self-government]].  It also abolished the seats of white representatives of black South Africans and removed from the rolls the few blacks still qualified to vote. The [[Bantu Investment Corporation Act]] of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands to create employment there. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in "white" cities and redirect such development to the "homelands". The [[Black Homeland Citizenship Act]] of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of blacks to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence.

Interracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws.

The government tightened pass laws compelling blacks to carry identity documents, to prevent the immigration of blacks from other countries. To reside in a city, blacks had to be in employment there. Until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these ''pass'' requirements, as attempts to introduce ''pass laws'' for women were met with fierce resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |title=Extracts from paper prepared by the Secretariat for the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, Copenhagen, July 1980 (The anti-pass campaign) |accessdate=14 July 2008 |publisher=[[African National Congress]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622003552/http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strijdom]], Malan's successor as Prime Minister, moved to strip voting rights from black and Coloured residents of the Cape Province. The previous government had introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Bill into Parliament in 1951; however, four voters, G Harris, W D Franklin, W D Collins and Edgar Deane, challenged its validity in court with support from the United Party.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Dennis; Le Roux, Michelle (2009). ''Precedent &amp; Possibility: The (Ab)use of Law in South Africa.'' Juta and Company Limited. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-1-77013-022-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Supreme Court upheld the act, but reversed by the Appeal Court, finding the act invalid because a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both Houses of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] was needed to change the [[entrenched clause]]s of the [[Constitution of South Africa#Previous constitutions of South Africa|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rielations.'' Penguin Books. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The government then introduced the High Court of Parliament Bill (1952), which gave Parliament the power to overrule decisions of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, John Charles (1965). ''A history of post-war Africa.'' Praeger. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Supreme Court and the Appeal Court declared this invalid too.&lt;ref&gt;Witz, Leslie (2003). ''Apartheid's festival: contesting South Africa's national pasts.'' Indiana University Press. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the Strijdom government increased the number of judges in the Appeal Court from five to 11, and appointed pro-Nationalist judges to fill the new places.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Monica Hunter; Thompson, Leonard Monteath (1969).

F. J. (1975). ''Five hundred years: a history of South Africa.'' Academica. p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament met in a joint sitting and passed the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act]] in 1956, which transferred Coloured voters from the common voters' roll in the Cape to a new Coloured voters' roll.&lt;ref&gt;Mountain, Alan (2003). ''The first people of the Cape: a look at their history and the impact of colonialism on the Cape's indigenous people.'' New Africa Books. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the vote, the Senate was restored to its original size. The Senate Act was contested in the Supreme Court, but the recently enlarged Appeal Court, packed with government-supporting judges, upheld the act, and also the Act to remove Coloured voters.&lt;ref&gt;Du Pre, R H. (1994). ''Separate but Unequal – The 'Coloured' People of South Africa – A Political History.'' Jonathan Ball Publishers, Johannesburg. pp. 134–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1956 law allowed Coloureds to elect four people to Parliament, but a 1969 law abolished those seats and stripped Coloureds of their right to vote.  Since Asians had never been allowed to vote, this resulted in whites being the sole enfranchised group.

A 2016 study in the [[The Journal of Politics|Journal of Politics]] suggests that disenfranchisement in South Africa had a significant negative impact on basic service delivery to the disenfranchized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroth|first=Verena|last2=Larcinese|first2=Valentino|last3=Wehner|first3=Joachim|date=19 May 2016|title=A Better Life for All?

=== Division among whites ===
Before South Africa became a republic in 1961, politics among white South Africans was typified by the division between the mainly [[Afrikaner]] pro-republic conservative and the largely English anti-republican liberal sentiments,&lt;ref&gt;Muller (1975), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt; with the legacy of the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] still a factor for some people. Once South Africa became a republic, Prime Minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] called for improved relations and greater accord between people of British descent and the Afrikaners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doug Booth|Booth, Douglas]] (1998). ''The race game: sport and politics in South Africa.'' Routledge. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that the only difference was between those in favour of apartheid and those against it. The ethnic division would no longer be between Afrikaans and English speakers, but between blacks and whites.

Most Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority "no" vote in [[Natal Province|Natal]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Paul Singer (1990). ''Natalians first: separatism in South Africa, 1909–1961.'' Southern Book Publishers. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan|Harold Macmillan's]] "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]" speech left the British faction feeling that the UK had abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Peter (2007). ''The making of a nation: South Africa's road to freedom.'' Zebra. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  The more conservative English speakers supported Verwoerd;&lt;ref&gt;Suzman, Helen (1993). ''In no uncertain terms: a South African memoir.'' Knopf. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; others were troubled by the severing of ties with the UK and remained loyal to [[the Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;Keppel-Jones, Arthur (1975). ''South Africa: a short history.'' Hutchinson. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were displeased by having to choose between British and South African nationalities. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent voting illustrated only a minor swell of support,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Lacour-Gayet|Lacour-Gayet, Robert]] (1977). ''A history of South Africa.'' Cassell. p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.

== Homeland system ==
{{Main|Bantustan}}
[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|Map of South Africa showing the location of bantustans]]
[[File:Ciskei2.jpg|thumb|Rural area in [[Ciskei]], one of the apartheid era [[homeland]]s]]

Under the homeland system, the government attempted to divide South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which was supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for a different ethnic group.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Territorial separation was hardly a new institution. There were, for example, the "reserves" created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, 13 percent of the land was reserved for black homelands, a small amount relative to its total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system, but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands, a recommendation that was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ivan. Bureaucracy and Race: Native Administration in South Africa. Berkeley: U of California, 1997. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Verwoerd became Prime Minister in 1958, the policy of "separate development" came into being, with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands. The government justified its plans on the ostensible basis that "(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelands{{snds}}hence this policy of separate development".&lt;ref&gt;Amisi, Baruti, and Simphiwe Nojiyeza. Access to Decent Sanitation in South Africa: The Challenges of Eradicating the Bucket System Baruti Amisi n. pag. Feb. 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the homelands system, blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa, becoming citizens of the independent homelands who worked in South Africa as foreign migrant labourers on temporary work permits. In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and border industries and the Bantu Investment Corporation were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands. Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands.

The vision of a South Africa divided into multiple ethno-states appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligensia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party's racist policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the previously crude policy of ''baasskap''.&lt;ref name="sparksNews24Appalled"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/AllisterSparks/Verwoerd-and-his-policies-appalled-me-20150512|title=Verwoerd and his policies appalled me|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicsWebRememberingVerwoerd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/remembering-verwoerd|title=Remembering Verwoerd - OPINION {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afrikanerDominationNews24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afrikaner-domination-died-with-verwoerd-50-years-ago-20160906|title=Afrikaner domination died with Verwoerd 50 years ago|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten homelands were allocated to different black ethnic groups: [[Lebowa]] (North [[Basotho|Sotho]], also referred to as Pedi), [[QwaQwa]] (South Sotho), [[Bophuthatswana]] ([[Tswana people|Tswana]]), [[KwaZulu]] ([[Zulu people|Zulu]]), [[KaNgwane]] ([[Swazi people|Swazi]]), [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] ([[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]), [[Gazankulu]] ([[Shangaan|Tsonga]]), [[Venda]] ([[Venda people|Venda]]) and [[KwaNdebele]] ([[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]]). Four of these were declared independent by the South African government: [[Transkei]] in 1976, [[Bophuthatswana]] in 1977, [[Venda]] in 1979, and [[Ciskei]] in 1981 (known as the TBVC states).
Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;Those who had the money to travel or emigrate were not given full passports; instead, travel documents were issued.&lt;/ref&gt; The South African government attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of [[illegal immigrants]].

=== International recognition of the Bantustans ===
Bantustans within the borders of South Africa were classified as "self-governing" or "independent". In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no significant economic infrastructure and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.

Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the Swiss-South African Association encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.

== Forced removals {{Anchor|Forced removal}} ==
{{See also|1=Group Areas Act|2=Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991}}
During the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of "resettlement", to force people to move to their designated "group areas". Millions of people were forced to relocate. These removals included people relocated due to [[slum clearance]] programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called "black spots" (black-owned land surrounded by white farms), the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and "surplus people" from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a "Coloured Labour Preference Area")&lt;ref name="clp"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Western | first = J. | title = A divided city: Cape Town | journal = [[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]], Special Issue Dedicated to Saul B.

The best-publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in [[Johannesburg]], when 60,000 people were moved to the new township of [[Soweto]] (an abbreviation for South Western Townships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Western Areas to Soweto: forced removals |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/places/villages/gauteng/soweto/history3.htm |accessdate=7 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117170427/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/places/villages/gauteng/soweto/history3.htm |archivedate=17 January 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeSophia"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Toby Street Blues |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=21 February 1955 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892971,00.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1955, [[Sophiatown]] had been one of the few urban areas where black people were allowed to own land, and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce, as it was convenient and close to town. It had the only swimming pool for black children in Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="Meredith2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Meredith|title=Mandela: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsUXdCxt0WUC&amp;pg=PT95|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-84739-933-5|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg, it held an almost symbolic importance for the 50,000 black people it contained.  Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police forced residents out of their homes and loaded their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land {{convert|19|km}} from the city centre, known as [[Meadowlands, Gauteng|Meadowlands]], which the government had purchased in 1953. Meadowlands became part of a new planned black city called [[Soweto]]. Sophiatown was destroyed by bulldozers, and a new white suburb named [[Triomf]] (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to black South Africans alone. Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor (Mkhumbane) in [[Durban]], and [[District Six]] in [[Cape Town]], where 55,000 Coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats, were carried out under the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950. Nearly 600,000 Coloured, Indian and [[Chinese South Africans|Chinese people]] were moved under the Group Areas Act. Some 40,000 whites were also forced to move when land was transferred from "white South Africa" into the black homelands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music of South Africa|last = Muller|first = Carol|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NP passed a string of legislation that became known as ''petty apartheid''. The first of these was the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949|Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949]], prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950 (as amended in 1957 by Act 23) forbade "unlawful racial intercourse" and "any immoral or indecent act" between a white and a black, Indian or Coloured person.

Blacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in areas designated as "white South Africa" unless they had a permit - such being granted only exceptionally. They were required to move to the black "homelands" and set up businesses and practices there. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Trains, hospitals and ambulances were segregated.&lt;ref&gt;On apartheid transport see Pirie, G.H. Travelling under apartheid. In D M Smith (ed.), ''The Apartheid City and Beyond: Urbanisation and Social Change in South Africa.'' Routledge, London (1992), pp. 172–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the smaller numbers of white patients and the fact that white doctors preferred to work in white hospitals, conditions in white hospitals were much better than those in often overcrowded and understaffed, significantly underfunded black hospitals.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;[http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/policy/framewrk/chap01.html Health Sector Strategic Framework 1999–2004 – Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923163238/http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/policy/framewrk/chap01.html |date=23 September 2006 }}, Department of Health, 2004. Retrieved 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential areas were segregated and blacks were only allowed to live in white areas if employed as a servant and even then only in servants quarters. Blacks were excluded from working in white areas, unless they had a pass, nicknamed the ''dompas'', also spelt ''dompass'' or ''dom pass''. The most likely origin of this name is from the Afrikaans "verdomde pas" (meaning accursed pass),&lt;ref name="dompass"&gt;[http://www.dsae.co.za/#!/search/hws/dompass/sN/pN Dictionary of South African English on historical principles]. Retrieved 27 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; although some commentators ascribe it to the Afrikaans words meaning "dumb pass". Only blacks with "Section 10" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's [[Bantustan|homeland]] and prosecution of the employer for employing an illegal migrant. Police vans patrolled white areas to round up blacks without passes. Blacks were not allowed to employ whites in white South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Conflict in South Africa|last = Saaty|first = Thomas|publisher = Springer Publishing|year = |isbn = |location = |page = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trade unions for black and Coloured workers had existed since the early 20th century, it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed. Trade unions under apartheid were racially segregated, with 54 unions being white only, 38 for Indian and Coloured and 19 for black people. The Industrial Conciliation Act (1956) legislated against the creation of multi-racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi-racial unions into separate branches or organisations along racial lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Omond|first=Roger|title=The Apartheid Handbook|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=978-0-14-022749-9|pages=102–109|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s the state spent ten times more per child on the education of white children than on black children within the Bantu Education system (the education system in black schools within white South Africa). Higher education was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959. Eight black universities were created in the homelands. [[Fort Hare University]] in the [[Ciskei]] (now Eastern Cape) was to register only [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking students. [[Sesotho|Sotho]], [[Setswana|Tswana]], [[Sepedi|Pedi]] and [[Venda language|Venda]] speakers were placed at the newly founded [[University of Limpopo|University College of the North]] at Turfloop, while the [[University of Zululand|University College of Zululand]] was launched to serve Zulu students. Coloureds and Indians were to have their own establishments in the [[University of the Western Cape|Cape]] and [[University of Durban-Westville|Natal]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Overcoming the Apartheid Legacy in Cape Town Schools|last = Lemon|first = Anthony|date = 2009|journal = Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. Blacks were not allowed to buy [[hard liquor]]. They were able only to buy state-produced poor quality beer (although this law was relaxed later). Public beaches were racially segregated. Public swimming pools, some pedestrian bridges, drive-in cinema parking spaces, graveyards, parks, and public toilets were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Blacks were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957, but this was never rigidly enforced and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360 [[South African rand|rand]] a year or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Blacks could never acquire land in white areas. In the homelands, much of the land belonged to a "tribe", where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be used. This resulted in whites owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land. Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the "homelands" became "independent", and they were no longer able to apply for South African passports. Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet, the government contending that a passport was a privilege, not a right, and the government did not grant many passports to blacks. Apartheid pervaded culture as well as the law, and was entrenched by most of the mainstream media.

{{Main|Coloureds}}
The population was classified into four groups: African, White, Indian and Coloured (capitalised to denote their legal definitions in South African law). The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent, including of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Malay race|Malay]] ancestry. Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world, such as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and China as [[slavery|slaves]] and [[Indentured labour|indentured workers]].&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;Patric Tariq Mellet [https://archive.is/20120707062952/http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/intro/ "Intro"], ''Cape Slavery Heritage''. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured. Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or Black, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or White. Different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups. Further tests determined membership of the various sub-racial groups of the Coloureds.

Many of those formerly classified as Coloured are opposed to the continuing use of the term "coloured" in the post-apartheid era, though the term no longer signifies any legal meaning. The expressions "so-called Coloured" (Afrikaans ''sogenaamde Kleurlinge'') and "brown people" (''bruinmense'') acquired a wide usage in the 1980s.

Discriminated against by apartheid, Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate [[Township (South Africa)|townships]], in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations, and received an inferior education, though better than that provided to Africans. They played an important role in the [[anti-apartheid movement]]: for example the [[African Political Organization]] established in 1902 had an exclusively Coloured membership.

Voting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to Blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.

== Women under apartheid ==
[[Colonialism]] and apartheid had a major impact on Black and Coloured women, since they suffered both racial and [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Charter, 17 April 1954 Johannesburg |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4666 |publisher=ANC |accessdate=15 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104233/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4666 |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotula|first=Lorenzo|title=Gender and Law: Women's Rights in Agriculture|year=2006|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=9789251055632|pages=46–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPDXvKekn0IC|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs were often hard to find. Many Black and Coloured women worked as agricultural or domestic workers, but wages were extremely low, if existent.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapchick|first=Richard E.|author2=Stephanie Urdang|year=1982|title=Oppression and Resistance: The Struggle of Women in Southern Africa|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=48, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitation problems, and mortality rates were therefore high. The controlled movement of black and Coloured workers within the country through the Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923 and the [[pass laws]] separated family members from one another, because men could prove their employment in urban centres while most women were merely dependents; consequently, they risked being deported to rural areas.&lt;ref name="bern"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Hilda|year=1985|title=For their Triumphs and for their Tears: Women in Apartheid South Africa|publisher=International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport under apartheid ==
{{See also|Rugby union and apartheid}}
By the 1930s, association football mirrored the balkanised society of South Africa; football was divided into numerous institutions based on race: the (White) [[South African Football Association]], the South African Indian Football Association (SAIFA), the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) and its rival the South African Bantu Football Association, and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA). Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches; this revealed the unequal lives black South Africans were subject to, in contrast to Whites, who were obviously much better off financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alegi|first=Peter|year=2004|title=Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa|publisher=University of KwaZula-Natal Press|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apartheid's social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines. Thus, in an effort to centralise finances, the federations merged in 1951, creating the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), which brought Black, Indian, and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid. This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government, and{{snds}}with urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policies{{snds}}it was harder to play football along these racial lines. In 1956, the Pretoria regime{{snds}}the administrative capital of South Africa{{snds}}passed the first apartheid sports policy; by doing so, it emphasised the White-led government's opposition to inter-racialism.

While football was plagued by racism, it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies. With the international bans from [[FIFA]] and other major sporting events, South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally. In a 1977 survey, white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid.&lt;ref name=robnixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Rob|year=1992|title=Apartheid on the Run: The South African Sports Boycott|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=75, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1950s, Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the "racialisation" of sports in South Africa; anti-apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the "weakness" of white national morale. Black journalists for the ''Johannesburg Drum'' magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure, with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked, "Why shouldn't our blacks be allowed in the SA team?"&lt;ref name=robnixon /&gt; As time progressed, international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained. In the 1980s, as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid. Football associations also discussed the formation of a single, non-racial controlling body. This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation, in December 1991, of an incorporated South African Football Association. On 3 July 1992, FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football.

Sport has long been an important part of life in South Africa, and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did. After the re-acceptance of South Africa's sports teams by the international community, sport played a major unifying role between the country's diverse ethnic groups. Mandela's open support of the predominantly white rugby fraternity during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was considered instrumental in bringing together South African sports fans of all races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nauright|first=John|year=2004|title=Global Games: Culture, Political Economy and Sport in the Globalised World of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1325–36|via=|doi=10.1080/014365904200281302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asians during apartheid ==
{{Further|Indian South Africans|Asian South Africans|Chinese South Africans}}
Defining its Asian population, a minority that did not appear to belong to any of the initial three designated non-white groups, was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government.

For political reasons, the classification of "[[honorary white]]" was granted to immigrants from [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]{{snds}}countries with which South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2008/06/19/in-south-africa-chinese-is-the-new-black|date=19 June 2008|title=In South Africa, Chinese is the New Black|publisher=China Realtime Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snds}}and to their descendants.

[[Indian South Africans]] during apartheid were classified many ranges of categories from "Asian" to "black" {{clarify|date=June 2014}} to "Coloured" {{clarify|date=June 2014}} and even the mono-ethnic category of "Indian", but never as white, having been considered "nonwhite" throughout South Africa's history. The group faced severe discrimination during the apartheid regime and were subject to numerous racialist policies.

In a study done by Josephine C. Naidoo and Devi Moodley Rajab, they interviewed a series of Indian South Africans about their experience in South Africa. Their study highlighted education, the workplace, and general day to day living. For one specific participant who was a doctor, said that it was considered the norm for Non-White and White doctors to mingle while working at the hospital but when there was any down time or breaks, they were to go back to their segregated quarters. Not only was there severe segregation for doctors, Non-White, more specifically Indians, were paid three to four times less than their White counterparts. Many described being treated as a “third class citizen” due to the humiliation of the standard of treatment for Non-White employees across many professions. Many Indians described a sense of justified superiority from Whites due to the apartheid laws that, in the minds of White South Africans, legitimized those feelings. Another finding of this study was the psychological damage down to Indians living in South Africa during apartheid. One of the biggest long-term effects was inter-racial mistrust. Inter-racial mistrust is emotional hatred towards Whites. There was such a strong degree of alienation that left damaging psychological effects of inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/097133360501700204|title = The Dynamics of Oppression| journal=Psychology and Developing Societies| volume=17| issue=2| pages=139–159|year = 2005|last1 = Naidoo|first1 = Josephine C.| last2=Rajab| first2=Devi Moodley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal resistance ==

Apartheid sparked significant internal resistance.&lt;ref name="Lodge 1983" /&gt; The government responded to a series of popular uprisings and protests with police brutality, which in turn increased local support for the armed resistance struggle.&lt;ref name="ANC Armed Struggle"&gt;{{cite web

Internal resistance to the apartheid system in South Africa came from several sectors of society and saw the creation of organisations dedicated variously to peaceful protests, passive resistance and armed insurrection.

In 1949, the [[African National Congress Youth League|youth wing]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) took control of the organisation and started advocating a radical black nationalist programme. The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience actions that led to occasional violent clashes with the authorities.

In 1959, a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of [[Sharpeville]], where 69 people were killed by police in the [[Sharpeville massacre]].

In the wake of Sharpeville, the government declared a state of emergency. More than 18,000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of [[Sabotage|domestic sabotage]] and [[terrorism]].

In May 1961, before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored.

When the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organisers was a 42-year-old, [[Thembu]]-origin [[Nelson Mandela]]) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938112,00.html A War Won], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 9 June 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Blood River]].

In the 1970s, the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] was created by tertiary students influenced by the Black Power movement in the US. BC endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement, [[Steve Biko]], was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was beaten to death in detention.

In 1976, secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the [[Soweto uprising]] to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans as the only language of instruction. On 16 June, police opened fire on students protesting peacefully. According to official reports 23 people were killed, but the number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheid/a/Soweto-Uprising-Pt2.htm 16 June 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto]. africanhistory.about.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=The White Tribe of Africa|year=1987|first=David|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[Les Payne]] of Newsday said at least 850 murders were documented) Elsabe Brink; Gandhi Malungane; Steve Lebelo; Dumisani Ntshangase; Sue Krige, ''Soweto 16 June 1976'', 2001, 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years several student organisations were formed to protest against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 and rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986.

In parallel with student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal. Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] wrote that basic [[supply and demand]] led to violations of Apartheid "on a massive scale" throughout the nation, simply because there were not enough white South African business owners to meet the demand for various goods and services. Large portions of the garment industry and construction of new homes, for example, were effectively owned and operated by blacks, who either worked surreptitiously or who circumvented the law with a white person as a nominal, figurehead manager.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2004, 2009). ''Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One''. Second Edition, NY: Basic Books. Ch. 7: The Economics of Discrimination.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, anti-apartheid leaders determined to resist the tricameral parliament assembled to form the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) in order to coordinate anti-apartheid activism inside South Africa. The first presidents of the UDF were [[Archie Gumede]], [[Oscar Mpetha]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]]; patrons were Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], Dr [[Allan Boesak]], [[Helen Joseph]], and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Basing its platform on abolishing apartheid and creating a nonracial democratic South Africa, the UDF provided a legal way for domestic human rights groups and individuals of all races to organise demonstrations and campaign against apartheid inside the country. Churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did. The UDF, coupled with the protection of the church, accordingly permitted a major role for Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], who served both as a prominent domestic voice and international spokesperson denouncing apartheid and urging the creation of a shared nonracial state.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Mandela Foundation,  [https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv03188/06lv03222.htm United Democratic Front]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by [[Helen Suzman]], [[Colin Eglin]] and [[Harry Schwarz]], who formed the [[Progressive Federal Party]]. Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the [[South African Communist Party]] and women's organisation the [[Black Sash]]. Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties.

=== Commonwealth ===
South Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] criticised them during his [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]] speech in [[Cape Town]]. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the [[Sharpeville Massacre]], resulting in more international condemnation. Soon afterwards, [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] announced a [[1960 South Africa referendum|referendum]] on whether the country should become a republic. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for Whites to eighteen years of age and included Whites in [[South West Africa]] on the roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked Whites; "Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?", and 52 percent voted "Yes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cTUesMgd7joC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Blazes+Along+a+Diplomatic+Trail&amp;cd=1#v=onepage J. C. Gordon Brown, ''Blazes Along a Diplomatic Trail: A Memoir of Four Posts in the Canadian Foreign Service''] (Trafford Publishing, 2000) p300&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with which it had privileged trade links. [[India]] had become a [[republic within the Commonwealth]] in 1950, but it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence.

At the first UN gathering in 1946, South Africa was placed on the agenda. The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians, a great cause of divergence between South Africa and India. In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ampiah, Kweku (1997). ''The dynamics of Japan's relations with Africa: South Africa, Tanzania and Nigeria.'' CRC Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the [[Sharpeville massacre]], and the Security Council for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime, demanding an end to racial separation and discrimination. On 7 August 1963, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 181|Resolution 181]], calling for a voluntary [[arms embargo]] against South Africa. From 1964 onwards, the US and the UK discontinued their arms trade with South Africa. The Security Council also condemned the Soweto massacre in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 392|Resolution 392]]. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|Resolution 418]].

After much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A [[disinvestment from South Africa]] movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/guide/antia.htm|title=Summary of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|publisher=[[United States Congress]]|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholic Church ===
[[Pope John Paul II]] was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1985, while visiting the [[Netherlands]], he gave an impassioned speech at the [[International Court of Justice]] condemning apartheid, proclaiming that "no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130309014419/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-13/news/mn-9935_1_afrikaners Pope Attacks Apartheid in Speech at U.N.

The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa.

Cambridge University Press. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, fourteen nations from Central and East Africa gathered in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], and formulated the ''[[Lusaka Manifesto]]'', which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance except [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal African Society (1970). ''African affairs, Volumes 69–70.'' Oxford University Press. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations.&lt;ref name=geld /&gt;

The [[Lusaka Manifesto]] summarised the political situations of self-governing African countries, condemning racism and inequity, and calling for Black majority rule in all African nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Richard | year = 1970 | title = The Lusaka Manifesto | url = | journal = African Affairs | volume = 69 | issue = 275| pages = 178–179 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a095995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognising its autonomy.

''Introduction to African politics: a continental approach.'' Praeger. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to its policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971. The ''Mogadishu Declaration'' stated that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that its Black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, Audie (1999). ''Norms in International Relations: The Struggle Against Apartheid.'' Cornell University Press. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outward-looking policy ===

In 1966, [[B. J. Vorster]] became Prime Minister. He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with Black majority rule in Africa. This he called his "Outward-Looking" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pfister|first=Roger |title=Apartheid South Africa and African States: From Pariah to Middle Power, 1962–1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YABvZRghzkAC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-625-6|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Beck|first=Roger B. |title=The History of South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js6vo2NY4Z8C&amp;pg=PA151|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30730-0|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ndlovu|first=Sifiso Mxolisi|title=The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGE-XB5QlD8C&amp;pg=PA616|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=Unisa Press|isbn=978-1-86888-406-3|chapter=The ANC's Diplomacy and International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] of [[Nigeria]] in 1962 and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]] in 1964. In 1966, he met the heads of the neighbouring states of [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Botswana]]. In 1967, he offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working down the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but were dependent on South African economic assistance.

[[Malawi]] was the first country not-neighbouring country to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations, and in 1969; Malawi was the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president [[Hastings Banda]] made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.

Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]], Madagascar, [[Mauritius]], Gabon, [[Zaire]] (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the [[Central African Republic]]. Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees{{clarify|date=September 2014}}.

=== Sports and culture ===
{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa|Rugby union and apartheid}}

====Beginning====
South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of them having players of different races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-White South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.

====Isolation====

====Verwoerd years====
In 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with White establishments, SASA approached the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from competing at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]] in [[Tokyo]]. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Olympic Games. South Africa selected a multi-racial team for the next Olympic Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympic Games]]. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.

Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[Māori people|Maori]] to enter the country under the status of "honorary Whites". Huge and widespread protests occurred in [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]] against the [[Springboks|Springbok]] tour{{snds}}the government spent $8,000,000 protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled. A "rebel tour"{{snds}}not government sanctioned{{snds}}went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour{{snds}}A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vorster years=====
Vorster succeeded Verwoerd as Prime Minister in 1966 following his assassination, and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for international sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. "Dolly" was eventually included in the team as the first substitute, but the tour was cancelled. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, including that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969/70.

The first of the "White Bans" occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing Association{{snds}}[[Don Bradman|Sir Don Bradman]]{{snds}}flew to South Africa to meet Vorster. Vorster had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead, but things became heated after Bradman asked why Black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket. Vorster stated that Blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game. Bradman{{snds}}thinking this ignorant and repugnant{{snds}}asked Vorster if he had heard of a man named [[Garry Sobers]]. On his return to [[Australia]], Bradman released a short statement: "We will not play them until they choose a team on a non-racist basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/the-day-apartheid-was-hit-for-six/2008/08/22/1219262525329.html The Day Apartheid Was Hit For Six]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman, while the African National Congress rejoiced. This was the first time a predominantly White nation had taken the side of multiracial sport, producing an unsettling resonance that more "White" boycotts were coming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |title=Bradman's Perfection |publisher=DreamCricket |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710151045/http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Almost twenty years later, on his release from prison, Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman, his childhood hero, was still alive (Bradman lived until 2001).

In 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.

In [[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978]], Nigeria [[boycott]]ed the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]]. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] because of UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm|title=Commonwealth Games|publisher=About.com|accessdate=7 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060527215130/http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm| archivedate=27 May 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural boycott====
In the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for ''cultural'' boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor [[Marlon Brando]] called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in the United Kingdom and the United States was also vetoed. After the arrival of [[TV|television]] in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.

=== Western influence ===
[[File:Boycott Apartheid Bus, London, UK. 1989.jpg|thumb|London "Boycott Apartheid" bus, 1989]]

''Apartheid: Special Report of the Directed General on the Application of the Decoration Concerning the Policy of South Africa.'' [[International Labour Organization]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1986{{spaced ndash}}a week before he was murdered{{spaced ndash}}[[Sweden|Sweden's]] Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] made the [[keynote]] address to the ''Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid'' held in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Bangura, Abdul Karim (2004).

Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In addressing the hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathisers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] such as [[Oliver Tambo]], Palme declared: "Apartheid cannot be reformed; it has to be eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;Grieg, Charlotte (2008). ''Cold Blooded Killings: Hits, Assassinations, and Near Misses That Shook the World.'' Booksales Inc Remainders. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position. In [[Switzerland]], the [[Swiss-South African Association]] lobbied on behalf of the South African government. In the 1980s, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration and the Thatcher ministry in the UK followed a "[[constructive engagement]]" policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions, justified by a belief in free trade and a vision of South Africa as a bastion against [[Marxist]] forces in Southern Africa. Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/or/pr/lond88.html |title=Oliver Tambo interviewed by The Times|date=13 June 1988 |publisher=ANC |accessdate=25 September 2012 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523184111/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/or/pr/lond88.html |archivedate = 23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1987 her spokesman, [[Bernard Ingham]], famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was "living in [[cloud cuckoo land]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Mandela/0,,2-7-1507_1389526,00.html |title=Mandela's triumphant walk |date=18 July 2003 |publisher=News24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924042332/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Mandela/0%2C%2C2-7-1507_1389526%2C00.html |archivedate=24 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a conservative lobbying organisation, actively campaigned against divesting from South Africa throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2013/12/11/alecs_institutional_corruption_from_backing_apartheid ALEC's "Institutional Corruption", From Backing Apartheid to Assault on Clean Energy, Public Sector]. ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' 11 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late-1980s, with the tide of the [[Cold War]] turning and no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]/[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] initiative in the US favoured [[Disinvestment from South Africa|economic sanctions]] (realised as the ''[[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]]'' of 1986), the release of Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Kind of War|author=Mark Phillips and [[Colin Coleman]]|publisher=Transformation|year=1989

The UK's significant economic involvement in South Africa may have provided some [[Leverage (negotiation)|leverage]] with the South African government, with both the UK and the US applying pressure and pushing for negotiations. However, neither the UK nor the US was willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]]. Although a high-profile compensation claim against these companies was thrown out of court in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/press468.htm |title=Compensation case against South African miners thrown out |publisher=Minesandcommunities.org |accessdate=3 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119221322/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/press468.htm |archivedate=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] in May 2008 upheld an appeal court ruling allowing another lawsuit that seeks damages of more than US$400,000,000,000 from major international companies which are accused of aiding South Africa's apartheid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7396040.stm |title=US court allows apartheid claims |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet support for militant anti-apartheid movements worked in the government's favour, as its claim to be reacting in opposition to aggressive Communist expansion gained greater plausibility, and helped it justify its own domestic militarisation methods, known as "Total Strategy".&lt;ref name=Onslaught1/&gt; Total Strategy involved building up a formidable conventional military and counter-intelligence capability.&lt;ref name=Onslaught1/&gt; It was formulated on counter-revolutionary tactics as espoused by noted French tactician [[André Beaufre]].&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt; Considerable effort was devoted towards circumventing [[International sanctions|international arms sanctions]], and the government even went so far as to develop [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]],&lt;ref&gt;Von Wielligh, N. &amp; von Wielligh-Steyn, L.

As a result of "Total Strategy", South African society became increasingly militarised. Many domestic civil organisations were modelled upon military structures, and military virtues such as discipline, patriotism, and loyalty were highly regarded.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt; In 1968, national service for White South African men lasted nine months at minimum, and they could be called up for reserve duty into their late-middle age if necessary.&lt;ref name=Reflections&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potgieter|first1=Thean|last2=Liebenberg|first2=Ian|title=Reflections on War: Preparedness and Consequences|year=2012|pages=70–81|publisher=Sun Media Press|location=Stellenbosch|isbn=978-1920338855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of national service was gradually extended to twelve months in 1972 and twenty-four months in 1978.&lt;ref name="Reflections"/&gt; At state schools, white male students were organised into military-style formations and drilled as cadets or as participants in a civil defence or "Youth Preparedness" curriculum.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt; Compulsory military education and in some cases, paramilitary training was introduced for all older white male students at state schools in three South African provinces.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt; These programmes presided over the construction of bomb shelters at schools and drills aimed at simulating mock insurgent raids.&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;

From the late-1970s to the late-1980s, defence budgets in South Africa were raised exponentially.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt; Covert operations focused on espionage and domestic counter-subversion became common, the number of [[special forces]] units swelled, and the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) had amassed enough sophisticated conventional weaponry to pose a serious threat to the "[[front-line states]]", a regional alliance of neighbouring countries opposed to apartheid.&lt;ref name=Minter/&gt;

The apartheid government made judicious use of [[extraterritorial operation]]s to eliminate its military and political opponents, arguing that neighbouring states, including their civilian populations, which hosted, tolerated on their soil, or otherwise sheltered anti-apartheid insurgent groups could not evade responsibility for provoking retaliatory strikes.&lt;ref name=Wilkenfeld/&gt; While it did focus on militarising the borders and sealing up its domestic territory against insurgent raids, it also relied heavily on an aggressive preemptive and counter-strike strategy, which fulfilled a preventative and deterrent purpose.&lt;ref name=SACP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sechaba|first1=Tsepo|last2=Ellis|first2=Stephen|title=Comrades Against Apartheid: The ANC &amp; the South African Communist Party in Exile|year=1992|pages=184–187|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn= 978-0253210623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reprisals which occurred beyond South Africa's borders involved not only hostile states, but neutral and sympathetic governments as well, often forcing them to react against their will and interests.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Political History of the Civil War in Angola: 1974-1990|last=James III|first=W.

External South African military operations were aimed at eliminating the training facilities, safehouses, infrastructure, equipment, and manpower of the insurgents.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; However, their secondary objective was to dissuade neighbouring states from offering sanctuary to MK, PLAN, APLA, and similar organisations.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; This was accomplished by deterring the supportive foreign population from cooperating with infiltration and thus undermining the insurgents' external sanctuary areas.&lt;ref name="Zambian"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking African Politics: A History of Opposition in Zambia|last=Larmer|first=Miles|year=2011|location=Surrey|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1409482499|pages=209–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also send a clear message to the host government that collaborating with insurgent forces involved potentially high costs.&lt;ref name="Zambian"/&gt;

The scale and intensity of foreign operations varied, and ranged from small special forces units carrying out raids on locations across the border which served as bases for insurgent infiltration to major conventional offensives involving armour, artillery, and aircraft.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; Actions such as [[Operation Protea]] in 1981 and [[Operation Askari]] in 1983 involved both full scale conventional warfare and a counter-insurgency reprisal operation.&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;{{cite book|title=Responding to Low-Intensity Conflict Challenges|last=Blank|first=Stephen|location=Montgomery |publisher=Air University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0160293320|pages=223–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Insurgencies&gt;{{cite book|last=Radu|first=Michael|title=The New Insurgencies: Anti-Communist Guerrillas in the Third World|year=1990|pages=131–141|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0887383076}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgent bases were usually situated near military installations of the host government, so that SADF retaliatory strikes hit those facilities as well and attracted international attention and condemnation of what was perceived as aggression against the armed forces of another sovereign state.&lt;ref name=Dale&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=Richard|title=The Namibian War of Independence, 1966-1989: Diplomatic, Economic and Military Campaigns|year=2014|pages=74–77, 93–95|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Incorporated Publishers|location=Jefferson|isbn=978-0786496594}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would inevitably result in major engagements, in which the SADF's expeditionary units would have to contend with the firepower of the host government's forces.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; Intensive conventional warfare of this nature carried the risk of severe casualties among white soldiers, which had to be kept to a minimum for political reasons.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; There were also high economic and diplomatic costs associated with openly deploying large numbers of South African troops into another country.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; Furthermore, military involvement on that scale had the potential to evolve into wider conflict situations, in which South Africa became entangled.&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt; For example, South Africa's activities in Angola, initially limited to containing PLAN, later escalated to direct involvement in the [[Angolan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=SACP/&gt;

As it became clearer that full-scale conventional operations could not effectively fulfill the requirements of a regional counter-insurgency effort, South Africa turned to a number of alternative methods. Retributive artillery bombardments were the least sophisticated means of reprisal against insurgent attacks. Between 1978 and 1979 the SADF directed artillery fire against locations in Angola and Zambia from which insurgent rockets were suspected to have been launched.&lt;ref name=Democracy&gt;{{cite book|last=Ndlovu|first=Sifiso Mxolisi|title=The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970-1980|year=2006|pages=659–661|publisher=University of South Africa Press|location=Pretoria|isbn=978-1868884063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borderstrike"&gt;{{cite book | first = Willem | last = Steenkamp| authorlink = | title = Borderstrike!

Also noteworthy were South African transnational espionage efforts, which included covert assassinations, kidnappings, and attempts to disrupt the overseas influence of anti-apartheid organisations. South African military intelligence agents were known to have abducted and killed anti-apartheid activists and others suspected of having ties to MK in [[London]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Purkitt, Helen E.; Burgess, Stephen Franklin (2005).

New Africa Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== State security ==
During the 1980s the government, led by [[P.W. Botha]], became increasingly preoccupied with security. It set up a powerful [[State Security Council|state security apparatus]] to "protect" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, William; Fourie, Marius; Van Wyk, Belinda (1998). ''Police Management in South Africa.'' Juta and Company Limited. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Botha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate SWAPO in Namibia. Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the African National Congress' sabotage campaign.

The government punished political offenders brutally. 40,000 people annually were subjected to [[Flagellation|whipping]] as a form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Anzovin, Steven (1987). ''South Africa: apartheid and divestiture.'' H.W. Wilson Co. p. 80. {{ISBN|978-0-8242-0749-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority had committed political offences and were lashed ten times for their crime.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Don; Davis, Dennis (1987). ''Detention &amp; torture in South Africa: psychological, legal &amp; historical studies.'' Currey. p. 18. {{ISBN|978-0-85255-317-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If convicted of treason, a person could be hanged, and the government executed numerous political offenders in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/political-executions-south-africa-apartheid-government-1961-1989|title=Political executions in South Africa by the apartheid government 1961 – 1989|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1980s progressed, more and more anti-apartheid organisations were formed and affiliated with the UDF. Led by the [[Reverend]] [[Allan Boesak]] and Albertina Sisulu, the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish the apartheid system and eliminate the homelands completely.

=== State of emergency ===
Serious political violence was a prominent feature from 1985–89, as Black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make Black townships "ungovernable" (a term later replaced by "people's power") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishments. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, were attacked with petrol bombs, beaten, and murdered by [[necklacing]], where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck, after they were restrained by wrapping their wrists with barbed wire. This signature act of torture and murder was embraced by the ANC and its leaders.

On 20 July 1985, Botha declared a [[State of Emergency]] in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the [[Eastern Cape]], and the [[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging|PWV]] region ("[[Pretoria]], [[Witwatersrand]], [[Vereeniging]]").&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, William J. (1986). ''Apartheid, imperialism, and African freedom.'' International Publishers. p. 226. {{ISBN|978-0-7178-0640-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the [[Western Cape]] was included. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency, about 2,436 people were detained under the Internal Security Act.&lt;ref&gt;Legum, Colin (1989). ''Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents, Volume 20.'' Africana Pub. Co. p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;  This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could rule by decree without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening, to advise anyone to stay away from work or to oppose the government, and to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government released that name, with up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. Detention without trial became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, Brian; Hoffmann, Wilman (1990). ''People and violence in South Africa.'' Oxford University Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The media was censored, thousands were arrested and many were interrogated and [[torture]]d.&lt;ref&gt;Blond, Rebecca; Fitzpatrick, Mary (2004). ''South Africa, Lesotho &amp; Swaziland.'' Lonely Planet. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 1986, four days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising, the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the Public Security Act, including the right to declare "unrest" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and television cameras were banned from entering such areas. The state broadcaster, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC), provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC underground press within South Africa.

In 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the National Union of Mineworkers commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. The year 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations.

Much of the violence in the late-1980s and early-1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other whenever it suited them. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases. The ANC and the PAC in return detonated bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as magistrates courts. Between 1960-1994, according to statistics from the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], the Inkatha Freedom Party was responsible for 4,500 deaths, South African security forces were responsible for 2,700 deaths and the ANC was responsible for 1,300 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume5.pdf Volume Five – Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of emergency continued until 1990, when it was lifted by State President [[F.W. de Klerk]].

== Final years of apartheid ==
{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}

=== Factors ===

==== Institutional racism ====
Apartheid developed from the racism of colonial factions and due to South Africa's "unique industrialization".&lt;ref name="NigelWorden"&gt;Nigel, Worden, The making of modern South Africa: Conquest, Segregation and Apartheid, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2000) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of industrialization led to segregation of and classing of people, which  was "specifically developed to nurture early industry such as mining".&lt;ref name="NigelWorden" /&gt; Cheap labour was the basis of the economy and this was taken from what the state classed as peasant groups and the migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Boner, Peter, Delius, Deborah, Posel, "The Shaping of Apartheid, contradiction, continuity and popular struggle", The Worlds Knowledge, (1993) pp. 1–47 (p. 6.)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Philip Bonner highlights the "contradictory economic effects" as the economy did not have a manufacturing sector, therefore promoting short term profitability but limiting labour productivity and the size of local markets. This also led to its collapse as "Clarkes emphasises the economy could not provide and compete with foreign rivals as they failed to master cheap labour and complex chemistry".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Boner, Peter, Delius, Deborah, Posel, "The Shaping of Apartheid, contradiction, continuity and popular struggle", The Worlds Knowledge, (1993) pp. 1–47 (p. 7.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic contradictions ====
The contradictions{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in the traditionally capitalist economy of the apartheid state led to considerable debate about racial policy, and division and conflicts in the central state.&lt;ref name="PaulMaylam"&gt;Paul, Maylam, "The Rise and Decline of Urban Apartheid in South Africa", African Affairs, 89.354(1990) pp. 57–84 (p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; To a large extent the political ideology of apartheid had emerged from the colonisation of Africa by European powers which institutionalised racial discrimination and exercised a paternal   philosophy of "civilising inferior natives."&lt;ref name="PaulMaylam" /&gt; Some scholars have argued that this can be reflected in [[Afrikaner Calvinism]], with its parallel traditions of racialism;&lt;ref name="SaulDubow"&gt;[[Saul Dubow|Dubow, Saul]], "Afrikaner Nationalism, Apartheid and the conceptualisation of 'Race{{'"}}, The Journal of African History, 33(1992) pp. 209–237 (pp. 209, 211)&lt;/ref&gt; for example, as early as 1933 the executive council of the Broederbond formulated a recommendation for mass segregation.&lt;ref name="SaulDubow" /&gt;

==== Western influence ====
[[File:South Africa House anti apartheid London 1989.jpg|thumb|Anti-apartheid protest at [[South Africa House]] in London, 1989]]
External western influence can be seen as one of the factors that arguably greatly influenced political ideology, particularly due to the influences of colonisation. South Africa in particular is argued to be an "unreconstructed example of western civilisation twisted by racism".&lt;ref&gt;L.H, Gann, "Apartheids Genesis 1935–1962", Business Library, (1994) pp. 1–6. (p. 1.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, South Africa experienced economic growth second only to that of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Legasick | first1 = Martin | year = 1974 | title = Legislation, Ideology and Economy in Post-1948 South Africa | url = | journal = Journal of South African Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 5–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with Western countries grew, and investment from the United States, France and Britain poured in.

In 1974, resistance to apartheid was encouraged by [[Portugal|Portugal's]] withdrawal from [[Mozambique]] and [[Angola]], after the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]]. South African troops withdrew from Angola in early 1976, failing to prevent the MPLA from gaining power there, and black students in South Africa celebrated.

The [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]], signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a Bill of Rights. It caused a split in the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] that ultimately realigned opposition politics in South Africa, with the formation of the [[Progressive Federal Party]] in 1977. It was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa.

In 1978, the defence minister of the NP, [[Pieter Willem Botha]], became Prime Minister. Botha's white regime was worried about the Soviet Union helping revolutionaries in South Africa, and the economy had slowed down. The new government noted that it was spending too much money trying to maintain the segregated homelands that had been created for blacks and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Nor was maintaining blacks as a third class working well. The labour of blacks remained vital to the economy, and illegal black labour unions were flourishing. Many blacks remained too poor to make much of a contribution to the economy through their purchasing power{{snds}}although they were more than 70 percent of the population. Botha's regime was afraid that an antidote was needed to prevent the blacks from being attracted to Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democratization in South Africa|last = Giliomee|first = Hermann|date = 1995|journal = Political Science Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1979, the Nigerian government claimed that the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was selling Nigerian oil to South Africa, although there was little evidence or commercial logic for such sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weymouth Genova|first=Ann |title=Oil and Nationalism in Nigeria, 1970–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T3NVGzBmkUC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26666-2|page=123}} Weymouth Genova covers the possibility of Nigerian oil going to South Africa in detail from page 113. Heavily laden tankers have to respect the ocean currents which means they travel clockwise around Africa; oil for South Africa would likely come from the Middle East rather than West Africa. Nigeria had been taking over other oil marketing companies to reduce price differentials across the country; they needed to fill a budget shortfall due to low oil prices and had a history of disputes with BP and the British government so BP assets were seized when Shell's stake in SPDC was not.&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged sanctions-breaking was used to justify the seizure of some of BP's assets in Nigeria including their stake in SPDC, although it appears the real reasons were economic nationalism and domestic politics ahead of the Nigerian elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weymouth Genova|first=Ann |title=Oil and Nationalism in Nigeria, 1970–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T3NVGzBmkUC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26666-2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many South Africans attended schools in Nigeria,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and Nelson Mandela several times acknowledged the role of Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In the 1980s, the anti-apartheid movements in the United States and Europe were gaining support for boycotts against South Africa, for the withdrawal of US firms from South Africa and for the release of Mandela. South Africa was becoming an outlaw in the world community of nations. Investing in South Africa by Americans and others was coming to an end and an active policy of [[Disinvestment from South Africa|disinvestment]] ensued.

=== Tricameral parliament ===
{{Main|Tricameral Parliament}}
In the early 1980s, Botha's National Party government started to recognise the inevitability of the need to reform apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Colin; Quirk, Pádraic (2000). ''Peace building in Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa: transition, transformation and reconciliation.'' Palgrave Macmillan. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early reforms were driven by a combination of internal violence, international condemnation, changes within the National Party's constituency, and changing demographics{{snds}}whites constituted only 16 percent of the total population, in comparison to 20 percent fifty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Beinart, William (2001). ''Twentieth-century South Africa''. Oxford University Press. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-0-19-289318-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a new constitution was passed implementing what was called the Tricameral Parliament, giving Coloureds and Indians voting rights and parliamentary representation in separate houses{{snds}}the House of Assembly (178 members) for whites, the House of Representatives (85 members) for Coloureds and the House of Delegates (45 members) for Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Francis Group (2004). ''Europa World Year Book 2, Book 2.'' Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 3841.&lt;/ref&gt; Each House handled laws pertaining to its racial group's "own affairs", including health, education and other community issues.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul (23 December 1993). "S. Africa Approves Charter; White-Led Parliament Votes for Constitution Canceling Its Powers." ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; All laws relating to "general affairs" (matters such as defence, industry, taxation and Black affairs) were handled by a cabinet made up of representatives from all three houses.  However, the white chamber had a large majority on this cabinet, ensuring that effective control of the country remained in white hands.&lt;ref&gt;Wople, Harold (1990). ''Race, class &amp; the apartheid state.'' Africa World Press. p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0-86543-142-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marais, D. (1989). ''South Africa: constitutional development, a multi-disciplinary approach.'' Southern Book Publishers. p. 258. {{ISBN|978-1-86812-159-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks, although making up the majority of the population, were excluded from representation; they remained nominal citizens of their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;Lötter, Hennie P. P. (1997). ''Injustice, violence and peace: the case of South Africa.'' Rodopi. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-90-420-0264-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Tricameral elections were largely boycotted by Coloured and Indian voters, amid widespread rioting.&lt;ref&gt;"Cops fight crowds at S. Africa elections." ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]].'' 28 August 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reforms and contact with the ANC under Botha ===
Concerned over the popularity of Mandela, Botha denounced him as an arch-[[Marxism|Marxist]] committed to violent revolution, but to appease black opinion and nurture Mandela as a benevolent leader of blacks,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the government moved him from Robben Island to [[Pollsmoor Prison]] in a rural area just outside Cape Town, where prison life was easier. The government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners, to let the world know that he was being treated well.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Black homelands were declared [[nation-state]]s and [[pass laws]] were abolished. Black labour unions were legitimised, the government recognised the right of blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave blacks [[property rights]] there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sex between the races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for black schools increased, to one-seventh of what was spent per white child, up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus.

In January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzi{{snds}}his first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty-one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid.

Between 1986 and 1988, some petty apartheid laws were repealed, along with the pass laws.&lt;ref name="saHistoryPassLaws"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=21 March 2011|work=South African History Online|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botha told white South Africans to "adapt or die"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916936,00.html South Africa: Adapt or Die]. ''Time''.&lt;/ref&gt; and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as "[[Point of no return|rubicon]]" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the eighties as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as lifting the ban on the ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations "renounced violence".

By 1987, South Africa's economy was growing at one of the lowest rates in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with black leaders and white minorities existed in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Whispers of South Africa one day having a black President sent more hardline whites into Rightist parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside Cape Town. He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha. Botha impressed Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. The two had a friendly discussion, with Mandela comparing the African National Congress' rebellion with that of the [[Afrikaner rebellion]] and talking about everyone being brothers.

A number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of white intellectuals met the ANC in [[Senegal]] for talks known as the [[Dakar Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberfeld | first1 = Daniel | year = 2002 | title = Evaluating the Contributions of Track-two Diplomacy to Conflict Termination in South Africa, 1984–90 | url = | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 355–372 | doi = 10.1177/0022343302039003006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidency of F. W. de Klerk ===
[[File:Frederik de Klerk with Nelson Mandela - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 1992.jpg|thumb|De Klerk and Mandela in [[Davos]], 1992]]
Early in 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; he was prevailed upon to resign in February 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Roherty, James Michael (1992). ''State security in South Africa: civil-military relations under P.W. Botha.'' M.E. Sharpe. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-87332-877-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as president later that year by [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]]. Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, de Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. In his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990, de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]]. The Land Act was brought to an end. De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release Nelson Mandela, to return to [[press freedom]] and to suspend the death penalty. Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of [[common law]] crimes were released.

On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from [[Victor Verster Prison]] after more than 27 years of confinement.

Having been instructed by the [[UN Security Council]] to end its long-standing involvement in South West Africa / [[Namibia]], and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola, and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans, the Angolans, and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war, South Africa negotiated a change of control; Namibia became independent on 21 March 1990.

=== Negotiations ===
{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}
Apartheid was dismantled in a series of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiations]] from 1990 to 1991, culminating in a transitional period which resulted in the country's [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general elections]], the first in South Africa held with [[universal suffrage]].

In 1990 negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition towards majority rule. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations, despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country. Apartheid legislation was abolished in 1991.&lt;ref name="Abolished"/&gt;

At the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at [[Groote Schuur]], the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute, which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return.

There were fears that the change of power would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial transitional government and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an "undivided South Africa".

Reforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the right-wing white opposition, leading to the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a whites-only [[1992 South African Referendum|referendum]] in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue. A 68 per cent majority gave its support, and the victory instilled in de Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations.

When negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, and the power to change decisions made by parliament.

Persistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities, especially in the Southern Natal provinces. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the [[Boipatong massacre]] of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the Gauteng township of Boipatong, killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited, and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre.  When de Klerk visited the scene of the incident he was initially warmly welcomed, but he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards.  The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd.  Shots were fired by the police, and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975920-1,00.html|work=Time |title=Enemies: Black vs. Black vs. White|first=Scott|last=Macleod|date=7 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship.  Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negotiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage.

The [[Bisho massacre]] on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The Ciskei Defence Force killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the [[Ciskei]] homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and de Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations.

Right-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of [[Chris Hani]] on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular general secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in Dawn Park in Johannesburg by [[Janusz Waluś]], an anti-communist [[Poles|Polish]] refugee who had close links to the white nationalist [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the international community, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination.&lt;ref name=turningpoints&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |title=Turning Points in History Book 6: Negotiation, Transition and Freedom |accessdate=3 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309124114/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |archivedate=9 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|crash through the doors]] of the Kempton Park World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council, though this did not derail the process.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Arthur (2008). ''Victory Or Violence – The Story of the Awb of South Africa.'' Lulu.com. pp. 165–166. {{ISBN|978-1-4092-0187-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the continuing "black-on-black" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the [[St James Church massacre]] on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town, killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58.

In 1993 de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1993|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060620040422/http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993/| archivedate=20 June 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence persisted right up to the 1994 elections. [[Lucas Mangope]], leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, declared that it would not take part in the elections. It had been decided that, once the temporary constitution had come into effect, the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa, but Mangope did not want this to happen. There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a [[Bophuthatswana coup d'état|coup d'état in Bophuthatswana]] on 10 March that deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power. Three AWB militants were killed during this intervention, and harrowing images were shown on national television and in newspapers across the world.

Two days before the elections, a [[car bomb]] exploded in Johannesburg, killing nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_n16_v111/ai_15239247 |title=Dawn of liberation – 1994 South African election |accessdate=13 July 2008  |author=Christian Century |date=11 May 1994 |publisher=BNet, a CBS Company}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1996/9612/s961213g.htm |title=New cut-off date opens amnesty doors for pre-election bombers |accessdate=13 July 2008  |author=[[Truth and reconciliation commission]] |publisher=South African Department of Justice and Constitutional Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the elections, another one went off, injuring 13. At midnight on 26–27 April 1994 the old flag was lowered, and the old (now co-official) national anthem ''[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika|Die Stem]]'' ("The Call") was sung, followed by the raising of the new [[Flag of South Africa|rainbow flag]] and singing of the other co-official anthem, ''[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]'' ("God Bless Africa").

=== 1994 election ===

[[File:Flag of South Africa.svg|thumb|The new multicoloured [[flag of South Africa]] adopted in 1994 to mark the end of Apartheid]]

{{Main|South African general election, 1994}}
The election was held on 27 April 1994 and went off peacefully throughout the country as 20 million South Africans cast their votes. There was some difficulty in organising the voting in rural areas, but people waited patiently for many hours to vote amidst a palpable feeling of goodwill. An extra day was added to give everyone the chance. International observers agreed that the elections were free and fair.&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, Heather (2001). ''The politics of the new South Africa: apartheid and after.'' Pearson Education. p. 194. {{ISBN|978-0-582-38227-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union's report on the election compiled at the end of May 1994, published two years after the election, criticised the Independent Electoral Commission's lack of preparedness for the polls, the shortages of voting materials at many voting stations, and the absence of effective safeguards against fraud in the counting process.  In particular, it expressed disquiet that "no international observers had been allowed to be present at the crucial stage of the count when party representatives negotiated over disputed ballots."  This meant that both the electorate and the world were "simply left to guess at the way the final result was achieved."&lt;ref name=Jeffery&gt;Jeffery, A.  ''People's War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa''.  Jonathan Ball.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC won 62.65 percent of the vote,&lt;ref name=IEC-1994-results&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.za/Elections94.asp |title=Elections '94 |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628132254/http://www.elections.org.za/Elections94.asp |archivedate=28 June 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairvote-rsa1994"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/?page=554 |title=Spotlight Three: South Africa's 1994 Elections |accessdate=13 July 2008  |first=Arend|last=Lijphart|publisher=FairVote}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than the 66.7 percent that would have allowed it to rewrite the constitution. 252 of the 400 seats went to members of the African National Congress. The NP captured most of the white and Coloured votes and became the official opposition party. As well as deciding the national government, the election decided the provincial governments, and the ANC won in seven of the nine provinces, with the NP winning in the Western Cape and the IFP in [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. On 10 May 1994, Mandela was sworn in as South Africa's president. The Government of National Unity was established, its cabinet made up of 12 ANC representatives, six from the NP, and three from the IFP. [[Thabo Mbeki]] and de Klerk were made deputy presidents.

The anniversary of the elections, 27 April, is celebrated as a [[public holidays in South Africa|public holiday]] known as [[Freedom Day (South Africa)|Freedom Day]].

[[South African Press Association]]. 14 May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baltasar Garzón Real''' ({{IPA-es|baltaˈsaɾ ɣaɾˈθon}}; born 26 October 1955) is a Spanish [[Disbarment|disbarred]] lawyer and former judge. Garzón formerly served on Spain's central criminal court, the ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'', and was the [[examining magistrate]] of the ''Juzgado Central de Instrucción No. 5'', which investigates the most important criminal cases in Spain, including terrorism, [[organised crime]], and [[money laundering]]. In 2011 he was suspended from judicial activity and in 2012 he was convicted of illegal wiretapping and disbarred for a period of 11 years. Garzón is currently head of [[Julian Assange]]'s legal team, despite not having a legal license in any country.

==Career==
On 10 October 1998, Garzón issued an international warrant for the arrest of former [[Chile]]an dictator, General [[Augusto Pinochet]], for the alleged deaths and torture of Spanish citizens. Although the British government refused to extradite Pinochet,&lt;ref name="Pinochet"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/13/pinochet.chile6 | title=Extradition refused | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=23 August 2012 | author=Dyer, Clare | location=London | date=13 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first time that a former head of government had been arrested on the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson|Robertson, Geoffrey]], ''Crimes Against Humanity''. Penguin Books, 2006. Ppg. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garzón has been prevented from working as a judge in Spain since May 2010.  His initial suspension was the result of legal action initiated by [[Manos Limpias]], a rightist union&lt;ref name=reutersprobe/&gt; headed by [[Miguel Bernard Remón]], a former leader of [[Fuerza Nueva]], a pro-[[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] political party.&lt;ref name="pais"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/01/20/actualidad/1327057880_618382.html | title=El Supremo rechaza apartar a un juez recusado por Manos Limpias | work=''[[El País]]'' (elpais.com) | date=January 2012 | agency=[[EFE]] | accessdate=13 February 2012 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Netherlands"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/interview-garz%C3%B3n-a-%E2%80%9Ccancer%E2%80%9D-spanish-justice | title=Garzon, a "cancer" on Spanish justice | date=January 2012 | agency=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Garrido, Marta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tremlett Observer"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/05/baltasar-garzon-trial-franco-crimes | title=Trial of judge Baltasar Garzón splits a Spain still suffering civil war wounds | work=[[The Observer]] (guardian.co.uk) | date=February 2012 | author=[[Giles Tremlett|Tremlett, Giles]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was suspended from judicial activity in Spain pending trial in respect of a charge relating to his investigation of [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] crimes,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8682948.stm | title=Crusading Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón is suspended | publisher=BBC News | date=May 2010 | accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was awarded the René Cassin Prize by the French organization [[Jeune République]] with the support of the [[International Criminal Court]] and [[Amnesty International]] and as a consequence given permission to work as a legal adviser at the [[International Criminal Court]] in [[The Hague]] from May 2010.&lt;ref name="Pais"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Poder/Judicial/autoriza/traslado/Garzon/Haya/elpepuesp/20100518elpepunac_31/Tes | title=El Poder Judicial... | publisher=El País | year=2010 | accessdate=22 August 2012 | author=Hernández, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] considered three charges against Garzón.  They found against him in relation to one of the charges, that relating to his investigation of the corrupt, money-laundering [[Gürtel case|"Gurtel" network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Los fundamentos de uno de los fallos más discutidos de la historia de España|language=Spanish|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2012 the Supreme Court convicted him of illegally [[Covert listening device|wiretapping]] conversations between suspects (on remand in connection with inquiries into "Gurtel") and their lawyers who were believed to be moving their money beyond the reach of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* On 27 February 2012 he was cleared of abusing his powers in investigating the crimes of the Francoist era (the charge which had resulted in his first suspension in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/27/baltasar-garzon-cleared-franco-crimes?newsfeed=true | title=Baltasar Garzón cleared over his Franco-era crimes inquiry | publisher=Guardian newspapers UK | date=27 February 2012 | author=Tremlett | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garzón stated that he would appeal to the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] against his expulsion from the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/10/baltasar-garzon-options | title=Baltasar Garzón has limited options after guilty verdict | author=Tremlett | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
Born in [[Torres, Jaén|Torres]], [[Jaén Province, Spain|Jaén]], Garzón graduated from the [[University of Seville]] in 1979.  He was appointed to the ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in 1988, and rapidly made his name in Spain by pursuing the [[Basque people|Basque]] separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/06/spain.guantanamo |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=Judge Baltasar Garzón | date=6 March 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Paul | last=Hamilos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1993, Garzón asked for an extended leave of absence as a judge and went into [[politics of Spain|politics]], running for the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] (the lower house of parliament) as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] candidate on the party list of the then ruling party [[Partido Socialista Obrero Español]] (PSOE). Prime Minister [[Felipe González]] appointed him head of a strengthened National Plan Against Drugs, but Garzón resigned shortly after being appointed, complaining of lack of support from the government, and returned to the ''Audiencia Nacional''.

==Spanish cases==

===GAL===
{{main|Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación}}
His 1994 investigation led to the conviction of [[José Barrionuevo|José Barrionuevo Peña]], a former Interior minister, as head of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación]] (GAL), a [[state terrorism|state terrorist]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge who arrested Pinochet now finds himself in the dock|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/judge-who-arrested-pinochet-now-finds-himself-in-the-dock-6291027.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 January 2012|author=Alasdair Fotheringham|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug-trafficking===
{{main|Operación Nécora}}
Garzón made his name as a magistrate through several police operations centred on drug-trafficking in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Colombian cartels, such as the [[Medellín Cartel]], were using the [[Galician mafia]], already accustomed to smuggling tobacco, to smuggle drugs into Spain. In 1990, ''[[Operación Nécora]]'' led to the conviction of members of the clan led by Laureano Oubiña. The following year Garzón headed another investigation, ''Operación Pitón'', which led to the conviction of members of the Charlines clan.

===''Caso Atlético''===
About 1999 he investigated [[Jesús Gil]], the former mayor of [[Marbella]] and owner of [[Atlético Madrid]], who was convicted in 2002 on grounds of corruption.

===ETA===
Garzón has also presided in many trials against alleged ETA members. In July 1998 he presided a case against Orain S.A., the Basque communication company that published the newspaper ''[[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]'' and owned the radio station ''Egin Irratia''. Garzón ordered the closure of both and sent some of the company officers to prison, due to their alleged links with ETA. These charges were later dropped for lack of evidence, and the journalists were released. Many years later Garzón imprisoned them again under the allegation of being part of ETA in a "broader" sense. ''Egin'' was allowed to reopen years later by the Audiencia Nacional, after all charges were found without foundation. In February 2003 Garzón also ordered the closure of ''[[Egunkaria]]'', once again alleging links with ETA (some years later, it was proven that Egunkaria had no links with the banned separatist group, but it was too late and the newspaper could never be printed again, the company who publishes it had gone bankrupt). In October 2002 Garzón suspended the operations of the [[Batasuna]] party for three years, alleging direct connections with ETA. In February 2008 he also ordered the ban of two Basque nationalist parties which had filled the political space of Batasuna: [[Communist Party of the Basque Homelands|EHAK]] and [[Eusko Abertzale Ekintza|EAE-ANV]] on the same grounds.{{original research inline|date=February 2012}}

===Francoist atrocities===
{{see also|White Terror (Spain)#Aftermath}}
On 17 October 2008, Garzón formally declared the acts of repression committed by the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]] to be [[crimes against humanity]], and accounted them in more than one hundred thousand killings during and after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He also ordered the exhumation of 19 unmarked mass graves, one of them believed to contain the remains of the poet [[Federico García Lorca]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/world/europe/17spain.html?ref=world Fuchs, Dale, "Crusading Judge Orders Inquiry Into Franco Era", ''The New York Times'', 17 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, (October 2008),[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/spain  "Franco repression ruled as a crime against humanity", ''The Guardian'' (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2008, Garzón said that he was dropping the investigation against Franco and his allies after state prosecutors had questioned his jurisdiction over crimes committed 70 years ago by people who are now dead and whose crimes were covered by an [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law|amnesty passed in 1977]]. In a 152-page statement, he passed responsibility to regional courts for opening 19 mass graves believed to hold the remains of hundreds of victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/europe/19spain.html?hp Burnett, Victoria, "Spanish Judge Drops Probe Into Franco Atrocities", ''The New York Times'', 18 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Caso Gürtel'' ===
{{main|Gürtel case}}
Garzón started a major corruption inquiry, code-named "G&amp;uuml;rtel" from the name of its ringleader, Franscisco Correa, ("G&amp;uuml;rtel" being German for "belt", which is the meaning of "correa" in Spanish). The case was related to bribes given to [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. He was disposed of the case in 2010.&lt;ref name="Agencies"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/09/baltasar-garzon-guilty-wiretapping-spain|title=Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón found guilty in wiretapping case|last=Agencies|date=2012-02-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegation of improper eavesdropping====
The accused in the case sought to have evidence against them ignored. The accused asked that the evidence be ruled inadmissible, since it was obtained from [[Telephone tapping|conversations between prisoners and counsel]], which, under Spanish law, it is claimed, is allowed only in terrorism-related cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/10/22/valencia/1256236713.html |title=Garzón defiende en Valencia las escuchas del caso Gürtel: 'Se ajustan a la legalidad' &amp;#124; Valencia |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Garzón's authorisation of the recordings resulted in his suspension as a judge.&lt;ref name="Agencies"/&gt;

==International cases==

===Augusto Pinochet===
{{Main|Indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet}}
On 10 October 1998, Garzón issued an international warrant for the arrest of former [[Chile]]an President [[Augusto Pinochet]] for the alleged deaths and torture of Spanish citizens. The [[Chilean Truth Commission]] (1990–91) report was the basis for the warrant, marking an unprecedented use of [[universal jurisdiction]] to attempt to try a former dictator for a crime committed abroad. Eventually it was turned down by British [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], who rejected Garzón's request to have Pinochet [[extradition|extradited]] to Spain on health grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/06/spain.guantanamo|title=Profile: Judge Baltasar Garzón|last=Hamilos|first=Paul|date=2008-03-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=February 2012}}

====Kissinger and Operation Condor====
Garzón asked for permission for cross-examination of former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in connection with a plot in the 1970s known as [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;''CNN'', 18 April 2002, [http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/18/spain.kissinger/index.html "Spanish judge seeks Kissinger"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentine genocide===
Garzón also filed charges of genocide against Argentine military officers on the disappearance of Spanish citizens during [[Argentina]]'s 1976–1983 dictatorship.  Eventually [[Adolfo Scilingo]] and [[Miguel Angel Cavallo]] were prosecuted in separate cases.  Scilingo was convicted and sentenced to over 1,000 years incarceration for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/legal-procedures/adolfo_scilingo_258.html TRIAL (Track Impunity Always)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925073420/http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/legal-procedures/adolfo_scilingo_258.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guantanamo===
Garzón issued indictments for five [[List of Guantanamo Bay detainees|Guantanamo detainees]], including Spaniard [[Abderrahman Ahmad]] and Jordanian [[Jamil El Banna]].  Ahmad was extradited to Spain on 14 February 2004.  El Banna was released to the United Kingdom, and in 2007, Garzón dropped the charges against him on humanitarian grounds.&lt;ref name=DailyMail2009-03-29&gt;{{cite news

====Bush Six====
{{Main|Bush Six}}
In March 2009, Garzón considered whether Spain should allow charges to be filed against former officials from the [[United States government]] under [[George W. Bush]] for offering justifications for torture.&lt;ref name=Reuters2009-03-28&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six former Bush officials are: [[Alberto Gonzales]], former [[Attorney General]];
[[John Yoo]], of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]];
[[Douglas Feith]], former undersecretary of defense for policy;
[[William Haynes II]], former general counsel for the Department of Defense;
[[Jay Bybee]], also at Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel; and
[[David Addington]], [[VPOTUS|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]'s Chief of Staff.

However, the investigation was assigned to Judge [[Eloy Velasco]] who chose not to pursue it stating that Spain could not investigate the case if the U.S. did not intend to conduct its own investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress2009-05-05&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] it was revealed that Chief Prosecutor [[Javier Zaragoza]] intended to argue that the case
should not be assigned to Judge Garzón,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and a later cable stated that Garzón was "forced to give up" the investigation.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

On 29 April 2009, Garzón opened an investigation into an alleged "systematic programme" of torture at [[Guantánamo Bay]], following accusations by four former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;"Spanish Judge Opens Probe into Guantanamo Torture", ''Agence France Presse'', 29 April 2009 [http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2009/04/29-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the leaked cable indicates that the Chief Prosecutor intended to also fight this investigation and that he feared, "Garzón may attempt to wring all the publicity he can from the case unless and until he is forced to give it up."

In September 2009 the Spanish newspaper ''[[Público (Spain)|Público]]'' reported that, despite opposition, Garzón was proceeding to the next phase of his investigation. ([[Andy Worthington]], writing in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' gave an English language account of this story).&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost2009-09-08&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-worthington/spanish-judge-resumes-tor_b_279451.html| title=Spanish Judge Resumes Torture Case Against Six Senior Bush Lawyers

==Appearance before the Spanish Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court of Spain has declared admissible three [[criminal accusation]]s against Garzón for 'prevarication' which implies using his authority as a judge to intentionally subvert the course of  justice. This is a very serious criminal offense punishable by suspension from any (Spanish) judicial activity for up to twenty years.

===Crimes against humanity by Franco’s government===
In October 2008, Garzón opened a controversial inquiry into alleged [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the Nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War and the years that followed the war. This action was controversial because the offenses were nearly 70 years old, previous to the concept of [[crimes against humanity]], and a 1977 general amnesty act barred any investigations related to criminal offenses with a political aim previous to 1976. In 2008 the inquiry was suspended. In September 2009, a fascist trade union called "[[Manos limpias]]" (Clean Hands) filed a lawsuit against Garzón alleging that Garzón had abused his judicial authority by opening the inquiry.

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] considers that his short-lived inquiry did not justify disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecution, adding that the prosecution of judges for carrying out their professional work was "an inappropriate and unwarranted interference with the independence of the judicial process".&lt;ref name=BBCface/&gt;

On 24 April 2010 Garzón presented an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judge investigating the case, [[Luciano Varela]] for giving advice to the plaintiffs about the errors in their documents. Garzón accused the judge of partiality, in having "a direct interest in the proceedings and bias in the action" and having "worked closely with the plaintiffs by offering counsel or legal advice" intended help the complainants to correct a defect in their series of indictments to meet a deadline, an action which he defined as "atypical, extra-judicial and prejudicial to one of the parties" (i.e. him, as the accused). According to Garzón, "intervention by the [[Juge d'instruction|instructing judge]] is not protected under any provision of the current legal procedural rules and is clearly unrelated to the substantive rules of Spanish court procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/687198/0/garzon/varela/recusacion/|title=Garzón recusa a Varela por "parcialidad" en la causa abierta contra él en el Supremo|author=[[Agencia EFE]]|editor=[[20 minutos]] publicado bajo licencia CC-BY-SA 2.1.|date=24 April 2010|accessdate=24 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100428023930/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/687198/0/garzon/varela/recusacion/| archivedate= 28 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Varela]] accepted the appeal and temporarily stepped out from the case until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal.

On 11 May 2010 [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], chief prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) requested that the [[Judiciary of Spain]] might assign Garzón as a consultant to the ICC for six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = El Poder Judicial suspende a Baltasar Garzón por investigar los crímenes del franquismo

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which would have allowed [[General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain]] (La Comisión Permanente Extraordinaria del Consejo General del Poder Juidicial or CGPJ) to avoid suspending Garzón during the impending trial for investigating crimes committed during the [[Francisco Franco]] era.

In response, Judge Varela brought forward his conclusion that Garzón should stand trial, and the CGPJ rejected the request of the ICC on the basis that it appeared to be simply a personal request by Moreno-Ocampo, rather than an official ICC invitation. On Friday 14 May 2010 Garzón was duly suspended from judicial activity&lt;ref name=reutersprobe&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE64D3R020100514 "Controversial Spain judge suspended over war probe" Reuters] Accessed 15 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; (with pay) 'as a precaution, pending judgment' as a result of the decision of Judge Varela, which suspension is formally required by Spanish law. The CGPC subsequently declared that it would require five different certificates ('informes' in Spanish) to release Garzón to the ICC as a consultant for six months during his period of suspension from judicial activity. These were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* That the public prosecutor (which opposes the trial of Garzón) certify that there would be no conflict of interest
* That the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] (hearing the case against Garzón) would not be delayed or inconvenienced
* That the ICC certify the appointment would not provide [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] for Garzón from either outstanding or future criminal process in Spain
* That Spain's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]] declare the appointment of Garzón to be in the [[national interest]] of Spain
* That the Secretary General of the CGPJ was satisfied that all of the above certificates were appropriate  and legally valid for this temporary assignment.

José Manuel Gómez Begresista, the president of the CGPJ's Commission for Studies and Reports, impugned each of the above five conditions, which he characterized  as 'ridiculous' since Garzón had previously been assigned to such work, and no immunity from Spanish law attaches thereto. He went on to state that the decision taken by the CGPJ "lacked any legal grounds whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Later that day, the CGPJ authorised the assignment of Garzón to the ICC.

Coincidentally, on the same day,  The Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] delivered final judgement in the case [[Vassili Kononov]] v. [[Latvia]] No. 36376/04, on 17 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Russian Federation had maintained that any prosecution of the applicant was statute-barred, as supported by the  dissenting opinion of Judge Costa joined by Judges Kalaydjieva and Poalelungi, which  is essentially analogous to the basis of the prosecution of Garzón: under "[[Echr#Article 7 - Article 15 - derogations|Article 15]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] no derogation is permissible and in conclusion, [the dissident judges] consider that, in respect of  [[Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]

*(a)  the legal basis of the applicant's [previous] prosecution and conviction was not sufficiently clear in 1944;
*(b)  [the current legislation] it was not reasonably foreseeable at that time either, particularly by the applicant himself;
*(c)  prosecution of the offense was, moreover, statute-barred from 1954 under the applicable domestic legislation;
*(d)  and, as a consequence, the finding that the applicant's acts were not subject to statutory limitation, thus resulting in his conviction, amounted to retrospective application of the criminal law to his detriment."&lt;ref name="British and Irish Legal Information Institute"&gt;{{cite web

However, in the prevailing and joint concurring opinion of judges Rozakis, Tulkens, Spielmann and Jebens, (Para No. 6) "''the right approach,  []  is that Article 7 of the Convention and the principles it enshrines require that in a rule-of-law system anyone considering carrying out a particular act should be able, by reference to the legal rules defining crimes and the corresponding penalties, to determine whether or not the act in question constitutes a crime and what penalty he or she faces if it is carried out. Hence no one can speak of retroactive application of substantive law, when a person is convicted, even belatedly, on the basis of rules existing at the time of the commission of the act." ''&lt;ref name="British and Irish Legal Information Institute"/&gt;  Since the [[Spanish State]] of Franco had laws against kidnapping and killing, it might be difficult to argue that these acts were legal, even if they were directed by  (Francoist) state officials, particularly as Garzón convicted the PSOE government officials promoting the GAL assassination squads.

===Impartiality questions===
On 17 December 2010 Garzón  challenged five of the seven Supreme Court justices that could be appointed to judge him for his activities in respect of the exhumation of Franco victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Garzón recusa a cinco de los siete jueces que le juzgarán

He alleges that Juan Saavedra, Adolfo Prego Oliver, Joaquin Giménez, Francisco and Juan Ramon Berdugo Monterde should be disqualified from officiating in any way because they have participated in pre-trial activities and thus may have an interest in the outcome that might affect their impartiality. These five judges have intervened in the investigation of the case, and the defence claims that consequently – and according to a strict interpretation of the principle of ''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'' – such intervention demonstrates these five judges an indirect interest in the outcome of the process.

The background to this case is that conservative opinion generally asserts that "the dictatorship" is past, and exhuming its less savoury activities is injurious to modern Spanish political interests (as may be Garzón's extraterritorial attempts to accuse foreign nationals of crimes against humanity).

Certainly founding members of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], such as [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]], were members of Franco's government, and there may be a fear that the more aggressively socialist opposition may wish to use these exhumations to imply thereby the intentions of modern Spanish political leaders may be less than entirely democratic, and that established political entities may seek to influence the course of justice (for example – between 2005–2010 – when the PP and PSOE denied the [[Spanish Senate]] the necessary majority to approve fresh judges for the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Banco Santander corruption allegation===
The allegation is that Garzón dropped (adjourned ''[[sine die]]'') a case against the director of [[Grupo Santander|Santander]], [[Emilio Botín]], in return for payment for some courses sponsored by the bank in New York between 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lne.es/espana/2010/01/29/supremo-investiga-garzon-dinero-recibio-nueva-york-banco-santander/866011.html ''La Nueva España''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This appeal to the [[Spanish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] follows a charge previously archived by the criminal court on 27 November 2006, since the alleged 1.2 million euro fee was deemed by the lower court to be in fact 216,000 euros, which was not paid to Garzón, but to the university foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/20100129/nacional/destacados/supremo-investiga-garzon-pidio-20100129.html eldiariomontanes.es] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court Investigating Judge insisted that there was clear evidence of wrongdoing involving some 2.5 million [[United States dollar|US$]], but, because the complaint was originally laid on 12 June 2009, but the last payment was made in May 2006 the 3-year statute of limitations relating to the Supreme Court had been exceeded by 25 days. It was not clear why the case,  previously archived by a provincial court on 27 November 2006 was not referred back to the lower court where a 15-year statute of limitations applies provided there is disclosure of 'further and better evidence' which might then lead to a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Supreme Court trial===
On 9 February 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that judge Baltasar Garzón was guilty of illegally ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers in a case of corruption. Under Spanish law, such wiretaps are only expressly permitted for terrorism cases and the legality of their use in other cases is more vague. The Supreme Court also barred Garzón from the legal profession for 11 years. The court said: "Garzón's methods are typical of totalitarian countries, without any respect of the right of defence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2013/09/11/Spanish_Judge_Baltasar_Garzon_Tells_the_Story_of_the_Arrest_ Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón Tells the Story of the Arrest of Chile's Augusto Pinochet - Worldnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other judges also came out in support of Garzón.

Given the severity of the accusations against the Supreme Court, a large number of persons and institutions issued statements in support of the ruling. The progressive [[Judges for Democracy]] association stated that "The Supreme Court and any other criminal court can only be asked to apply the law and respect the presumption of innocence. This must be both in determining the facts and in interpreting the norm. Whether or not one agrees with the Court's decision and the interpretation on which it is founded, we must state that the Supreme Court has ruled in this context and should not be disqualified as such an institution for it.&lt;ref name="Judges for Democracy"&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.juecesdemocracia.es/txtComunicados/2012/10febrero12.htm | title=Comunicado JpD sobre sentencia Garzón | publisher=Jueces para la Democracia | date=10 February 2012 | accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Margarita Robles]], member of the [[General Council of the Judiciary]] and former Subsecretary of State with the socialist government, said that the Supreme Court ruling was "legally impeccable" and had been produced as part of a procedure "with all the guarantees."&lt;ref name="Deia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.deia.com/2012/02/10/politica/estado/margarita-robles-cree-que-la-sentencia-es-impecable-aunque-le-entristece-la-situacion-de-garzon- | title=Robles sobre Garzón: "La sentencia es impecable" | work=Deia | date=10 February 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121103611/http://www.deia.com/2012/02/10/politica/estado/margarita-robles-cree-que-la-sentencia-es-impecable-aunque-le-entristece-la-situacion-de-garzon- | archivedate=21 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was later revealed that the Supreme Court had made a mistake in sentencing by overlooking the fact the Garzón had been suspended for nearly a year in the period 2010/2011 solely on the basis of his pending trial on a charge relating to his investigation of Francoist atrocities, a charge on which he was subsequently cleared.&lt;ref name="El Supremo se equivoca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.publico.es/espana/440813/el-supremo-se-equivoca-con-garzon | title=El Supremo se equivoca | work=[[Público (Spain)|Público]] | accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of politicisation of the judiciary==
In June 2010 Garzón was recruited as a consultant to the ICC.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

At the end of October 2010, the re-election of Judge Juan Saavedra to the [[Spanish Supreme Court]] Penal Division reactivated the three judicial processes against Garzón. The re-appointment of a right-wing judge may have suggested to the Spanish legal authorities that the complaints had sufficient weight to merit continuing the domestic process despite the rulings in the European Court of Human Rights cited above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10598">'''''Bitching Betty''''' is a [[slang]] term used by some pilots and aircrew (mainly [[North America]]n), when referring to the voices used by some aircraft warning systems.

The enunciating voice, in at least some aircraft systems, may be either male or female and in some cases this may be selected according to pilot preference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} If the voice is female it may be referred to as Bitching Betty; if the voice is male it may be referred to as '''''Barking Bob'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-distinct-voice-of-the-f-a-18-hornets-bitchin-betty-1764527531|title=The Distinct Voice Of The F/A-18 Hornet's 'Bitchin' Betty' Warning System Is Retiring|first=Tyler|last=Rogoway|publisher=foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female voice is heard on military aircraft such as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]],&lt;ref name=lane/&gt; the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]&lt;ref name=milne/&gt; and the  [[Mikoyan MiG-29]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} A male voice is heard on [[Boeing]] [[commercial airliner]]s and is also used in the [[BAE Hawk]].

In the [[United Kingdom]] the term ''Nagging Nora'' is sometimes used, and in New Zealand the term used for Boeing aircraft is '''Hank the Yank'''. The voice warning system used on [[London Underground]] trains, which also uses a female voice, is known to some staff as '''Sonya''' as it "get'''s on ya''' nerves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cl522|title=Episode 1, The Tube - BBC Two|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
There are two notable systems, which employ voice warnings, and which are found in most commercial and military aircraft: TCAS ([[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]]) and TAWS/EGPWS (Terrain Avoidance Warning System / Enhanced [[Ground Proximity Warning System]]). Both systems provide warnings and verbal instructions.

The auditory warnings produced by these systems usually include a separate attention-getting sound, followed by one or more verbal commands to the pilot/crew. Perhaps the most widely known example, encountered in many video games and movies, is the "Pull up! Pull up!" command. Other common spoken warnings are "Caution, Terrain", "Windshear! Windshear!", or "Traffic, Traffic". These may be followed by short directions to the pilot, advising how the situation may be resolved. TCAS and TAWS/EGPWS are usually integrated to prevent conflicting advice, such as an instruction to "Descend! Descend!" to avoid another aircraft when the aircraft is already close to the ground.

Modern Boeing and [[Airbus]] airliners both feature a male voice, which calls out height above terrain on [[Final approach (aeronautics)|approach to landing]], and other related warnings. Airbus aircraft feature a distinctive British [[Received pronunciation|RP]] accent (heard on recent builds of the [[Airbus A320|A320]] and all Airbus aircraft since the [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]]), or a French accent (heard on ECAM-equipped [[Airbus A300|A300]]s, [[Airbus A310|A310]]s and early A320s).

A female voice was incorporated into [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80/90]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and [[Boeing 717]] (inherited from McDonnell Douglas after the merger with Boeing) series aircraft in their Central Aural Warning Systems (CAWS). These systems provided a voice for most warnings, including fire, altitude, cabin altitude, stall, overspeed, autopilot disconnect and so on.

In more advanced cockpits, on newer aircraft, there may be many other voice warnings managed by an integrated Indications and Crew Alerting System (ICAS) such as "Gear up. Gear up." These may be warning words or phrases, or simply declarative statements which augment the pilot's [[situation awareness]].

==Voice gender==
Early [[human factors]] research in aircraft and other domains indicated that female voices were more authoritative to male pilots and crew members and were more likely to get their attention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Much of this research was based on pilot experiences, particularly in combat situations, where the pilots were being guided by female [[air traffic controller]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} They reported being able to most easily pick out the female voice from amid the flurry of radio chatter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

More recent research, however, carried out since more females have been employed as pilots and air traffic controllers, indicates that the original popular hypothesis may be unreliable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} 

[[Judy Edworthy|Edworthy]] and colleagues in 2003, based at [[Plymouth University]] in [[UK]], for example, found that both acoustic and non-acoustic differences between male and female speakers were negligible. Therefore, they recommended, the choice of speaker should depend on the overlap of noise and speech spectra. Female voices did, however, appear to have an advantage in that they could portray a greater range of urgencies because of their usually higher pitch and pitch range. They reported an experiment showing that knowledge about the sex of a speaker has no effect on judgments of perceived urgency, with acoustic variables accounting for such differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edworthy|first=J|authorlink=Judy Edworthy|author2=Hellier, E |author3=Rivers, J |title=The use of male or female voices in warnings systems: a question of acoustics.|journal=Noise &amp; Health|date=Oct–Dec 2003|volume=6|issue=21|pages=39–50|pmid=14965452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrabito in 2009, however, at [[Defence Research and Development Canada]] in [[Toronto]], found that with simulated cockpit background radio traffic, a male voice rather than a female voice, in a monotone or urgent announcing style, resulted in the largest proportion of correct and fastest identification response times to verbal warnings, regardless of the gender of the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrabito, |first=G. Robert |title=Effects of Talker Sex and Voice Style of Verbal Cockpit Warnings on Performance |journal=[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]] |volume=51 |number=1 |year=2009 |pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voices==
There have been several "Bitching Bettys", over the years, for various commercial and military aircraft:
* Kim Crow - Crow's was the first voice to be digitized. Pilots and astronauts know her as the original Bitching Betty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-voice-actress.com|title=Kim Crow|publisher=.best-voice-actress.com|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erica Lane - her voice can be heard in the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]] helicopter.&lt;ref name=lane&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleinc.com/erica.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603013300/http://www.eleinc.com/erica.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 June 2006|title=Erica Lane Enterprises, Inc., a Woman-owned, SBA certified 8(a) HUBZone SDB|date=3 June 2006|publisher=eleinc.com/|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sue Milne - her voice is used in the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].&lt;ref name=milne&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Ward |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2168713/Fighter-pilots-nagging-Nora-female-voice-commands-cockpit-Typhoon-jets.html |title=Fighter pilots to get 'nagging Nora' female voice commands in the cockpit of Typhoon jets |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==
Voice warning systems included in cars of the late 1970s to early 1980s, such as the [[Datsun]] and [[Nissan]] [[Z-Car]] series, found in the [[280ZX]] and 1984-1988 [[300ZX]] (optional in the base model and standard in the Turbo model), and the [[Datsun Maxima]] and [[Nissan Maxima]] of the early 1980s, were also known as Bitching Betty. The Datsun system issued commands such as "lights are on," or "Left door is open."  The system used a small box located under the vehicle's dashboard that implemented a small, white plastic [[Gramophone record|record]] disc that used a [[Magnetic cartridge]] to play spoken commands through the vehicle's [[audio system]]'s speakers, similar to that of some [[Texas Instruments]] talking toys of the time period. [[Datsun]]'s original name for the feature was "Talking Lady."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Some [[Acura]]s ([[Honda]]'s [[luxury car]] marque in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[China]]) of the mid 2000s, would ask the driver to "please fasten your [[seatbelt]]" when the driver's seatbelt was not fastened, in addition to a chime warning.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The [[General Dynamics]] [[M1 Abrams]] features a female voice warning system to warn the crew of open hatches and critical faults when equipped with the System Enhancement Package.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The '''Border Police of Georgia''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: შსს საქართველოს სასაზღვო პოლიცია) is the primary [[border guard]]ing force and [[coast guard]] in the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and is under command of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. It is responsible for patrolling the entire 1839&amp;nbsp;km (1142.7&amp;nbsp;mi) land border of Georgia, as well as the country's 310&amp;nbsp;km (192.6&amp;nbsp;mi) coastline and [[territorial waters]] in the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://police.ge/en/ministry/structure-and-offices/border-police |title=Border Police |publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs |access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, border control at checkpoints is instead performed by the Patrol Police department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://police.ge/en/ministry/structure-and-offices/patrol-police-department?sub=375]&lt;/ref&gt; The current chief is [[Temur Kekelidze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bpg.gov.ge/en/news/miscellaneous/new-head-appointed-at-the-mia-border-police-of-georgia.page |title=New Head Appointed at the MIA Border Police of Georgia |date=February 8, 2018 |access-date=May 24, 2018 |publisher=MIA Border Police of Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Formation of the Border Police began shortly after Georgia regained its [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|independence]] from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, and was officially formed in 1992 as a [[paramilitary]] unit within the [[Ministry of Defense of Georgia|Ministry of Defense]]. In 1994, the agency separated from the Ministry of Defence to become the independent State Border Defence Department. In the following years, the Coast Guard Service and the Border Aviation Service were formed as part of the new department, in 1998 and 1999 respectively. On February 11, 2004, the State Border Defence Department was absorbed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and was reclassified as a [[law-enforcement agency]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bpg.gov.ge/en/border-police/brief-history |title=Brief History |publisher=MIA Border Police of Georgia |access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Border Police played a role in the [[Russo-Georgian War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bpg.gov.ge/en/news/visits/mia-marked-a-coast-guards-day.page |title=MIA Marked a Coast Guard’s Day |date=July 17, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2017 |publisher=MIA Border Police of Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the loss of multiple Coast Guard ships and their crews at [[Poti]] and along the Abkhaz shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://turkishnavy.net/2008/09/21/russian-georgian-war-at-sea/ |title=Russian – Georgian War at Sea |publisher=Bosphorous Naval News |date=September 21, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/08/while-the-media/ |title=INSIDE THE BATTLE FOR THE BLACK SEA |last=Shachtman |first=Noah |date=August 15, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the war, the Coast Guard has continued to enforce the [[Georgian sea blockade of Abkhazia]], arresting several commercial vessels traveling to and from [[Abkhazia]] on the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/945f9dd0-8da3-11de-93df-00144feabdc0 |title=Georgia threatens Abkhazia over sea-trade |publisher=Financial Times |last=Gorst |first=Isabel |date=August 20, 2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byzantine diplomacy''' concerns the principles, methods, mechanisms, ideals, and techniques that the [[Byzantine Empire]] espoused and used in order to negotiate with other states and to promote the goals of its foreign policy. [[Dimitri Obolensky]] asserts that the preservation of civilization in [[Eastern Europe]] was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the [[history of Europe]] and the [[History of the Middle East|Middle East]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{harvnb|Obolensky|1994|loc="The Principles and Methods of Byzantine Diplomacy", p. 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and goals==
{{further information|Byzantine-Mongol alliance|Sino-Roman relations}}
After the fall of [[Rome]], the key challenge to the Byzantine Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its sundry neighbors, including the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], [[Georgians]], [[Caucasian_Iberians|Iberians]], the [[Germanic peoples]], the [[Bulgars]], the [[Slavs]], the [[Armenians]], the [[Huns]], the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], the [[Franks]], the [[Lombards]], and the [[Arabs]], that embodied and so maintained its imperial status. All these neighbors lacked a key resource that Byzantium had taken over from Rome, namely a formalized legal structure. When they set about forging formal political institutions, they were dependent on the empire. Whereas classical writers are fond of making a sharp distinction between peace and war, for the Byzantines diplomacy was a form of war by other means. Anticipating [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Carl von Clausewitz]], Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]] writes, "Since many and various matters lead toward one end, victory, it is a matter of indifference which one uses to reach it." With a regular army of 120,000-140,000 men after the losses of the seventh century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=281}}; {{harvnb|Haldon|1999|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the empire's security depended on activist diplomacy.

Byzantium's "[[Bureau of Barbarians]]" was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire’s rivals from every imaginable source.&lt;ref name="Antonucci"&gt;{{harvnb|Antonucci|1993|pp=11–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While on the surface a protocol office—its main duty was to ensure foreign envoys were properly cared for and received sufficient state funds for their maintenance, and it kept all the official translators—it clearly had a security function as well. ''On Strategy'', from the 6th century, offers advice about foreign embassies: "[Envoys] who are sent to us should be received honourably and generously, for everyone holds envoys in high esteem. Their attendants, however, should be kept under surveillance to keep them from obtaining any information by asking questions of our people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennis|1985|loc=Anonymous, ''Byzantine Military Treatise on Strategy'', para. 43, p. 125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and methods==
{{Byzantine culture}}
[[File:Bulgarian king Omurtag sends delegation to Byzantine emperor Michael II from the Chronicle of John Skylitzes.jpg|left|thumb|[[Omurtag]], [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|ruler of Bulgaria]], sends delegation to Byzantine emperor [[Michael II]] (Madrid Skylitzes, Biblioteca Nacional de España, Madrid).]]

Byzantine diplomacy drew its neighbors into a network of international and interstate relations, controlled by the empire itself.&lt;ref name="Neuman"&gt;{{harvnb|Neumann|2005|pp=869–870}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This process revolved around treaty making. Byzantine historian Evangelos Chrysos postulates a three-layered process at work: 1) the new ruler was welcomed into the family of kings, 2) there was an assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes and values, 3) as a formalization of the second layer of the process, there were laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepard|Franklin|1992|loc=Evangelos Chrysos, "Byzantine Diplomacy, A.D. 300–800: Means and Ends", p. 35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to drive this process, the Byzantines availed themselves of a number of mostly diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to [[Constantinople]] would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. Constantinople's riches served the state's diplomatic purposes as a means of propaganda, and as a way to impress foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|2002|loc="Writing the Economic History of Byzantium", p. 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Liutprand of Cremona]] was sent as an ambassador to the Byzantine capital, he was overwhelmed by the imperial residence, the luxurious meals, and acrobatic entertainment. Special care was taken to stimulate as many of the senses in as high degree as possible: brightly lit things to see, terrifying sounds, tasty food; even the diplomatic set-piece of having barbarians standing around the throne wearing their native gear.&lt;ref name="Neuman870-871"&gt;{{harvnb|Neumann|2005|pp=870–871}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Byzantium in its dealings with the barbarians generally preferred diplomacy to war is not surprising. For the East Romans, faced with the ever-present necessity of having to battle on two fronts — in the east against [[Persia]]ns, Arabs and [[Turkish people|Turks]], in the north against the Slavs and the [[steppe]] nomads — knew from personal experience how expensive war is both in money and manpower.&lt;ref name="O"/&gt; The Byzantines were skilled at using diplomacy as a weapon of war. If the [[Bulgars]] threatened, subsidies could be given to the [[Kiev Rus]]. A [[Kiev Rus|Rus]] threat could be countered by subsidies to the [[Patzinaks]]. If the Patzinaks proved troublesome, the [[Cumans]] or [[Uzès]] could be contacted. There was always someone to the enemy’s rear in a position to appreciate the emperor's largesse. Another innovative principle of Byzantine diplomacy was effective interference in the internal affairs of other states. In 1282, [[Michael VIII]] sponsored a revolt in [[Sicily]] against [[Charles of Anjou]] called the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. Emperor [[Heraclius]] once intercepted a message from Persian rival [[Khosrau II]] which ordered the execution of a general. Heraclius added 400 names to the message and diverted the messenger, provoking a rebellion by those on the list. The emperor maintained a stable of pretenders to almost every foreign throne. These could be given funds and released to wreak havoc if their homeland threatened attack.&lt;ref name="Antonucci"/&gt;

'''Cradock''' is a town in the [[Eastern Cape Province]] of South Africa, in the upper valley of the [[Great Fish River]], {{convert|250|km|mi}} by road northeast of [[Port Elizabeth]]. The town is the administrative seat of the [[Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality]] in the [[Chris Hani District Municipality|Chris Hani District]] of the Eastern Cape. The estimated population in 2015 was 35,000.

The town is named after [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|John Cradock]], governor of the [[Cape Colony]] and commander of the forces.&lt;ref name="Raper1989" /&gt;

== Pre-colonial history==
For thousands of years [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers were the sole human inhabitants of southern Africa. About 2000 years BP the semi-nomadic [[Khoikhoi]] (or Khoekhoen or Khoikhoin) arrived with cattle, sheep and goats. These pastoralists migrated south towards the coast. Rock paintings and petroglyphs (engravings) remain as evidence of the first people who lived here.

By the 4th century AD Bantu-speaking people had begun to migrate from central Africa down the east coast into southern Africa. The [[amaXhosa]] pressed further south to the banks of the Great Fish River where they met San hunter-gatherers and [[Khoikhoi]] pastoralists, and later still Dutch and then British settlers.

===Colonial history===
The district of which Cradock is now the centre was first settled by Dutch farmers in the late 18th century, but was known long before to the hunters who illicitly crossed the frontier in search of game and ivory.

The first official Dutch expedition to the upper Great Fish River was in mid-1752 when a party led by Ensign [[August Frederik Beutler]] visited the area. Beutler, following the instructions of Governor [[Ryk Tulbagh]] to investigate the possibilities of developing the Cape's eastern regions, was accompanied by a number of other officials including a diarist, Carl Haupt, and a surveyor, [[Carl Wentzel]], who drew a map of the route taken. Almost the only mention made about the area in the diary was that it was very dry and forage was unobtainable.

Forty five years later traveller [[Sir John Barrow]] crossed the Great Fish River. At his crossing point he noted on his map the existence beside the river of "Hepatic wells" - sulphur springs. In later years the springs were to be used for wool washing  and the town's laundry.

After the [[Xhosa Wars#Fourth War (1811–12)|1811–12 Xhosa War]], it became apparent that to maintain order along the frontier more administrative and military posts would have to be established along the Great Fish River. The district of [[Graaff-Reinet]] was too large to administer properly and the town itself too far from the river, so it was decided to set up a new sub-drostdy, and in June 1812 Ensign [[Andries Stockenstrom]] was appointed deputy landdrost. Piet van Heerden's farm Buffels Kloof beside the Great Fish River was bought for 3 500 rix dollars. One of the advantages of the purchase was that Van Heerden's stone-walled house farmhouse could serve as a prison, the first and apparently most important requirement of any town. The house also provided accommodation for a constable and two policemen.

The official proclamation appeared in the [[Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette|Cape Town Gazette]] on 21 January 1814. [[Sir John Cradock]] sanctioned an expenditure of 12 000 [[rixdollar]]s on public buildings and work began at once on a house for the deputy landdrost. In addition he was allowed a farm to "render his positionas comfortable and respectable as possible". The farm chosen was Driefontein, that of Piet van Heerden's brother, W J van Heerden.

In July 1817 the Reverend John Evans was appointed as first minister and he set about raising funds for a church. With minister, deputy landdrost, constable and policemen, the inhabitants could consider their tiny village well on the way to being a "town".&lt;ref name="LogieSnaddon2006" /&gt;

In the 1830s the [[Great Trek]] began, as [[Afrikaners]] who were discontent with British rule left ''en masse'' for the interior. Most of the migration departed from (and via) the area around Cradock.

The [[Cape Colony]] received a degree of independence in 1872 when "[[Responsible Government]]" was declared and, in 1877, the government of Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] sanctioned construction of a railway line connecting [[Port Elizabeth]] on the coast with the hinterland. Passing as it did through Cradock it led to significant growth and economic development in and around the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burman|first=Jose |title=Early railways at the Cape|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6YMAQAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Human &amp; Rousseau|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoeman2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoeman|first=Chris|title=The Historical Karoo: Traces of the Past in South Africa's Arid Interior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4OGngEACAAJ|year=2014|publisher=Zebra|isbn=978-1-77022-568-8|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, a boom in demand for ostrich feathers led to a massive rise in prosperity for the local ostrich farmers.

===The Cradock Four===
{{main|The Cradock Four}}
[[Matthew Goniwe]], Sparrow Mkonto, Fort Calata and Sicelo Mhlauli, known as [[The Cradock Four]] — were abducted while travelling from [[Port Elizabeth]] to Cradock in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1998/98217_0x6849810596.htm STATEMENT BY THE TRC: AMNESTY APPLICATIONS FOR CRADOCK FOUR KILLINGS, 16 February 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180847/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1998/98217_0x6849810596.htm |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then taken to an unknown destination, where they were assaulted, killed and their bodies and the vehicle in which they were travelling burnt. Some of these incidents occurred on the night of 27 June 1985 (the night of their abduction) and some of them occurred at a later, unknown time.

Three [[South African Bureau of State Security|Security Branch]] policemen, a Sergeant Faku, Sergeant Mgoduka, and one Sakati who participated in the killing of the activists were later killed in a car bomb blast at [[Motherwell, Eastern Cape|Motherwell]] in 1989.

The Cradock Four Memorial is a monument located in Lingelihle, a township near Cradock. The monument was erected on 22 July 2000 in commemoration of the Cradock Four.&lt;ref name="news_Crad"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Cradock Four memorial neglected, forgotten | last = Spies | first = Derrick | work = News24 | date = 7 April 2015 | accessdate = 2017-10-11 | url = http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Cradock-Four-memorial-neglected-forgotten-20150407 | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and tourism==
Cradock is one of the Cape's chief centres of the [[wool]] industry, and also produces beef, dairy, fruit, [[alfalfa|lucerne]], and [[mohair]].

Of enormous importance to the economic development of Cradock was the construction of the [[Orange-Fish River Tunnel]]. Completed in 1975 and {{convert|83|km|0|abbr=on}} in length it diverts water from the [[Gariep Dam]] on the [[Orange River]] to the Great Fish River and then on as far as the Addo Valley, [[Grahamstown]] and [[Port Elizabeth]] for irrigation, household and industrial use.

The construction of the tunnel also made possible the annual [[Fish River Canoe Marathon]]. From humble beginnings in 1982 the two-day, {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} event now attracts in excess of 1 500 paddlers from around the world.

A notable attraction is the [[Mountain Zebra National Park]] just {{convert|15|km}} from the town, where the once-endangered [[Mountain zebra|zebra]] species together with lion, cheetah, buffalo and a range of antelope species are to be seen in magnificent surroundings.

Notable attractions in the town are the "tuishuise" (at-home houses), superbly restored Victorian era craftsmen's houses in Market Street which form part of the Victoria Manor Hotel; the [[NG church|Dutch Reformed Moederkerk]] which dates back to 1868 and was designed after the style of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London; and [[List of heritage sites in Eastern Cape|Schreiner House]] where the renowned author of ''[[The Story of an African Farm]]'' lived as a young girl. The house, which is located at 9 Cross Street and is a satellite of the [[National English Literary Museum]], contains a modern set of exhibitions portraying the life of Olive Schreiner.

Cradock was established as a municipality in 1840. By 1902, the town council had assumed a coat of arms.&lt;ref name=med&gt;The arms were depicted on a [http://southafricanmedals.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=828&amp;category_id=1&amp;keyword=Cradock&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=1 medallion] issued in 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cig&gt;The arms were depicted on a [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms cigarette card] issued in 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The arms were formally granted by the provincial administrator in May 1966&lt;ref name=og1&gt;Cape of Good Hope ''Official Gazette'' 3348 (27 May 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; and registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in September 1969.

The arms were: ''Quarterly: I, Argent, a tree Vert; II, Gules, a beehive, Or; III, Gules, a fleece Or; IV, Azure, a garb Or''. In layman's terms, this means that the shield was divided into four quarters displaying (1) a green tree on a silver background, (2) a golden beehive on a red background, (3) a golden fleece on a red background, and (4) a golden wheatsheaf on a blue background.&lt;ref name="ngw._Crad"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Cradock | author =  | work = Heraldry of the World | date =  | accessdate = 2016-01-04 | url = http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Cradock | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1966, the shield was flanked by two ostrich feathers. They were replaced with two mountain zebras, as supporters.  The crest was a cornucopia and the motto was ''Perseverantia vincit''.

'''''Crossing the Line 2: The New Face of Anti-Semitism on Campus''''' is a 2015 film which documents how a growing number of anti-Israel demonstrations on U.S. campuses also include anti-Semitic messaging. The filmmakers interviewed pro-Israel college students, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who say that they feel increasingly intimidated to express their support for Israel on campus.

==Synopsis==
Crossing the Line 2: The New Face of Anti-Semitism on Campus is a documentary film that was released in New York on February 25, 2015 as a “sequel” to [[Jerusalem U]]’s 2010 feature film Crossing the Line: The Intifada Comes to Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem U documentary explores anti-Semitism on US campuses|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jerusalem-U-documentary-explores-anti-Semitism-on-US-campuses-393520|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the original film, Crossing the Line 2 aims to uncover the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activity on North American college campuses and educate the viewer to be able to identify when valid [[criticism of Israel]] “crosses the line” into anti-Semitic rhetoric.

Both films explore the growing phenomenon of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activism on college campuses across North America, with Crossing the Line 2 covering more recent examples of this activism up to the year 2014. One such event, whose footage is shown in the film, is an anti-Israel demonstration at [[Cornell University]] where a demonstrator spits on a Jewish student and screams “f*ck you Zionist scum.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New film depicts Jewish students’ growing insecurity on campus|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-film-depicts-jewish-students-growing-insecurity-on-campus/|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary also examines the experiences of Jewish college students who openly support the [[State of Israel]] and fight against campaigns on their campuses that oppose or critique the Israeli government, such as the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign and [[Israel Apartheid Week]]. These students consistently describe the hostility they face on their campuses, such as fake eviction notices at [[New York University]], and Israel Apartheid Week held on campuses across [[North America]]. The film highlights two students from [[Ohio University]] who were arrested in 2014 for publicly criticizing the student senate president for participating in the [[ALS Ice Bucket Challenge]] by pouring fake blood on herself and calling on Ohio University to divest from Israel.

==Reception==
Former member of the Dutch parliament [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] wrote that watching Crossing the Line 2 was “like having a bucket of ice water being poured over my head...The more we pretend that this is happening somewhere far away, the more hopeless and helpless we feel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9941">[[File:Cyrus Teed.jpg|thumb|Dr. Cyrus R. Teed, alias Koresh.]]

'''Cyrus Reed Teed''' (October 18, 1839 – December 22, 1908) was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[eclectic medicine|eclectic physician]] and [[alchemy|alchemist]] turned religious leader and [[messiah]]. In 1869, claiming divine inspiration, Teed took on the name '''Koresh''' and proposed a new set of scientific and religious ideas he called [[Koreshanity]], including a unique [[Hollow Earth theory]] that posits the Earth and sky exist inside the inner surface of a sphere.

In the 1870s, he founded in New York the [[Koreshan Unity]], a commune whose rule of conduct was based on his teachings. Other similar communities were established in Chicago and San Francisco. After 1894 the group concentrated itself in the small Florida town of [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], seeking to build a "[[New Jerusalem]]" in that locale, peaking at 250 residents during the first decade of the 20th Century. Following Teed's death late in 1908 the group went into decline, finally disappearing in 1961, leaving the [[Koreshan State Historic Site]] behind.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Cyrus Reed Teed was born October 18, 1839 in [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Teed studied medicine before opening a medical practice in [[Utica, New York]].&lt;ref name=Hinds471&gt;William Alfred HInds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies.'' Second Edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koreshanity===

As a young [[eclectic medicine|eclectic physician]], Teed was always interested in unconventional experiments, such as [[alchemy]], often involving dangerously high levels of [[electricity]]. In the autumn of 1869, during an experiment he was badly shocked, and passed out. During his period of unconsciousness, Teed believed he was visited by a divine spirit who told him that he was the [[messiah]]. Inspired, once he awoke Teed vowed to apply his scientific knowledge to "redeem humanity." He promptly changed his first name to "Koresh," the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for Cyrus.

Teed denounced the idea that the Earth revolved around the sun and instead pioneered his own theory of the Universe, known as the Cellular Cosmogony. According to this theory, human beings live on the inside of the planet, not the outside. The [[sun]] is a giant battery-operated contraption, and the stars mere refractions of its light.

Teed's ideas, called [[Koreshanity]], caught on with others. Koreshanity preached cellular cosmogony, alchemy, reincarnation, immortality, celibacy, communism, and a few other radical ideas. Teed started preaching Koreshanity in the 1870s in New York, forming the [[Koreshan Unity]], later moving to Chicago.

===Communal leader===

One of Teed's fundamental principles involved the gathering of his most devoted followers into communal living groups.&lt;ref name=Hinds471 /&gt; A first commune was formed in Chicago in 1888. By 1902 a second Koreshan community was established in that city.&lt;ref name=Hinds471 /&gt; Other followers of the so-called Koreshan Unity formed a short-lived community in San Francisco, which lasted from 1891 to 1892. Small church groups existed in other towns.

In 1894 Teed's followers began to congregate in a small [[Florida]] town called [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], where Teed planned to form a "[[New Jerusalem]]." The two Chicago societies, including the group's printing plant, were subsequently shut down and moved to Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt; The colony was extensively landscaped and bedecked with numerous exotic tropical plants. The Koreshans built extensively, establishing a bakery, general store, concrete works, power plant, and "World College of Life" in the community. They also published their newspaper from the site, called ''The Flaming Sword.''&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pg. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "golden age" of the Koreshan Unity in Estero was 1903 to 1908, when they had over 250 residents and incorporated the town, its territory embracing some 110 square miles — the fifth largest area of any city in the United States at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pg. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

They tried to run several candidates for county government against the local Democratic Party, but were never successful.

===Death and legacy===

On October 13, 1906, while meeting the 1:30PM Atlantic Coast Line train from Baltimore, a group of Koreshans got into a fight in front of R. W. Gillams' grocery store in Ft. Myers, Teed tried to break it up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Peter|title=Cyrus Teed|url=http://koreshan.mwweb.org/teed.htm|website=mwweb.org|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was severely beaten&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings of Estero Town Council", ''The American Eagle'', (Estero: Koreshan, 1906), Vol. 1, No. 23, accessed on 15 Dec 2016, https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/koreshan/documents.php?doc=2-8-americaneagle&amp;sec=2&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; by a Marshal Sanchez, suffering injuries from which he never recovered. He died on December 22, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Kossy, ''Kooks''. Portland: Feral House, 1994. pg. 89. {{ISBN|0-922915-19-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teed's followers initially expected his [[resurrection]], after which he and his faithful would be taken up to heaven as he had predicted in his book ''The Immortal Manhood.'' They kept a constant vigil over his body for two days, after which time it began to show signs of decay. Following Christmas the county health officer stepped in to order his burial.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science.'' pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death the group went into decline.

In 1910, a hurricane destroyed his tomb on the southern end of Estero island and washed his coffin out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Teed&amp;GSfn=Cyrus&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=48112733&amp;df=all&amp; |title=Cyrus Read Teed (1839–1908) – Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=2010-02-14 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last remaining follower, Hedwig Michel, deeded the colony to the State of Florida in 1961. It is now the [[Koreshan State Historic Site]].

Cyrus Teed's son, [[Douglas Arthur Teed]], was an [[American Impressionism|American Impressionist]] painter, but not a follower of his father's teachings.

The '''Dagga Couple''' or '''DC''' is a pro-[[cannabis]] lobbyist organisation from [[South Africa]] founded by '''Julian Stobbs''' and '''Myrtle Clarke''' after the two were arrested for the [[Possession of a controlled substance|possession]] and [[Drug dealer|dealing]] in the substance in 2010. Rather than plead guilty, the couple decided instead to sue seven sectors of [[South African government|government]] that maintained and enforced the policy of [[cannabis prohibition]] in the country resulting in what has been described locally as the ''Trial of the Plant'' in 2017.&lt;ref name=TL&gt;[https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-07-30-dagga-experts-square-off-in-trial-of-the-plant/ Link] [[Times LIVE|Times Live]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and arrest==
Julian Stobbs, a retired [[U.K.|Royal Navy]] air traffic controller and art director in the television and film industry and Kathleen (Myrtle) Clarke, a freelance art director and former school teacher were
arrested after police, acting on a tip-off, raided their home in August 2010. Having more than 115 grams of cannabis ([[South African law]] dictates that anything above 115 grams is considered dealing), they were charged with possession, the intent to sell and faced a lengthy jail time if convicted. They were granted bail and subsequently released.

{{quote|...we had a very heavy handed visit from the [[South African Police Service]] who, acting on a tip off, raided our property in search of a 'drug lab'. What they found was a quiet middle aged couple in their pyjamas and a quantity of dagga. We were arrested after a five hour ordeal in our kitchen, jailed, and because we had more than 115g of the substance, were charged with dealing in dagga. We were subsequently granted bail and released.|Clarke on their arrest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ann7.com/dagga-couple-legalisation-case-postponed/], Dagga couple legalisation case postponed, retrieved on 16 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
However, according to [[ENCA]], "the two have turned their case on its head, challenging the government to legalise marijuana". They are suing seven government departments on the charges that they are upholding unlawful and unconstitutional laws. Cannabis is considered a Schedule 7 drug in South Africa, along with [[heroin]], [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]]; The Dagga Couple intend to challenge this and many other legal  aspects they consider "unjust and irrational, not supported by any empirical evidence and outdated".
In line with changing attitudes worldwide, they also believe cannabis does far less damage than [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]] and that it can be used for [[Medical cannabis|medicinal]] purposes.&lt;ref name=CITIZEN&gt;[https://citizen.co.za/news/1581689/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dagga-couple/ Everything you need to know about the ‘Dagga Couple’ ], [[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]].

Cannabis is illegal for recreational and medical use in South Africa though some advocates have been pressurising the government to modify its laws, which first restricted cannabis in 1922, to allow exemptions for medical use, religious practices, and other purposes.

Cannabis is thought to have been introduced to Africa by early Arab or Indian Hindu travelers, which [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] settlers subsequently introduced to southern Africa when they migrated southward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was already in popular use in South Africa by the indigenous&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/dagga-judgment-there-are-less-drastic-ways-to-deal-with-its-harmful-effects/|title=Dagga judgment: there are less drastic ways to deal with its harmful effects|last=de Vos|first=Pierre|date=2017-05-04|website=Constitutionally Speaking|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khoisan and Bantu peoples prior to European settlement in the Cape in 1652, and was traditionally used by [[Sotho people|Basotho]] to ease childbirth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2014-02-27-the-war-on-dagga-sobers-up|title=The war on dagga sobers up|last=Kings|first=Sipho|date=2014-02-28|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2017-05-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Hazel Crampton, old [[Afrikaner cuisine|Afrikaner recipes]] for teas and foods exist which make use of the plant.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/cannabis-sas-hidden-history-10-06-2011|title=Cannabis: SA's hidden history|last=King|first=Caroline|date=2011-05-10|work=Grocott's Mail|access-date=2017-05-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the plant was associated with traditional African populations and a lower economic status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toit1991"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdxAAAAMAAJ|title=Cannabis, alcohol, and the South African student: adolescent drug use, 1974-1985|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|year=1991|isbn=978-0-89680-166-0|author=Brian M.

By joining, anyone arrested for any cannabis related charge in South Africa will receive all the legal assistance necessary in order to obtain the stay of prosecution.

A '''demissionary cabinet''' (Dutch: "demissionair kabinet") is a type of [[caretaker government|caretaker]] [[cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]] in the [[politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. 

A demissionary cabinet continues the current government after a cabinet has ended. This can either be after completion of the full term, between general elections (when the new house of representatives is installed) and the formation of a new cabinet, or after a [[cabinet crisis]]. In both cases the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|prime minister]] hands in the resignation of his cabinet to the  [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Monarch]]. The Monarch will not accept full resignation until a new [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet has been formed]]. Between the moment in which the prime minister hands in the resignation and the monarch installs a new cabinet, the cabinet is labelled demissionary. As a demissionary cabinet is considered a continuation of the previous cabinet, it is not counted as a new cabinet (e.g. [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|Balkenende IV]] did not become Balkenende V when becoming demissionary). 

By constitutional convention, a demissionary cabinet has fewer powers than a conventional cabinet. The main aim of a demissionary cabinet is to organise elections and take care of ongoing business until the new cabinet comes into power. Thus, besides organising elections, it can only take care of urgent and pressing matters and not initiate controversial legislation. The [[States-General of the Netherlands|States General]] decide which affairs are urgent and pressing, and which are deemed controversial. It is a custom (which is not always followed) that the opinion of minority parties is taken into account for these decisions.

A demissionary cabinet takes care of policy during [[elections in the Netherlands|elections]] and [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]]. This is relevant as the formation process can take, in comparative terms, a very long time. An example of a very long-lasting caretaker government was the [[Netherlands cabinet Den Uyl|cabinet Den Uyl]] between 22 March and 18 December 1977, during the formation of the cabinet [[Netherlands cabinet Van Agt-1|Van Agt-I]]. 

In the case of the fall of a cabinet, there are several ways in which a cabinet can be a caretaker cabinet. 
# The complete cabinet stays on post until a new cabinet is formed (e.g. all the ministers of [[Netherlands cabinet Kok-2]] stayed on as a demissionary cabinet after the fall of the cabinet over Srebrenica).
# Part of the cabinet stays on post until a new cabinet is formed (example: only CDA and CU ministers of [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4]] stayed on as a demissionary cabinet after the resignation of the PvdA ministers over Uruzgan).
# An official minority cabinet (not having demissionary status) is formed after the breaking up of a cabinet. Such a minority caretaker cabinet has as primary task to organise elections. Yet it has much more authority in proposing new law and suggestion policy compared to a demissionary cabinet. The new cabinet is seen as a successor rather than the continuation of the fallen cabinet (example [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-3]] followed up on [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-2]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5905">The '''Direct and Counter-cyclical Payment Program''' (DCP) of the [[USDA]] provides payments to eligible producers on farms enrolled for the 2002 through 2007 crop years. There are two types of DCP payments – direct payments and counter-cyclical payments. Both are computed using the base acres and payment yields established for the farm.

DCP was authorized by the [[2002 Farm Bill]] and is administered by the [[Farm Service Agency]] (FSA).

*share in the risk of producing a crop on [[base acres]] on a farm enrolled in DCP, and be entitled to share in the crop available for marketing from the base acres or would have shared had a crop been produced; *annually report the use of the farm’s cropland acreage;
*comply with conservation and wetland protection requirements on all of their land;
*comply with planting flexibility requirements;
*use the [[base acre]]s for agricultural or related activities;
*and protect all base acres from erosion, including providing sufficient cover as determined necessary by the county FSA committee, and control weeds.

==Eligible Commodities==
Base acres and payment yields are established for the following
commodities: barley; corn; grain sorghum, including dual purpose varieties that can be
harvested as grain; oats; canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame
and sunflower, including oil and non-oil varieties; peanuts, beginning in 2003;
rice, excluding wild rice; soybeans; upland cotton; and
wheat.

==Direct Payments==
The 2002 Farm Bill replaced [[production flexibility contract]] (PFC) payments (which were established by the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996]]) with direct payments. 

Direct payments are not based on producers’ current production choices, but are tied to acreage bases and yields. Because direct payments provide no incentive to increase production of any certain crop, the payments support farm income without distorting producers’ current production decisions.

For the 2002-crop year only, producers’ final direct payments were reduced by the 2002 PFC payments
they had already received.

==Counter-cyclical Payments==
The Farm Bill added counter-cyclical payments, which provide support counter to the cycle of market prices as part of a “safety net” in the event of low crop prices. Counter-cyclical payments for a commodity are only issued if the effective price for a commodity is below the target price for the commodity.

The counter-cyclical payment rate is the amount by which the target price of each commodity exceeds its effective price. The effective price for each commodity equals the direct payment rate plus the higher of: the national average market price received by producers during the marketing year, or
the national loan rate for the commodity.

For each commodity, the [[countercyclical]] payment for each crop year equals 85 percent of the farm’s base acreage times the farm’s counter-cyclical payment yield times the counter-cyclical
payment rate.

Counter-cyclical payments are not available for other oilseeds because the sum of their national loan rate and direct payment rate is equal to or greater than their target price.

==Refund==
Producers must refund to FSA counter-cyclical payments that exceed the actual counter-cyclical
payment for each respective crop. This situation may occur when actual market prices exceed
the projected market prices used in determining the partial countercyclical payment rates.

==Base Acres==
Farm owners, or their designees, were provided a one-time opportunity to choose from five options in determining DCP base acres. “Base acres” means, with respect to a covered commodity on a farm, the number of acres of the crop established by the election of the owner or owners of the farm. The options in determining DCP base acres were: to use 2002 PFC acreage to establish DCP base acres; to use 2002 PFC acreage and add oilseed base history for the 1998-2001 crop years (three options were available
under this scenario that allowed fl exibility between oilseed base acres and other crop base acres); and
to calculate all base acres using the farm’s planted and approved prevented planted history from 1998-2001.

==Direct Payment Yields==

Direct payment yields for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice on a farm are the 2002 PFC payment yields for the applicable crops on the farm. Yields used to calculate direct payments cannot be updated; the yields must be those used for PFC.

For covered commodities without PFC program payment yields, FSA assigned a direct payment yield using the PFC yield of similar farms. The direct payment yield for oilseeds is calculated by multiplying the 1998 through 2001 average yield for the oilseed times the historic yield ratio for the oilseed.

==Counter-cyclical Payment Yields==
Farm owners, or their designees, who updated their base acres had a one-time opportunity to also partially update their counter-cyclical payment yields. using one of the following two methods:
*93.5 percent of the 1998-2001 average yield; or
*the direct payment yield (PFC yield) plus 70 percent of the difference between the 1998- 2001 average and the direct payment yield.

Farm owners had to use the same counter-cyclical payment yield method for all eligible commodities
on a farm. If farm owners did not choose to partially update their counter-cyclical payment
yields, then their established PFC payment yields are used to calculate counter-cyclical payments.

The '''medical effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima''' upon humans can be put into the four categories below, with the effects of larger [[thermonuclear weapon]]s producing blast and thermal effects so large that there would be a negligible number of survivors close enough to the center of the blast who would experience prompt/acute radiation effects, which were observed after the 16 [[kiloton]] yield Hiroshima bomb, due to its relatively low yield:&lt;ref name="remm.nlm.gov"&gt;http://www.remm.nlm.gov/RemmMockup_files/radiationlethality.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf page 3. see ''negligible''. Meaning that if you are close enough to get a harmful dose of radiation from a 1 megaton weapons, you are going to die from blast effects alone.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Initial stage—the first 1–9 weeks, in which are the greatest number of deaths, with 90% due to [[thermal]] injury and/or blast effects and 10% due to super-lethal [[radiation]] exposure.
*Intermediate stage—from 10–12 weeks. The deaths in this period are from [[ionizing radiation]] in the median lethal range - [[LD50]]
*Late period—lasting from 13–20 weeks. This period has some improvement in survivors' condition.
*Delayed period—from 20+ weeks. Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand [[Millisievert]]s of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders. Furthermore, ionizing radiation above a dose of around 50-100 [[Millisievert]] exposure has been shown to statistically begin increasing a person's chance of dying of cancer sometime in their lifetime over the normal unexposed rate of c. 25%, in the long term, a heightened rate of cancer, proportional to the dose received, would begin to be observed after c. 5+ years, with lesser problems such as eye [[cataract]]s and other more minor effects in other organs and tissue also being observed over the long term.

Depending on whether individuals further afield [[shelter in place]] or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind, and therefore avoid contact with the [[fallout]] plume, and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion, their exposure to fallout, and therefore their total dose, will vary. With those who do shelter in place, and or evacuate, experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal.&lt;ref&gt;7 hour rule: At 7 hours after detonation the fission product activity will have decreased to about 1/10 (10%) of its amount at 1 hour.
At about 2 days (49 hours-7X7) the activity will have decreased to 1% of the 1-hour value! http://www.falloutradiation.com/johnwayne7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf Nuclear Warfare chapter 9 see page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout [[isotope]], [[I-131]] decays away to 0.1% of its initial quantity after ten [[half-life|half-lives]] – which is represented by 80 days in the care of [[I-131]] case, would make the difference between likely contracting [[thyroid cancer]] or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scientists estimate that if there were a [[nuclear war]] resulting in 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities, it could cause significant loss of life in the tens of millions from long term climatic effects alone. The climatology hypothesis is that ''if'' each city [[firestorm]]s, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a [[nuclear winter]] scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, ''Scientific American'', June 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blast effects — the initial stage ==

===Immediate post-attack period===
[[Image:Nukemetal.jpg|thumb|Melted and fused pieces of metal (including coins that were in people's pockets) from the Atomic bombings of Japan. The melting of metal like this occurred during the ensuing fires and [[firestorms]], long after the bombs had exploded.]]

The main causes of death and disablement in this state are thermal burns and the failure of structures resulting from the blast effect. Injury from the pressure wave is minimal in contrast because the human body can survive up to 2 bar (30 psi) while most buildings can only withstand a 0.8 bar (12 psi) blast. Therefore, the fate of humans is closely related to the survival of the buildings around them.&lt;ref name = "Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Hugh. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 50-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate within certain peak overpressure===
* over 0.8 bar (12 psi) - 98% dead, 2% injured
* 0.3 - 0.8 bar (5-12 psi) - 50% dead, 40% injured, 10% safe
* 0.14 - 0.3 bar (2-5 psi) - 5% dead, 45% injured, 50% safe&lt;ref name = "Middleton"/&gt;

==Types of radioactive exposure after a nuclear attack==
 [[Image:The patient's skin is burned in a pattern corresponding to the dark portions of a kimono - NARA - 519686.jpg|thumb|Japanese woman (one of the [[Hiroshima Maidens]]) suffering burns from thermal radiation after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan.]]

In a nuclear explosion the human body can be irradiated by at least three processes. The first, and most major, cause of burns is due to [[thermal]] radiation and not caused by [[ionizing]] radiation.

* Thermal [[burn]]s from [[infrared]] heat radiation, these would be the most common burn type experienced by personnel.
* If people come in direct contact with [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]], [[beta burn]]s from shallow ionizing [[beta particle|beta radiation]] will be experienced, the largest particles (visible to the naked eye) in [[Nuclear fallout#Local|local fallout]] would be likely to have very high radioactivity because they would be deposited so soon after detonation; this fraction of the total fallout is called the prompt or local fallout fraction. It is likely that one such particle upon the skin would be able to cause a localized beta burn. This local fallout, termed ''Bikini snow'' after the Pacific island weapon tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23287814?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102598558117|title=Conservation and Heritage in the Face of Insular Urbanization: The Marshall Islands and Kiribati|first=Stephen A.|last=Royle|year=1999|work=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=25|number= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was experienced by the crew on the deck of the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]'' fishing ship following the explosion of the 15 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Shrimp'' device in the [[Castle Bravo]] event. However, these particular decay particles ([[beta particle]]s) are very weakly penetrating and have a short range, requiring almost direct contact between fallout and personnel to be harmful.
* Rarer still would be personnel who experience [[radiation burn]]s from highly penetrating [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. This would likely cause deep gamma penetration within the body, which would result in uniform whole body irradiation rather than only a surface burn. In cases of whole body gamma irradiation (c. 10 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]) due to accidents involving medical product irradiators, some of the human subjects have developed injuries to their skin between the time of irradiation and death.

In the picture above, the normal clothing (a [[kimono]]) that the woman was wearing attenuated the far reaching [[thermal radiation]]; the kimono, however, would  naturally have been unable to attenuate any [[gamma radiation]], if she were close enough to the weapon to have experienced any, and it would be likely that any such penetrating radiation effect would be evenly applied to her entire body. [[Beta burn]]s would likely be all over the body if there was contact with fallout after the explosion, unlike thermal burns, which are only ever on one side of the body, as heat radiation [[infrared]] naturally does not penetrate the human body. In addition, the pattern on her clothing has been burnt into the skin by the thermal radiation. This is because white fabric reflects more visible and [[infrared]] light than dark fabric. As a result, the skin underneath dark fabric is burned more than the skin covered by white clothing.

There is also the risk of internal radiation poisoning by ingestion of fallout particles, if one is in a fallout zone.

==Radiation poisoning==
{{main|acute radiation syndrome}}
'''Radiation poisoning''', also called "'''radiation sickness'''" or a "'''creeping dose'''", is a form of damage to organ tissue due to excessive exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of [[radiation]] in a short period, though this also has occurred with long-term exposure to low-level radiation. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning occur as ionizing radiation interferes with cell division. There are numerous lethal radiation syndromes, including [[prodromal]] syndrome, [[bone marrow]] death, [[central nervous system]] death and [[gastrointestinal]] death.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"&gt;Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prodromal syndrome ===
The “prodromal syndrome” is not a diagnosis, but the technical term used by mental health professionals to describe a specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset of an illness. For example, a fever is “prodromal” to measles, which means that a fever may be a risk factor for developing this illness.

=== Bone marrow death ===
[[Bone marrow]] death is caused by a dose of radiation between 2 and 10 Gray and is characterized by the part of the bone marrow that makes the blood being broken down. Therefore, production of [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cells]] and platelets is stopped due to loss of the blood-making [[stem cells]] (4.5 Gray kills 95% of stem cells). The loss of [[platelet]]s greatly increases the chance of fatal [[hemorrhage]], while the lack of white blood cells causes infections; the fall in red blood cells is minimal, and only causes mild [[anemia]].&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The exposure to 4.5 Gray of penetrating gamma rays has many effects that occur at different times:

In 24 hours:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*[[vomiting]]
*[[diarrhea]]
These will usually abate after 6–7 days.

Within 3–4 weeks there is a period of extreme illness.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*severe bloody diarrhea, indicating intestinal disorders causing fluid imbalance
*extensive [[internal bleeding]]
*[[septicemia]] infections

The peak incidence of acute BM death corresponds to the 30-day nadir in blood cell numbers. The number of deaths then falls progressively until it reaches 0 at 60 days after irradiation. The amount of radiation greatly affects the probability of death. For example, over the range of 2 to 6 Gray the probability of death in untreated adults goes from about 1% to 99%, but these figures are for healthy adults. Therefore, results may differ, because of the thermal and mechanical injuries and infectious conditions.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal death ===
Gastrointestinal death is caused by a dose of radiation between 10 and 50 Gray. Whole body doses cause damage to [[epithelial cells]] lining the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe, causing exhaustion and [[emaciation]] in a few days and death within 7–14 days from loss of water and electrolytes.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The symptoms of gastrointestinal death are:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*gastrointestinal pain
*anorexia
*nausea
*vomiting
*diarrhea

=== Central nervous system death ===
[[Central nervous system]] death is the main cause of death in 24–48 hours among those exposed to 50 Gray.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

The symptoms are:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*vomiting
*nausea
*diarrhea
*[[drowsiness]]
*[[lethargy]]
*tremors
*[[delirium]]
*frequent [[seizure]]s
*[[convulsions]]
*[[hyperthermia|heat prostration]]
*[[coma]]
*[[respiratory failure]]
*[[death]]

== Short-term effects (6–8 weeks) ==

=== Skin ===
The [[Human skin|skin]] is susceptible to beta-emitting radioactive fallout. The principal site of damage is the [[germinal layer]], and often the initial response is [[erythema]] (reddening) due to [[blood vessel]]s congestion and [[edema]]. Erythema lasting more than 10 days occurs in 50% of people exposed to 5-6 Gray.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

Other effects with exposure include:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2–3 Gray—temporary [[hair loss]]
*7 Gray—permanent [[epilation]] occurs
*10 Gray—itching and flaking occurs
*10–20 Gray—weeping [[blister]]ing and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation will occur

=== Lungs ===
The [[lung]]s are the most radiosensitive organ, and [[radiation pneumonitis]] can occur leading to [[pulmonary insufficiency]] and death (100% after exposure to 50 Gray of radiation), in a few months.

Radiation [[pneumonitis]] is characterized by:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*Loss of epithelial cells
*[[Edema]]
*[[Inflammation]]
*Occlusions of airways, air sacs and blood vessels
*[[Fibrosis]]

=== Ovaries ===
A single dose of 1–2 Gray will cause temporary damage and suppress [[menstruation]] for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

=== Testicles===
A dose of 0.1 Gray will cause low sperm counts for up to a year; 2.5 Gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

==Long-term effects==

===Cataract induction===
The timespan for developing this symptom ranges from 6 months to 30 years to develop but the median time for developing them is 2–3 years.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2 Gray of gamma rays cause opacities in a few percent
*6-7 Gray can seriously impair vision and cause [[cataracts]]

===Cancer induction===
[[Cancer]] induction is the most significant long-term risk of exposure to a nuclear bomb. Approximately 1 out of every 80 people exposed to 1 Gray will die from cancer, in addition to the normal rate of 20 out of 80. About 1 in 40 people will get cancer, in addition to the typical rates of 16-20 out of 40. Different types of cancer take different times for them to appear:&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;
*2 years for [[leukemia]] to appear
*20 or more years for [[skin cancer]] or [[lung cancer]]

===''In utero'' effects on human development===
A 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] dose of radiation will cause between 0 and 20 extra cases of [[perinatal mortality]], per 1,000 births and 0-20 cases per 1000 births of severe mental sub-normality. A 0.05&amp;nbsp;Gy dose will increase death due to cancer 10 fold, from the normal 0.5 per 1000 birth rate to a rate of 5 per 1,000.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} An antenatal dose of 1&amp;nbsp;Gy in the first trimester causes the lifetime risk of fatal cancer sometime in the child's life to increase from c. 25% in non-exposed humans to 100% in the first trimester after exposure.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;

===Transgenerational genetic damage===
Exposure to even relatively low doses of radiation generates genetic damage in the progeny of irradiated rodents. This damage can accumulate over several generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Long-term development of the radionuclide exposure of murine rodent populations in Belarus after the Chernobyl accident|date=25 March 2013 |pmid=16215755 | doi=10.1007/s00411-005-0015-2 |volume=44 |issue=3 |vauthors=Ryabokon NI, Smolich II, Kudryashov VP, Goncharova RI |journal=Radiat Environ Biophys |pages=169–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious diseases resulting from nuclear attack===
It was assumed in the 1983 book ''Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War'' that, although not caused by radiation, one of the long-term effects of a nuclear war would be a massive increase in [[infectious disease]]s caused by [[fecal matter]] contaminated water from untreated [[sewage]], crowded living conditions, poor standard of living, and lack of [[vaccine]]s in the aftermath of a [[nuclear war]], with the following list of diseases being cited:&lt;ref name = "Middleton"/&gt;
*[[Dysentery]]
*[[Typhoid]]
*[[Infectious hepatitis]]
*[[Salmonellosis]]
*[[Cholera]]
*[[Meningococcal meningitis]]
*[[Tuberculosis]]
*[[Diphtheria]]
*[[Whooping cough]]
*[[Polio]]
*[[Pneumonia]]

However although what the authors describe are conditions already prevalent in many of the world's city [[slum]]s, it is inconceivable why people would try to remain living in crowded conditions by reverting to [[slum]] lifestyles, during or after a nuclear war. As many cities would already be destroyed, with [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slum]] or otherwise, this would serve no benefit to inhabitants.

There would be billions of disease carrying [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], in the form of city residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact122.html |title=Cities and Emerging or Re-emergging Diseases |publisher=Apps.who.int |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}{{Dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; lying deceased in cities caused by the direct nuclear weapons effects alone, with the surviving few billion people spread out in rural communities living agrarian lifestyles, with the survivors therefore posing a way of living far less prone to creating the crowded [[slum]] living conditions required for infectious diseases to spread. Moreover, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is also one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2496928 | pmid=18828410 | volume=123 | title=Disaster mythology and fact: Hurricane Katrina and social attachment | author=Jacob B, Mawson AR, Payton M, Guignard JC | journal=Public Health Rep | pages=555–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publichealthreports.org/issueopen.cfm?articleID=2091&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|[[Epidemic]]s seldom occur after a disaster, and dead bodies do not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of [[infectious disease]]s. Intuitively, epidemic diseases, illnesses, and injuries might be expected following major disasters. However, as noted by de Goyet, epidemics seldom occur after disasters, and unless deaths are caused by one of a small number of infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhus, or plague, exposure to dead bodies does not cause disease ... [[Cholera]] and [[typhoid]] seldom pose a major health threat after disasters unless they are already endemic.}}

'''Encounter Books''' is an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] book publisher. It draws its name from [[Encounter (magazine)|''Encounter'']], the now defunct literary magazine founded by [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Stephen Spender]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=689 ''FrontPage Magazine''] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/right-books-and-big-ideas# "The Right Books and Big Ideas"]; ''The Nation;'' 22 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounter Books publishes non-fiction books in the areas of politics, history, religion, biography, education, public policy, current affairs and social sciences.

==History==
Encounter Books was founded in 1998 in San Francisco by the [[Bradley Foundation]], with [[Peter Collier (political author)|Peter Collier]] as editor.&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/1998/05/04/daily17.html "Bradley Foundation Starts Book Publisher"]; ''Milwaukee Business Journals;'' May 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Collier retired in late-2005. Encounter Books was taken over by the commentator [[Roger Kimball]], who is also co-editor and publisher of ''[[The New Criterion]]'' magazine. In early 2006, Kimball relocated Encounter Books to New York City.

==Commercial appeal==
Several of its titles have sold sufficiently to appear on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Best Seller List, including ''[[Black Rednecks and White Liberals]]'' by [[Thomas Sowell]], ''[[Climate Confusion]]'' by [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy W. Spencer]], ''[[Willful Blindness]]'' by [[Andrew C. McCarthy]], and ''[[The Grand Jihad]]'', also by McCarthy.

==Encounter Broadsides==
In October 2009, Encounter launched a series of short polemical booklets in what it said was the spirit of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense]].'' These are called Encounter Broadsides. The series publishes well-known commentators on topical political issues from health care and immigration to the Guantanamo Bay internment camp. Published Broadside authors include [[John R. Bolton]], Victor Davis Hanson, John Fund, [[Michael Ledeen]], Andrew C. McCarthy, [[Betsy McCaughey]], Stephen Moore, and [[Michael B. Mukasey]].

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reported that the series would be "crashed", meaning produced and marketed on an aggressive turnaround schedule.&lt;ref name = "PW"&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Publishers weekly | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/18170-encounter-s-new-imprint-crashes-short-books-.html | title = Encounter's new imprint crashes short books}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Roger Kimball said of the series:

{{quote|[T]he imprint will serve as "a new—or rather, a revival of an old—genre that is supple enough to respond quickly to unfolding events and yet authoritative enough to have an important effect on the debate over policy."&lt;ref name = "PW" /&gt;}}

==Review policies==
In June 2009, Encounter announced that it was no longer sending its books to ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. At the time publisher [[Roger Kimball]] complained that the ''New York Times'' was politicized and superficial in its cultural coverage. He said his books could not expect positive reviews from the ''Times'' and said they could gain "impetus" from "the pluralistic universe of talk radio and the 'blogosphere'." He said Encounter could have its books make the ''Times'''s bestseller list without needing a review from the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/164878/encounter-books-says-goodbye-inew-york-timesi-we-hardly-knew-ye-andrew-c-McCarthy Andrew McCarthy, "Encounter Books Says Goodbye New York Times"]; ''National Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary, Queen of Scots arms, South Leith Parish Church.JPG|thumb|280px|upright|The royal arms of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] incorporated into the [[Tolbooth]] in [[Leith]] (1565) and now in [[South Leith Parish Church]]]]
'''Government in early modern Scotland''' included all forms of administration, from the [[List of Scottish monarchs|crown]], through national institutions, to systems of [[Local government of Scotland|local government]] and the [[Scots law|law]], between the [[Early Modern Scotland|early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century]]. It roughly corresponds to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern era in Europe]], beginning with the [[Renaissance Scotland|Renaissance]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the last [[Jacobite risings]] and the beginnings of the [[industrial revolution]]. Monarchs of this period were the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]]: [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], [[James V of Scotland|James V]], [[Mary Queen of Scots]], [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], [[James VII of Scotland|James VII]], [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], and the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]]: [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George II of Great Britain|George II]].

The crown remained the most important element of government throughout the period and, despite the many royal minorities, it saw many of the aspects of aggrandisement associated with "[[new monarchy]]" elsewhere in Europe. Theories of [[limited monarchy]] and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly [[George Buchanan]], in the sixteenth century, but [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] advanced the theory of the [[divine right of kings]], and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the sixteenth century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage. The [[Privy council of Scotland|Privy Council]] and the great offices of state, remained central to the administration of the government, even after the departure of the Stuart monarchs to rule in England from 1603, but they were often sidelined and was abolished after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], with rule direct from London. [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and never achieved the centrality the national life of its counterpart in England before it was disbanded in 1707.

Revenue remained a continual problem for Scottish government, even after the introduction of regular taxation from the 1580s, with receipts insufficient for the business of government and, after 1603, much of the costs being paid out of English revenues. In local government, attempts were made increase its effectiveness, with the creation of [[Justices of Peace]] and [[Commissioners of Supply]]. The continued existence of [[Court baron|courts baron]] and introduction of [[kirk session]]s helped consolidate the power of local [[laird]]s. In law there was an expansion of central institutions and professionalisation of lawyers as a group. Scottish law was maintained as a separate system after the union in 1707 and from 1747 the central courts gained a clear authority over local institutions.

==Crown==
[[File:George Buchanan by Arnold van Brounckhorst.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[George Buchanan]] (1506–82), one of the major thinkers of the era on resistance to monarchy]]
[[James V of Scotland|James V]] was the first Scottish monarch to wear the closed [[imperial crown]], in place of the open [[circlet]] of medieval kings, suggesting a claim to absolute authority within the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p188/&gt; His diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532, which were re-added when it was reconstructed in 1540 in what remains the [[Crown of Scotland]]. The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force, defending national borders and interests, royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p188&gt;A. Thomas, "The Renaissance", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-162433-0}}, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; New monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on "[[new men]]" rather than the great magnates, the use of the clergy as a form of civil service, developing [[standing army|standing armed forces]] and a [[Royal Scottish Navy|navy]].&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jGYDyP0xkFcC&amp;pg=PT150&amp;dq=renaissance+scotland+monarchy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=-D2dT_iHIaPN0QXwrJDlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEcQ6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20scotland%20monarchy&amp;f=false ''A History of Scotland''] (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0-14-013649-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major intellectual figures in the Reformation included [[George Buchanan]] (1506–82), whose works ''De Jure Regni apud Scotos'' (1579) and ''Rerum Scoticarum Historia'' (1582) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p200/&gt; Buchanan was one of the young [[James VI and I|James VI's]] tutors and although they succeeded in producing a highly educated Protestant prince, who would publish works on subjects including government, poetry and witchcraft, they failed to intellectually convince him of their ideas about limited monarchy and he would debate with Buchanan and others over the status of the crown and kirk.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp200-2&gt;Thomas, "The Renaissance", pp.&amp;nbsp;200–2.&lt;/ref&gt; James asserted the concept of "[[Divine right of kings|Divine right]]", by which a king was appointed by God and thus gained a degree of sanctity. These ideas he passed on to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], whose ability to compromise may have been undermined by them, helping to lead to his political difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;C. Carlton. ''Charles I: The Personal Monarch'' (London: Routledge, 1995), {{ISBN|0-415-12141-8}}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was executed in 1649, the Scottish [[Covenanter]]s objected, but avoided advancing the sanctity of kings as a reason.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0-415-27880-5}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1689, when the Scottish Estates had to find a justification for deposing [[James II of England|James VII]] they turned to Buchanan's argument on the contractual nature of monarchy in the [[Claim of Right]].&lt;ref name="lynch92"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court==
{{Main|Royal Court of Scotland}}
[[File:Restored ceiling of the King's Chamber, Stirling Castle.jpg|thumb|left|The Stirling Heads, carved roundels on the roof of the King's Chamber in [[Stirling Castle]], include many members of the court of James V]]
The [[Court (royal)|royal court]] consisted of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was the monarch and members of the [[Privy Chamber]]. [[Gentleman of the chamber]] were usually leading nobles or individuals with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had direct access to the monarch, with the implication of being to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p88-9&gt;J. Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-19-924354-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, the monarch and the court were often itinerant, spending time at one of the royal palaces, such as Linlithgow, Sterling and Falkland, or undertaking a royal progress to a part of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p141/&gt;

In the sixteenth century, the court was central to the patronage and dissemination of [[Renaissance]] works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of [[chivalry]], which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. [[Tournament (medieval)|Tournaments]] provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court, with [[Ball (dance)|balls]], [[masque]]s and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp192-3&gt;Thomas, "The Renaissance", pp.&amp;nbsp;192–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p200&gt;Thomas, "The Renaissance", p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p12&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|0-7486-0233-X}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Officers of state==
{{See also|Great officers of state}}
[[File:MaryQueenofScotsSeal.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[Great Seal of Scotland|Great Seal]] of Mary Queen of Scots (1542–67)]]
The [[Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]] was effectively the first minister of the kingdom. His department, the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], was responsible for the [[Great Seal of Scotland|Great Seal]], which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004pp150-1&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p151&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treasurer of Scotland|Treasurer]] was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p152&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lord President of the Court of Session]], often known simply as the Lord President, acted as a link between the Privy Council and the Court.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p160&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Advocate|king's advocate]] acted as the legal council. The post emerged in the 1490s to deal with the king's patrimonial land rights and from 1555 there were usually two king's councillors, indicating the increase in the level of work. From 1579 they increasingly became a public prosecutor.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p164&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; After the union most of the offices remained, but political power was increasingly centred in London. [[John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe]], became the first [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] until the post was abolished in 1746 after the Jacobite Rising of 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp.&amp;nbsp;282–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privy council==
{{Main|Privy Council of Scotland}}
[[File:Holyrood Palace 1544.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from the so-called 'Hertford sketch' of Edinburgh in 1544, showing [[Holyrood Palace]], described as 'the kyng of Skotts palas']]
The Privy Council developed out of the theoretically larger king's or queen's council of leading nobles and office holders in the sixteenth century. "Secret Councils" had been maintained during the many regencies of the later medieval era, but the origins of the Privy Council were in 1543, during the minority of Mary, Queen of Scots. After her majority it was not disbanded, but continued to sit and became an accepted part of government.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004pp35&amp;130&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', pp. 35 and 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1707, while in session in Edinburgh, the Privy Council met in what is now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Glendinning, Aonghus MacKechnie, Richard D. Oram, ''The Architecture of Scottish Government: from Kingship to Parliamentary Democracy'' (Dundee: Dundee University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|1-84586-000-4}}, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; When the monarch was at one of the royal palaces or visiting a region of the kingdom on official business, the council would normally go with them and as a result of being away from its servants, records and members, its output tended to decrease. While the monarch was away on a holiday or hunting trip, the council usually stayed in session in Edinburgh and continued to run the government.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2004p141&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council's primary function was judicial, but it also acted as a body of advisers to the king and as a result its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy.&lt;ref name=McCoy1974pp1-2/&gt; Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p15&gt;Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London.&lt;ref name=McCoy1974pp1-2/&gt; Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state.&lt;ref&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1610 the council was presided over by the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Lord Chancellor]], but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence,&lt;ref name="Goodacre2004p141" /&gt; and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliament==
{{Main|Parliament of Scotland}}
[[File:St. Giles and Parliament House c.1647.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], built by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to house the [[Parliament of Scotland]], pictured c. 1647]]
In the sixteenth century, parliament usually met in [[Stirling Castle]] or the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh]], which was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561. King Charles I ordered the construction of [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament Hall]], at the expense of the Edinburgh burgesses, which was built between 1633 and 1639 and remained the parliament's home until it was dissolved in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Mason, ''Scots and Britons: Scottish Political Thought and the Union of 1603'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-521-02620-2}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, ''The History of the Scottish Parliament volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235–1560'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7486-1485-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The attendance of [[knight]]s and [[Fee simple|freeholders]] had become important, and [[burgh]] commissioners joined them to form the [[Three Estates]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan R. MacDonald, ''The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c. 1550–1651'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5328-5}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Brown, ''Parliament and Politics in Scotland, 1235–1560'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7486-1485-0}}, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, [[ecclesiastical]], social or economic.&lt;ref name=Tanner2000/&gt; Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the [[Lords of the Articles]], chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Tanner2000&gt;R. J. Tanner, 'The Lords of the Articles before 1540', ''Scottish Historical Review'', 79 (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;189–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p21"&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown was also able to call a [[Convention of Estates]], which was quicker to assemble and could issue laws like parliament, making them invaluable in a crisis, but they could only deal with a specific issue&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p15/&gt; and were more resistant to the giving of taxation rights to the crown.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p157"/&gt;

Parliament played a major part in the Reformation crisis of the mid-sixteenth century. It had been used by James V to uphold Catholic orthodoxy&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p22"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted its right to determine the nature of religion in the country, disregarding royal authority in 1560. The 1560 parliament included 100 [[lairds]], who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of [[Feu (land tenure)|feuars]], who would not gain these rights until 1661.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p157"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as 'abbots' and 'priors'. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567, but a small number of Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate. James VI attempted to revive the role of the bishops from about 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Goodacre, ''The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; They were abolished by the Covenanters in 1638, when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Macinnes, ''Union and Empire: The Making of the United Kingdom in 1707, Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-521-85079-7}}, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; A further group appeared in the Parliament from the minority of James IV in the 1560s, with members of the Privy Council representing the king's interests, until they were excluded in 1641.&lt;ref name=McCoy1974pp1-2&gt;F. N.

He controlled the committee by filling it with royal officers as non-elected members, but was forced to limit this to eight from 1617.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p158"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been officially suspended at the end of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1661. This parliament, known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp.&amp;nbsp;231–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. [[James II of England|James VII]]'s parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689 William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the ''Claim of Right'', which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life, but it never reached the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined [[Parliament of Great Britain]], but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation and revenue==
For the early part of the era, the authority of the crown was limited by the large number of minorities it had seen since the early fifteenth century, with every monarch coming to the throne as a minor between 1406 and 1625. This tended to decrease the level of royal revenues, as regents, lacking the royal authority to create support, often [[alienated land]] and revenues, with Margaret Tudor reducing royal income from about £30,000 Scots to £13,000 in the minority of James V.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; James V was able to extract the heaviest taxation every levied on the Scottish church in exchange for his continued loyalty to the papacy, taking £72,000 in four years.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mason, "Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century", in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Regular taxation was adopted from 1581 and afterwards was called on with increasing frequency and scale until a demand of £240,000 in 1612 resulted in serious opposition. A new tax on annual rents amounting to five per cent on all interest on loans, mainly directed at the merchants of the burghs was introduced in 1621, but the 1621 levy was still being collected over a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Charles I the annual income from all sources in Scotland was under £16,000 sterling and inadequate for the normal costs of government, with the court in London now being financed out of English revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of £10,000 a month from the county assessment was demanded by the Cromwellian regime, which Scotland failed to fully supply, but it did contribute £35,000 in excise a year. Although Parliament made a formal grant of £40,000 a year to Charles II, the rising costs of civilian government and war meant that this was inadequate to support Scottish government.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Under William I and after the Union, engagement in continental and colonial wars led to heavier existing taxes and new taxes, including the [[Tax per head#England and Scotland|Poll]] and [[Hearth Tax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 123 and 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==

From the sixteenth century, the central government became increasingly involved in local affairs. The [[feud]] was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of [[Justices of the Peace]] on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp162-3&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp.&amp;nbsp;162–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English, set up in 1587.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp162-3/&gt; James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts of the region and forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the ''Statues of Iona'' of 1609.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp164-5&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp.&amp;nbsp;164–5.&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667 [[Commissioners of Supply]] were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the [[cess]] land tax.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-521-89167-1}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish also became an important unit of local government after three major pieces of legislation, in 1574, 1579 and 1592, established what would become known as "[[Old Scottish Poor Law|the Old Poor Law]]".&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp166-8&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;166–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressured by Justices, the parish became responsible for taking care of the destitute in periods of famine, to prevent the impoverished from taking to the roads and causing general disorder.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p144&gt;Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.&lt;ref name=Grell&amp;Cunninghamp1997p223&gt;O. P. Grell and A. Cunningham, ''Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe, 1500–1700'' (London: Routledge, 1997), {{ISBN|0-415-12130-2}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was able to cope with the general level of poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in major subsistence crisis like that of the "[[seven ill years]]" of the 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'', pp. 127 and 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour could be regulated through kirk [[Session (Presbyterian)|sessions]], composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p144/&gt; The local [[court baron]] remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held at the behest of the local baron when there was a backlog of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues. The combination of kirk sessions and courts baron gave considerable power to local lairds to control the behaviour of the populations of their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'', pp.&amp;nbsp;80–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
{{Main|History of Scots law}}
[[File:Great Window in Parliament Hall, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|Institution of the [[Court of Session]] by [[James V of Scotland|James V]] in 1532, from the Great Window in Parliament Hall, Edinburgh]]
In the late Middle Ages, justice in Scotland was a mixture of the royal and local, which was often unsystematic with overlapping jurisdictions, undertaken by clerical lawyers, laymen, amateurs and local leaders.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp24-55&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Under James IV the legal functions of the council were rationalised, with a royal [[Court of Session]] meeting daily in Edinburgh to deal with civil cases. In 1514 the office of justice-general was created for the earl of Argyll (and held by his family until 1628). The study of law was popular in Scotland from the Middle Ages and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Reid and R. Zimmerman, ''A History of Private Law in Scotland: I. Introduction and Property'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-19-829941-9}}, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1532 the Royal [[College of Justice]] was founded, leading to the training and professionalisation of an emerging group of career lawyers. The Court of Session placed increasing emphasis on its independence from influence, including from the king, and superior jurisdiction over local justice. Its judges were increasingly able to control entry to their own ranks.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp24-55/&gt; In 1605 the professionalisation of the bench led to entry requirements in Latin, law and a property qualification of £2,000, designed to limit the danger of bribery, helping to create an exclusive, wealthy, powerful and professional caste, who also now dominated government posts in a way that the clergy had done in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp154-5&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp.&amp;nbsp;154–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1672 the [[High Court of Justiciary]] was founded from the College of Justice as a supreme court of appeal. The Act of Union in 1707 largely persevered the distinct Scottish legal system and its courts, separate from English jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Kilday, ''Women and Violent Crime in Enlightenment Scotland'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2007), {{ISBN|0-86193-287-0}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The major reform to Scottish law came as a result of the [[Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746|Heritable Jurisdictions Act 1747]], which was part of the government reaction to the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] and which limited the powers of burgh courts, abolished hereditary offices and made the [[Court baron|barony]] and [[regality]] courts obsolete, strengthening the reach of the central judicial courts.&lt;ref&gt;Kilday, ''Women and Violent Crime in Enlightenment Scotland'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw widespread attempts to codify and comment on the Scottish legal system. The first substantive account of Scottish law was the ''Practicks'' of Bishop [[John Sinclair (bishop)|John Sinclair]] (d. 1566), senator of the College of Justice. This was followed by [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|James Balfour]]'s (c. 1525–83) ''Practicks'', who with Sir [[John Skene, Lord Curriehill|John Skene]] of Curriehill (c. 1543–1617), was a major figure in the move to codification. Skene produced an edition of the Acts of Parliament and a legal dictionary, ''De Verborum Significatione'' and edited ''Regiam Maisestatem'', a history of the Scottish law, which attributed much of its creation to [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. [[Thomas Craig (poet)|Thomas Craig]] of Riccarton (c. 1538–1608) produced two large works, ''Jus Feudale'', which examined feudal law, and ''De Unione Regnorum Britanniae'', which explored the possibilities of unifying the English and Scottish legal systems. Often seen as the beginning of modern Scottish legal study is [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair]]'s (1619–95) ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).&lt;ref name=Wormald1991p178&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="869">A '''headquarters unit''' is a specialised [[military unit]] formed around the [[headquarters]] of a  [[commanding officer]] and the requirements of that position. As such, a headquarters unit is always a component of a larger unit.

Examples include:
* headquarters [[regiment]], which usually controls a brigade, division or larger unit;
* headquarters [[battalion]]  (controlling a regiment, brigade or larger unit);
* headquarters [[company (military unit)]] (controlling a battalion);
* headquarters [[platoon]] (controlling a company)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4832">'''Hugh Brock''' (1914 - 1985) was a lifelong British pacifist, editor of ''[[Peace News]]'' between 1955 and 1964, a promoter of nonviolent direct action and a founder of the [[Direct Action Committee]], a forerunner of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]].

Hugh Brock was a [[conscientious objector]] in World War II. In May 1940, in the face of new defence regulations and demands in parliament for the banning of ''Peace News'', its printer refused to continue printing it and, at the same time, the Wholesale Newsagent Association, which handled two-thirds of the circulation, refused to distribute it any longer. Alternative printing arrangements were made by the editor, [[Humphrey Moore]], and Hugh and his brother, Ashley, (A H Brock) agreed to ignore any potential threat under the regulations and, with peace groups across Britain, created an efficient voluntary distribution chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2395/pn239525.htm|title= Harry Mister “Humphrey Moore 1909-1995”|website=peacenews.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brock took on the role of assistant editor of ''Peace News'' in 1946 and became editor in 1955. He shifted the focus of Peace News towards campaigning for nuclear disarmament, nonviolent direct action and the movement for colonial freedom. In 1955 he appointed the American academic [[Gene Sharp]] to Peace News to cover the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/archives-of-peace-news/|title=Archives of Peace News  - University of Bradford|website=www.bradford.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the newspaper was the official organ of the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU) but this formal link was broken in 1961. He left ''Peace News'' in 1964.&lt;ref name="brad.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/cwlhbp.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1946 and 1952 ''Peace News'' published more than 160 articles dedicated to the discussion of Gandhi's relevance to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Scalmer                
”Globalising Gandhi: Translation, Reinvention, Application, Transformation” Borderlands Vol 4 No 3, [http://www.borderlands.net.au/issues/vol4no3.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s Hugh Brock played a significant role in the growth of nonviolent protest in Britain. In November 1949 the PPU had set up a Nonviolence Commission to study nonviolent resistance and the ideas of [[Gandhi]]. In December 1951 some members formed '[[Operation Gandhi]]' to organise nonviolent direct action directly inspired by Gandhi. Among their aims were the withdrawal of US troops from Britain and an end to Britain's production of [[Nuclear Weapon|atomic weapons]]. Brock was secretary of this group. Its activities began with a sit-down outside the [[War Office]] on 11 January 1952. Eleven protesters squatted in front of the War Office, having first notified the police. The protesters did not resist arrest and pleaded guilty to the charges against them, following principles of nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Scalmer op cit, quoting ''Peace News''&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other protests at Aldermaston, [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]], [[Porton Down]] and the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell. The protest march to Aldermaston in 1952 involved just 35 people and paved the way for the much larger [[Aldermaston Marches]] that began in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Hugh, "Marching to Aldermaston - ten years ago!", Sanity, Good Friday, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Hugh Brock was one of a committee that arranged protests against British testing of the H-bomb on [[Christmas Island]] in the [[Pacific]]. The committee later became the [[Direct Action Committee]], which organised the 1958 Aldermaston March. With the formation in 1960 of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which organised civil disobedience against nuclear weapons on a larger scale, the Direct Action Committee merged into the new organisation.

After leaving ''Peace News'' Brock continued to be involved with peace campaigning until his death in 1985. He kept a large number of papers, which were donated to the [[University of Bradford]] by his wife Eileen.&lt;ref name="brad.ac.uk"/&gt;

The Hugh Brock Memorial Library, [[Kitwe]] [[Zambia]], was established in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2434/index.php|title=Peace News #2434 February 1999 |website=peacenews.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35652">'''Human resource management in public administration''' concerns [[human resource management]] as it applies specifically to the field of [[public administration]]. It is considered to be an in-house structure that ensures unbiased treatment, ethical standards, and promotes a value-based system.

==Function==
The function of human resources management is to provide the employees with the capability to manage: healthcare, record keeping, promotion and advancement, benefits, compensation, etc.  The function, in terms of the employers benefit, is to create a management system to achieve long-term goals and plans.  The management allows companies to study, target, and execute long-term employment goals. For any company to have an efficient ability to grow and advance human resource management is a key.

Human resources are designed to manage the following:

*Employee Benefits: include various types of non-wage compensation provided to '''employees''' in addition to their normal wages or salaries.
*Employee health care: the identification of recognition of a disease by a physician/ physician's assistant/nurse practitioner. 
*Compensation: something, typically money, awarded to someone as a recompense for loss, injury, or suffering.
*Annual, sick, and personal leave: excused (and generally unpaid) leave for unexpected (such as accident or sickness) or expected (anniversaries, birthdays, marriage) events important to the individual. 
*Sick banks: a fund accumulated to pay off a corporate or public debt 
*Discipline: the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience.
*Records (tax information, personnel files, etc.):also known as '''records''' and information '''management''' or RIM, is the professional practice of '''managing''' the '''records''' of an organization throughout their life cycle, from the time they are created to their eventual disposal.
*Recruitment and employee retention strategies:refers to the ability of an organization to retain its '''employees'''
* Salary and Wages Administrations : process of compensating an organization's employees in accordance with accepted policy and procedures

Historically, when a new president came into power, political leaders would appoint their supporters to political offices in thanks for the campaign assistance.  This became known as the [[spoils system]] and became popular in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]].  In his first address to Congress, Jackson defended the system; he believed that public offices should be rotated among supporters to help the nation achieve its ideals.  Jackson maintained that to perform well in public office, did not require special intelligence or training and rotating the office would ensure that the government did not develop corrupt civil servants.  The system was viewed as a reward to supporters of the party and a way to build a stronger government.  During the first 18 months of Jackson's presidency he replaced fewer than 1,000 of the 10,000 civil servants due to politics, and fewer than 20 percent of officeholders were removed.  Many of the men Jackson appointed to offices came from backgrounds of wealth and high social status.  The system continued after Jackson's presidency and opposition against the system began to grow.  During the presidency of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] corruption and inefficiency began to reach staggering proportion.  This led to a larger outcry against the system and helped bring about change in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoogenboom, Ari Arthur]].

'''[[George H. Pendleton]]''': Senator from Ohio sponsored the Civil Service Reform Act in 1883, which sought to implement a merit-based program in the federal government.  Its principal tenets include:

* Hiring employees by merit
* Receiving pay according to position, not personal characteristics
* Protection from political interference and dismissal via regime changes
* Government workers have an obligation to accountability (transparency)

'''[[Chester Barnard]]''': taught an organization was the cooperation of human activity and to survive an organization needed to have efficiency and effectiveness.  His definition of effectiveness: being able to accomplish the goals that were set and efficiency – if the goals are reached by the individuals of the organization then cooperation among them will continue.

'''Paul C. Light''': discusses the Shadow Government and how it is used to make the Federal government appear smaller, even as the Federal government grows.  The Shadow Government is made up of those entities that produce goods or services for the government under contracts, grants, or mandates.

'''[[Volcker Commission]]''':  also known as the National Commission on Public Service was established in 1989, to rebuild the federal civil service.  The commission was established by the United States Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul A. Volcker.  The main concern of the commission was morale because it was beginning to fall as were recruitment and retention among civil service employees and would soon become a crisis.  This possible crisis was believed to be hindering the ability of the government to function effectively as the demand on the government began to grow.

'''The commission identified three main threats''':

Public attitudes and political leadership: the public did not trust or respect the government and the leaders. This also included federal agencies.

Internal management systems:  the federal agencies were losing experienced personnel due to problems with the leadership in the federal agencies.  Mid-level workers were leaving the departments and entry level recruits were rethinking the commitments they made to the government.

'''The commission made some recommendations to address the problems.  These included''':

Strengthening the relationship between presidential appointees and career civil servants by building a spirit of partnership between the two.

Reducing the number of presidential appointees so that there is more room at the top for civil servants.

Providing competitive pay to aid in recruiting and retaining excellent people while demanding competitive performance of them.&lt;ref&gt;Volcker Report, Urgent Business for America: Revitalizing the Federal Government for the 21st Century, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pertinent legislating==
'''[[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act 1883]]:'''  designed to end to the spoils system and provide federal government jobs based on merit and be selected through competitive exams.  The act also made firing and demoting employees for political reasons unlawful.  It also made requiring employees to give political service or contributions unlawful. The act also established the Civil Service Commission to enforce these rules. It was used to reinforce the efficiency of government.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, E. H. (2009).

'''[[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]]:''' encompassed a wide variety of reforms including the creation of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), The Federal Labor Relations Authority, and abolished the Civil Service Commission.  The act seeks greater accountability of federal employees for their performance.  The act also provides protection for "whistleblowers" and employees calling attention to any government malpractices.&lt;ref&gt;Ingraham, Patricia W. and David H. Rosenbloom, The Promise and Paradox of Civil Service Reform. Pittsburgh University, Pittsburgh Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hatch Act of 1939]]:''' was passed into legislation to prohibit federal government employees from participating in certain political activities both on and off duty.  The employee could not support or oppose a political party, partisan political group, or a candidate for a partisan political party. 
  
In 1993, Congress passed legislation that amended the act as it applies to federal employees.  Under the amendment most federal employees are now able to take part in political management and political campaigns.   The act also applies to local and state employees who are employed with programs financed by loan or grants from the government or a federal agency.  If the employee works for a research or educational institutions supported by a state, the employee is not under the restrictions of the act.  The government employees that are covered by the new amendment are in executive agencies or in positions in the U.S. Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, John R.

'''[[Classification Act of 1949]]''': established the classification standards program, this law states that positions are to be classified based on the duties and responsibilities assigned and the qualifications required to do the work.  The position classifications standards are built on the foundation of the grade levels.

'''Title VII from [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]''': founded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and forbade discrimination in hiring, firing, and compensation based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.  It is also unlawful for an employer to segregate, limit, or classify employees in any way that will deprive them of employment opportunities or affect their employment status.  In addition, it is unlawful to discriminate on these five bases in an apprenticeship, training, or retraining programs.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlmann, Marcus D. and Linda Vallar Whisenhunt, Student's Guide to Landmark Congressional Laws on Civil Rights.

==Human Resource Management ''Focus'' In Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)==
[[Equal Opportunity Employment|Equal Employment Opportunity]] is continually in the spotlight of human resource (HR) management even after over 40 years of progress.  The number of EEO complaints and lawsuits remains significant, indicating that ongoing progress is needed to decrease employment discrimination.  EEO issues in HR Management are so prevalent that it has become one of the biggest concerns for HR professionals.

While HR professionals agree that equal employment opportunities are a legitimate focus, there is considerable controversy over best way to achieve equality.  One way is to use the "blind to differences" approach, which argues that differences among people should be ignored and everyone should be treated equally.  The second common approach is affirmative action, through which employers are urged to employ people based on their race, age, gender, or national origin.  The idea is to make up for historical discrimination by giving groups who have been affected enhanced opportunities for employment."&lt;ref&gt;Mathis, L., Jackson, H., (2006). Human Resource Management 12th ed. Managing Equal Employment and Diversity., pg. 105. Retrieved, February 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The former approach emphasizes equal treatment regardless of individual differences; the latter emphasizes fairness based on individual circumstances.

Thus, it is important for HR professionals to understand Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) discrimination process because of the significant complaints and lawsuits that will undoubtedly be encountered throughout HR Management.  "This discussion is to enhance the reader's understanding of the EEO process; the parts in each section of this discussion track the EEO process as chronologically as possible.  However, the goal of this discussion is not to provide an exhaustive study of complex legal subjects.  Digest summaries and articles themselves do not have the force of law and the reader is advised to look to the actual decisions and other sources discussed for a more precise understanding of applicable EEO law."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998"&gt;U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (1998). The Digest of Equal Employment Opportunity Law. Vol. XX, No. 1, SPECIAL FOCUS ISSUE I: AN OVERVIEW OF THE EEO PROCESS IN THE FEDERAL SECTOR FROM INITIATION THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS Retrieved, February 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For a more detailed discussion of the topics addressed in this Digest, see EEOC's website at [http://www.eeoc.gov/ "www.eeoc.gov"] and the statutes, regulations, decisions, guidance, and directives cited in these articles.

'''Initiating and Navigating the EEO Process'''

''Part 1: The Pre-Complaint Process''

The EEO process is initiated when an individual contacts an EEO counselor concerning a suspected violation of one or more of the laws that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces.  "The Commission's regulations, promulgated under applicable statutory law, can be found in relevant parts in [[Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] ("Labor"). The federal sector process itself is detailed in 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (1999); and further amplified in Management Directive 110 (1999) (hereinafter, Maryland-110).  MD-110 has often been referred to as the EEO counselor's "bible" for the wealth of information, appendices, and forms contained therein regarding the EEO process and is available online to the public at: [http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/index.cfm http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/index.cfm]"&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

Under the EEOC-enforced statutes currently in force, there are 8 bases of employment discrimination that may be alleged regarding an agency action, policy, or practice in the EEO process.  "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. It is also illegal to discriminate against a person because the person complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit." &lt;ref name="EEOC, 2010, Authority and Role"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (2010). About EEOC: Overview, Authority &amp; Role. Retrieved, February 11, 2010. From http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

"Most employers with at least 15 employees are covered by EEOC laws (20 employees in age discrimination cases).  Most labor unions and employment agencies are also covered.  The laws apply to all types of work situations, including hiring, firing, promotions, harassment, training, wages, and benefits."&lt;ref name="EEOC, 2010, Authority and Role"/&gt;

Once an individual has filed a charge of discrimination, it is important that the individual must adhere to certain time frames and follow specified procedures in order to avoid dismissal of their complaints.  For example, an EEO complaint may possibly be dismissed for failure to begin EEO counseling within 45 days of the suspected discriminatory incident or effective date of alleged discriminatory personnel action.

However, an "aggrieved person" or "counselee" must consult with an EEO counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to resolve the disputed matter informally.  The counselor's role is to provide a solution of the alleged discrimination before the complaint is formally filed.  After which, during the 30-day period the Counselor is to complete counseling, provide for the counselee (i.e., the aggrieved person) a written list of the counselee's rights and responsibilities. 
These include the following:

*The right to request a hearing or an immediate final decision after an investigation by the agency.
*The responsibility to exercise certain election rights (which will be specified later in this section).
*The right to file a civil action in federal court after filing with EEOC a notice of intent to sue under the ADEA instead of pursuing a complaint of age discrimination in the administrative EEO process.
*The need to be aware of administrative EEO and federal court time frames.
*An understanding that only the claims raised in pre-complaint counseling (or issues and claims like or related to issues or claims raised in pre-complaint counseling) may be alleged in a subsequent complaint filed with the agency.

"Such EEO contact must occur within 45 days of when the aggrieved person knew or should have known of the alleged discriminatory matter, or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the personnel action.  At the time of initiating EEO counseling and throughout the EEO process, the counselee is permitted to have a representative who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.  The counselor, who may be an agency employee and work either full-time in EEO or in a collateral duty role, is required to be neutral and favor neither the counselee nor the agency."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

"Failure of the aggrieved person to raise a matter in counseling may result in subsequent dismissal of the formal EEO complaint. Through the counseling process claims are set forth and clarified, and the counselor conducts a limited inquiry (not an investigation) for the purpose of achieving resolution."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

During the counselor's inquiry, the counselor may utilize certain procedures common to mediation but does not engage in actual mediation, even if that counselor is also a certified mediator.  Throughout this counseling, or pre-complaint stage, the Counselor will also notify the counselee of pertinent legal choices that are available.  Also, during this process the EEO counselor must inform the counselee that, where the agency offers ADR, the counselee must elect to choose between engaging in ADR or continuing informal counseling, but not both. Despite the choice of ADR or continuing the process of informal counseling, if resolution is not achieved, the counselee will have the opportunity to file a formal EEO complaint. "The ADR process in the pre-complaint phase is limited to a maximum of 90 days. However, the EEOC encourages the parties to engage in ADR to attempt to resolve their dispute at any subsequent time up to and including the appellate process."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

Further, "Counselors must advise individuals of their duty to keep the agency and Commission informed of their current address and to serve copies of appeal papers on the agency.  The notice [of the right to file a formal complaint within 15 days of the counselee's receipt of the notice] shall include notice of the right to file a class complaint.  If the aggrieved person informs the Counselor that he or she wishes to file a class complaint, the counselor shall explain the class complaint procedures and the responsibilities of a class agent."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

The Counselor must also notify the counselee of his or her right to remain anonymous until the grievance is officially filed, where and with whom the formal complaint is to be filed, "and of the complainant's duty to assure that the agency is informed immediately if the complainant retains counsel or a representative"&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt; In addition, "the Counselor shall not attempt in any way to hinder the aggrieved person from filing a complaint."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

Before a formal complaint may go to federal court as a civil action to pursue the aggrieved individual's discrimination claims, the EEO administrative process reviews the claim.  This is known as [exhaustion of administrative remedies].  "In complaints concerning Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA—where the complainant chooses to go through the EEO process--the "exhaustion" requirement is satisfied after 180 days from the filing of the individual complaint or the class complaint if an appeal has not been filed and final action has not been taken by the agency."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt; Equal Pay Act claims, on the other hand, must be filed within two years (or three years for willful violations) of the alleged discrimination, despite their standing in the administrative process.

There are exceptions to the above requirement.  An EEO complaint filed under the ADEA may exempt a complaint from the above requirement.  If the complaint gives the commission at least 30 days written notice of the intent to file an action, it may bypass the EEO process and go directly to a U.S. District Court and file a civil action naming the head of an allegedly discriminating agency.  "A complainant who is asserting a claim under the EPA, however, may bypass the EEO administrative process completely and go directly to court. The filing of a civil action by the complainant will terminate the processing of an administrative complaint or appeal filed with the EEOC, and, therefore, the complainant should notify the agency and Commission when s/he has filed a civil action."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

In addition to the claim processes discussed, a counselee may have to choose between continuing his or her claims in the negotiated grievance process or the EEO process.  "When an aggrieved person is employed by an agency that is subject to 5 U.S.C. 7121(d), and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that permits claims of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, that employee must elect to proceed either through the EEO process or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt; However, a complainant should be aware that, if he or she chooses to pursue a negotiated grievance before filing an EEO complaint, the time limitations in the EEO process will not be extended unless the agency consents to an extension in writing.

Another important election that an EEO Counselor must inform the counselee of is mixed cases.  Essentially, a mixed case is a claim of discrimination that is appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  Regulations related to mixed cases can be found at 29 C.F.R. § 1614.302.  To determine if MSPB may have jurisdiction there are two important questions that must be answered.  First, does the employee have standing to appear before the MSPB? "For example, a probationary employee does not have standing to go to MSPB on an EEO-based claim.  Employees of certain agencies, e.g., the FBI, CIA, TVA, the U.S. Postal Service, and certain non-appropriated fund activities (such as the Army and Air Force Exchange) do not have standing.  Those employees may, however, pursue their claims through the regular EEO process with their agency."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt; Secondly, does the claim occur from an action appealable to MSPB?  Commonly, the more severe the personnel action at hand, the more likely it will be appealable to MSPB, e.g., removal, suspension for more than 14 days, and reduction in grade.

In short, an aggrieved individual can file a mixed case complaint with the agency or a mixed case appeal with the MSPB but not both at the same time.  The aggrieved person must choose one or the other.  In the initial case of a mixed case complaint being filed, the complaint proceeds through the EEO process as with any EEO complaint, with these exceptions:

*There is no right to a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge (AJ) after an investigation.
*The investigation is limited to 120 days (not 180).
*The agency must issue a final agency decision (FAD) within 45 days following the investigation.
*If dissatisfied with the FAD, complainant must appeal the FAD, within 30 days of receipt of the FAD, to the MSPB (not to the EEOC).

If the aggrieved individual chooses to file a mixed case "appeal" instead of a mixed case "complaint", then this individual may request a hearing before an MSPB administrative judge (AJ) but not an EEOC administrative judge (AJ).  Afterwards, if the aggrieved individual is dissatisfied with the MSPB's verdict on his or her claims of discrimination under the statutes the EEOC enforces, they may choose to file a petition with the EEOC from the MSPB decision.

'''Part 2: Filing the Individual Complaint'''

Once the counseling is over and if there has been no resolution to the claim or claims, the EEO counselor must provide the counselee with a Notice of Final Interview and the Right to File a Formal Complaint with the appropriate agency official.  The counselee then is required to file the formal complaint within a time period of 15 days once the Notice of Final Interview has been received.  This complaint must be signed by either the complainant or the individual's attorney.  The complaint is also required to contain a phone number and address where the complainant or his or her attorney can be reached.  The complainant is responsible for proceeding with the complaint with or without a designated representative.

The formal complaint must contain a precise statement that identifies the aggrieved individual and the agency and the actions or practices that form the basis of the complaint.  The agency in turn, must provide the complainant with written acknowledgement of the complaint and the date of filing. The agency's acknowledgement letter will include the following information:

*The address of the EEOC office where a request for a hearing is to be sent.
*The right to appeal the final action on or dismissal of a complaint.
*The requirement that the agency conduct an impartial and appropriate investigation within 180 days of the filing of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the time period.

'''Part 3: Amending and Consolidating Complaints'''

A complainant may amend a pending complaint to add claims that are related or similar to those raised in the pending complaint, prior to the agency's mailing of the notice required by 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(f) at the conclusion of the investigation.  If the complainant needs to add or amend a new incident of alleged discrimination during the processing of an EEO complaint, the complainant will be instructed by the investigator or other EEO staff person to submit a letter to the agency's EEO Director or Complaints Manager at that time.  The letter submitted must describe the new incident or amendments added by the complainant. Once the EEO officials review this request and determine the proper handling of the amendment they will decide if new EEO counseling is required. No new counseling is required when:

*Additional evidence is offered in support of the existing claim, but does not raise a new claim.
*The incident raises a new claim that is like or related to the claims(s) raised in the pending complaint.

"Additional evidence becomes part of the investigation of the pending claim and the complainant is so notified. The complaint must be amended where a new claim is like or related to the claim(s) raised in the pending complaint, and the EEO official must notify both the complainant and the investigator, in writing, acknowledging receipt of the amendment and the date it was filed. The EEO official will also instruct the investigator to investigate the new claim. New counseling will be required if the new claim is not like or related to the claim(s) in the pending complaint. The new claim will be the subject of a separate complaint and be subject to all of the regulatory case processing requirements."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

'''Part 4: The Investigation'''

EEO investigations are covered in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108 and the instructions are contained in the Commission's Management Directives.  An efficient investigation is one that is conducted impartially with and contains an appropriate factual record.  A correct factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred.  "All agency employees, including the complainant, are required to cooperate with the investigation and "witness testimony is given under oath or affirmation and without a promise that the agency will keep the testimony or information provided confidential."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

During this process the investigators must thoroughly investigate the complaint and are authorized to administer oaths and require witness testimony and documentation.  An investigator cannot make or suggest findings of discrimination and must be free of conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest throughout the investigation of complaints.  The evidence gathered by the investigator should only be relevant to the case in order to determine whether discrimination has occurred and if so, create the "appropriate remedy."  Generally, investigations should be completed within 180 days of the filing of the individual complaint, unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period an additional 90 days.

At the end of the investigation, the agency must present the complainant with a copy of the complaint file, including the report of investigation, and the notice of the right to request either an immediate final decision from the agency or a hearing before an EEOC AJ.  A complainant also may request an AJ hearing after 180 days from the filing of the complaint even if the investigation has not been completed.  The complainant must receive a copy of the complaint file, plus the report of investigation (ROI), and a copy of the hearing transcript if a hearing was held.

'''An overview of the EEO process: Conclusion'''

This discussion has provided the detailed EEO process with regard to the processing of individual EEO complaints of discrimination, in accordance with 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. "The principles reflected in those procedures are also intended to guide the processing of class complaints of discrimination under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204."&lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt; The overall purpose of this discussion is to enhance the reader's understanding of the EEO process; the parts in each section of this discussion track the EEO process as chronologically as possible.  However, the goal of this discussion is not to provide an exhaustive study of complex legal subjects.  Digest summaries and articles themselves do not have the force of law and the reader is advised to look to the actual decisions and other sources discussed for a more precise understanding of applicable EEO law" &lt;ref name="EEOC 1998" /&gt;

==HR structure==
'''Federal Level:''' The Federal classification system is not a pay plan, but is vital to the structure and administrations of employee compensation.  The pay system is influenced by the grade level and by quality of performance, length of service, and recruitment and retention considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Liff]], Improving the Performance of Government Employees: A Manager's Guide, AMACOM, New York, (2011), {{ISBN|978-0-8144-1622-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to define Federal occupations, establish official position titles, and describe the grades of various levels of work.  OPM approves and issues position classification standards that must be used by federal  agencies to determine the title, series, and grade of positions.

The classification standards help assure that the Federal personnel management program runs soundly because agencies are now becoming more decentralized and now have more authority to classify positions.  Agencies are required to classify positions according to the criteria and the guidance that OPM has issued.  The official titles that are published in classification standards have to be used for personnel, budget, and fiscal purposes.  The occupations in federal agencies may change over time, but the duties, responsibilities, and qualifications remain the same so careful application of appropriate classification of the standards needs to be related to the kind of work for the position.  When classifying a position the first decision to be made is the pay system.  There is the General Schedule (GS) and the Federal Wage System (FWS), which covers trade, craft, or laboring experience.

'''''General Schedule''' Covers positions from grades GS−1 to GS−15 and consists of twenty two occupational groups and is divided into five categories:

'''Professional''' – Requires knowledge either acquired through training or education equivalent to a bachelor's degree or higher.  It also requires the exercise of judgment, discretion and personal responsibility. Examples can be attorneys, medical officers, and biologists. Usually a person who is in the field of HR, and has gone through the education required, stays in the field for long-term career goals. People of this category are seen in the upper management of HR departments.

'''Administrative''' – Requires the exercise of analytical ability, judgment, discretion, and personal responsibility, and the application of a substantial body of knowledge of principles, concepts, and practices applicable to one or more fields of administration or management. These positions do not require specialized education, but do require skills usually gained while attaining a college level education. Examples can be budget analysts and general supply specialists. These positions will most likely be filed by career employees that act in a managerial function.

'''Technical''' – Requires extensive practical knowledge, gained through experience and specific training and these occupations may involve substantial elements of the work of the professional or administrative field.  Technical employees usually carry out tasks, methods, procedures, and computations that are laid out either in published or oral instructions. Depending upon the level of difficulty of work, these procedures often require a high degree of technical skill, care, and precision. Examples of the technical category would be forestry technician, accounting technician, and pharmacy technicians.

'''Clerical''' – Involves work in support of office, business, or fiscal operations.  Typically involves general office or program support duties such as preparing, receiving, reviewing, and verifying documents; processing transactions; maintaining office records; locating and compiling data or information from files. Examples can be secretaries, data transcribers, and mail clerks.

'''Other''' – There are some occupations in the General Schedule which do not clearly fit into one of the groups.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Personnel Management, Classifier's Handbook, August 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some firefighter and various law enforcement agencies have specialized positions that manage HR duties within the organization.

Humane law enforcement officers (oftentimes abbreviated as "HLEOs" in some jurisdictions) are generally members of a state or local society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA) or a state or local police department and as such are generally trained and certified alongside other police and law enforcement officers at a state or local police training academy.  Depending on the jurisdiction, HLEOs may also be sworn and/or commissioned officers with peace officer status, empowered with the appropriate law enforcement authority to effect arrests with or without warrant, sign complaints and issue court summonses, conduct searches and seizures, and carry weapons including a firearm, especially if trained and certified through a police training academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Law-Enforcement-Careers/a/Career-Profile-Animal-Cop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Humane law enforcement may be performed by government agencies, private agencies, or both, depending on the jurisdiction. Individuals who perform humane law enforcement duties include [[police officer]]s, [[humane law enforcement officer]]s, [[animal control officer]]s, and animal cruelty investigators.

There are many different agencies that are involved in humane law enforcement including private and public. One of the better known private agencies is the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty&lt;/ref&gt; Other agencies include the [[Humane Society of the United States]] as well as state police departments. Although all the states do not have a specific humane law enforcement section of their police department, all of them do in one way or another take care of the responsibilities that humane officers would do.

== Duties ==

The duties of humane law enforcement personnel also depend on the jurisdiction. Their duties may include performing routine patrol to look out for violations of humane laws, answering complaints relating to violations of humane laws, making arrests or issuing summonses for violations of humane laws, and seizing animals due to violations of humane laws. They may also perform undercover work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policeofficersteps.com/humane-law-enforcement-training.php Humane law enforcement training]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some of the duties may differ slightly between different jurisdictions and agencies, for the most part many of the responsibilities will be the same. According to criminologycareers.com, humane law enforcement officers are responsible for "Investigating animal abuse cases, Enforcing laws related to the care and keeping of animals, Regulating industries that work with and use animals, Writing reports, Preparing and executing warrants, Arresting suspected criminals, Issuing civil fines, Responding to calls for service."&lt;ref&gt;http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Law-Enforcement-Careers/a/Career-Profile-Animal-Cop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These duties are performed by all humane enforcement agencies while others may differ slightly depending on the location of the agency. For example, a humane law officer in New York City would most likely not be dealing with bear baiting offenders like officers in South Carolina do.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnr.sc.gov/news/yr2014/feb27/feb27_humane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Training==
[[File:Hinged Handcuffs Rear Back To Back.JPG|thumb|Hinged Handcuffs Rear Back To Back]]
Anywhere that you may go seeking employment to become a humane law enforcer, will at the very least require a high school diploma or GED in order to get the job. A great majority of the agencies and departments will also require previous experience working with animals. If you are hoping to become a humane officer through a police department, you will also have to go through the police academy because humane officers are fully empowered police officers. On top of these requirements, in order to put yourself ahead of the competition, you may want to look into secondary training. "Individuals interested in becoming humane society police officers may obtain training through state humane society associations, national animal control associations, community colleges or technical schools."&lt;ref&gt;http://study.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Humane_Society_Police_Officer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary training along with previous experience working with animals is helpful because you would be working with sick/injured animals and need to know how to properly handle and care for them.

==Other Requirements==

If you acquire an interview to become a humane law enforcement officer, your interviewer will be looking for key personality traits and characteristics to set you aside from the other interviewees and show that you are mentally capable of performing the necessary duties. According to study.com, a person needs to exhibit these traits, "Active listening, critical thinking, good judgment and decision-making, strong public speaking skills, ability to cope with high-stress situations involving animals and their owner" in order to perform well. Criminologycareers.com emphasizes these characteristics along with compassion and understanding as "absolute must-have abilities in order to stay safe on the job." The reasons why these traits are so important is because, just like with any typical police duty, you never know how the perpetrator will react. Plus people can be especially emotional when it comes to their animals because they may have a strong connection to the animal.

'''Kenneth J. Gergen''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[emeritus]] [[professor]] at [[Swarthmore College]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Yale University]] (1957) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Duke University]] (1962).

==Biography==

The son of [[John Jay Gergen]], the Chair of the Mathematics Department at [[Duke University]], and Aubigne Munger (née Lermond), Gergen grew up in Durham, North Carolina. He had three brothers, one of whom is [[David Gergen]], the prominent political analyst. After completing public schooling, he attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1957, he subsequently became an officer in the U.S. Navy. He then returned to graduate school at Duke University, where he received his PhD in psychology in 1963. His dissertation advisor was [[Edward E. Jones]]. Gergen went on to become an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Relations at [[Harvard University]], where he also became the Chairman of the Board of Tutors and Advisors for the department and representative to the university's Council on Educational Policy.

In 1967, Gergen took a position as Chair of the Department of Psychology at [[Swarthmore College]], a position he held for ten years. At various intervals, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Marburg]], the [[Sorbonne]], the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], [[Kyoto University]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]]. At Swarthmore, he spearheaded the development of the academic concentration in interpretation theory. In an attempt to link his academic work to societal practices, he collaborated with colleagues to create the [[Taos Institute]] in 1996. He is currently Gil and Frank Mustin Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Senior Research Professor at Swarthmore, the Chairman of the Board of the Taos Institute, and an adjunct professor at [[Tilburg University]].

Gergen is married to Mary M. Gergen, Professor Emeritus at [[Penn State University]], and a major contributor to [[feminist psychology]] and performance inquiry. She is the author of over 50 articles and is the co-author (with Ken Gergen) of "Social Construction". They publish the Positive Aging Newsletter with a readership of around 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth J. Gergen, Ph.D.|url=https://www.taosinstitute.net/kenneth-j-gergen|website=The Taos Institute|publisher=The Taos Institute|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

Gergen's earliest studies challenged the presumption of a unified or coherent self.{{Clarify|reason=What studies, and in what way did they challenge this assumption?|date=June 2017}} He then raised questions about the value of [[altruism]], by exploring the ways in which helping others leads to the recipient's resentment and alienation. 

A major point in Gergen's career was his 1973 article "Social Psychology as History". In the article, he argues that the laws and principles of social interaction are variable over time, and that the scientific knowledge generated by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] actually influences the phenomena it is meant to passively describe. For example, studying obedience to authority may reduce the likelihood of obedience. He argued therefore that social psychology was not fundamentally a cumulative science, but was effectively engaged in the recording and transformation of cultural life. The article proved contentious, receiving criticism, such as from [[Barry R. Schlenker]]. The developing dispute became known as the "Gergen-Schlenker debate" and touched topics around the metatheory of social psychology.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"&gt;Warren Thorngate (1976) ''"In General" vs. "It depends": Some Comments of the Gergen-Schlenker Debate'';  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2, S. 404-410.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl E. Weick]] later took Warren Thorngate's contribution to that dispute to formulate [[Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity]], a theorem revolving around research methodology in social sciences.

Also contributing to what was called "the crisis in social psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Kim, U. (1999), "After the 'Crisis' in Social Psychology: The Development of the Transactional Model of Science". ''[[Asian Journal of Social Psychology]]'', 2: 1–19. doi: 10.1111/1467-839X.00023&lt;/ref&gt; was Gergen's subsequent publication on generative theory. Here he proposed that, because theoretical suppositions were not so much recordings of social life as creators, theories should not be judged by their accuracy so much as their potential to open new spaces of action.

Combining these ideas with developments in literary and critical theory, along with the history of science, Gergen went on to develop a radical view of [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] knowledge. This view was proposed as a successor project to what Gergen considered an inherently flawed [[Empiricism|empiricist]] conception of knowledge.  From Gergen's perspective, all human intelligibility (including claims to knowledge) is generated within relationships. It is from relationships that humans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and good. From this perspective, scientific theories, like all other reality posits, should not be assessed in terms of truth, but in terms of pragmatic outcomes. Such assessments are inevitably wedded to values, and thus all science is morally and politically weighted in implication. As he saw it, this same form of assessment also applies to social constructionist theory. The question is not its accuracy, but its potentials for humankind.

This latter conclusion informed most of Gergen's subsequent work, in areas including therapy and counseling, education, organizational change, technology, conflict reduction, civil society, and qualitative inquiry. In one form or another, this work is concerned with transforming social life. For the most part, his preferred direction of change is toward more collaborative and participatory relationships. Additionally, he has been concerned with fostering a "[[relational psychoanalysis|relational]]" view of the self, where the "traditional emphasis on the individual mind is replaced by a concern with the relational processes from which rationality and morality emerge."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He is also known for his comment "I am linked therefore I am" as an answer to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' proposition "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".&lt;ref&gt;Relational Being. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these developments are summarized in ''Relational Being, Beyond the Individual and Community,'' which attempts to demonstrate that what are considered mental processes are not so much "in the head" as in relationships. It also attempts to answer charges of [[moral relativism]] with a non-foundational morality of collaborative practice, and to outline a way to bring science together with concerns for the sacred.

Gergen's work is associated with [[social constructionism]]. Other major interests in his diverse works include analyzing the effects of technology on social life, examining connections between social construction and [[theology]], and promoting a more optimistic model of aging.

==Notable concepts==
Concepts that Gergen has written about include:
*''Enlightenment effects''. The moral and political effects on cultural behavior of disseminating scientific knowledge. ("Social psychology as history")
*''Generative theory'': Theory that unsettles common assumptions, and opens up possibilities or new forms of action. ("Toward generative theory")
*''Deficit discourse'': By constructing the world, and particularly individuals, in terms of problems, there is an objectification of deficit and a suppression of positive possibilities. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Cycle of progressive infirmity'': With the dissemination of information about [[Classification of mental disorders#Categorical schemes|categories of mental illness]], people come to see themselves in these terms. As a result, they seek help from the [[Mental health professional|mental health professions]], which are in turn, expanded in numbers. With the expansion of the mental health industry, new diagnostic categories are developed and disseminated. The society becomes progressively infirmed. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Multiphrenia'': The condition, largely attributed to technologies that increase social contact, of being simultaneously drawn in multiple and conflicting directions. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Pregression''. To unsettle the modernist value placed on progress, the proposal that for every change that is effected in societal life, the repercussions will unsettle multiple conditions that people define as positive. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Positive aging'': As an alternative to the pervasive view of aging as decline (deficit discourse), it is possible to discover and construct myriad ways of creating later life as a period of unparalleled growth and enrichment.
*''First and second order morality'': All collaborative relationships will be about some understanding of the good. With multiple groups proclaiming their own good, the stage is set for interminable conflict. Second order morality is achieved through practices that bring otherwise embattled groups into a condition of positive collaboration. (''Relational Being'')
*''Transformative dialogue'': Forms of dialogic practice that dissolve the barriers of meaning separating otherwise conflicted parties. (''Relational Being'')
*''Co-action''. One's actions have no meaning in themselves, but come into meaning through another's collaborative action. At the same time, another's potentially collaborative actions only become so as they are supplemented. All human intelligibility emerges not from individual actors but through co-action. (''Relational Being'')
*''Multi-being''. What is commonly viewed as the individual subject is the common intersection of multiple relationships. (''Relational Being'')

==Awards==
Gergen has received research grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], and the Barra Foundation. His work has merited awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[National Communication Association]], the Constructivist Psychology Network, the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]] in Santiago. He has received fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[Fulbright Foundation]], and the Alexander Humboldt foundation. He also holds honorary degrees from [[Tilburg University]],  [[Saybrook Graduate School]], and the [[University of Athens]].

'''Labour Day''' ('''[[Labor Day]]''' in the United States) is an [[Year|annual]] [[public holiday|holiday]] to celebrate the achievements of [[worker]]s. Labour Day has its origins in the [[trade union|labour union]] movement, specifically the [[eight-hour day]] movement, which advocated eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest.

For most countries, Labour Day is synonymous with, or linked with, [[International Workers' Day]], which occurs on 1 May. For other countries, Labour Day is celebrated on a different date, often one with special significance for the labour movement in that country. Labour Day is a [[public holiday]] in many countries.

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the holiday is celebrated on the first Monday of September and considered the unofficial end of [[summer]], with [[summer vacation]]s ending and students returning to school around then.

==International Workers' Day==
{{main|International Workers' Day}}

For most countries, "Labour Day" is synonymous with, or linked with, International Workers' Day, which occurs on 1 May. Some countries vary the actual date of their celebrations so that the holiday occurs on a Monday close to 1 May.

==Other dates==

===Australia===
Labour Day in [[Australia]] is a public holiday on dates which vary between [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]]. It is the first Monday in October in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], it is the second Monday in March (though the latter calls it Eight Hours Day). In [[Western Australia]], Labour Day is the first Monday in March. In the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] it is called May Day and occurs on the first Monday in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/special-dates-and-events/public-holidays|title=Australian Government: National Public Holidays|publisher=australia.gov.au|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the fourth Monday of March in the territory of [[Christmas Island]].

The first march for a nine-hour day by the [[Australian labour movement#Early history|labour movement]] occurred in Melbourne on 21 April 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldownunder.com/australian-dates/holiday-labour-day.htm|title=Australian Public Holidays: Labour Day|work=alldownunder.com|date=1998|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this day stonemasons and building workers on building sites around [[Melbourne]] stopped work and marched from the [[University of Melbourne]] to Parliament House to achieve an [[eight-hour day]]. Their direct action protest was a success, and they are noted as being among the first organised workers in the world to achieve an 8-hour day, with no loss of pay.&lt;ref name="LewisBalderstone2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wendy Lewis|author2=Simon Balderstone|author3=John Bowman|title=Events that Shaped Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6TVAAAACAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2016|year=2006|publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-74110-492-9|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Bangladesh Garment Sramik Sanghati, an organization working for the welfare of garment workers, has requested that 24 April be declared Labour Safety Day in [[Bangladesh]], in memory of the victims of the [[2013 Savar building collapse|Rana Plaza]] building collapse.&lt;ref name = "dwelle2404"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thousands mourn collapse victims of Rana Plaza garment factory one year on|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=20 July 2014|date=24 April 2014|url=http://www.dw.de/thousands-mourn-collapse-victims-of-rana-plaza-garment-factory-one-year-on/a-17589288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangladesh.officialpublicholidays.com/national-holiday|last=Official Public Holidays|title=Bangladesh Official Public Holidays|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahamas===
Labour Day is a national holiday in the [[Bahamas]], celebrated on the first Friday in June in order to create a long weekend for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/bahamas|last=timeanddate|title=Holidays in The Bahamas in 2015|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional date of Labour Day in the Bahamas, however, is 7 June, in commemoration of a significant workers' strike that began on that day in 1942. Labour Day is meant to honor and celebrate workers and the importance of their contributions to the nation and society. In the capital city, Nassau, thousands of people come to watch a parade through the streets, which begins at mid-morning. Bands in colorful uniforms, traditional African [[junkanoo]] performers, and members of various labour unions and political parties are all part of the procession, which ends up at the Southern Recreation Grounds, where government officials make speeches for the occasion. For many residents and visitors to the Bahamas, the afternoon of Labour Day is a time to relax at home or perhaps visit the beach.

[[Image:1900s Toronto LabourDay Parade.jpg|thumb|right|A Labour Day parade in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the early 1900s]]
Labour Day ([[French language|French]]: ''Fête du Travail'') has been celebrated in Canada on the first Monday in September since the 1880s. The origins of Labour Day in Canada can be traced back to December 1872 when a parade was staged in support of the Toronto Typographical Union's strike for a 58-hour work-week,&lt;ref name="CanEnc"&gt;{{cite web |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |title=Origins of Labour Day |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/origins-of-labour-day-feature/ |first=James |last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost a full decade before a [[Labor Day#History|similar event in New York City]] by the American [[Knights of Labor]], a late 19th-century U.S. [[labor federation]], launched the movement towards the American Labor Day holiday.&lt;ref&gt;"Origin of Labor Day," ''Cincinnati Tribune,'' Sept. 1, 1895, Special Labor Day supplement, pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto Trades Assembly (TTA) called its 27 unions to demonstrate in support of the Typographical Union who had been on strike since 25 March.&lt;ref name="CanEnc"/&gt; [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], Canadian politician and editor of the ''[[Toronto Globe]]'' hit back at his striking employees, pressing police to charge the Typographical Union with "conspiracy."&lt;ref name="CanEnc"/&gt; Although the laws criminalising union activity were outdated and had already been abolished in Great Britain, they were still on the books in Canada and police arrested 24 leaders of the Typographical Union.  Labour leaders decided to call another similar demonstration on 3 September to protest the arrests. Seven unions marched in [[Ottawa]], prompting a promise by Canadian [[Prime Minister]] Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] to repeal the "barbarous" anti-union laws.&lt;ref name="CanEnc"/&gt; Parliament passed the [[Trade Union Act]] on 14 June the following year, and soon all unions were seeking a 54-hour work-week.

The Toronto Trades and Labour Council (successor to the TTA) held similar celebrations every spring. American [[Peter J. McGuire]], co-founder of the [[American Federation of Labor]], was asked to speak at a labour festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 22 July 1882. Returning to the United States, McGuire and the [[Knights of Labor]] organised a similar [[parade]] based on the Canadian event on 5 September 1882 in New York City, USA. On 23 July 1894, Canadian Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]] and his government made Labour Day, to be held in September, an official holiday. In the United States, the New York parade became an annual event that year, and in 1894 was adopted by American president [[Grover Cleveland]] to compete with [[International Workers' Day]] (May Day).

While Labour Day parades and picnics are organised by unions, many Canadians regard Labour Day as the Monday of the last long weekend of summer. Non-union celebrations include picnics, [[fireworks display]]s, water activities, and public art events. Since the new school year generally starts right after Labour Day, families with school-age children take it as the last chance to travel before the end of summer.

An old fashioned tradition in Canada and the United States frowns upon the wearing of white after Labour Day. Explanations for this tradition vary; the most common is that white is a summer colour and Labour Day unofficially marks the end of summer. The rule may have been intended as a status symbol for new members of the upper and middle classes in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920684,00.html |title = Why We Can't Wear White After Labor Day |author = Laura FitzPatrick |date = September 8, 2009 |work = [[Time Magazine]] |accessdate = February 25, 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110303043411/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920684,00.html |archivedate = March 3, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Labour Day tradition in [[Atlantic Canada]] is the Wharf Rat Rally in [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], while the rest of Canada watches the [[Labour Day Classic]], a [[Canadian Football League]] event where rivals like [[Calgary Stampeders]] and [[Edmonton Eskimos]], [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]] (except in [[2011 CFL season|2011]] and [[2013 CFL season|2013]], due to scheduling conflicts), and [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] and [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] play on Labour Day weekend. Before the demise of the [[Ottawa Renegades]] after the 2005 season, that team played the nearby [[Montreal Alouettes]] on Labour Day weekend. Since the [[2014 CFL season]], when the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] began play, the Montreal–Ottawa Labour Day tradition has once again been observed. Likewise, [[Ontario University Athletics]] has a long-established tradition to play [[college football|university football]] on Labour Day.

The Labour Day parade in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] started in 1921 and still continues today, over 90 years later. The celebrations go on for three days with a parade on Labour Day Monday.

===Jamaica===
Before 1961, 24 May was celebrated in [[Jamaica]] as Empire Day in honour of the birthday of [[Queen Victoria]] and her emancipation of slaves in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="jam"&gt;{{cite web |work=National Labour Day 2008 |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/labourDay2008/history.htm |title=History of Labour Day |publisher=Jamaica Information Service |access-date=21 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910163817/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/labourDay2008/history.htm |archive-date=10 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name suggests, the day was used to celebrate the British Empire, complete with flag-raising ceremonies and the singing of patriotic songs. In 1961, [[Jamaican Chief Minister]] [[Norman Washington Manley]] proposed the replacement of Empire Day with Labour Day, a celebration in commemoration of 23 May 1938, when [[Alexander Bustamante]] led a [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939|labour rebellion]] leading to Jamaican independence.

In 1972, [[Jamaican Prime Minister]] [[Michael Manley]] promoted Labour Day as a showcase for the importance of labour to the development of Jamaica, and a day of voluntary community participation to beneficial projects.&lt;ref name="jam"/&gt; Since then, Labour Day has been not only a public holiday but also a day of mass community involvement around the country.

=== Kazakhstan ===
Labor Day in [[Kazakhstan]] is celebrated on the last Sunday in September. The holiday was officially established in late 2013. In 1995, the government of Kazakhstan replaced International Workers' Day with Kazakhstan People's Unity Day. Kazakh President Nur sultan Nazarbayev also instituted a special medal that is awarded to veterans of labor on the occasion of the holiday. Labor Day it is widely celebrated across the country with official speeches, award ceremonies, cultural events, etc. It is a non-working holiday for most citizens of Kazakhstan because it always falls on a weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anydayguide.com/calendar/218|title=Labor Day in Kazakhstan / September 24, 2017|last=AnydayGuide|work=AnydayGuide|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], Labour Day is a public holiday held on the fourth Monday in October. Its origins are traced back to the eight-hour working day movement that arose in the newly founded [[Wellington]] colony in 1840, primarily because of carpenter [[Samuel Parnell]]'s refusal to work more than eight hours a day. He encouraged other tradesmen also to work for only eight hours a day and in October 1840, a workers' meeting passed a resolution supporting the idea.  On 28 October 1890, the 50th anniversary of the eight-hour day was commemorated with a parade. The event was then celebrated annually in late October as either ''Labour Day'' or ''Eight-Hour Demonstration Day''. In 1899 government legislated that the day be a public holiday from 1900.  The day was celebrated on different days in different provinces. This led to ship owners complaining that seamen were taking excessive holidays by having one Labour Day in one port then another in their next port. In 1910 the government stipulated that the holiday would be observed on the same day throughout the nation.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], Labour Day is celebrated every 19 June.  This holiday was proposed in 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://library2.nalis.gov.tt/Default.aspx?tabid=268 Trinidad and Tobago Labour Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807210105/http://library2.nalis.gov.tt/Default.aspx?tabid=268 |date=7 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be commemorated on the anniversary of the 1937 [[Tubal Uriah Butler|Butler]] labour riots.

===United States===
[[File:First United States Labor Day Parade, September 5, 1882 in New York City.jpg|thumb|First US Labor Day Parade, September 5, 1882 in [[New York City]]]]
{{Main|Labor Day}}
In the United States, Labor Day is a [[federal holiday]] observed on the first Monday of September. It is customarily viewed as the end of the [[summer]] vacation season.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Yelena. [http://www.celebrations.com/article/Labor-Day-End-of-Summer-White-Party Labor Day End of Summer White Party], Celebrations.com. Retrieved 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools open for the year on the day after Labor Day.&lt;ref&gt;Helderman, Rosalind S. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/05/AR2009090502666.html Issues That Matter to You: School Start After Labor Day]"; ''The Washington Post'', 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday is shared with [[Canada]], where it is known as '''Labour Day''' ('''''Fête du Travail''''' in French).

[[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] promote individual liberty and seek to minimize the role of the state. In the [[abortion debate]] some libertarians [[Abortion-rights movements|support legal access]] to [[abortion]] as part of their general support for individual rights, especially in regard to what they consider to be a woman's right to control her body.&lt;ref&gt;

A woman's body is her property, to do with as she wishes."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian right|Religious right]] and intellectual conservatives have attacked such libertarians for supporting abortion rights, especially since the demise of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWriT6k6WUsC&amp;client= The Politics of Freedom: Taking on the Left, the Right, and Threats to Our Liberties]'', [[Cato Institute]], 2008 {{ISBN|1-933995-14-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-933995-14-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWriT6k6WUsC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=most+libertarians+are+pro-choice+abortion&amp;num=100&amp;ei=pBktSpTPMaSCywT1srifBw&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA3,M1 page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Other libertarians claim libertarian principles such as the [[non-aggression principle]] apply to human beings from [[Fertilisation|conception]], and that the universal [[right to life]] thus applies to [[fetus]]es in the womb. Some of those individuals express [[opposition to legal abortion]].&lt;ref name="Libertarians for Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.l4l.org/library/abor-rts.html |title=Abortion and Rights: Applying Libertarian Principles Correctly |author=Doris Gordon (1995, 1999) |publisher=[[Libertarians for Life]]}} Also see: {{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|authorlink1=Wendy McElroy|title=Liberty for Women|date=2002 |location= Chicago |publisher=Ivan R.

==Support for legal abortion==
Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] argued that the notion of a [[fetus]]'s having a right to life is "vicious nonsense" and stated, "An embryo has no rights... a child cannot acquire any rights until it is born."&lt;ref name= "RefRand"&gt;Ayn Rand, ''The Voice of Reason'' excerpted at  [http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/abortion.html Ayn Rand Lexicon entry on Abortion.]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also wrote: "Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered."&lt;ref name="RefRand"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Murray Rothbard]]&lt;ref&gt;"Literature of liberty," [[Cato Institute]], v. 4, p. 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "no being has a right to live, unbidden, as a parasite within or upon some person's body" and that therefore the woman is entitled to eject the fetus from her body at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=For a New Liberty|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B65ic_7bfFEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=For+a+New+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_4ZpTOCuLoH58Abl8OyyBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false 131–132]|chapter=Personal Liberty|author=Rothbard, Murray|isbn=0-930073-02-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, explaining the right of the woman to "eject the fetus from her body", Rothbard also wrote that "every baby as soon as it is born and is therefore no longer contained within his mother's body possesses the right of self-ownership by virtue of being a separate entity and a potential adult.

Libertarian anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]] initially concluded that no one should interfere to prevent neglect of the child, although they could still repress a positive invasion. However, Tucker, having reconsidered his opinion, resolved that parental cruelty is of non-invasive character and therefore is not to be prohibited. Tucker's opinion is grounded on the fact that he viewed the child as the property of the mother while in the womb and until the time of their emancipation (at the age of being able to contract and provide for themselves) unless the mother had disposed of the fruit of her womb by contract. In the meantime, Tucker recognized the right of the mother to dispose of her property as she sees it fit. According to Tucker's logic "the outsider who uses force upon the child invades, not the child, but its mother, and may be rightfully punished for doing so."&lt;ref name= "RefCarlWatnerAtVoluntaryist.com"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Watner |first=Carl |date=March 1975 |title=Spooner vs. Liberty |journal=[[Voluntaryist.com]].

[[Walter Block]], professor of economics at [[Loyola University New Orleans]], provides an alternative to the standard choice between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" which he terms "[[evictionism]]". According to this moral theory, the act of abortion must be conceptually separated into the acts of (a) eviction of the fetus from the womb; and (b) killing the fetus. Building on the libertarian stand against trespass and murder, Block supports a right to the first act, but, except in certain circumstances, not the second act. He believes the woman may legally abort if (a) the fetus is not viable outside the womb; or (b) the woman has announced to the world her abandonment of the right to custody of the fetus, and (c) no one else has "homesteaded" that right by offering to care for the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;

In "The Right to Abortion: A Libertarian Defense," the Association of Libertarian Feminists created what they call a "systematic philosophical defense of the moral case for abortion from a libertarian perspective." It concludes: "To sacrifice existing persons for the sake of future generations, whether in slave labor camps for the utopian nightmares of [[Marxism|Marxists]] or [[fascism|fascists]], or in unwanted pregnancies, compulsory childbearing, and furtive coat hanger abortions for the edification of fetus-worshippers, is to establish hell on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Presley and Robert Cooke, [http://www.alf.org/abortion.php "The Right to Abortion: A Libertarian Defense], [http://www.alf.org Association of Libertarian Feminists web site], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capitalism Magazine]] supports the [[pro-choice]] position, writing:
{{quote|A fetus does not have a right to be in the womb of any woman, but is there by her permission. This permission may be revoked by the woman at any time, because her womb is part of her body... There is no such thing as the right to live inside the body of another, i.e., there is no right to enslave... a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state (or church). Even if a fetus were developed to the point of surviving as an independent being outside the pregnant woman's womb, the fetus would still not have the right to be inside the woman's womb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abortionisprolife.com/faq.htm Abortion is Pro Life] at Capitalism Magazine's site AbortionisProLife.com.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305231031/http://www.abortionisprolife.com/faq.htm |date=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leonard Peikoff, [http://capitalismmagazine.com/2003/01/abortion-rights-are-pro-life/ Abortion Rights are Pro-Life] at ''Capitalism Magazine'', January 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harry Browne]], the Libertarian Party candidate for President in 1996 and 2000, rejected the terms "pro-life" and "pro-choice" and stated about abortion: "Whatever we believe abortion is, we know one thing: Government doesn't work, and it is as incapable of eliminating abortions as it is of eliminating poverty or drugs."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Browne, [http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/Abortion.htm The Libertarian stand on abortion], [http://harrybrowne.org Harry Browne personal web page], December 21, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libertarian Party's 2004 presidential candidate [[Michael Badnarik]] had a similar position, writing: "I oppose government control over the abortion issue. I believe that giving the government control of this issue could lead to more abortions rather than fewer, because the left-right pendulum of power swings back and forth. This shift could place the power to set policy in the hands of those who demand strict population control. The government that can ban abortion can just as easily mandate abortion, as is currently the case in China."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.OnTheIssues.org/2004/Michael_Badnarik_Abortion.htm Michael Badnarik on Abortion], OnTheIssues.org voters guide 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's 2012 presidential candidate [[Gary Johnson]] wanted to keep abortion legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertleatribune.com/2012/08/24/libertarian-gets-on-minn-ballot-for-president/ Libertarian gets on Minn. ballot for president], [[Associated Press]], August 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertarian Party perspective===
The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|U.S. Libertarian Party]] [[party platform|political platform]] (2012) states: "Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lp.org/platform National Platform of the Libertarian Party, 1.4 Abortion], adopted in Convention, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organizations===
Other pro-choice libertarian organizations include the Association of Libertarian Feminists and Pro-Choice Libertarians.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Presley and Robert Cooke, [http://www.alf.org/abortion.php "The Right to Abortion: A Libertarian Defense"], [http://www.alf.org Association of Libertarian Feminists web site], 2003 and [http://www.prochoicelibertarians.net Pro-Choice Libertarians] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pro-choicelibertarians.net List of Just Some of the Reasons Libertarians Want Government out of the Abortion Issue], at [http://pro-choicelibertarians.net Pro-ChoiceLibertarians.net].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to legal abortion==
The [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] libertarian group [[Libertarians for Life]] argues that humans in the [[zygote|zygotic]], [[embryo]]nic, and fetal stages of development have the same rights as humans in the [[neonate|neonatal]] stage and beyond. Doris Gordon of the group notes that the principles of both the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|U.S. Libertarian Party]] and [[Objectivist ethics]] require some obligation to children and counter with an appeal to the [[non-aggression principle]]:

{{quote|Non-aggression is an ongoing obligation: it is never optional for anyone, even [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. If the non-aggression obligation did not apply, then earning money versus stealing it and consensual sex versus [[rape]] would be morally indifferent behaviors. The obligation not to aggress is pre-political and pre-legal. It does not arise out of [[contract]], agreement, or the law; rather, such devices presuppose this obligation. The obligation would exist even in a [[state of nature]]. This is because the obligation comes with our [[human nature]], and we acquire this nature at conception.&lt;ref name="Libertarians for Life"/&gt;}}

===Anti-abortion political officials===
[[Anti-abortion]] Libertarian and former Republican congressman [[Ron Paul]] says in "Abortion and Liberty":
{{quote|It's no coincidence that today's argument over abortion comes at a time when freedom in general is threatened in the United States, as well as in other Western countries. Nor was it accidental that genocide, abortion, and euthanasia were all practiced under Hitler, and that all three characterize totalitarian states. Even today, Communist governments vary their positions on abortion strictly on economic calculations of whether more or fewer slaves are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Paul (1983). ''Abortion and Liberty''. [[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]], {{ISBN|9780912453026}}. {{OCLC|9682249}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His main position calls for overturning ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and letting the states decide the issue. Ron Paul's son, Republican [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Rand Paul]], calls himself "totally pro-life" and supports "any and all legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Sullum, [http://reason.com/blog/2010/05/26/rand-paul-on-abortion Rand Paul on Abortion], [[Reason Magazine]], May 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Libertarian Party candidate for president was [[Bob Barr]] who has called abortion "murder" and opposed legalized abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Raffi Khatchadourian, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all The Third Man, Bob Barr's Libertarian run for the White House], [[The New Yorker]], October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whips''' have managed business and maintained party discipline for Australia's federal political parties in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. As the number of members of parliament and amount of business before the House has increased, so too has the number of [[Party whip (Australia)|whips]]. The three parties represented in the first Parliament each appointed one whip. Each of today's three main parties appoint a chief whip, while the [[Australian Labor Party]] and [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] each have an additional two whips and the [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] have one additional whip. Until 1994, a party's more senior whip held the title "Whip", while the more junior whip was styled "Deputy Whip". In 1994, those titles became "Chief Whip" and "Whip", respectively.

While many whips have gone on to serve as ministers, only three have gone on to lead their parties: Labor's Frank Tudor, the Country Party's Earle Page, and the National Party's Mark Vaile. Page is the only one of them to have served as prime minister (albeit for only a short time), and Vaile is the only one to have served as deputy prime minister. Tudor, less auspiciously, was the only of them to serve as leader of the opposition.

Page was also one of four people to serve as whip while representing [[Division of Cowper|Cowper]], the others being Francis Clarke (Protectionist), John Thomson (Commonwealth Liberal and Nationalist), and Gerry Nehl. As of August 2013, one other constituency has the same distinction: [[Division of Griffith|Griffith]], represented by William Conelan, William Coutts, Don Cameron, and Ben Humphreys—all of them Labor except Cameron. Oddly, the last three served in the seat consecutively.

New South Wales Premier and Labor Party Leader [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s adherents in the Federal Parliament crossed the floor in 1931 to defeat Labor Prime Minister [[James Scullin]], precipitating the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 election]]. Following the election, Lang's NSW Labor Party expelled members who, being loyal to the federal party, had stood against official NSW Labor candidates. The federal party then expelled Lang and his supporters. Lang's four supporters formed their own parliamentary party, with [[Jack Beasley]] (who had led the faction within the Labor Party) as leader. The party expanded to nine following the [[Australian federal election, 1934|1934 election]] and at their pre-sessional meeting in October re-elected Beasley and elected a deputy leader and whip. Following Scullin's resignation as Labor leader in late 1935, the Lang and Official Labor began negotiating a resolution to the split, and the two parties formally adopted an agreement under which the NSW Labor Party was absorbed back into the federal party on 25 February 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17318025 |title=Unity in Labor Party: Terms Accepted, Expulsions Removed |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |page=13 |date=26 February 1936 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Malaysia}}

The '''Malaysian Islamic Party''' ('''PAS'''; {{lang-ms|Parti Islam Se-Malaysia}}; formerly known as '''Malayan Islamic Party''') is an [[Islamist]] [[political party]] in [[Malaysia]]. PAS's electoral base is in Malaysia's rural and conservative north. The party has governed the east coast state of [[Kelantan]] twice (1959–1977 and 1990–present) and has also, in the past, formed governments in [[Terengganu]] (1959–1962, 1999–2004 and 2018–present) and [[Kedah]] (2008–2013). The party currently holds 18 of the 222 seats in the federal [[Dewan Rakyat|House of Representatives]] and has elected parliamentarians or state assembly members in eight of the country's 13 states.

== Background ==
The party was founded in 1951 by Muslim clerics in the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO). In the party's early decades, it fused Islamist and [[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay nationalist]] ideologies and entrenched itself as one of the country's strongest opposition parties. From 1974 to 1978, PAS joined the governing [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition, but has otherwise been in opposition at the federal level for the entirety of its history. The 1980s saw the party taken over by a group of Muslim clerics ("[[ulama]]"), who shifted the party's ideology away from Malay nationalism towards a more radical brand of Islamism. After poor electoral performances, the party moderated in the 1990s, with an increase in progressive leaders. In the 2015 PAS Muktamar, the Ulama wing called for a total out of progressives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/ahead-of-party-polls-pas-ulama-wing-calls-for-total-wipe-out-of-progressive|title=Ahead of party polls, PAS ulama wing calls for total wipe out of progressives|author=Syed Jaymal Zahiid|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which the progressive leaders lost almost all party positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bridgetwelsh.com/2015/06/the-pas-purge-of-the-progressives/|title=The PAS purge of the progressives|work=Malaysiakini|publisher=Bridget Welsh|date=6 June 2015|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive faction later formed [[Parti Amanah Negara]] (AMANAH) and with the two main Malaysian opposition parties, [[Parti KeADILan Rakyat|PKR]], [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]] formed [[Pakatan Harapan]].

PAS's electoral base is in Malaysia's rural and conservative north. The party has governed the northern state of [[Kelantan]] two times (1959-1977 and 1990-now) and [[Terengganu]] three times (1959-1962, 1999-2004 and 2018-now) and also, in the past, formed governments in [[Kedah]] (2008-2013) and [[Perak]] (2008-2009). The party currently holds 18 of the 222 seats in the federal [[Dewan Rakyat|House of Representatives]] and has elected parliamentarians or state assembly members in eight of the country's 13 states.

The President is the party's chief office-holder. [[Abdul Hadi Awang]] has occupied the post since 2002. Under the President sits a Deputy President and three Vice-Presidents. There are two standing decision-making bodies of the party: the elected Central Working Committee, which deals with administrative and political affairs, and the Syura Council, composed of clerics, which deals with religious matters. The party has formal branches for women members ("PAS Muslimat") and youth ("PAS Pemuda"). ''[[Harakah (Newspaper)|Harakah]]'' is the party's official newspaper.

== History ==
=== Origins: post-World War II Islamist movements ===
The post-World War II period, while Malaya was still under British colonial rule, saw the emergence of the country's first formal Islamic political movements. The Malay Nationalist Party (MNP), a left-wing nationalist organisation, was formed in 1945 and led by [[Burhanuddin al-Helmy]], who would later become the president of PAS. Out of the MNP arose the Pan-Malayan Supreme Islamic Council (MATA) in 1947, and MATA in turn formed the party ''Hizbul Muslimin'' ("Islamic Party") in 1948. The central aim of ''Hizbul Muslimin'' was the establishment of an independent Malaya as an Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Funston|1976|pp=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party did not live beyond 1948. The [[Malayan Emergency]] of that year, while a British–Communist dispute, saw the colonial administration arrest a number of the party's leaders, and the nascent group disbanded. Nevertheless, the party served as a forerunner to PAS, supplying both the ideology upon which PAS was formed and some of PAS's key leaders in its early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Funston|1976|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Party formation (1953–1956) ===
PAS was founded on 24 November 1951, as the ''Persatuan Islam Se-Malaya'' (PAN-Malayan Islamic Organisation). The formation of the party was the culmination of a growing movement among Muslim clerics within the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) to formalise a discrete Islamic political organisation. However, at first, the lines between UMNO and the new party were blurred. PAS allowed dual membership of the two parties, and many of its early senior leaders were also UMNO members. The party's first president was [[Ahmad Fuad Hassan]], an UMNO cleric. He lasted in the position only until 1953, when he fell out of favour with the party, which was now developing a more distinct identity, and returned to the UMNO fold. Fuad's departure coincided with the end of dual membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party turned to [[Abbas Alias]], a Western-educated medical doctor, as its second president, although he did not play an active role in the party and was little more than a nominal figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Funston|1976|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's first electoral test was the pre-independence [[Malayan general election, 1955|1955 election]] to the [[Federal Legislative Council]], the body that preceded the national parliament. 52 single-member seats were up for election; PAS fielded 11 candidates. Hampered by a lack of funds and party organisation, PAS succeeded in having only one candidate elected: [[Ahmad Tuan Hussein]], a teacher at an Islamic school in [[Kerian]], [[Perak]]. He was the only opposition member of the Council; the other 51 seats were won by members of the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance]] coalition between UMNO, the [[Malayan Chinese Association|Malaysian Chinese Association]] and the [[Malayan Indian Congress|Malaysian Indian Congress]]. PAS's performance in the election weakened its hand in negotiations with the British over the terms of Malayan independence. Its advocacy for the protection of Malay and Muslim rights, including the recognition of Islam as the country's official religion, was ignored. Alias stepped down from the presidency in 1956, handing it voluntarily to the radical nationalist [[Burhanuddin al-Helmy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change exemplified a broader trend among PAS's leadership in the late 1950s: the party's upper echelons gradually became filled with nationalists and long-time UMNO opponents, replacing the UMNO clerics who had initially led the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Funston|1976|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burhanuddin al-Helmy era (1956–1969) ===
Burhanuddin al-Helmy, a prominent anti-colonialist, steered PAS in a socialist and nationalist direction and set about strengthening the party's internal structure and geographic reach. In the [[Malayan general election, 1959|1959 election]], Malaya's first since independence, the party's focus on rural constituencies, especially in the north, paid off. Thirteen PAS candidates were elected to the 104-member [[Dewan Rakyat|House of Representatives]], and the party took control of the legislative assemblies of the northern states of [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liow|2009|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Burhanuddin's leftist pas-Islamism, under which PAS sought greater ties between the Muslim peoples of Malaya and the Indonesian archipelago, soon led the party into a [[Wedge issue|wedge]]. The [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] (''Konfrontasi'') of 1963–66 turned popular Malayan opinion against Indonesia. PAS's attacks on [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]'s Alliance government for seeking Western assistance during the confrontation, and the party's continued support for Southeast Asian pas-Islamism, led to a loss of support in the [[Malaysian general election, 1964|1964 election]]. The party's parliamentary cohort was reduced to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became further marginalised the following year, when Burhanuddin was detained without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] on allegations that he had collaborated with Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political circumstances in the country had changed by the [[Malaysian general election, 1969|1969 election]]. The ''Konfrontasi'' had ended, Burhanuddin had been released from custody although was too ill to campaign actively, and the Alliance coalition was suffering internal division and unpopularity. PAS's vote rose to over 20 percent of the national electorate, netting the party 12 seats in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parliament would not convene until 1971. [[13 May Incident|Race riots]] after the election caused Tunku Abdul Rahman to suspend Parliament and declare a state of emergency. The country would be run by a [[National Operations Council]] for the following two years. In the meantime, Burhanuddin died in October 1969 and was replaced as PAS's President by his deputy, [[Asri Muda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asri Muda era (1970–1982) ===
Asri came to the presidency having been PAS's de facto leader during Burhanuddin's long illness.&lt;ref name="Chin Tong 2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin Tong|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this did not mean a seamless transition for the party. While Burhanuddin had been sympathetic to left-wing causes and parties in Malaysia, Asri was first and foremost a Malay nationalist, and was hostile to leftist politics. One of his first acts as President of PAS was to part ways with the party's opposition allies on the left, such as the [[Parti Rakyat Malaysia|Malaysian People's Party]] (PRM). Ideologically, Asri's presidency would see the party shift markedly away from the pas-Islamism of Burhanuddin. The party became principally concerned with the protection and advancement of the rights of ethnic Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's activities also became solely focused on party politics, as reflected in the change of its name in 1971 from the "Persatuan Islam Se-Malaysia" (Pan-Malaysian Islamic Association) to the "Parti Islam Se-Malaysia" (PAS-Malaysian Islamic Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Asri's most radical change was still to come. In January 1972, he announced, after negotiations with UMNO, that PAS would be joining the Alliance coalition (which would soon rebadge itself as the [[Barisan Nasional]]). After two decades as an opposition party, PAS would now be in government, but as a junior partner of its main rival UMNO. The move was controversial within PAS, and some of its members and senior leaders either left the party or were purged by Asri. Asri's principal justification for joining UMNO in a coalition government was that after the 1969 race riots, Malay unity was paramount, and that this required a partnership between the country's two ethnic-Malay political parties. Asri himself became a minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malaysian general election, 1974|1974 election]] saw PAS competing under the Barisan Nasional banner for the first and only time. The party won 14 parliamentary seats to UMNO's 62, cementing PAS's position as the junior of the coalition partners. PAS also found itself governing in coalition in Kelantan, which it had previously governed in its own right. PAS's vote in its northern strongholds was weakened by a loss of support to both its former opposition allies and renegade PAS candidates running on anti-Barisan Nasional tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it was Kelantan, Asri's home state and the base of political power, that would trigger the downfall of the UMNO–PAS partnership. After a conflict between Asri and the UMNO-favoured chief minister of the state, [[Mohamad Nasir]], over investigations that Nasir initiated into Asri's financial dealings, Asri mobilised the PAS members of the [[Kelantan State Legislative Assembly]] to move a no-confidence motion against Nasir. The UMNO assemblymen staged a walk-out, abandoning Asri, driving an irreparable wedge through the coalition and causing a political crisis in the state. The Prime Minister [[Hussein Onn]] declared an emergency in the state, allowing the federal government to take control. Asri withdrew PAS from Barisan Nasional in December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malaysian general election, 1978|1978 election]] underscored how disastrous PAS's foray into the Barisan Nasional had been. The party was reduced to five parliamentary seats and, in separate state-level elections in Kelantan, was routed by UMNO and the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Front]] (Berjasa), which Nasir had founded after leaving PAS. The party's fortunes in the Kelantan election were not helped by a ban on public election rallies; while the Barisan Nasional was able to campaign through a compliant mass media, public talks were the principal way in which PAS could reach voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sundaram &amp; Ahmad|1988|p=850}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS fared little better in the [[Malaysian general election, 1982|1982 election]]. In the face of a new prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], and the decision of the popular Islamist youth leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]] to join UMNO instead of PAS, the party was unable to improve on its five parliamentary seats and failed to regain government in Kelantan. Meanwhile, the 1978 to 1982 period coincided with the rise of a new generation of leaders within the party, including foreign-educated Muslim clerics (or "[[ulama]]") such as [[Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat]] and [[Abdul Hadi Awang]]. This group sought to reorient PAS as an Islamist party and were fundamentally hostile to UMNO, whose Malay nationalist focus they saw to be at the expense of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=95–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the group succeeded in electing [[Yusof Rawa]] to the deputy presidency of the party, ousting the Asri loyalist [[Abu Bakar Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sundaram &amp; Ahmad|1988|p=852}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of PAS's 1982 assembly, it was clear to Asri that the ulama faction had the numbers to defeat him. He resigned on the floor of the assembly, and subsequently attacked the party through the media, leading to his expulsion. The following year, Yusof was elevated to the presidency, unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ulama takeover (1982–1989) ===
The ulama who took over PAS in 1982 drew from the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]] for inspiration in establishing an Islamic state; Yusof Rawa himself had served as Malaysia's Ambassador to Iran in the years preceding the revolution. Yusof openly rejected the Malay nationalism that characterised both UMNO and PAS under Asri Muda, considering it a narrow and ignorant philosophy that was contrary to the concept of a Muslim [[ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As if to exemplify the shift in the party's ideological outlook under Yusof and his ulama colleagues, the party's new leaders adopted a more conservative and religious form of dress, abandoning Malay and western clothing for traditional Arab religious garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hooker &amp; Norani|2003|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Politics between UMNO and PAS became increasingly religious in nature.  The Barisan Nasional government tried to counter the possible electoral appeal of PAS's Islamisation by creating a number of state-run Islamic institutions, such as the [[International Islamic University of Malaysia]].  PAS leaders responded by labelling such initiatives as superficial and hypocritical, UMNO leaders as "infidels" and UMNO as the "party of the devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly divisive rhetoric between UMNO and PAS produced deep divisions in Malay communities, especially in the northern states. Sometimes the divisions became violent, the most infamous example being the 1985 [[Memali incident]], in which the government sanctioned a raid on a village led by the PAS cleric [[Ibrahim Libya]], which left 14 civilians and four policemen dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liow|2009|pp=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was against this backdrop that the PAS ulama faced their [[Malaysian general election, 1986|first general election]] in 1986. The result was a whitewash for the Barisan Nasional coalition. PAS recorded its worst-ever election result, retaining only one seat in Parliament. PAS, in recovering from the defeat, had no choice but to retreat from its hardline Islamism and pursue a moderate course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liow|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, Yusof had become too ill to remain as PAS's President, and was replaced by his deputy, [[Fadzil Noor]], another member of the ulama faction that now dominated the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral revival in the 1990s ===
[[File:Nik Aziz Kelantan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat]] became the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of [[Kelantan]] in 1990, and remained in the post for 23 years.]]
While not abandoning PAS's ideological commitment to the establishment of an Islamic state, Fadzil Noor moderated the party's rhetoric. He also set about infusing the party's membership with young urban professionals in an attempt to diversify the leadership ranks beyond religious clerics.&lt;ref name="Chin Tong 2007"/&gt; The 1990s also saw PAS engage in international Islamist movements. [[Abdul Hadi Awang]] became active in a number of international Islamic organisations and delegations, and Islamist parties abroad sent delegations to Malaysia to observe PAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first electoral test of Fadzil's presidency was the [[Malaysian general election, 1990|1990 election]], which occurred against the backdrop of a split in UMNO out of which the [[Semangat 46]] opposition party was formed. PAS joined Semangat 46 and two other Malay parties in the [[Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah|United Ummah Front]] ("Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah"), and won seven parliamentary seats. The new coalition swept the Barisan Nasional from power in Kelantan, winning all of its state assembly seats. [[Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat]], a cleric who played a leading role in the 1982 takeover of the party, became Kelantan's Chief Minister, and would remain in the position until his retirement in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first acts of the PAS-led government in Kelantan was to seek to introduce [[hudud]], a criminal punishment system for particular Islamic offences. The move was abandoned after it became clear that the law could not be enforced over the objections of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS retained its seven parliamentary seats and the government of Kelantan in the [[Malaysian general election, 1995|1995 election]] while all other opposition parties lost ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Malaysian general election, 1999|next election]], in 1999, circumstances external to PAS had changed its fortunes for the better. The [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] split the Barisan Nasional government between supporters of the Prime Minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], and his deputy, [[Anwar Ibrahim]]. Mahathir's sacking of Anwar in 1998 provoked widespread opposition, which PAS capitalised on more than any other opposition party. The party ran a sophisticated campaign for the 1999 election, taking advantage of the internet to bypass restrictions on print publications and managing to woo urban professional voters while retaining its traditional rural support base. For the first time, PAS joined the centre-left and secular [[Democratic Action Party]] in a coalition—the [[Barisan Alternatif]]—which also included Anwar Ibrahim's new party [[Keadilan]]. The result was PAS's best ever. The party took 27 of 192 parliamentary seats and won landslide state-level victories in Kelantan and Terengganu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=155–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PAS in the 21st century ===
The death of Fadzil Noor in 2002, and his replacement by the conservative cleric [[Abdul Hadi Awang]], coincided with a period of division within the party between its younger and professional leaders, who sought to make PAS's Islamist ideology more appealing to mainstream Malaysia, and its conservative, and generally older, clerics. The party was unable to reconcile the views of the two factions with a coherent definition of the "Islamic state" that the party's platform envisioned.&lt;ref name="Chin Tong 2007"/&gt; The debate itself caused the DAP to break with the Barisan Alternatif coalition; as a secular party with mainly an ethnic Chinese support base, it could not support the vision of an Islamic state propagated by PAS's conservatives. PAS also found itself losing Malay support following the replacement of Mahathir as Prime Minister with [[Abdullah Badawi]], a popular and moderate Muslim, and post-[[11 September attacks|11 September]] fears among the electorate about radical Islam in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Function|2006|pp=139–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the 1999 election had been the party's zenith, the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 poll]] was one of the lowest points in its history. In an expanded Parliament, PAS was reduced to seven seats. Abdul Hadi not only lost his parliamentary seat but saw the government he led in Terengganu thrown from office after one term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response of PAS to the 2004 election, like its response to the similar 1986 wipeout, was to abandon the hardline image that had contributed to its defeat. By now, the urban professional wing of the party's membership, brought into the party by [[Fadzil Noor]] in the 1990s, was ready to take charge. While Abdul Hadi's presidency was not under threat, the moderate faction, known as the "Erdogans" after the moderate Turkish Islamist leader [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], had its members voted into other key positions in the party's 2005 general assembly.&lt;ref name="Chin Tong 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS was now able to attack Abdullah Badawi's government from both the right and the left: on the one hand, it criticised Abdullah's promotion of [[Islam Hadhari]] as a watered-down version of Islam; on the other, it attacked the government for its human rights record and promoted the causes of social and economic justice, including for non-Muslims. The party also capitalised on the growth of the internet and social media in Malaysia to bypass the pro-government mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]] PAS joined the DAP and [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR) in a new coalition, the [[Pakatan Rakyat]]. The coalition handed the Barisan Nasional its worst-ever election result. Barisan Nasional lost its two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, disabling it from passing constitutional amendments without opposition support. PAS won 23 seats; the Pakatan Rakyat won 82. At a state level, decades-old Barisan Nasional governments fell in [[Kedah]], [[Perak]] and [[Selangor]]. PAS now governed Kedah and Kelantan (led respectively by [[Azizan Abdul Razak]] and [[Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat]]) and supplied the Chief Minister of Perak ([[Nizar Jamaluddin]]) in a Pakatan Rakyat coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS's 2009 general assembly saw latent fissures within the party come out into the open. The incumbent deputy president [[Nasharudin Mat Isa]], a Malay nationalist who promoted greater co-operation between PAS and UMNO, was challenged by two moderate candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasharudin survived with the backing of the conservative ulama faction; his two opponents had split the moderate vote. But at the 2011 assembly, Nasharudin was not so lucky: [[Mohamad Sabu]], a leading moderate close to Anwar Ibrahim, commanded the support of the "Erdogan" wing and toppled him. Sabu's election was a significant defeat for the ulama faction. He was the first non-cleric to serve as the party's deputy president in over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mueller|2014|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakatan Rakyat coalition went into the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]] facing [[Najib Razak]], who had replaced Abdullah as Prime Minister in 2009 but failed to improve the government's fortunes, especially among urban voters. PAS made a concerted effort to expand its voter base beyond the northern peninsula states, and campaigned heavily in [[Johor]], where it had never won a parliamentary seat. The election witnessed a significant degree of cross-over ethnic voting: Chinese voters in Malay-majority seats decided in large numbers to support PAS, to maximise the chances of a national Pakatan Rakyat victory. Pakatan Rakyat won 50.8 percent of the national popular vote although fell short of forming government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS, however, suffered a net loss of two parliamentary seats. This was principally attributable to a swing against the party in Kedah, where the party was removed from state government after one term and lost four parliamentary seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mole.my/content/pas-loses-kedah-some-support-kelantan|title=PAS loses Kedah &amp; some support in Kelantan|date=6 May 2013|work=Bernama|accessdate=17 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042413/http://mole.my/content/pas-loses-kedah-some-support-kelantan|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology and policies ==
[[File:PAS Flag.svg|thumbnail|Alternative flag of PAS, occasionally flown along the official full-moon-on-a-green-field flag]]
According to [[Farish A. Noor]], a Malaysian academic who has written a complete history of PAS:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the day PAS was formed, in November 1951, the long-term goal of creating an Islamic state in Malaysia has been the beacon that has driven successive generations of PAS leaders and members ever forward. What has changed is the meaning and content of the signifier 'Islamic state'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From time to time, PAS's pursuit of an "Islamic state" has involved attempts to legislate for ''[[hudud]]''—an Islamic criminal justice system—in the states that it governs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-islam/islamic-law-debate-puts-more-pressure-on-malaysia-pm-idUSKBN0N70BH20150416|title=Islamic law debate puts more pressure on Malaysia PM|author1=Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah|author2=Praveen Menon|author3=Trinna Leong|author4=John Chalmers|author5=Mark Bendeich|publisher=Reuters|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{*}} {{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/opinions-divided-in-kelantan-over-hudud-law-debate|title=Opinions divided in Kelantan over hudud law debate|work=Reuters|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{*}} {{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/31/asia/malaysia-hudud-bill/|title=Push for hudud law raises tensions in Malaysia|author=Zan Azlee|publisher=CNN|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws would apply to all Muslims and would not apply to non-Muslims. PAS-dominated state assemblies in Kelantan and Terengganu passed ''hudud'' laws in the early 1990s and early 2000s respectively, although neither has ever been enforced due to opposition from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liow|2009|pp=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS returned to its pursuit of ''hudud'' laws after the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]], signalling that it would table bills in the federal Parliament to allow the laws, still on the statute books in Kelantan, to be enforced. The bills would require a two-thirds majority in the Parliament as they involve constitutional amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.news.yahoo.com/kelantan-consider-smaller-guillotine-thieves-under-hudud-law-024326655.html|title=Kelantan to consider ‘smaller’ guillotine for thieves under hudud law, says report|work=The Malaysian Insider|publisher=Yahoo!

After PAS's electoral routing in 2004, the party sought to broaden its policies beyond Islamism. Among other things, the party focused on calling for improved civil liberties and race relations. However, these policy shifts have proven controversial within the party; conservatives have considered them part of a dilution of PAS's commitment to an Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liow|first1=Joseph Chinyong|last2=Pasuni|first2=Afif|editor1-last=Weiss|editor1-first=Meredith|title=Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Malaysia|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317629590|page=54|chapter=Islam, the state and politics in Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2004/01/07/dress-code-ruling-draws-flak/|title=Dress code ruling draws flak|publisher=The Star|date=7 January 2004|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{*}} {{cite web|url=http://www.weldd.org/our-voices/malaysia-new-pas-terengganu-dress-code-women-sparks-furore|title=Malaysia: New PAS Terengganu dress code for women sparks furore|publisher=Weldd|date=7 January 2004|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{*}} {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/letters/2004/01/12/pas-violating-rights-with-dress-code/|title=PAS violating rights with dress code|publisher=The Star|date=12 January 2004|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When PAS was defeated in Terengganu, enforcement of female dress codes was reduced. The state PAS government in Kelantan bans traditional Malay dance theatres, banned advertisements depicting women who are not fully clothed, and enforced the wearing of headscarves, although they allowed gender segregated cinemas and concerts. Some government-controlled bodies pressure non-Muslims to also wear headscarves, and all students of the International Islamic University of Malaysia and female officers in the Royal Malaysian Police are required to wear headscarves in public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90143.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report [Archived Content]|publisher=US Department of State|year=2007|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAS party wishes that the death penalty be enacted for Muslims who attempt to convert, as part of their ultimate desire to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Chinyong Liow|title=Piety and Politics: Islamism in Contemporary Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_5cCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87|date=7 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-045209-4|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties and linkages with the Muslim Brotherhood===
PAS has also maintained close personal and ideological ties with the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]].{{sfn|Müller|2014|p=2}} The party's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood dates back to the 1940s when PAS's founders were exposed to the ideas and teachings of the Muslim Brotherhood while they were studying in Cairo during the 1940s. According to Wan Saiful Wan Jan of the think tank [[Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs]], the Muslim Brotherhood regards PAS as a model for a successful Muslim political party; since PAS has governed the state of Kelantan continually since 2002. PAS representatives are often invited to Muslim Brotherhood speaking engagements overseas. In 2012, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang spoke alongside Muslim Brotherhood scholar Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] at a speaking event in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chew|first1=Amy|title=The rising force in Malaysia's opposition|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201321092433869462.html|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, PAS representatives met with Muslim Brotherhood leaders Sheikh Mahdi Akif and Dr Muhammad Badie in Cairo.&lt;ref name="PAS President 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presiden.pas.org.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:pas-tegaskan-pendirian-bersama-ikhwanul-muslimin&amp;catid=14:kenyataan-rasmi&amp;Itemid=56|title=PAS tegaskan pendirian bersama Ikhwanul Muslimin|language=Malay|publisher=PAS President|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=15 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404045418/http://presiden.pas.org.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:pas-tegaskan-pendirian-bersama-ikhwanul-muslimin&amp;catid=14:kenyataan-rasmi&amp;Itemid=56|archivedate=4 April 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Müller, PAS's current generation of leaders, the Ulama Leadership (''Kepimpinan Ulama'') were also influenced by Muslim Brotherhood ideology while studying in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India during the 1980s. Muslim Brotherhood–inspired Islamic education methods (''tarbiyah'') and regular study circles (''usrah/halaqah'') were systematically introduced while networks were established with Muslim political parties and movements abroad.{{sfn|Müller|2014|p=54-55}} In April 2014, Awang criticised the governments of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates for designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref name="PAS President 2014" /&gt; In January 2016, former PAS leader [[Mujahid Yusof Rawa]] claimed that the Muslim Brotherhood's influence on PAS was limited to sharing the organisation's views on the role of Islam in society. Rawa also claimed that other local Muslim groups such as ''[[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia]]'' (ABIM; Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia) and IKRAM were also sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukry|first1=Anisah|title=‘Muslim Brotherhood influence not a problem in Malaysia’|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/%E2%80%98muslim-brotherhood-influence-not-problem-malaysia%E2%80%99|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=[[The Edge (Malaysia)|''The Edge'']]|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and membership ==
PAS's general assembly ("Muktamar") elects the party's President, Deputy President, three Vice-Presidents and a multi-member Central Working Committee. The assembly is held annually, but elections occur only in every second year. The assembly is composed mainly of delegates elected by individual local divisions of the party.&lt;ref name="Mueller 2014 46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mueller|2014|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day-to-day administration of the party is carried out by its Secretary-General, a position appointed by the party's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chin Tong|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Working Committee is ostensibly the party's principal decision-making body, although its decisions are susceptible to being overturned by the Syura Council, an unelected body composed only of Muslim clerics and led by the party's Spiritual Leader ("Musyidul 'Am").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liow|2009|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the different administrative bodies within the party occasionally causes conflict. In 2014, the Central Working Committee voted to support the nomination of [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], the President of the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR), to be the Chief Minister of the [[Pakatan Rakyat]] government in [[Selangor]]. [[Abdul Hadi Awang]], as PAS's president and with the backing of the Syura Council, overturned the decision and nominated different candidates.&lt;ref name=Akil&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/09/08/PAS-syura-council-subject-muktamar/|title=PAS syura council must abide by muktamar resolutions, says Wan Saiful|last=Akil Yunus|date=8 September 2014|work=The Star|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has three recognised sub-organisations for different categories of party members: an [[ulama]] wing (the "Dewan Ulama") for Muslim clerics, a women's wing (the "Dewan Muslimat") and a youth wing (the "Dewan Pemuda"). Each wing elects its own leadership at its own general assembly.&lt;ref name=Akil/&gt; There is a fourth wing for non-Muslim supporters of the party, although it does not have the same recognised position in the party's structure as the other three wings.&lt;ref name="Mueller 2014 46"/&gt;

PAS has approximately one million members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2012|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than any other opposition party in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farish|2014|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS members often distinguish themselves from UMNO members through cultural and religious practices. For Islamic headwear, males who support PAS tend to prefer the white, soft ''kopiah'', while UMNO supporters tend to wear the traditional Malay ''[[songkok]]'', a rigid black cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daniels|2005|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of Malaysia host rival mosques catering for the members and supporters of each party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riddell|2005|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission Zero House ==
Grocoff first gained national attention for the rehabilitation of his Victorian-era [[Zero-energy building|Mission Zero house]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The '''Military Religious Freedom Foundation''' ('''MRFF''') is a watchdog group and advocacy organization founded in 2005 by [[Michael L. Weinstein|Michael Weinstein]]. The group's stated goals are to "ensure that members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] receive the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] guarantee of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] to which they are entitled by virtue of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/about/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinstein describes the group's target as "a small subset of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] that's called [[Premillennialism|premilliennial]], [[Dispensationalism|dispensational]], [[Christian Reconstructionism|reconstructionist]], [[Dominionism|dominionist]], [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]], or just [[Dominionism|Dominionist Christianity]]."&lt;ref name=CSPAN-GODSIDE&gt;[http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=200006-1&amp;tID=5 "With God on Our Side" Talk given July 10, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231107/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=200006-1&amp;tID=5 |date=September 27, 2007 }} at [[Hammer Museum]], Los Angeles.

==Background==
The organization was founded by [[USAFA]] graduate and former [[United States Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps|USAF Judge Advocate General's Corps]] officer [[Michael L. Weinstein|Michael Weinstein]] in 2005 for the purpose of opposing the spread of alleged religious intimidation by Christians in positions of power within the US military.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/12/13/weinstein/index_np.html|title=These people should be court-martialed|publisher=salon.com|date=December 13, 2006|author=Alex Kopperman|accessdate=2008-02-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306151810/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/12/13/weinstein/index_np.html|archivedate=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Weinstein said he experienced discrimination due to his Jewish faith while a cadet at the [[United States Air Force Academy]]. After his sons reportedly experienced discrimination as well while at the Academy, Weinstein founded the MRFF in 2005. He describes the group's target as "a small subset of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] that's called [[Premillennialism|premilliennial]], [[Dispensationalism|dispensational]], [[Christian Reconstructionism|reconstructionist]], [[Dominionism|dominionist]], [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]], or just [[Dominionism|Dominionist Christianity]]."&lt;ref name=CSPAN-GODSIDE/&gt; He further characterized their target as ""incredibly well-funded gangs of fundamentalist Christian monsters who terrorize their fellow Americans by forcing their weaponized and twisted version of Christianity upon their helpless subordinates in our nation's armed forces."&lt;ref name="CSPAN-NEWBAG"&gt;Michael Weinstein (April 16, 2013).

From its inception, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation has advocated for many active duty U.S. servicemen/women and veterans who have contacted the MRFF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-07-08/us/atheist.soldier_1_tours-discrimination-bible?_s=PM%3AUS|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709030728/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-07-08/us/atheist.soldier_1_tours-discrimination-bible?_s=PM%3AUS|deadurl=yes|title=Atheist soldier sues Army for 'unconstitutional' discrimination - CNN|date=9 July 2012|archivedate=9 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding alleged religious discrimination, harassment and aggressive proselytizing by Fundamentalist Christians.  MRFF reports that it currently represents over 50,000 active duty U.S. marines, sailors, soldiers, airmen, cadets, midshipmen, national guard, reservists and veterans, about 96% of whom self-identify as practicing Christians. Of the remaining 4%, MRFF represents Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Native American Spiritualist, Humanist, Pagan, Atheist, slightly over 18% of all Muslim Americans in the U.S. military, other minority faith and non-faith military members, and slightly under 1,000 LGBT military members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/events|title=MRFF official website]; April 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2012, advisory board member [[Glen Doherty]], a Roman Catholic, died in the [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi]], [[Libya]].&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellement|first=John R.|title=Winchester native among victims of Libya attack|url=http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/09/13/winchester-native-one-four-americans-killed-libya-consulate-attack-benghazi/85pjpmEnsiSRkKWs0th28J/story.html|accessdate=September 13, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRFF founder [[Michael L.

On November 13, 2014, for the sixth consecutive year, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation was officially nominated again for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize (its seventh total nomination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/about/michael-l-mikey-weinstein|title=About Mikey Weinstein, MRFF's Founder and President|date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
MRFF has filed multiple federal lawsuits against the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense, with military members as co-plaintiffs, asserting a pattern and practice of constitutionally impermissible promotions of religion by the military. MRFF founder Weinstein has spoken to students at a number of the U.S. military's educational institutions: The U.S. Air Force Academy's National Character and Leadership Symposium, the Air Force JAG School, the Air Command and Staff College, and the US Army War College.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Chief among the violations was the obtaining of permission to film the video at the Pentagon by means of a willful "[mischaracterization] of the purpose and proponent of the video" by Chaplain (Colonel) Ralph G. Benson, as well as the acts of officers who used their name, rank, and uniforms as a means towards endorsing the Christian Embassy proselytizing message.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/12/AR2007081200968.html Pulling Rank on Religion], washingtonpost.com, August 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-aslan22aug22,0,4674900.story?coll=la-opinion-center Not so fast, Christian soldiers], latimes.com; retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the California Council of Churches IMPACT (CCCI), a public policy advocacy organization which represents numerous and diverse mainstream Christian and Orthodox Christian communities, formally announced its endorsement of the MRFF's mission, with CCCI Board President Rev. John Freeseman stating "Our alignment with the Military Religious Freedom Foundation is on behalf of religious freedom for all people, regardless of belief or non-belief. It is not the function of the U.S. Military to proselytize our troops but to protect our constitutional freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/press-releases/ccci_release.html California Christian Organization Endorses Military Religious Freedom Foundation]; retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Colonel Kimberly Toney, commander of the USAF's [[501st Combat Support Wing]] sent an email with a link to a religious-themed web video about the life story of [[Nick Vujicic]]. The sponsoring site of the video, 4marks.com, is a Catholic website. USAF service members who looked at the site after following the emailed link complained that the site contained criticism of President [[Barack Obama]]. Weinstein said the incident represented a textbook case of improper religious influence and added, "There's a pervasive pattern of constitutional abuse when you have a wing commander who sends out a direct, proselytizing e-mail with a link to a Web site that slanders the president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lichtblau, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/washington/15video.html Air Force Looks Into ‘Inspirational’ Video]", ''[[New York Times]]'', March 15, 2009, pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooting]] in November 2009, the religious right [[American Family Association]] issued the statement "No More Muslims in the US Military", which explicitly stated that Muslim military enlistees be barred from military service in the United States armed forces on the grounds that "... just as Christians are taught to imitate the life of Christ, so Muslims are taught to imitate the Prophet in all things.

The MRFF initiated the January 2010 media coverage of the [[Jesus rifles]] controversy, when rifle scopes manufactured by US government contractor [[Trijicon]] were discovered to be engraved with scripture citations. Following the breaking of this story by [[ABC News]], the outrage provoked by this discovery was voiced by a diverse range of religious and political constituencies and within a week of the ABC News report, Trijicon announced that it would halt the engraving of the biblical inscriptions on all products sold to the government.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (January 22, 2011) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8474268.stm US firm to remove Biblical references on gunsights]; retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckholm, Erik, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22guns.html Firm to Remove Bible References From Gun Sights], "New York Times", January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the MRFF demanded that the US Army cease and desist their policy of administering a "spiritual fitness" component to the mandatory [[Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] program test, whereby soldiers' combat-readiness and ability are judged on the basis of their religiosity.

U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello ruled the plaintiffs (which included the MRFF and USAFA professor David Mullin) lacked sufficient legal standing to challenge the event.&lt;ref&gt;The Denver Post, February 2, 2011 [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_17345033 Judge rejects bid to stop Air Force Academy prayer luncheon]; retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;The Washington Post, August 2, 2011 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/checkpoint-washington/post/air-force-suspends-ethics-course-that-used-bible-passages-to-train-missile-launch-officers/2011/08/02/gIQAv6V2pI_blog.html Air Force suspends ethics course that used Bible passages to train missile launch officers], washingtonpost.com; retrieved August 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States Air Force, in response to the pressure caused by the release of internal training material via a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, revised the ethical indocrination course material to which nuclear missile launch officers were exposed as a standard component of their training. The course was defended by a spokesman for the Air Force's Air Training and Education Command as a means towards "[helping] folks understand why we're doing what we're doing. In the missile launch industry, it takes a certain mindset to be able to walk in the door and say, yes, I can do that"&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Included in the a course is the [[PowerPoint]] presentation [http://truthout.org/files/nuclear_ethics.pdf Who Are You When No One Is Looking: Five Ethical Principles For Service To The Air Force], a presentation which reveals a Christian [[militarist]] perspective and which heavily quotes [[Judeo-Christian]] [[scripture]] and contains a synopsis of the [[Just War Theory]] of [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]. Controversially, the PowerPoint also contains a slide excerpting the words of former [[Nazi Party]] member, [[SS]] [[Sturmbannführer]], [[aerospace engineer]] and [[rocket scientist]] [[Wernher Von Braun]], who is quoted as stating that "We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon [the ballistic missile] to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world best be secured", in reference to his 1945 surrender to American occupation forces and subsequent recruitment by the United States [[Office of Strategic Services]] via [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Jason.

According to the '''Native Administration Act, 1927''' (Act No. 38 of 1927; subsequently renamed the '''Bantu Administration Act, 1927''' and the '''Black Administration Act, 1927'''), the [[Governor-General of South Africa]] could "banish a 'native' or 'tribe' from one area to another whenever he deemed this 'expedient or in the general public interest'.

This Act set up a separate legal system for the administration of African law and made the proclaimed Black areas subject to a separate political regime from the remainder of the country, ultimately subject only to rule by proclamation, not parliament.

The central imperative behind the Act was to establish a strong enough system of national 'native administration' to contain the political pressures that were likely to result from the legislative measures necessary for the implementation of territorial segregation. It was, together with the [[Native Affairs Act, 1920]], part of a process of transferring power over the regulation of African life from Parliament to the executive.

Moreover, it included a clause which stated: "Any person who utters any words or does any other act or thing whatever with intent to promote any feeling of hostility between Natives and Europeans, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to a fine of one hundred pounds or both", thus it became popularly known as the "hostility law".

==Repeal==
Many provisions of the act became unconstitutional on the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa]] on 27 April 1994, which invalidated all laws which unfairly discriminated on the basis of race. The remaining provisions of the act have been repealed, or will be repealed on a future date, by the [[Repeal of the Black Administration Act and Amendment of Certain Laws Act, 2005]].

The '''Night of the Long Knives''' ([[German language|German]]: {{audio|De-Nacht der langen Messer.ogg|''Nacht der langen Messer''}}), or the '''Röhm Purge''', also called '''Operation Hummingbird''' (German: ''Unternehmen Kolibri'') was a [[purge]] that took place in [[Nazi Germany]] from June 30 to July 2, 1934, when [[Adolf Hitler]], urged on by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]], carried out a series of political [[extrajudicial]] executions intended to consolidate his hold on power in Germany, as well as to alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of [[Ernst Röhm]] and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), the Nazis' own mass [[paramilitary]] organization. Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent [[coup]] by the SA under Röhm - the so-called ''Röhm putsch''.

The primary instruments of Hitler's action, who carried out most of the killings, were the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler, and the [[Gestapo]], the [[secret police]].  Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being Röhm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the socialist-leaning [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] faction of the [[Nazi Party]], including its figurehead, [[Gregor Strasser]], were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Bavaria]]n politician [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], who had suppressed Hitler's Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.

Hitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to conciliate leaders of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of Röhm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with Röhm's outspoken support for a "second revolution" to redistribute wealth. In Röhm's view, President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg's]] appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30, 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power, but had left unfulfilled the party's larger goals. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate [[German resistance to Nazism|German critics]] of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], as well as to settle scores with old enemies.{{efn|name=Papen}}

[[Victims of the Night of the Long Knives|At least 85 people]] died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds,{{efn|name=Evans p39}}{{efn|name=Kershaw p517}}{{efn|name=Johnson_298}} with high estimates running from 700 to 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks p. 314 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}; citing:&lt;br&gt;- memoranda in the [[William E.

It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against [[extrajudicial killing]]s to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government.{{sfn|Johnson|1991|pp=298–299}} It established Hitler as the supreme administrator of justice of the German people, as he put it in his July 13 speech to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]].

Before its execution, its planners sometimes referred to the purge as ''Hummingbird'' (German: {{lang|de|Kolibri}}), the codeword used to send the execution squads into action on the day of the purge.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=515}} The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase "Night of the Long Knives" in the German language predates the killings and refers generally to acts of vengeance.

==Hitler and the ''Sturmabteilung'' (SA)==
[[File:Hitler 1928 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitler posing in [[Nuremberg]] with SA members in 1928. [[Julius Streicher]] is to the left of Hitler, and [[Hermann Göring]] stands beneath Hitler]]

[[President of Germany#Weimar Republic presidency|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on January 30, 1933.{{efn|name=1932 parliamentary elections}} Over the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|next few months]], during the so-called [[Gleichschaltung]], Hitler dispensed with the need for the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] as a [[legislature|legislative body]]{{efn|name=Enabling Act}} and eliminated all [[List of political parties in Germany#Parties existing before World War II|rival political parties]] in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a [[one-party state]] under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected [[veteran]] [[field marshal]]. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to [[conscription]], and a more aggressive [[foreign policy]], the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.

To a lesser extent, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organisation, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the [[Freikorps]] movement of the post-World War I years. The ''Freikorps'' were nationalistic organisations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans founded by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the ''Freikorps'' believed that the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution]] had [[Stab-in-the-back myth|betrayed]] them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the ''Freikorps'' were in opposition to the new [[Weimar Republic]], which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called "November criminals." Captain [[Ernst Röhm]] of the ''Reichswehr'' served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. Röhm was given the nickname "The Machine Gun King of Bavaria" in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. Röhm left the ''Reichswehr'' in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]]. Also known as the "brownshirts" or "stormtroopers," the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists.{{sfn|Reiche|2002|pp=120–121}} The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilisation of Germany's inter-war experiment with [[democracy]], the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=266}} In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=165}}

Hitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking. They would attack passers-by, and then attack the police who were called to stop them.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=23}} Complaints of "overbearing and loutish" behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The [[Federal Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=501}}

Hitler's move would be to strengthen his position with the army by moving against its nemesis, the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=435}} On July 6, 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]], or Nazi, [[Nazi seizure of power|brown revolution]]. Now that the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, "The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=20}}

Hitler's speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of [[Great Depression in Central Europe|the Great Depression]], when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively&amp;nbsp;– or even primarily&amp;nbsp;– a [[working class]] phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour.{{efn|name=Schoenbaum pp. 35–42}} Many stormtroopers believed in the [[socialism|socialist]] promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.{{efn|name=Bullock p80}}

==Conflict between the army and the SA==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14393, Ernst Röhm crop.jpg|thumb|upright|SA leader [[Ernst Röhm]] in [[Bavaria]] in 1934]]
No one in the SA spoke more loudly for "a continuation of the German revolution" (as one prominent stormtrooper put it) than Röhm.{{efn|name=Frei p126}} Röhm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of [[World War I]], Röhm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper.{{sfn|Frei|1987|p=13}} Röhm saw violence as a means to political ends. He took seriously the socialist promise of National Socialism, and demanded that Hitler and the other party leaders initiate wide-ranging socialist reform in Germany.

Not content solely with the leadership of the SA, Röhm [[lobbying|lobbied]] Hitler to appoint him [[defence minister|Minister of Defence]], a position held by the conservative General [[Werner von Blomberg]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=24}} Although nicknamed the "Rubber Lion" by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the [[Prussian nobility]], and regarded the SA as a [[Plebs|plebeian]] rabble that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|pp=712–739}}

If the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in [[Rummelsburg]], denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, "Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army."{{sfn|Bessel|1984|p=97}}

Despite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalised army. Röhm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the [[Prussian aristocracy]] altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}} In January 1934, Röhm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|p=726}}

In response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on February 28, 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, Röhm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, Röhm declared that he would not take instructions from "the ridiculous corporal"&amp;nbsp;– a demeaning reference to Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=26}} While Hitler did not take immediate action against Röhm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them.

==Growing pressure against the SA==
[[File:Vonpapen1 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz von Papen]], the conservative vice-chancellor who ran afoul of Hitler after denouncing the regime's failure to rein in the SA in his [[Marburg speech]]. (Picture taken 1946 at the Nuremberg trial)]]

Despite his earlier agreement with Hitler, Röhm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, Röhm's success could come only at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared Röhm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including [[Free State of Prussia|Prussian]] premier [[Hermann Göring]], [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], and Hitler's deputy [[Rudolf Hess]], positioning themselves against Röhm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only Röhm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. Röhm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned Göring, Minister-President of Prussia.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|p=33}} Finally in the spring of 1934, the growing rift between Röhm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], to start playing politics again.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315–316}} Schleicher criticised the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] and [[Werner von Alvensleben]] started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, Röhm Minister of Defence, [[Heinrich Brüning]] Foreign Minister and [[Gregor Strasser]] Minister of National Economy.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=315–316}} The British historian Sir [[John Wheeler-Bennett]], who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a "lack of discretion" that was "terrifying" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=316}} Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with Röhm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}

As a means of isolating Röhm, on April 20, 1934, Göring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, Göring believed, could be counted on to move against Röhm.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=29}} Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against Röhm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be "liquidated" started to circulate amongst Göring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} At the end of May two former Chancellors, Heinrich Brüning and Kurt von Schleicher, received warnings from friends in the ''Reichswehr'' that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} Brüning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}} By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=317}}

Demands for Hitler to constrain the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's [[homosexuality]] did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet [[Benito Mussolini]] on June 15.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=317–318}} Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary [[Otto Meißner]], Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] ordered the German Ambassador to Italy [[Ulrich von Hassell]]&amp;nbsp;– without Hitler's knowledge&amp;nbsp;– to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]] as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}} While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=318}}

On June 17, 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave [[Marburg speech|a speech]] at [[University of Marburg|Marburg University]] warning of the threat of a "second revolution."{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|pp=308–312}} Privately according to his memoirs, von Papen, a [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholic]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] with ties to army and industry, threatened to resign if Hitler did not act.{{sfn|Von Papen|1953|p=309}} While von Papen's resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler's position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative.

==Heydrich and Himmler==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-50-10, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|left|''SS-Brigadeführer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the Bavarian police and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], in Munich, 1934]]
In response to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring [[martial law]] and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|2005|pp=319–320}} Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, in part due to Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall&amp;nbsp;– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=31}}

In preparation for the purge, both Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that Röhm had been paid 12 million [[Reichsmark]] (EUR {{Format price|{{#expr:{{inflation|DE|12000000|1934|r=0}} / 1.95583}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) by France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on June 24 that Röhm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government ({{lang|de|Röhm-Putsch}}).{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=30}} At Hitler's direction, Göring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men Göring recruited to assist him was [[Willi Lehmann]], a Gestapo official and [[NKVD]] spy. On June 25, General [[Werner von Fritsch]] placed the ''Reichswehr'' on the highest level of alert.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=321}} On June 27, Hitler moved to secure the army's cooperation.{{sfn|O'Neill|1967|pp=72–80}} Blomberg and [[General]] [[Walther von Reichenau]], the army's liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling Röhm from the German Officers' League.{{sfn|Bullock|1958|p=165}} On June 28 Hitler went to [[Essen]] to attend a wedding celebration and reception; from there he called Röhm's adjutant at [[Bad Wiessee]] and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on June 30 at 11h.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=31}} On June 29, a signed article in ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the ''Reichswehr'' stood behind Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=322}}

==Purge==
[[File:ASchneidhuber.JPG|thumb|upright||August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police]]
{{Further information|Victims of the Night of the Long Knives}}

At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and his entourage flew into [[Munich]]. From the airport they drove to the [[Bavaria]]n Interior Ministry, where they assembled the leaders of an SA rampage that had taken place in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the [[epaulet]]s off the shirt of ''Obergruppenführer'' August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.{{sfn|Bullock|1958|p=166}}
[[File:Kurheim Hanselbauer.JPG|thumb|left|Hotel Lederer am See (former Kurheim Hanselbauer) in Bad Wiessee before its planned demolition in 2017.]]

With Hitler's arrival in Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel and Hitler personally placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. According to [[Erich Kempka]], Hitler turned Röhm over to "two detectives holding pistols with the safety catch removed."  The SS found [[Breslau]] SA leader [[Edmund Heines]] in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader.{{sfn|Kempka|1971}} Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on [[moral turpitude]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=514}} Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside the hotel and shot.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with Röhm and Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=32}}

Although Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by Röhm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=514}} Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced "the worst treachery in world history." Hitler told the crowd that "undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements" would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the "traitors."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=32}} Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned Göring at 10:00 with the codeword {{lang|de|Kolibri}} to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=514}} [[Sepp Dietrich]] received orders from Hitler for the ''[[Leibstandarte]]'' to form an "execution squad" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}} There in the prison courtyard, the ''Leibstandarte'' firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=23}} Those not immediately executed were taken back to the ''Leibstandarte'' barracks at [[Lichterfelde, Saxony-Anhalt|Lichterfelde]], given one-minute "trials", and shot by a firing squad.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n73/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pp=51, 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against conservatives and old enemies===

The regime did not limit itself to a purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary [[Herbert von Bose]] without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate [[Edgar Julius Jung|Edgar Jung]], the author of Papen's [[Marburg speech]], and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=34}} The Gestapo also murdered [[Erich Klausener]], the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33–34}}

Hitler and Himmler unleashed the Gestapo against old enemies, as well. Both [[Kurt von Schleicher]], Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home. Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], the former Bavarian state commissioner who crushed the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1996|pp=78–79}} Kahr's fate was especially gruesome. His body was found in a wood outside Munich; he had been hacked to death, apparently with pickaxes. The murdered included at least one accidental victim: [[Willi Schmid]], the music critic of the {{lang|de|Münchner Neuste Nachrichten}} newspaper.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=36}}{{r|gunther1940}} As Himmler's adjutant [[Karl Wolff]] later explained, friendship and personal loyalty were not allowed to stand in the way:

{{quote|Among others, a charming fellow [named] [[:de:Hans Erwin von Spreti-Weilbach|Karl von Spreti]], Röhm's personal adjutant. He held the same position with Röhm as I held with Himmler. [He] died with words "Heil Hitler" on his lips. We were close personal friends, we often dined together in Berlin. He lifted his arm in the Nazi salute and called out "Heil Hitler, I love Germany."{{sfn|The Waffen-SS 2002}}}}

Some SA members died saying "Heil Hitler" because they believed that an anti-Hitler SS plot had led to their execution.{{r|gunther1940}} Several leaders of the disbanded [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] were also murdered in the purge. The Party had generally been aligned with the Social Democrats and Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism, being critical of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]], but voting nonetheless for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] which granted Hitler dictatorial authority. {{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

===Röhm's fate===
Röhm was held briefly at [[Stadelheim Prison]]{{efn|name=Stadelheim Prison}} in Munich, while Hitler considered his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, [[Theodor Eicke]], Commandant of the [[Dachau concentration camp]], and his SS adjutant [[Michael Lippert|Michel Lippert]] visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they handed him a [[John Browning#Products|Browning]] pistol loaded with a single bullet and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself."{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=221}} Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=33}} Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=312}} In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert had been one of the few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.

==Aftermath==

As the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. Göring instructed police stations to burn "all documents concerning the action of the past two days."{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=517}} Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Röhm and Schleicher from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=36}} Then, on July 13, 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:

{{quote|If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this. In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people. I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason, and I further gave the order to cauterise down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life. Let the nation know that its existence—which depends on its internal order and security—cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=226}}{{sfn|Fest|1974|p=469}}}}

Concerned with presenting the massacre as legally sanctioned, Hitler had the cabinet approve a measure on July 3 that declared, "The measures taken on June 30, July 1 and 2 to suppress treasonous assaults are legal as acts of self-defence by the State."{{sfn|Fest|1974|p=468}} Reich Justice Minister [[Franz Gürtner]], a conservative who had been Bavarian Justice Minister in the years of the Weimar Republic, demonstrated his loyalty to the new regime by drafting the statute, which added a legal veneer to the purge.{{efn|name=Gürtner}} Signed into law by Hitler, Gürtner, and Minister of the Interior [[Wilhelm Frick]], the "Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defence" [[Amnesty law|retroactively legalised]] the murders committed during the purge.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=72}} Germany's legal establishment further capitulated to the regime when the country's leading legal scholar, [[Carl Schmitt]], wrote an article defending Hitler's July 13 speech. It was named "The Führer Upholds the Law."{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=519}}

===Reaction===

Almost unanimously, the army applauded the Night of the Long Knives, even though the generals [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] were among the victims. The ailing [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], Germany's highly revered military hero, sent a telegram expressing his "profoundly felt gratitude" and congratulated Hitler for "nipping treason in the bud."{{sfn|Fest|1974|p=470}} General von Reichenau went so far as to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with [[Ernst Röhm]] to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador [[André François-Poncet]], and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} François-Poncet was not declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government. The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2005|pp=33–34}} One retired captain, [[Erwin Planck]], seemed to realise this: "If you look on without lifting a finger," he said to his friend, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], "you will meet the same fate sooner or later."{{sfn|Höhne|1970|pp=113–118}} Another rare exception was Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.{{sfn|Schwarzmüller|1995|pp=299–306}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99203, Berlin, Wahlplakat für Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|Election poster for [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1932 (translation: "With him")]]
Rumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos.{{efn|name=Kershaw p87}} Luise Solmitz, a [[Hamburg]] schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's "personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness" in her private diary. She even compared him to [[Frederick the Great]], the 18th-century King of [[Prussia]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=39}} 

Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow [[Germans]]. "A very calm and easy going mailman," the diarist [[Victor Klemperer]] wrote, "who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply ''sentenced'' them.'" It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. "A chancellor," he wrote, "sentences and shoots members of his own private army!"{{sfn|Klemperer|1998|p=74}} The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it. 

Among the few exceptions were General [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]] and Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=328}} Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=328}} Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticised Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganise the government by firing Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]], [[Robert Ley]], Hermann Göring, [[Werner von Blomberg]], Joseph Goebbels and [[Richard Walther Darré]] from the Cabinet.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Instead, the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General [[Werner von Fritsch]] as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed) and [[Rudolf Nadolny]] as Foreign Minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the "distant friendliness" towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}} Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with:

{{quote|Excellency, the gravity of the moment has compelled us to appeal to you as our Supreme Commander. The destiny of our country is at stake. Your Excellency has thrice before saved Germany from foundering, at [[Battle of Tannenberg|Tannenberg]], at the end of the War and at the moment of your election as ''Reich'' President. Excellency, save Germany for the fourth time! The undersigned Generals and senior officers swear to preserve to the last breath their loyalty to you and the Fatherland.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=329}}}}

Hindenburg never responded to the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as [[Otto Meissner|Otto Meißner]], who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=330}} It is noteworthy that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they wanted to see continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=329–330}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0402-504, Generaloberst Werner von Blomberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Werner von Blomberg]] in 1934]]
In late 1934–early 1935, [[Werner von Fritsch]] and [[Werner von Blomberg]], who had been shamed into joining Hammerstein and Mackensen's rehabilitation campaign, successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating Generals von Schleicher and von Bredow.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=336}} Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July, which portrayed them as the vilest traitors, working against the Fatherland in the pay of France.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=336}} In a speech given on January 3, 1935 at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot "in error" on the basis of false information, and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=337}} Hitler's speech was not reported in the German press, but the army was appeased by the speech.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=337}} However, despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers, the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, Göring told [[Jan Szembek (diplomat)|Jan Szembek]] that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} During a meeting with Polish Ambassador [[Józef Lipski]] on May 22, 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was "rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the [[Rapallo Treaty]]."{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}} The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German–Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=327}}

Former [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], who was in exile in [[Doorn]], Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He asked, "What would people have said if I had done such a thing?"&lt;ref name=mac452&gt;Macdonogh 2001, pp. 452–53&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing of the murder of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, "We have ceased to live under the [[rule of law]] and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!"&lt;ref name=mac452 /&gt;

==SA leadership==
Hitler named [[Viktor Lutze]] to replace Röhm as head of the SA. Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to "homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living" in the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=520}} Lutze did little to assert the SA's independence in the coming years, and the SA lost its power in Germany. Membership in the organisation plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=40}}

According to [[Albert Speer|Speer]], "the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler&amp;nbsp;... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated."{{sfn|Speer|1995|pp=90-93}}

The Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as "the supreme leader of the German people", as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself ''[[de jure]]'' as well as ''[[de facto]]'' [[Sovereign immunity|above the reach of the law]]. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power.{{efn|name=Evans p72}} The Night of the Long Knives also sent a clear message to the public that even the most prominent Germans were not immune from arrest or even summary execution should the Nazi regime perceive them as a threat. In this manner, the purge established a pattern of violence that would characterise the Nazi regime.

Röhm was purged from all [[Nazi propaganda]], such as ''[[The Victory of Faith]]'', the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film about the 1933 [[Nuremberg rally]], which showed Röhm frequently alongside Hitler; a copy of the original survived and was found in the United Kingdom many years later.

'''Nthabiseng Mokoena''' is a prominent South African [[intersex]] activist&lt;ref name="hivos" /&gt; and an advisory board member for the first intersex human rights fund.&lt;ref name="astraea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soginews.com/boost-intersex-activists-organisations/ |title=Boost for Intersex activists and organisations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 16, 2015 |website=SOGI News.com |publisher=[[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights|RFSL]] |access-date=2015-07-02 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704060543/http://www.soginews.com/boost-intersex-activists-organisations/ |archivedate=July 4, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Mokoena describes how she was born with both male and female sexual characteristics, and struggled with shame and identity. Her mother was supportive, despite suffering blame and stigma for her different child.&lt;ref name="hivos"&gt;{{Cite web| last = [[Hivos]] | title = For Intersex activist Nthabiseng Mokoena, the shame is over| date = September 16, 2014| url = https://www.hivos.org/news/intersex-activist-nthabiseng-mokoena-shame-over}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaceproject.org/nthabiseng-mokoena/ |title= Nthabiseng Mokoena - The Interface Project |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=[[Advocates for Informed Choice#The Interface Project|The Interface Project]] |access-date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaceproject.org/transcript-nthabiseng-mokoena |title= Transcript - Nthabiseng Mokoena - December 10, 2012 - The Interface Project |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=[[Advocates for Informed Choice#The Interface Project|The Interface Project]] |access-date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Mokoena, meeting other intersex people helped to overcome feelings of shame.

Mokoena declined free clitoris reduction surgery aimed at creating a more feminine genital appearance. In doing so, Mokoena would have been a clinical case study, but she found this to be degrading. Mokoena says:

{{quotation|I am so pleased I never had surgery. The people I met, most of them, black and white, who have had surgery as babies, usually have confused parents who the doctors incorrect informed, and the children were subjected to surgery which has ended up being far more traumatic and confusing.”
“We have been raised in a world that makes us feel like monsters. My advice to other intersex people is to love and accept. Only then will you make the right decision about surgery.

'''Paul James''' (born 1958, [[Melbourne]]), is Professor of Globalization and Cultural Diversity at Western Sydney University, and Director of the Institute for Culture and Society where he has been since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uws.edu.au/ics/people/researchers/professor_paul_james|title=Professor Paul James|first=University of Western Sydney - Helen|last=Barcham|website=Uws.edu.au|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a writer on [[global politics]], globalization, sustainability, and social theory.

==Background==
After studying politics at the [[University of Melbourne]] James was a lecturer in the Department of Politics at [[Monash University]], Melbourne before moving to [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] in 2002 as Professor of Globalization and Cultural Diversity, the first professor of globalization in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/pauljames |title=James, Professor. Paul - RMIT University |publisher=Rmit.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At RMIT he led and secured funding for several successful initiatives, including the [[Global Cities Institute]] (Director, 2006–2013); the UN Global Compact Cities Programme (Director, 2007–2014); and the Globalism Institute (Founding Director, 2002-2007; now, the Centre for Global Research) that brought scholars including [[Tom Nairn]], [[Manfred Steger]], [[:fi:Heikki Patomäki|Heikki Patomäki]] and Nevzat Soguk to RMIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/globalism/about |title=About the Globalism Research Centre - RMIT University |publisher=Rmit.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508191241/http://www.rmit.edu.au/globalism/about |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed to a research position at the Western Sydney University in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uws.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/professor_paul_james|title=Professor Paul James|first=Western Sydney University - Root User|last=(Squiz)|website=Uws.edu.au|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, a UN International Secretariat with offices in Sydney, Melbourne and New York until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesprogramme.org |title=The Cities Programme |publisher=The Cities Programme |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
James is primarily known as a theorist of globalization, particularly how local and national communities alter under an emergent level of global integration. His work has been read as challenging the simple notion of 'global flows' presented by other writers such [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and [[Arjun Appadurai]].&lt;ref&gt;Bude, Heinz, and Jörg Durrschmidt. (2010). ‘What is Wrong with Globalization? Contra “flow speak” - Towards and Existential Turn in the Theory of Globalization’, ''[[European Journal of Social Theory]]'' '''13''' (4), 2010: 481–500.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a distinctive comparative method called 'constitutive abstraction' or '[[engaged theory]]', he has contributed to theories of political culture, the changing nature of community, and the structures and subjectivities of social formation. He is author or editor of more than 30 books, including a [[Sage Publications]] series on globalization. The series, ''Central Currents in Globalization'', is a collection of writings by key figures in the field of globalization. His collaborative work includes writing with other senior scholars such as [[Jonathan Friedman]], [[Peter Mandaville]], [[Tom Nairn]], [[:fi:Heikki Patomäki|Heikki Patomäki]], [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Christopher Wise]], amongst others. His main contribution in the field of global studies is the book [https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_2006_ ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In—Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-edits ''[[Arena Journal]]'' (1986–present), a publication concerned with understanding the crisis-ridden transformations of our time, and is on the board of a dozen other journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arena.org.au/category/arena-journal/|title=Arena Journal - Arena|website=arena.org.au|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work also contributes empirically to understanding contemporary politics and culture, particularly in Australia, East Timor, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Nadarajah | first2= Yaso | last3= Haive | first3= Karen | last4= Stead | first4= Victoria | title= Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230875/Sustainable_Communities_Sustainable_Development_Other_Paths_for_Papua_New_Guinea_author_with_Nadarajah_Stead_and_Have_University_of_Hawaii_Press_Honolulu_2012 | year= 2012 | publisher= University of Hawaii Press | location= Honolulu }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research on sustainable community development laid part of the foundation for the 2007 legislation that went through the PNG parliament,&lt;ref&gt;''The National'', 11 January 2007, ''The National'', 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed by the Minister for Community Development at the time, Dame [[Carol Kidu]], as the basis of community development policy in Papua New Guinea.

As Director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme (2007-2014), James also works in the cross-over fields of urban [[sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/639 |title=Economist Debates: Cities: Statements |publisher=Economist.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues against the mainstream view that 'smart cities' are necessarily better or more sustainable cities, suggesting instead that it is the integration of learning and practice which makes for intelligent and sustainable cities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Berthon, ‘Smart Cities: Can they Work?’ ''The Guardian'', 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines he is quoted as saying that London used the 2012 Olympics in an intelligent way 'where the economy, politics and culture thrive, aided by good transport and a strong information technology infrastructure, all built on a platform of ecological sustainability'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Saltmarsh, ‘Will Olympics Save East London’, ''New York Times'', 28 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with this approach, he is one of the key developers of the '[[Circles of Sustainability]]' method used by a number of cities around the world to respond to relatively intractable or complex issues.&lt;ref&gt;Amen, Mark, Noah J. Toly, Patricia L. Carney and Klaus Segbers, eds. (2011). ''Cities and Global Governance'', Ashgate, Farnham.&lt;/ref&gt; That method takes the emphasis away from economic growth and suggests that cities should rather be aiming for social [[sustainability]], including cultural resilience, political vibrancy, economic prosperity and ecological adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Balch|title=Forget Economic Growth, We need real Prosperity Instead|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 May 2013|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/forget-economic-growth-real-prosperity-instead|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tania Brangan, ‘The Biggest Movement in History’, ''The Guardian'', 7 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, ‘China Becomes an Urban Nation at Breakneck Speed’, ''The Guardian'', 2 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Here his key contribution is ''Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Research Director of [[Global Reconciliation]] (2009–present), an organization dedicated to global dialogue and community-level practice, he has (with Paul Komesaroff) contributed to redefining the concept of 'reconciliation'. Instead of an emphasis on reconciliation as an event of testimony and contrition, the [[Global Reconciliation Foundation]] treats reconciliation as an ongoing process of dialogue and practice across the boundaries of continuing difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfield, Philipa, Cleo Fleming, Paul A. Komesaroff, eds. 2008. ''Pathways to Reconciliation: Between Theory and Practice'', Ashgate, Aldershot.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, James, Komesaroff, and a management team led by Peter Phipps and Haris Halilovich, ran the first national reconciliation forum in Bosnia Hercegovina. In October 2012, James, Komesaroff and Suresh Sudram, together with a team in Australia and Sri Lanka ran the first national civil-society reconciliation forum in Sri Lanka since the end of the war. This followed a Reconciliation Summit on the Middle East held in Amman, Jordan in 2009, organized by Komesaroff and James.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Flanagan, ‘Embracing the Wave of Compassion’, ''The Age'', 9 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because his work has a general reach, criticisms of James’ work tend to take the form of rebukes for what he does not do or challenges to take seriously mainstream considerations such as citizenship and social movement success.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Bleiker, ‘Global Matrix’, Australian Book Review, June–July 2006; Tristan Clayton, ‘Global Matrix’, Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, vol. 23, no. 5, 2005, pp. 787–8; William Safran, ‘Nation Formation’, Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism, Vol. 29, Nos 1-2, 2002, pp. 161–63; Lars Bo Kaspersen, ‘Nation Formation’, The European Journal of Development Research, 2000; Paul Reynolds, ‘Nation Formation’, Capital and Class, no. 67, 1999, pp. 196–7; Bernt Jonsson, ‘Politics of Differences, Equality and Religion’, New Routes, vol. 3, no. 2, 1998, pp. 25–6;Philip Smith, ‘Nation Formation’, in Journal of Sociology, 34, 1, 1998, pp. 87–9; Andrew Vandenberg, `Nation Formation’ in Forum, no. 7, 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, describing James’s book written with Tom Nairn, ''Global Matrix'', Claudia Aradau (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;371) initially writes positively that: “Contradiction remains however the structuring principle of the book and a method of analysis. It allows the authors to think alternatives from ‘the field of our own ideological determinations’ (Balibar, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;25)". However, she then goes on to criticize the authors for failing to consider citizenship as one of the missing conceptions in the range of alternatives to the world in crisis that the authors describe.

In a similar vein, Bihku Parekh says that despite his comprehensive coverage, "James does not explore how the nation and the state are internally related such that the apparently strange idea of the nation-state was considered self-evident by many."&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, Bhikhu. 1998. ‘Nation Formation’, ''Nations and Nationalism'' '''4'''(2): 274&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pentagon Mass Casualty project''' (codenamed '''Pentagon [[Mascal]]''') was a contingency exercise that was held in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] conference room between October 24 and October 26, 2000. The exercise required emergency response teams, members of the defense protective services, and U.S. government officials to conduct emergency simulations in preparation for a possible plane crash into [[the Pentagon]].

In the experiment, emergency personnel were required to hold radio and other communications devices to increase their operational readiness for quickly transporting massive casualties from the disaster area to medical centers. Toy trucks were used as miniature models to simulate emergency transport vehicles for victims.

'''Pride's Purge''' was an event that took place in December 1648, during the [[Second English Civil War]], when troops of the [[New Model Army]] under the command of Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.  Some have called it a ''[[coup d'état]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macaulay|first1=James|title=Cromwell Anecdotes|date=1891|publisher=Hodder|location=London|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-cITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=pride%27s+purge+coup+d%27etat#v=onepage&amp;q=pride's%20purge%20coup%20d'etat&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1648, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was in captivity at [[Carisbrooke Castle]] and the [[First English Civil War|first stage]] of the [[English Civil War]] was over. The [[Long Parliament]] issued a set of demands for the future government of the Kingdom and sent commissioners to negotiate with the King over the terms of the putative [[Treaty of Newport]]. The leaders of the [[New Model Army]] had previously tried to negotiate with the King themselves in 1647, shortly after the end of the first civil war in 1646. Its leaders, the "grandees", were sorely disappointed when Charles stalled these negotiations by quite clearly attempting to play different factions in the Parliamentary alliance off against others. He eventually escaped captivity, leading to the second civil war that raged between 1647 and 1649. By the time Charles was recaptured, most of the army leaders were convinced that they could no longer trust him. So the army sent in a remonstrance on 20 November 1648, which was rejected by 125 votes to 58 in the House of Commons on 1 December. When the Commissioners returned with the King's answers, which were far short of what was hoped, the House of Commons eventually declared them acceptable by 129 votes to 83 early in the morning of 5 December 1648 (though this was technically a vote on whether the vote should be called).

== The Purge ==
On Wednesday 6 December Colonel Pride’s Regiment of Foot took up position on the stairs leading to the House, while [[Nathaniel Rich (soldier)|Nathaniel Rich’s]] Regiment of Horse provided backup. Pride himself stood at the top of the stairs.{{sfn|Firth|1898|p=349}} As MPs arrived, he checked them against the list provided to him; [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey of Groby]] helped to identify those to be arrested and those to be prevented from entering.{{sfn|Bradley|1890|p=206}} The purge was not over in one day, and a military watch was kept on the entrance until 12 December. By then 45 members had been imprisoned of which 25 were released before Christmas. It is not known exactly how many were excluded as many, once they heard of the purge, voluntarily stayed away, either because they feared they would be arrested but more usually as a sign of protest. Pre-purge the number of members who were still eligible to sit in the house was 507 but 18 seats were vacant and a further 18 members had not sat for a long time which meant that there were 471 active members. After the purge just over 200 members sat in what would become known as the [[Rump Parliament]].{{sfn|Woolrych|2004|p=428}}&lt;ref&gt;"The indispensable work on the Purge and the number of members affected by it is Underdown, ''Pride's Purge''. Equally essential on the Rump and its membership is Blair Worden, ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge, 1974), esp. Appendix A, pp. 387-91; on pp. 391-2 he convincingly revises Underdown's estimate of the number of members physically excluded by the army {{harv|Woolrych|2004|p=428}}."&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 200, 86 absented themselves voluntarily, 83 were allowed back in Parliament after formally dissenting from the decision to accept the King's proposals, and 71 were supporters of the army from the outset (see [[List of MPs not excluded from the English parliament in 1648]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The imprisoned members were taken first to the Queen’s Court within the [[Palace of Westminster]], and then to a nearby public house. There were three public houses next to the Palace in 1648, called Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell. The imprisoned members were taken to Hell where they spent the night. On the next day they were moved to two inns in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. By 12 December the first of the imprisoned members was allowed home;{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} many more were released on 20 December.{{sfn|Woolrych|2004|p=428}}

The Rump now had a majority that would establish a Republic. Any doubts the remaining members may have had over the wisdom of this course were suppressed by the presence of the Army in great numbers. On 4 January 1649 an Ordinance was passed to try the King for treason; the [[House of Lords]] rejected it. The House of Commons then passed an ‘Act’ by itself for the same purpose, and the King was beheaded on 30 January. On 6 February the House of Lords was abolished; the monarchy went the same way on 7 February, and a [[English Council of State|Council of State]] was established on 14 February.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- for all the sentences in the paragraph--&gt; Between the purge and the King's trial and execution only about 70 attended the Commons and attendance in the Lords rarely reached a dozen.{{sfn|Woolrych|2004|p=428}}

== Aftermath ==
Pride’s Purge was reversed on 21 February 1660 when all the surviving barred members were restored to the Long Parliament which, as law required, voted for its own dissolution. It was followed by the [[Convention Parliament (1660)]] which proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] king and [[Restoration (England)|restored the monarchy]].

Pride's Purge was arguably the most significant political event of the English Civil War, directly leading to the execution of Charles I and thus a permanent end to hostilities between the King and Parliament. Historians argue over the extent to which this was an independent action by Pride's regiment. Army chief [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] and his second in command, Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Cromwell]], stayed aloof from the proceedings. But Cromwell's swift journey to London from [[Pontefract]] on the day of the purge suggests that he was involved in its planning. He certainly benefited from and supported the outcome of the purge after it had taken place.

'''Queer Mutiny''' was a [[UK]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Queer]] ([[anarcha-queer]]) organisation.  There were branches in [[Edinburgh]], [[London]], [[Brighton]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Leeds]].

==Organization==
Groups were run independently by members, who were free to take the activities of the group in whatever direction they choose, as organisation was done in an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] manner, apart from Edinburgh QueerMutiny who rejected such labels.

Queers of all sexualities met as regularly as they felt fit, to socialise and get active. Queer Mutiny was a [[DIY]] collective which aimed to fight prejudice, link up with other campaigns, learn, create alternatives and celebrate what it is to be Queer. They organised skill-sharing workshops, with the hope of empowerment and having fun. They were against [[hierarchies]], [[capitalism]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].

==Events==
Queer Mutiny put on a variety of events that didn't revolve around consumption, where people could talk about politics, the planet and things beyond gay life and fashion.

Examples of activities of the groups were: queer self-defence, political activism, musical performance, radical queer walking, alternatives to [[Pride parade|Pride]], [[zine]] making, queer presence at [[Criticism of EDO Corporation#Protest in the UK|EDO demos]], [[dildo]]-making workshops, queer film nights, discussions about queer identity, [[critical Mass (cycling)|critical massing]], stencilling, and networking with other radical queers.

[[File:Richard M Weaver.png|thumb|right|Richard M. Weaver]]
'''Richard Malcolm Weaver, Jr''' (March 3, 1910&amp;nbsp;– April 1, 1963) was an American scholar who taught [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  He is primarily known as an intellectual historian, political philosopher and a mid-20th century [[conservatism|conservative]] and as an authority on [[modern rhetoric]].  Weaver was briefly a [[socialist]] during his youth, a lapsed leftist intellectual (conservative by the time he was in graduate school), a teacher of [[composition (language)|composition]], a [[Plato]]nist philosopher, cultural [[critic]], and a theorist of human nature and society.  Described by biographer Fred Young as a "radical and original thinker,"&lt;ref&gt;Young 4&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Weaver's books ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]''  and ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'' remain influential among [[conservatism|conservative]] theorists and scholars of the [[Southern United States|American South]].  Weaver was also associated with a group of scholars who in the 1940s and 1950s promoted [[traditionalist conservatism]].

==Life==
Weaver was the eldest of four children born to a middle-class Southern family in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].  His father, Richard Sr., owned a livery stable. After the death of her husband during 1915, Carolyn Embry Weaver supported her children by working in her family's department store in her native [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  Lexington is the home of the [[University of Kentucky]] and of two private colleges.

Despite his family's straitened circumstances after the death of his father, Richard Jr. attended a private boarding school and the [[University of Kentucky]]. He earned an A.B in English during 1932. The teacher at Kentucky who most influenced him was [[Francis Galloway]].  After a year of graduate study at Kentucky, Weaver began a master's degree in English at [[Vanderbilt University]]. [[John Crowe Ransom]] supervised his thesis, titled ''The Revolt against Humanism'', a critique of the [[humanism]] of [[Irving Babbitt]] and [[Paul Elmer More]].  Weaver then taught one year at [[Auburn University]] and three years at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].

During 1940, Weaver began a Ph.D. in English at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU), whose faculty included the rhetoricians and critics [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]], and the conservative political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]]. While at LSU, Weaver spent summers studying at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Virginia]], and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. His Ph.D. was awarded during 1943 for a thesis, supervised first by [[Arlin Turner]] then by [[Cleanth Brooks]], titled ''The Confederate South, 1865-1910: A Study in the Survival of a Mind and a Culture''. It was published during 1968, posthumously, with the title ''The Southern Tradition at Bay''.

After one year's teaching at [[North Carolina State University]], Weaver joined the English department at the [[University of Chicago]], where he spent the rest of his career,&lt;ref&gt;Young 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; and where his exceptional teaching earned him that university's [[Quantrell Award]] during 1949. During 1957, Weaver published the first article in the inaugural issue of [[Russell Kirk]]'s ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]]''.

Weaver spent his academic summers in a house he purchased in his ancestral [[Weaverville, North Carolina]], very near Asheville.  His widowed mother resided there year-round.  Weaver traveled between Chicago and Asheville by train.  To connect himself with traditional modes of agrarian life, he insisted that the family vegetable garden in Weaverville be plowed by mule. Every August the Weaver family had a reunion which Richard regularly attended and not infrequently addressed.

Precocious and bookish from a very young age, Weaver grew up to become "one of the most well-educated intellectuals of his era".&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 4&lt;/ref&gt; Highly self-sufficient and independent, he has been described as "solitary and remote",&lt;ref&gt;Young 1&lt;/ref&gt; as a "shy little bulldog of a man".&lt;ref&gt;Nash 84&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking close friends, and having few lifelong correspondents other than his Vanderbilt teacher and fellow Agrarian [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], Weaver was able to concentrate on his scholarly activities.

During 1962, the [[Young Americans for Freedom]] gave Weaver an award for "service to education and the philosophy of a free society".&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie x&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his sudden death in [[Chicago]], Weaver accepted an appointment at [[Vanderbilt University]]. Dr. Weaver died on April 1, 1963. According to his sister, he died from a cerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Fred|title=Richard M. Weaver, 1910-1963: A Life of the Mind|date=1995|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1964, the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;Nash 82&lt;/ref&gt; created a graduate fellowship in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isi.org/programs/fellowships/richard_weaver.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206102001/http://www.isi.org/programs/fellowships/richard_weaver.html |archivedate=2006-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[Rockford Institute]] established the annual [[Richard M. Weaver Award]] for Scholarly Letters.

==Early influences==
Weaver strongly believed in preserving and defending what he considered to be traditional Southern principles.&lt;ref&gt;Young 8&lt;/ref&gt; These principles, such as [[anti-consumerism]] and [[chivalry]], were the basis of Weaver's teaching, writing, and speaking.

Having been raised with strong moral values, Weaver considered religion as the foundation for family and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Young 21&lt;/ref&gt; His appreciation for religion is evident in speeches he gave early while an undergraduate at the [[Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour|Christian Endeavour Society]], as well as in his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Young 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by his University of Kentucky professors, who were mostly of Midwestern origin and of social democratic inclinations, and by the crisis of the [[Great Depression]], Weaver believed that industrial [[capitalism]] had caused a general moral, economic, and intellectual failure in the [[United States]]. Hoping initially that [[socialism]] would afford an alternative to the prevailing [[industrialist]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;Young 3&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the Kentucky chapter of the American Socialist Party. During 1932 Weaver actively campaigned for [[Norman Thomas]], the standard-bearer of that party. A few years later, he made a financial contribution to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Loyalist]] cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Encounters with intellectuals in coming years, such as Dr. Tricia McMillan, would unsettle his early acceptance of socialism.

While completing a thesis for a master's degree in English at [[Vanderbilt University]], Weaver discovered ideas related to the [[Southern Agrarians]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Young 69&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually he began a rejection of socialism and embrace of tradition. He admired and sought to emulate its leader, the "doctor of culture" [[John Crowe Ransom]].&lt;ref&gt;Young 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agrarians wrote passionately about the traditional values of community and the Old South. During 1930, a number of [[Vanderbilt University]] faculty and their students, led by Ransom, wrote an Agrarian manifesto, titled ''I'll Take My Stand''.&lt;ref&gt;Young 38&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver agreed with the group's suspicion of the post-Civil War industrialization of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Young 47&lt;/ref&gt; He found more congenial Agrarianism's focus on traditionalism and regional cultures than socialism's egalitarian "romanticizing" of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 12&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver abandoned socialism for Agrarianism only gradually over a number of years; the thinking of his 1934 M.A. thesis was not Agrarian.&lt;ref&gt;Young 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaver's Old South==
''The Southern Tradition at Bay'', the title under which Weaver's 1943 doctoral dissertation was published in 1968 after his death, surveyed the post-[[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] literature of the states that were part of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He revealed what he considered its continuities with the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era (1781–1860)|antebellum era]]. Weaver also discussed certain Southerners who dissented from this tradition, such as [[Walter Hines Page]], [[George Washington Cable]], and [[Henry W. Grady]], whom he termed "Southern liberals."

Weaver identified four traditional Southern characteristics: "a [[feudalism|feudal]] theory of society, a code of [[chivalry]], the ancient concept of the gentleman, and a noncreedal faith".&lt;ref&gt;Young 78&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the Southern feudal system was centered on the legitimate pride a family line derived from linking its name to a piece of land.&lt;ref&gt;Young 81&lt;/ref&gt; For Weaver, land ownership gave the individual a much needed "stability, responsibility, dignity, and sentiment".&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet in his ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'', he downplayed the materialistic notion of ownership.  He asserted that private property was "the last metaphysical right" of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 100&lt;/ref&gt; Southern chivalry and gentlemen's behavior, on the other hand, emphasized a paternalistic personal honor, and [[etiquette|decorum]] over competition and cleverness.&lt;ref&gt;Young 83&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver claimed that women preferred the romanticized soldier to the materialistic businessman.&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The noncreedal faith Weaver advocated (he was a non-practicing [[Protestantism|Protestant]]) grew out of what he termed the South's "older religiousness".&lt;ref&gt;Young 84&lt;/ref&gt; This "religion" emphasized a respect for tradition and nature, and for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]/[[Anglican Communion|Episcopal]] church,&lt;ref&gt;Young 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; the established church in Virginia and south during the colonial era. Weaver agreed with the traditional Christian notion that external science and technology could not save man, born a sinner in need of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver believed that the South was the "last non-materialist civilization in the Western World".&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 17&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver came to advocate a revival of Southern traditions as the only cure for a commodity-based capitalism. He believed it was a way to combat the social degradation he witnessed while living in Chicago.

==Beginnings of a theory==
Weaver gradually came to see himself as the "cultural doctor of the South," despite making his career in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Young 5&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, he sought to resist what he saw as America's growing [[barbarism (modern linguistics)|barbarism]] by teaching his students of the correct way to write, use, and understand language, teaching that connected Weaver with Platonist ideals. Following the tradition of the Socratic dialogues, Weaver taught that misuse of language caused social corruption. That belief led him to criticize [[jazz]] as a medium that promoted "barbaric impulses" because he perceived the idiom as lacking form and rules.&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Groothuis|first=Douglas|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/jazz-and-politics-by-douglas-groothuis.php?pg=1&amp;width=1024|title=Jazz and Politics|publisher=All About Jazz|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver's study of American literature emphasized the past, such as the nineteenth century culture of New England and the South, and the [[Lincoln-Douglas debate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Young 6&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to truly understand language, Weaver concentrated on a culture's fundamental beliefs; that is, beliefs that strengthened and educated citizens into a course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Young 9&lt;/ref&gt; By teaching and studying language, he endeavored to generate a healthier culture that would no longer use language as a tool of lies and persuasion in a "prostitution of words".&lt;ref&gt;Young 9&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a capitalist society, applied science was the "sterile opposite" of what he saw as redemption – the "poetic and ethical vision of life".&lt;ref&gt;Young 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver condemned modern media and modern journalism as tools for exploiting the passive viewer. Convinced that ideas, not machines, compelled humanity towards a better future, he gave words precedence over technology.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 96&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the Agrarians' emphasis of poetry, he began writing poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Young 76&lt;/ref&gt; In a civilized society, poetry allowed one to express personal beliefs that science and technology could not overrule. In Weaver's words, "We can will our world".&lt;ref&gt;Nash 97&lt;/ref&gt; That is, human beings – not mechanical or social forces – can make positive decisions through language that will change their existence.

==Communitarian individualism==
In a short speech delivered to the 1950 reunion of the Weaver clan, Weaver criticized urban life in Chicago as follows: "the more closely people are crowded together, the less they know one another".&lt;ref&gt;''Address'' 114&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparative study of [[John Randolph of Roanoke|Randolph of Roanoke]] and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], Weaver defined  "individualism" in two ways: 1) "studied withdrawal from society" (i.e. Thoreau) and 2) "political action at the social level" (i.e. Randolph).&lt;ref&gt;Young 11&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau (according to Weaver) rejected society while Randolph embraced social bonds through politics.

Personally opposed to America's centralized political power, Weaver, like Randolph, preferred an individualism that included community.&lt;ref&gt;Young 12&lt;/ref&gt; "Community" here refers to a shared identity of values tied to a geographical and spatial location – in Weaver's case, the Old South. He concluded that individualism that is founded on community enabled a citizen "to know who he was and what he was about".&lt;ref&gt;Young 12&lt;/ref&gt; Without this intimate foundation, citizens seeking individualism would be unable to reach a true, personal identity. More importantly, he believed that people should grant priority to a living community and its well-being, not to individual fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-nominalism==
In ''Ideas Have Consequences'', Weaver analyzed [[William of Ockham|William of Occam's]] 14th century notions of nominalist philosophy. In broad terms, nominalism is the idea that "[[universalism|universals]] are not real, only particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Young 107&lt;/ref&gt; Nominalism deprives people of a measure of universal truth, so that each man becomes his own "priest and ethics professor".&lt;ref&gt;Scotchie 5&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver deplored this [[relativism]], and believed that modern men were "moral idiots, ... incapable of distinguishing between better and worse".&lt;ref&gt;Nash 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver viewed America's moral degradation and turn toward commodity-culture as the unwitting consequences of its belief in nominalism. That is, a civilization that no longer believed in universal [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental values]] had no moral ambition to understand a higher truth outside of man.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 89&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a "shattered world",&lt;ref&gt;Young 113&lt;/ref&gt; in which truth was unattainable, and freedom only an illusion. Moreover, without a focus on the sort of higher truth that can be found in organized religions, people turned to the more tangible idols of science and [[economic materialism|materialism]].

Weaver's ideal society was that of the European [[Middle Ages]], when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] gave to all an accurate picture of reality and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 94&lt;/ref&gt; Nominalism emerged in the late Middle Ages and quickly came to dominate Western thinking. More generally, Weaver felt that the shift from universal truth and transcendental order to individual opinion and industrialism adversely affected the moral health of Americans.

Nominalism also undermines the concept of [[hierarchy]], which depends entirely on fundamental truths about people. Weaver, in contrast, believed that hierarchies are necessary. He argued that social, gender, and age-related equality actually undermine stability and order. Believing in "natural social groupings".&lt;ref&gt;Young 112&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed that it should be possible to sort people into suitable categories without the envy of equality. Using the hierarchical structure of a family as an example, he thought that family members accept various duties grounded in "sentiment" and "fraternity," not equality and rights.&lt;ref&gt;Young 113&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing in this direction, he claimed not to understand the [[feminist movement]], which led women to abandon their stronger connection to nature and intuition for a superficial political and economic equality with men.&lt;ref&gt;Young 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver maintained that egalitarianism only promoted "[s]uspicion, hostility, and lack of trust and loyalty".&lt;ref&gt;Toledano 270&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he believed that there must be a center, a transcendent truth on which people could focus and structure their lives. Contrary to what nominalism would suggest, language can be pinned down, can serve as a foundation through which one can "find real meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Young 122&lt;/ref&gt; So, those who do not understand language can never find real meaning, which is inordinately tragic. In Weaver's words, "a world without generalization would be a world without knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Young 114&lt;/ref&gt; Thus universals allow true knowledge.

==Weaver on rhetoric==
In ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'', Weaver evaluates the ability of rhetoric to persuade. Similarly to [[ancient philosophy|ancient philosophers]], Weaver found that language has the power to move people to do good, to do evil, or to do nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;Young 129&lt;/ref&gt; In his defense of orthodoxy, Weaver set down a number of rhetorical principles. He grounded his definition of "noble rhetoric" in the work of [[Plato]]; such rhetoric aimed to improve intellect by presenting men with "better versions of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Young 135&lt;/ref&gt; He also agreed with Plato's notions of the realities of transcendentals (recall Weaver's hostility to nominalism) and the connection between form and substance.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 7&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Weaver admired the connection between the forms of poetry and rhetoric. Like poetry, rhetoric relies on the [[connotation]] of words as well as their [[denotation]]. Good rhetoricians, he asserted, use poetic [[analogy|analogies]] to relate [[abstraction|abstract]] ideas directly to the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Young 132&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically emphasizing [[metaphor]], he found that comparison should be an essential part of the rhetorical process.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 23&lt;/ref&gt; However, arguments from definition—that is, from the very nature of things (justice, beauty, the nature of man) -- had an even higher ethical status, because they were grounded in essences rather than similarities. Arguments grounded in mere circumstance ("I have to quit school because I cannot afford the tuition") Weaver viewed as the least ethical, because they grant the immediate facts a higher status than principle. Finally, Weaver pointed out that arguments from authority are only as good as the authority itself.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Language is Sermonic'', Weaver pointed to rhetoric as a presentation of values. Sermonic language seeks to persuade the listener, and is inherent in all communication. Indeed, the very choice to present arguments from definition instead of from consequence implies that one of the modes of reason carries greater value. He also considered rhetoric and the multiplicity of man. That is, he acknowledged that logic alone was not enough to persuade man, who is "a pathetic being, that is, a being feeling and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 1352&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that societies that placed great value on technology often became dehumanized. Like a machine relying purely on logic, the rhetorician was in danger of becoming "a thinking robot".&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 1353&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver divided the nature of man into four categories: rational, emotional, ethical, and religious.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 13&lt;/ref&gt; Without considering these characteristics as a whole, rhetoricians cannot hope to persuade their listeners. Moreover, when motivating the listener to adopt attitudes and actions, rhetoricians must consider the uniqueness of each audience.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 1351&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, orators should acknowledge that each audience has different needs and responses, and must formulate their arguments accordingly. Weaver also divided "argumentation" into four categories: [[Causality|cause-effect]], [[definition]], [[consequentialism|consequences]], and [[communities of circumstance|circumstances]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 27&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetorician must decide which method of argument will best persuade a given audience.

In his ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'', Weaver coined the phrases "god terms" and "devil terms".&lt;ref&gt;Young 147-49&lt;/ref&gt; "God terms" are words particular to a certain age and are vague, but have "inherent potency" in their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Young 147&lt;/ref&gt; Such words include [[wikt:progress|progress]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] – words that seem impenetrable and automatically give a phrase positive meaning. In contrast, "devil terms" are the mirror image, and include words such as [[Communist]] and Un-American.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 222-23&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric, Weaver argued, must employ such terminology only with care. Employing ethical rhetoric is the first step towards rejecting vague terminology with propagandistic value.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesen 27&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing a "god" or "devil" term, Weaver suggested that a listener should "hold a dialectic with himself" to consider the intention behind such persuasive words.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 232&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "a society's health or declension was mirrored in how it used language".&lt;ref&gt;Young 151&lt;/ref&gt; If a language is pure, so too will be those who employ it.

==Weaver's influence==
Some regard ''The Southern Tradition at Bay'' as Weaver's best work.  ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' is more widely known, thanks to its substantial influence on the "postwar intellectual [[Right-wing politics|Right]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nash 87&lt;/ref&gt; The leading young conservative intellectuals of the era, including [[Russell Kirk]], [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], and [[Willmoore Kendall]], praised the book for its critical insights.&lt;ref&gt;Young 179&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Henry Regnery claims that the book gave the modern conservative movement a strong intellectual foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank S. Meyer]], a  [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist of the 1960s – and former Communist Party USA member – publicly thanked Weaver for inspiring him to join the Right.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 88&lt;/ref&gt;

For many liberals, Weaver was a misguided authoritarian. For many conservatives, he was a champion of tradition and liberty, with the emphasis on [[tradition]]. For Southerners, he was a refreshing defender of an "antimodern" South.&lt;ref&gt;Nash 108&lt;/ref&gt; For others he was a historical revisionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/138254/article-1G1-135580976/richard-weaver-untraditional-case-federalism|author=Bailey, Jeremy David|title=Richard Weaver's untraditional case for federalism.|publisher=Publius|date=September 22, 2004|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His refutation of what Russell Kirk termed "ritualistic [[liberalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Nash 87&lt;/ref&gt; struck a chord with conservative intellectuals. Stemming from a tradition of "[[cultural pessimism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Nash 92&lt;/ref&gt; his critique of nominalism, however startling, gave conservatives a new philosophical direction. His writing attacked the growing number of modern Americans denying conservative structure and moral uprightness, confronting them with [[empirical evidence|empirical]] [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]. During the 1980s, the emerging [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]] adapted his vision of the Old South to express [[antimodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash 109&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver has come to be seen as defining America's plight and as inspiring conservatives to find "the relationship between faith and reason for an age that does not know the meaning of faith".&lt;ref&gt;Toledano 259&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">The '''Rural Reconstruction Association''' ('''RRA''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] agricultural reform movement established in 1926 with [[Montague Fordham]] as its Council Secretary, a post he held for 20 years.&lt;ref name="Con1"&gt;P. Conford, 'Finance versus Farming: Rural Reconstruction and Economic Reform 1894-1955', ''Rural History'', 2002, Vol.13 No.2, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Influenced by the ideas of [[guild socialism]], the RRA sought for a time the creation of a National Agricultural Guild with land ownership held by land councils who would operate as local sections of the Guild.&lt;ref name="barb"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', 2002, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Its main consistent aims however were to revive [[agriculture]] and to decentralise the population of Britain.&lt;ref name="Con1"/&gt; It sought to standardise prices and produce grading, regulate imports and encourage more of a balance between agriculture and industry which, it argued, would benefit both sectors by ending over-reliance on manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Con1"/&gt; As such, the [[Agricultural Marketing Act 1931]], [[Wheat Act 1932]] and [[Agricultural Marketing Act 1933]], all of which moved towards [[protectionism]] in agriculture, were seen by the RRA as a vindication of their arguments.&lt;ref name="Con1"/&gt;

Their 1936 document ''The Revival of Agriculture'' attacked modern economics whilst praising what they saw as the more realistic approach of Elizabethan times, where financiers were servants of producers rather than masters. They argued that this system could be returned by controlling imports and so allowing domestic agricultural produce to reach a higher value. This would mean that banks would be more prepared to advance loans to farmers and would lead to the creation of a system of agricultural credit banks.&lt;ref&gt;Conford, 'Finance versus Farming', pp. 229-30&lt;/ref&gt; A revived agricultural sector was also presented as being central to national well-being as it would encourage fresh organic produce.&lt;ref&gt;Conford, 'Finance versus Farming', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The group grew close to the Economic Reform Club and Institute (ECRI) in the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;Conford, 'Finance versus Farming', p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; and with the ECRI it produced, between 1944 and 1956, a journal dedicated to the reform of the rural economy edited by [[Jorian Jenks]].&lt;ref name="barb"/&gt; Jenks' ''Rural Economy'' journal proved the focal point for [[fascism|fascist]] sympathies within the movement as Jenks, a former member of the [[British Union of Fascists]], was close to the [[Union Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Macklin, ''Very Deeply Dyed in Black'', New York: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The group enjoyed the support of some leading British figures as Sir [[George Stapledon]] and [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth|Lord Lymington]] were amongst the members of its board&lt;ref name="barb"/&gt; whilst [[Maurice Towneley-O'Hagan, 3rd Baron O'Hagan|Lord O'Hagan]] served as President of the movement for a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1945/dec/06/agricultural-policy Agricultural Policy debates] from [[Hansard]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sachsenspiegel''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzaksn̩ˌʃpiːɡl̩|lang}}, literally “Saxon Mirror”; [[Middle Low German]]: ''{{lang|gml|Sassen Speyghel}}''; {{lang-nds|Sassenspegel}}) is the most important [[law]] book and [[custumal]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Originating between 1220 and 1235 as a record of existing [[customary law]], it was used in places until as late as 1900. It is important not only for its lasting effect on later German law but also as an early example of written prose in a German language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dieter Pötschke | editor = Dieter Pötschke | title = Stadtrecht, Roland und Pranger:  zur Rechtsgeschichte von Halberstadt, Goslar, Bremen und Städten der Mark Brandenburg |trans-title=Stadtrecht, Roland und Pranger:  zur Rechtsgeschichte von Halberstadt, Goslar, Bremen und Städten der Mark Brandenburg | series = Harz-Forschungen | volume = 15 | year = 2002 | publisher = Lukas | language = German | isbn = 3-931836-77-0 | page = 135 | chapter = Utgetogen Recht steiht hir.

A Latin edition is known to have existed, but only fragmented chapters remain.

==History==
The ''Sachsenspiegel'' was one of the first prose works written in the [[Middle Low German]] language. The original title is ''Sassen Speyghel'', ''Sachsenspiegel'' being a later [[Standard German]] translation. It is believed to have been compiled and translated from [[Latin]] by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] administrator [[Eike of Repgow]] at the behest of his liege lord Count Hoyer of Falkenstein in the years 1220 to 1235.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give the period during which the ''Sachsenspiegel'' was written as 1220 to 1230, but 1220 to 1235 is given by others, such as sources at the Library of Congress ([https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/world/rule.html]), the European Court of Human Rights ([http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/227A68E9-89EA-46DF-A10C-1E81422C3E6E/0/2006OpeningofthejudicialyearWildhaberTugcuEnglish.pdf#search=%22Sachsenspiegel%201220%201235%22])  and Tufts University ([http://dca.tufts.edu/features/law/books/index.html])&lt;/ref&gt; Where the original was compiled is unclear. It was thought to have been written at Burg Falkenstein, but Peter Landau, an expert in medieval canon law, recently suggested that it may have been written at the [[Altzella Abbey|monastery of Altzelle]] (now Altzella).&lt;ref&gt;The suggestion that the ''Sachsenspiegel'' was written at Altzelle was made in a paper given by Professor Landau at the ''Deutscher Rechtshistorikertag'' 2004 and later published in an article (Landau, Peter: ''Die Entstehungsgeschichte des Sachsenspiegels: Eike von Repgow, Altzelle und die anglo-normannische Kanonistik''; ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters '' 2005, Vol 61, No. 1, pp 73-101), cited at the German Wikipedia article on ''Kloster Altzella'' and [http://www.rechtsbuchforschung.de http://www.rechtsbuchforschung.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209010817/http://www.rechtsbuchforschung.de/ |date=2007-02-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 14th century [[Johannes Klenkok]] opposed the Sachsenspiegel with a writing known as the ''Decadicon'' because he considered several articles of the law book to contradict the [[Corpus Juris Canonici]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Christopher Ocker]]|title=Johannes Klenkok: A Friar's Life, C. 1310-1374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CALAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=1993|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-835-3|}}, pp 51 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a written debate Klenkok turned to his former disciple and French canonist and cardinal of the Curia in [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] [[Pierre de la Vergne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocker, pp 52-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end [[Pope Gregory XI]] condemned 14 articles with his [[papal bull]] ''Salvator Humani Generis'' that was issued in 1374 but did not reduce the success of the Sachsenspiegel.&lt;ref&gt;Ocker, pp 66-69 and Lars Rentmeister, ''Staat und Kirche im späten Mittelalter - Der Schriftwechsel zwischen Johannes Klenkok und Herbord von Spangenberg über den Sachsenspiegel'', tredition (2016), {{ISBN|978-3-7345-1931-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Sachsenspiegel'' served as a model for law books in [[German language|German]] ([[Middle High German]]) like the ''[[Augsburg]]er Sachsenspiegel'', the ''Deutschenspiegel'', and the ''Schwabenspiegel''. Its influence extended into Eastern Europe, the Netherlands, and the Baltic States.

In [[Prussia]], the ''Sachsenspiegel'' was used until the introduction of the ''[[Allgemeines Landrecht für die preußischen Staaten]]'' in 1794. In Saxony it was used until the introduction of the Saxon Civil Code in 1865. In [[Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]] the ''Sachsenspiegel'' was not replaced until the introduction of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] in 1900. Its precedents continued to be cited as pertinent [[case law]] as recently as 1932 by the ''[[Reichsgericht]]'' (Supreme Court of the Reich) (RGZ 137, 373).

The influence of the ''Sachsenspiegel'', or at least parallels with it, can still be found in modern German law, for instance in inheritance law and the law of neighborly relations (''Nachbarrecht''; e.g., nuisance, party walls, etc.).

The ''Sachsenspiegel'' contains two branches of law: common law and feudal law.

==Saxon custom==
Saxon customary law, or ''[[Landrecht (medieval)|Landrecht]]'', was the law of free people including the peasant [[sokeman]]ry. It contains important rules and regulations concerning property rights, inheritance, marriage, the delivery of goods, and certain torts (e.g. [[trespass]], [[nuisance]]). It also treats criminal law and the composition of courts. In other words, it deals with criminal and civil law.

==Feudal law==
Feudal law, or ''[[Lehnrecht]]'', determined the relationship between different states and rulers, for example the election of [[emperor]]s and [[Monarch|kings]], feudal rights, etc. Though it has no modern equivalent, it encompasses what one would call today [[public law]].

The Sachsenspiegel acquired special significance through its exposition of the seven ''[[Heerschild]]e'' or "shields of knighthood":
#King
#Ecclesiastical princes
#Lay princes
#Free lords (''freie Herren'')
#''Schöffenbarfreie'', [[vassals]] (''[[Lehnsmänner]]'') of free lords, [[ministeriales]]
#Vassals of ''Schöffenbarfreie'' etc.
#Unnamed.
 
Manorial tenants and burgesses (inhabitants of a borough) were not mentioned.

==Extant copies==
[[File:Eike von Repgow Oldenburger Sachsenspiegel.jpg|thumb|[[Eike of Repgow]], from the [[Oldenburg]] ''Sachsenspiegel'']]

Four (of the original seven) [[illuminated manuscript]]s copies are still extant. They are named after their present locations: Heidelberg, Oldenburg, Dresden, and Wolfenbüttel,  and date from 1295 to 1371. In total, over 400 versions of the manuscript exist today.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11620/ |title = Mirror of the Saxons |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1295–1363 |accessdate = 2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dresden manuscript has been described as the "most artistically valuable," by the [[World Digital Library]]. It is located in the collection of the [[Saxon State Library]] and was created between 1295 and 1363 around [[Meissen, Germany]]. This version has 924 illustrations on 92 pages. The illustrations depict about 4,000 people. It suffered [[water damage]] after the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]] and underwent restoration in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

An early printed edition of the Sachsenspeigel was produced by [[Anna Rügerin]] in Augsburg, dated 22 June 1484. It is the first documented evidence of a woman working as a typographer.&lt;ref name="Typo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boardley|first1=John|title=The first female typographer|url=http://ilovetypography.com/2014/10/15/the-first-female-typographer/|website=I love typography|accessdate=17 May 2016|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proverbs==
Some German [[proverb]]s date from the Sachsenspiegel:

*"Wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst" (First come, first served, literally: "Who comes first, grinds first"), which is a rule for the order for grinding of corn by a [[miller]].
*"Wo der Esel sich wälzt, da muss er Haare lassen.", lit: "Where the donkey rolls, there it sheds hair." This is a rule for the jurisdiction of courts.

acquired a 25% share in the  [[Iraq Petroleum Company|Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC). The other shareholders were the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC) with 47.5%, the [[Anglo Saxon Petroleum | Anglo Saxon Petroleum Co]] 22.5% and the remaining 5% [[Calouste Gulbenkian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Zedalis|first=Rex J.|title=The Legal Dimensions of Oil and Gas in Iraq: Current Reality and Future Prospects|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page =264|isbn=9780521766616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 19 March 1914, the British and German governments had signed an agreement whereby the interest of [[National Bank of Turkey]] in TPC was transferred to APOC. The newly reconstituted TPC then applied for a concession for Mesopotamian oil which was granted subject to various conditions at which point [[World War I]] intervened. In December 1918, the British expropriated the 25% share of Deutsche Bank in TPC.&lt;ref name = Earle&gt;Earle, Edward Meade 1924 The Turkish Petroleum Company:A Study in Oleaginous Diplomacy Political Science Quarterly, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 265-279&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}}

It was this latter share that was ultimately to be given to the French under the San Remo oil agreement. There were prior abortive attempts at an agreement, preliminary and then final version of the Long-Bérenger Agreement,&lt;ref name = Marian&gt;Marian Kent 1976 Oil &amp; Empire:British Policy and Mesopotamian Oil 1900-1920 Macmillan Press {{ISBN|9781349020812}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |148 &amp; 172}} then the Greenwood-Bérenger Agreement before the final San Remo version. All versions can be seen at.&lt;ref name ="Marian"/&gt;{{rp|172–8}}
 
The agreement delimited the oil interests in [[Russia]] and [[Romania]], British ([[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]) and French colonies. The initial agreement takes the names of the British petroleum minister, Sir Walter Long, and the French petroleum minister, Henri Bérenger, who negotiated the agreement.&lt;ref name=Gareth&gt;G.

The '''University of Toronto Students' Union''' ('''UTSU'''), legally known as the '''Students' Administrative Council of the University of Toronto, Inc.''', is a student advocacy group at the [[University of Toronto]]. It is [[Canada]]'s second largest student union and the third largest in [[North America]].

==History==
The council evolved from the University of Toronto Union, which was founded in 1901. This was replaced by the Students' Parliament in 1907. The Students' Parliament suffered from low attendance from its elected members, especially representatives of the medical school. As the years progressed its Executive shouldered much of the work. In 1913, the parliament was replaced by a Students' Administrative Council composed of solely male students. The Women's Students' Administrative Council was formed in 1916, and in 1919 the two councils formed a Joint Executive. In 1931 the separate councils were abolished and the Joint Executive became the main body, and during 1935-1936 the unwieldy name "Joint Executive Students' Administrative Council" was simplified to "Students' Administrative Council". At an annual general meeting on 16 November 2006 University of Toronto students voted to change the name to University of Toronto Students' Union.

The mandate of UTSU until 1971 can be found in section 34 of the University of Toronto Act, 1947. SAC's original offices were located in [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]], but are today based in the [[Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory|Louis B. Stewart Observatory]] at the centre of Hart House Circle, just south of the Hart House building itself.

==Governance==
The Union is governed by a Board of Directors which includes elected representatives from each of the schools' federated and constituent colleges and professional faculties. The number of directors from each division is proportional to the population of that college or faculty.

The Union runs through its standing committees, and the Board of Directors. The bulk of the Union's work is put through the committees: Accessibility, Campaigns, Clubs, Elections and Referenda, Equity, Finance, Governance, Outreach, Services, Student Aid, and the Executive Committee. The committees are made up of members of the board of directors and deal with specific issues of operations and services. Projects and budgets move up through the commissions and committees. Students can participate in Working Groups, which can include any University of Toronto St. George student as long as at least half of them are UTSU members. Working Groups have a short-term, student focused mandate to complete a project.

===Federal structure===
In April 2013, students of the Engineering Society (EngSoc), one of the UTSU federated bodies, voted to separate from UTSU following several years of tension between EngSoc and UTSU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skulepedia.ca/wiki/2012-2013|title=2012-2013 - Skulepedia|website=skulepedia.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannon.skule.ca/how-the-current-state-of-engsoc-utsu-relations-came-to-be/|title=How the Current State of EngSoc-UTSU Relations Came to Be - The Cannon|website=cannon.skule.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentunion.ca/docs3/U%20of%20T%20EngSoc%20-%20Report%20on%20UTSU%20elections%20reform%20-%20August%2018,%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=University of Toronto Engineering Society
|date=August 18, 2010 |website=Studentunion.ca |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of negotiations, UTSU and EngSoc came to an agreement where UTSU recognised EngSoc as the main student government for engineering students, ensured that EngSoc would receive half of all UTSU levies and put EngSoc as the primary provider of student services to engineering students. EngSoc agreed not to defederate in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2015/07/28/utsu-and-engsoc-strike-a-deal/|title=UTSU and EngSoc strike a deal|date=28 July 2015|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2015/09/28/utsu-engsoc-reach-historic-fee-agreement/|title=UTSU, EngSoc reach historic fee agreement|date=28 September 2015|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utsu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UTSU-EngSoc-Contract-FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=Associate Membership Agreement |website=Utsu.ca |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
[[Voter turnout]] in UTSU elections was very low for several years. Recently, turnouts began reaching as high as the 15% mark, but have once again dropped to 6% following the controversy surrounding the 2010 elections.

==Services and businesses==
UTSU provides a variety of student services, including a Used Textbook Exchange, the U of T Food and Clothing Bank, and funding and services for campus clubs. UTSU also administers the student Health and Dental Plan and Student Discount Metropass sales, a program that was recently made permanent after lobbying from student unions throughout the Toronto area.

==National affiliation== 
In November 2002, UTSU members voted in favour of becoming members of the [[Canadian Federation of Students]], with 65% of those who voted supporting this decision.

in 2016, a movement called You Decide UofT launched a petition to hold a referendum on CFS membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2016/09/03/petition-for-referendum-on-utsu-membership-with-the-cfs-launched/|title=Petition for referendum on UTSU membership with the CFS launched|date=3 September 2016|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, 4 out of the 7 UTSU exec endorsed the campaign and called for an end to UTSU membership of the CFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2017/01/24/utsu-executives-endorse-discontinuing-cfs-membership/|title=UTSU executives endorse discontinuing CFS membership|date=24 January 2017|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2017 UTSU elections, the Demand Better slate, which had a policy of leaving the CFS, won most of the executive positions, including the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demandbetter.ca/platform|title=Demand Better UofT|date=13 March 2017|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313175323/http://www.demandbetter.ca/platform|archivedate=13 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestrand.ca/utsu-elections-demand-better-mathias-memmel/|title=UTSU Elections  2017: Demand Better, Mathias Memmel - The Strand|website=thestrand.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2017/03/16/demand-better-wins-most-utsu-executive-positions-unofficial-election-results/|title=Demand Better wins most UTSU executive positions, unofficial election results show|date=17 March 2017|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flat Fees'''

In 2009, the University of Toronto changed how they charged fees to students in the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science. Instead of charging per-course fees, they started charging a flat fee – meaning that students would have to pay for five courses – even if they only took three. This amounted to a 66 per cent tuition fee increase for no service improvement.

The UTSU had been opposing the flat fee structure since it was announced in 2009. Since the implementation of the program, students have found it difficult to have a part time job and do well in their studies, since they do not have the choice to reduce their course load under this tuition fee scheme. The flat fee scheme has also placed additional financial stresses onto students, worsening concerns about mental health.
They launched a strong campaign over the last few years to address this issue. In addition to petitions and protests, we garnered support from alumni, who started a letter-writing campaign to oppose flat fees, we brought the issue to a provincial level through the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario, making it one of their main lobbying asks and educating students across the province to the unfair fee-collection model, some of whom did not know it was taking place at their school.

In 2013 the UTSU ramped up our campaign, collecting more than 6000 postcard petitions from students asking the government to address the issue of flat fees and delivering them to the Brad Duguid, Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.
In December 2013, the provincial government announced that new legislation would limit the amount of fees that universities can charge to students. Under the new policy, 100 per cent of tuition fees can only be charged if students are taking an 80 per cent course load or higher. This will reduce tuition fees for some students over $2300 per year. The changes will roll out over two years starting in fall 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140428072120/http://utsu.ca/victories/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access copyright'''
UTSU was a vocal opponent of the University's controversial license with Access Copyright, which has since not been renewed. Access Copyright claimed that the license would provide students with the ability to use copyrighted works without penalty – a right already granted to students through the Copyright Act. Affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, students and researchers are permitted to use copyrighted works for educational purposes. Under the former license, each student at the University of Toronto was charged $26 in fees that provided no service or protections for students.

==Criticisms and controversy==
'''Historical criticisms'''

UTSU and its predecessor body SAC have long been the target of criticism. The earliest manifestations of this were in response to SAC's policy, established in 1926, of not interfering in political issues for fear this would impede campus unity. This policy extended to [[The Varsity (newspaper)]], which was published by SAC. In 1929 and 1931, SAC dismissed editors who published unpopular opinions. In the mid-1930s, SAC was criticized for failing to support efforts by anti-war and pro-peace advocates on campus, groups which SAC declared were of limited interest.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Levi "The SAC Historical Project 1930-1950", self-published, 1992, pp. 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, SAC's decision not to endorse efforts to prevent deportation of [[Japanese Canadians]] was also the brunt of campus criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Levi, "SAC Historical Project", 209-216&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-racist advocates also derided SAC's inability to embrace this cause in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Levi, "SAC Historical Project", 120-140&lt;/ref&gt;

This criticism began to shift in the 1960s when the student council embarked on a more activist agenda.  One of the more concrete manifestations of this was in 1972, when the Medical Society held a successful referendum calling for their withdrawal from SAC.  Administrative hesitation was the only factor which prevented this withdrawal from becoming effective.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sajani, President, Medical Society to J.H. Sword, Acting President U of T, February 25, 1972 University of Toronto Archives [UTA], A78-0028/29; John Evans, President of U of T to Robin Ross, Registrar, October 12, 1972, in University of Toronto Archives A78-0028/64&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversial public positions'''

The UTSU has been criticized for having taken controversial public positions on equity and racial issues on campus, as well as having become involved in controversial campaigns relating to certain global issues like the Sri Lankan conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2009/05/27/utsu-staffer-arrested-in-tamil-protest/|title=UTSU staffer arrested in Tamil protest|date=27 May 2009|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and federal issues like the Aboriginal movement Idle No More. Many criticisms have come from members of provincial and federal political parties, including both the Liberals and Conservatives (and their student arms), which have questioned the legitimacy of UTSU's democratic credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/university-of-toronto-liberals/the-utsu-should-worry-you/416661311730295|title=The UTSU should worry you|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007 CFS campaign allegations'''

The UTSU has also been criticized for its involvement with the Canadian Federation of Students, due to numerous reports of interference with student union elections at other schools in the Greater Toronto Area. Former S.A.C. Vice-President Sam Rahimi (2004-2005), has claimed that he was repeatedly asked to participate in election campaigns at Ryerson and York Universities, and that he and other student leaders from S.A.C. were bused in to these schools at election time to campaign on behalf of C.F.S. friendly slates &lt;ref&gt;R.

'''2008 threats of legal action'''

The UTSU has recently been involved in a number of scandals in which they have been accused of silencing students who disagree with the ideas of the union.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/article/1010|title=UTSU undermining democracy - Comment|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312082852/http://www.thevarsity.ca/article/1010|archive-date=12 March 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent referendum regarding the construction a Student Commons Building that was to be completely funded and run by students (as opposed to funded by private donations and run in part by the administration and by students {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}) the UTSU was accused of actively pursuing students who it felt were campaigning against the union.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The then president of the union went so far as to threaten legal action against a student who was putting up posters questioning the UTSU's approach to the student commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/article/1107|title=theVARSITY.ca - Editorial: U of T’s democratic sham - Comment|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122072719/http://www.thevarsity.ca/article/1107|archive-date=22 January 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012 lecture protests'''

A protest in November 2012 against guest lecturer [[Warren Farrell]] at an event organized by the [[Canadian Association for Equality]] garnered criticism after an estimated fifteen protesters blocked the entrance to the event and caused a delay in the lecture. One person was arrested at the event but was released with no charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2012/11/17/arrest-assaults-overshadow-mens-issues-lecture/|title=Arrest, assaults overshadow “men’s issues” lecture|date=17 November 2012|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UTSU organized the protest after the university administration denied their request to cancel the lecture. The protest was organized in response to controversial excerpts from Warren Farrell's publications and statements he made about incest in a 1977 [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsu.ca/content/3316|title=University of Toronto Students' Union - Statement re: Event/Rally Nov 16, 2012|website=Utsu.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323155648/http://www.utsu.ca/content/3316|archivedate=23 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewspaper.ca/the-news/item/1002-students-against-sexism-protest-men%E2%80%99s-issues-talk|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130407143454/http://www.thenewspaper.ca/the-news/item/1002-students-against-sexism-protest-men%E2%80%99s-issues-talk|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 April 2013|title=Students Against Sexism protest Men’s Issues talk - the newspaper|website=Thenewspaper.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the feminist protesters is recorded as repeatedly saying "You are fucking scum" to a male attendee.

'''2013 membership defederation'''

In 2013, several major divisions of the UTSU's membership—Trinity College, Victoria College, and the Engineering Society— held referenda proposing effective "defederation" from the Union by rerouting fees directly to their respective College or Faculty-based student societies, rather than paying the fees to the Union. All three divisions voted overwhelmingly in favour of fee diversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2013/10/07/dissatisfied-divisions-cite-scarborough-leaving-utsu-as-precedent-for-fee-diversion/|title=Dissatisfied divisions cite Scarborough leaving UTSU as precedent for fee diversion|date=7 October 2013|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015 election'''

After a long history of incumbent election victories, in 2015, a non-incumbent opposition slate won all 5 of the executive seats and a large number of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2015/03/30/brighter-uoft-victorious/|title=Brighter UofT victorious|date=30 March 2015|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2015/04/17/utsu-election-results-ratified/|title=UTSU election results ratified|date=17 April 2015|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawsuit against former executives and executive director'''

On September 24, 2015, it was revealed that the UTSU had filed a statement of claim against the former president, former vice-president internal &amp; services and the former executive director regarding the dismissal of the former executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2015/09/24/utsu-sues-former-executive-director-president-vice-president-internal-and-services/|title=UTSU sues former executive director, president, vice-president internal and services|date=24 September 2015|website=Thevarity.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/u-of-t-students-union-sues-former-director-ex-officials-over-severance-pay-1.2582603|title=U of T students' union sues former director, ex-officials over severance pay|first=Paola|last=Loriggio|date=26 September 2015|website=Toronto.ctvnews.ca|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit has since been settled between the former president and former vice-president internal &amp; services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">'''Voting age population''' (VAP) refers to the set of individuals that have reached the minimum voting age for a particular geographical or political unit. The presumption is that they are therefore generally eligible to vote, although other additional factors may cause them to be ineligible, such as lack of citizenship or a prior felony conviction. In estimating [[voter turnout]] the voting age population for a political unit is often used as the denominator for the number of individuals eligible to vote in a given election; this method has been shown to lose in accuracy when a larger percentage of the VAP is ineligible to vote. In the United States individuals become eligible to vote in political elections at age 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Michael|title=Voter Turnout|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm|publisher=United States Election Project|accessdate=2012-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514115243/http://elections.gmu.edu/voter_turnout.htm|archive-date=2008-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voter file usage ==
In the context of [[voter file]]s used for political organizing, VAP has a slightly different meaning and refers individuals who reside in a geography and who are not currently registered to vote, because under normal circumstances only individuals who are registered to vote would be included in political communications (due to cost efficiency). These VAP records are typically identified by matching a commercial marketing database to state voter registration data and flagging records which are not found to be registered to vote. Political organizations can then use those flags to include or exclude unregistered individuals in target lists for political organizing programs, such as communications that encourage voter registration or voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Registration|url=http://www.targetsmartcommunications.com/solutions/voter-registration/|publisher=TargetSmart Communications|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">[[File:Butchers'_Hall_(London).jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to Hall]]
The '''Worshipful Company of Butchers''' is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]], [[England]]. Records indicate that an organisation of [[Butchers]] existed as early as 975; the Butchers' Guild, the direct predecessor of the present Company, was granted the right to regulate the trade in 1331. The Butchers' Guild was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] centuries later, in 1605. The Butchers' still, unlike other Livery Companies, continues to exist as a trade association for members of the industry, instead of evolving into an institution primarily dedicated to charity. However, the Company does contribute, like all Livery Companies, to various charities.

The Company ranks twenty-fourth in the [[Livery Company#Precedence|order of precedence]] of [[City of London|City]] Livery Companies. The Company's motto is: ''Omnia Subiecisti Sub Pedibus, Oves Et Boves'', from the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and Latin for: ''Thou Hast Put All Things Under Man's Feet, All Sheep and Oxen''.

== History of the Butchers Hall ==
The Company's headquarters is at Butchers' Hall. The Butchers' has had several halls throughout its history; the first was located in Monkwell Street and dated from the second half of the 15th century. The next Hall near [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666, together with forty three other Livery Company Halls. Its successor in Pudding Lane (1667–77) was again burnt down, rebuilt in 1829-30 and compulsorily purchased by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1882. A new Hall was built at the present site in Bartholomew Close (1884–85), which was bombed in both [[world war]]s: 1915 and again in 1944. The Company's present Hall dates from 1960.

== Royal connections ==
HM [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] was admitted as an [[Honorary Freeman]] of the Company in March 1976, continuing a link with the [[Monarchy]] that started with King [[James I]] in 1605; she took a constant interest in "Her Butchers". Following the Queen Mother's death in March 2002, her granddaughter, HRH the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] was admitted to the Honorary Freedom of the Company (February 2003). Like the Queen Mother, the Princess Royal takes a keen interest in Company affairs, serving as its [[Master (form of address)|Master]] (2011–12).

== Other links ==
The Butchers' connections with the local area remain strong, many Liverymen working at [[Smithfield Market]].

The Butchers' Hall and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] have also stood side by side for years, forging links that continue to this day.

The Butchers' also maintains close relations with [[Commonwealth]] and international associations. For instance, the [[Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom|Australian High Commissioner]] and [[List of high commissioners of New Zealand to the United Kingdom|New Zealand High Commissioner]] are customarily granted the [[Title of honor|Honorary]] [[Freedom of the City|Freedom]] of the Company.

[[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] is the Butchers' adopted [[Church of England|Church]], and is where the Company's Annual Church Service takes place prior to Common Hall. The Honorary [[Chaplain]] to the Master Butcher is often the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|St Barts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">At least three organisations have used the name '''Young Labour League'''.

==Australia==
The first Young Labor League appears to have been founded in [[Australia]] in the last years of the 19th century, and became associated with the [[Australian Labor Party]].

==United Kingdom==
The second Young Labour League was founded in [[Clapham]], [[England]], in 1920, and became the youth wing of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Labour Party (UK)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1924.

==Ireland==
The third Young Labour League was founded in [[Dublin]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in about 1966 or 1967 with the encouragement of [[Proinsias Mac Aonghusa]]. It was founded by Brian O'Higgins, the son of an [[Irish people|Irish]] actor, with some female members in [[Dublin]]. Despite O'Higgins' efforts, and support from within the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] from figures such as [[Flor O'Mahony]] (later a Senator and a Member of the European Parliament), it was not in its early days recognised as an affiliated body. 

An early meeting was addressed by [[Noel Browne]].

Its campaigns included supporting [[Radio Caroline]], a pirate radio station, selling the Labour Party newspaper in [[Dublin]] pubs, and it produced a regular newsletter mostly written by Brian O'Higgins, including articles on the June 1967 War in the [[Middle East]], which was composited and hand printed on a small old press in O'Higgins' house in [[Dublin]].

It had the only stall at [[Liberty Hall]], [[Dublin]], at the Party's annual conference at which [[Brendan Corish]] announced that: "The Seventies will be Socialist". The stall, at the entrance to the conference, sold ''Corish Speaks'' (a collection of speeches on national affairs by Brendan Corish, edited and introduced by [[Proinsias Mac Aonghusa]]), pamphlets by [[James Connolly]], and other publications.

Its members assisted the Party during elections.

The League carried on a campaign against [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], a Labour Party deputy (Member of Parliament) in the legislative assembly known as the [[Dáil]], but it was intensely loyal to [[Brendan Corish]]. It criticized Tully as a numbers man and an opportunist. Those fears were later to be justified, as Tully, when he later became the Minister for Local Government, was alleged to have attempted a gerrymander, which resulted in a large voter backlash against the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] at the next election.

It had ceased to exist by the early 1970s. It was succeeded by [[Labour Youth]].
