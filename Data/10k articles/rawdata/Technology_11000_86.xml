An '''ATM Adaptation layer 1''' or '''AAL1''' is used for transmitting Class A network traffic, that is, real-time, constant [[bit rate]], [[connection oriented]] traffic (example- uncompressed [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]]). Bits are fed in by the application at constant rate and must be delivered to other end with minimum delay, [[jitter]] or overhead. The input is stream of bits without message boundaries. For this traffic, [[error detection]] [[Communications protocol|protocols]] cannot be used since timeouts and retransmission causes delay but the missing cells are reported to the application, that must take its own action to recover from them.

An '''absorption refrigerator''' is a [[refrigerator]] that uses a heat source (e.g., [[Solar thermal energy|solar]] energy, a fossil-fueled flame, [[waste heat]] from factories, or [[district heating]] systems) to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process.

The principle can also be used to [[air conditioning|air-condition]] buildings using the waste heat from a [[gas turbine]] or [[water heater]]. Using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces [[electricity]], then hot water, and finally, air-conditioning (called [[cogeneration]]/trigeneration).

The [[American National Standards Institute]] standard for the absorption refrigerator is given by the ANSI/AHRI standard 560–2000.&lt;ref&gt;PDF document for download at {{cite web|url=http://www.ahrinet.org/App_Content/ahri/files/standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20ARI560-2000.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031112012/http://ahrinet.org/App_Content/ahri/files/standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20ARI560-2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression cycle]] it lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators where electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the compressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from turbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).

Absorption cooling was invented by the French scientist [[Ferdinand Carré]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Granryd &amp; Björn Palm, Refrigerating engineering, Stockholm [[Royal Institute of Technology]], 2005, see chap. 4-3&lt;/ref&gt; The original design used water and sulphuric acid.

In 1922 [[Baltzar von Platen (1898-1984)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]], while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], enhanced the principle with a 3-fluid configuration. This "Platen-Munters" design can operate without a pump.

Commercial production began in 1923 by the newly formed company ''AB Arctic'', which was bought by [[Electrolux]] in 1925. In the 1960s, absorption refrigeration saw a renaissance due to the substantial demand for refrigerators for [[travel trailer|caravan]]s (travel trailers). AB Electrolux established a subsidiary in the United States, named Dometic Sales Corporation. The company marketed refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs) under the ''[[Dometic]]'' brand. In 2001, Electrolux sold most of its leisure products line to the venture-capital company [[EQT Partners|EQT]] which created ''Dometic'' as a stand-alone company.

In 1926, [[Albert Einstein]] and his former student [[Leó Szilárd]] proposed an alternative design known as the [[Einstein refrigerator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?q=1781541|title=US Patent 1781541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[TED Conference]], [[Adam Grosser]]  presented his research of a new, very small, "intermittent absorption" vaccine refrigeration unit for use in third world countries.  The refrigerator is a small unit placed over a campfire, that can later be used to cool 15 liters of water to just above freezing for 24 hours in a 30&amp;nbsp;°C environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grosser_and_his_sustainable_fridge.html|title=Adam Grosser and his sustainable fridge|author=Adam Grosser|date=Feb 2007|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
[[File:Absorption cooling.png|thumb|right|Absorption cooling process]]
Both absorption and [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|compressor refrigerators]] use a refrigerant with a very low [[boiling point]] (less than {{convert|-18|°C|°F}}). In both types, when this refrigerant evaporates (boils), it takes some heat away with it, providing the cooling effect. The main difference between the two systems is the way the refrigerant is changed from a gas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat. An absorption refrigerator changes the gas back into a liquid using a method that needs only heat, and has no moving parts other than the refrigerant itself.

The absorption cooling cycle can be described in three phases:
#'''Evaporation''': A liquid refrigerant evaporates in a low [[partial pressure]] environment, thus extracting heat from its surroundings (e.g. the refrigerator's compartment). Because of the low partial pressure, the temperature needed for evaporation is also low.
#'''Absorption''': The now gaseous refrigerant is absorbed by another liquid (e.g. a salt solution).
#'''Regeneration''': The refrigerant-saturated liquid is heated, causing the refrigerant to evaporate out. The hot gaseous refrigerant passes through a heat exchanger, transferring its heat outside the system (such as to surrounding ambient-temperature air), and condenses.  The condensed (liquid) refrigerant supplies the evaporation phase.

In comparison, a compressor refrigerator uses a compressor, usually powered by either an electric or internal combustion motor, to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant. The resulting hot, high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger ("condenser") that is exposed to the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant, now at a temperature near to that of the external environment, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section.  The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section.  The lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate, which [[evaporative cooling|absorbs heat]] from the refrigerator food compartment. The now-vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle.

Another difference between the two types is the refrigerant used. Compressor refrigerators typically use an [[Chlorofluorocarbon|HCFC]] or [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]], while absorption refrigerators typically use [[ammonia]] or [[water]].

===Simple salt and water system===
A simple absorption refrigeration system common in large commercial plants uses a solution of [[lithium bromide]] and [[lithium chloride]] salt and water.  Water under low pressure is evaporated from the coils that are being chilled. The water is absorbed by a lithium bromide/water solution. The system drives the water off the lithium bromide solution with heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sapali|first=S. N|title=Textbook Of Refrigeration And Air-Conditioning|publisher=PHI learning|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-203-3360-4|page=258|chapter=Lithium Bromide Absorption Refrigeration System}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear right}}

===Water spray absorption refrigeration===
[[File:Absorptive refrigeration.svg|thumb|right|Water spray absorption system]]
Another variant, uses air, water, and a salt water solution. The intake of warm, moist air is passed through a sprayed solution of salt water. The spray lowers the humidity but does not significantly change the temperature. The less humid, warm air is then passed through an [[evaporative cooler]], consisting of a spray of fresh water, which cools and re-humidifies the air. Humidity is removed from the cooled air with another spray of salt solution, providing the outlet of cool, dry air.

The salt solution is regenerated by heating it under low pressure, causing water to evaporate. The water evaporated from the salt solution is re-condensed, and rerouted back to the evaporative cooler.

===Single pressure absorption refrigeration===

1. Hydrogen enters the pipe with liquid ammonia&lt;br&gt;
2. Ammonia and hydrogen enter the inner compartment of the refrigerator. An increase in volume causes a decrease in the partial pressure of the liquid ammonia. The ammonia evaporates, taking heat from the liquid ammonia (ΔH&lt;sub&gt;Vap&lt;/sub&gt;) and thus lowering its temperature. Heat flows from the hotter interior of the refrigerator to the colder liquid, promoting further evaporation.&lt;br&gt;
3. Ammonia and hydrogen return from the inner compartment, ammonia returns to absorber and dissolves in water. Hydrogen is free to rise upwards.&lt;br&gt;
4. Ammonia gas condensation (passive cooling).&lt;br&gt;
5. Hot ammonia (gas).&lt;br&gt;
6. Heat insulation and distillation of ammonia gas from water.&lt;br&gt;
7. Heat source (electric).&lt;br&gt;
8. Absorber vessel (water and ammonia solution).]]

[[File:Thermal_image_of_a_domestic_absorption_refrigerator.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Thermal image of a domestic absorption refrigerator''' of a comparable type to the one in the labelled image above. Colour indicates relative temperature: blue=cold, red is hottest. The heat source (7) is contained entirely within the insulation section (6).]]

A single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a liquid's evaporation rate depends upon the ''partial'' pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes down with lower partial pressure.  While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant (therefore high evaporation rate) in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator, but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure (therefore low evaporation rate) in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator.

The refrigerator uses three substances: [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen]] gas, and [[water]]. The cycle is closed, with all hydrogen, water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused. The system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil (the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator, by being hotter than the outside air.) This pressure is typically 14–16&amp;nbsp;atm at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F).

The cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia at room temperature entering the evaporator. The volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the [[partial pressure]] of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the [[evaporation rate]] of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator's interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature. It continues to evaporate, while the large [[enthalpy of vaporization]] (heat) flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.

In the next two steps, the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen so it can be reused.

#The ammonia (gas) and hydrogen (gas) mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber. In the absorber, this mixture of gases contacts water (technically, a weak solution of ammonia in water). The gaseous ammonia dissolves in the water, while the hydrogen, which doesn't, collects at the top of the absorber, leaving the now-strong ammonia-and-water solution at the bottom. The hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water.
#The next step separates the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator (boiler), where heat is applied to boil off the ammonia, leaving most of the water (which has a higher boiling point) behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator.

The pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser. In this [[heat exchanger]], the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air, which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia, and therefore condenses. The condensed (liquid) ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas released from the absorption step, repeating the cycle.

'''AccelStor Ltd.''' (formerly AccelStor, Inc.) Chinese: '''英屬開曼群島商捷鼎創新股份有限公司''' (formerly 捷鼎國際股份有限公司). AccelStor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/innodisk-supermicro-and-toshiba-join-together-for-ssd-cloud-storage-484896.shtml|title=InnoDisk, Supermicro and Toshiba Join Forces for SSD Cloud Storage|first=Horia|last=Despa|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an All Flash Storage OEM founded on November 27, 2014 in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accelstor|title=AccelStor - crunchbase|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing Storage Appliance products, AccelStor also offers exclusive [[flash memory]] and storage acceleration software technology.

== History ==
AccelStor was founded by veterans of the storage, networking and IT markets in Taiwan in November 2014. The company’s product lineup consists of NVMe JBOF storage arrays (P310/P810), SATA JBOF All Flash Storage arrays (P710/P710-E/P710-SLED) and HA series Dual controller All Flash arrays (H510 &amp; H710).

J series extension shelves are also available for P710 &amp; HA models which can extend usable capacity to 1.1 PetaByte effective storage using Data Deduplication techniques and compression algorithms.

The distinguishing characteristic and feature of AccelStor AFA systems is their FlexiSuite™ software which includes an FMS 2016 award winning RAID replacement technology called FlexiRemap™ which won the best of show award at the 2016 FMS show in Santa Clara, California and which delivers stunning levels of sustained random WRITE IOPS performance (732,000 write IOPS @ 4K) with random reads delivering over 1.1 million IOPS @ 4K on their P710 SATA platforms.

FlexiRemap™ was designed to solve the problems that traditional RAID brings to NAND Flash memory used in SSD disk which causes hotspots in the SSD used for parity and uneven load in remaining data carrying SSD's in a traditional RAID grouping. FlexiRemap™ uses two parity drives, two hot spares and evenly loads the remaining data SSD's by using an award winning algorithm that delivers stunning performance at a 28% Data Protection and serial write packing overhead, which when compared to RAID 5 (27% overhead) is a very reasonable overhead considering that it is delivering 3x extended SSD durability, 13x Performance boost over RAID 5 and very attractive latency features to boot.

FlexiRemap™ outperforms Pure Storage RAID 3D by a wide margin and delivers maximum performance offered by current PCIe 3.0 server technology.

AccelStor use three different hardware providers for their base systems, featuring SuperMicro platforms for the P710 and H series systems, AIC for the P310 NVMe platform and Dell for the new P810 NVMe AFA platform. 

The P710-SLED (US) &amp; P710-E (EU) was recently launched under pressure from their USA based Chief Solutions Architect to address the Education market gap for an AFA solution serving VMware VDI virtual machines for students at a price point lower than high end spinning Disk based storage arrays from EMC, Pure Storage and HPe.

The US arm of the company is called AccelStor Solutions and operates out of Fremont California.

All AccelStor SATA and SAS platforms have shelf extension capability and the latest code revision with all the bells and whistle features in code release 4.0. 6U for 1.1 PB storage is an attractive option for customers who require high IOPS storage platforms at pricing lower than spinning disk solutions from EMC and HPe.

AccelStor FlexiSuite™ software offers full storage Data Services features such as FlexiDedupe™, FlexiSnap™, FlexiClone™ and FlexiRemap™ with Replication capability as well..

AccelStor are also about to release NeoTopaz™ technology at the 2018 Flash memory Summit in Santa Clara, California which is an NVMe storage technology that utilizes RDMA over 100GB Ethernet (RoCE) and offers up virtual storage controllers in a virtual all flash array format called vFlexiArray™.

vFlexiArrays™ can use the unique AccelStor share-nothing architecture for HA, or the more traditional two controllers with one set of storage HA solution. The Share nothing architecture has two separate and unique storage sets with synchronization taking place between the two virtual controllers over RoCE on 100GbE.

This architecture allows the virtual storage arrays to use the exact SSD type required for each storage use case and compute power can be scaled with memory and storage in separate silos. All data is isolated and fully protected and the virtual storage arrays use the full AccelStor award winning FlexiSuite™ technology pack on each vFlexiArray™ that includes the RAID free technology called FlexiRemap™.

== FlexiRemap™ Technology ==
Specifically designed for NAND flash memory operations, AccelStor’s [https://www.accelstor.com/category/flexiremap_technology FlexiRemap™ technology] features a unique architectural re-design of RAID operation that considerably speeds up random I/O requests, a major cause of storage-access slowdowns. Unlike traditional [[RAID]] algorithms, FlexiRemap™ remaps data before passing it to the underlying flash memory layer, avoiding unnecessary processing overhead and extending the lifespan of SSDs by a large margin.

FlexiRemap™ harnesses the power of processor architecture by managing the underlying flash memory directly from the kernel level of the operating system. This technology packs data intelligently during random writes, accelerating access and improving performance. Data is written onto each [[SSD|data carrying SSD]] evenly to prevent any section from wearing out prematurely as seen with RAID 5 and RAID 6. FlexiRemap™ also simplifies SSD management by integrating all the SSDs into a single store, combining capacity with data-access performance.

The power of AccelStor FlexiRemap™ technology is best demonstrated in AccelStor [https://www.accelstor.com/category/neosapphire_series NeoSapphire all-flash arrays], which can deliver more than 732,000 sustained WRITE IOPS @ 4KB random writes in standalone rack-mount form factors, reaching the highest performance tier for enterprise and datacenter storage systems.

== Products ==
===NeoSapphire™ All-Flash Array Series===

AccelStor’s NeoSapphire™ series of all-flash array storage appliances come in NVMe or SATA based SSD formats and are powered by AccelStor FlexiRemap™ technology which delivers sustained high levels of performance. With up to 732K WRITE IOPS @ 4K, NeoSapphire™ arrays significantly speed up data access and processing performance while reducing power consumption and increasing available space utilization making them suitable for real world random read/write mixed load operations that traditional storage systems have difficulty processing and also for huge volumes of data that need to be processed very rapidly by AI or similar technology. NeoSapphire™ arrays come in standard 1U or 2U rack-mount form factors and feature web-based GUI management, multi-protocol support, front-accessible hot-swappable SSDs, and redundancy through virtual data groups.

AccelStor spend a great deal of effort ensuring VMware, Openstack &amp; Windows Server compatibility at extreme levels of performance as well as being one of the few storage devices that offer parallel cluster file system support such as BeeGFS as well as other HPC enhancements related to performance levels on a host of other file systems including standard CIFS and NFS support.

AI platforms in particular see huge benefits from utilizing AccelStor AFA series appliances in their solution architecture as it offers the performance levels AI needs for real time problem solving using rapid data search capabilities. Genomic Sequencing operations also require ultra fast and low latency characteristics and NeoSapphire™ arrays are working globally with DNA sequencers successfully in this role.

===NVMe Flash Arrays===
* [https://www.accelstor.com/category/professional_models/?pageType=more&amp;product_id=1139 NeoSapphire™ P310]
* NeoSapphire™ P810

The P310 is available with either four Fiber Channel or six 10 GbE SFP+ interfaces, 8 SSD drive capability and is usually armed with 4TB SSD drives. The P310 is typically used for HPC, AI and tasks such as DNA sequencing and facial recognition applications requiring low latency and high sustained IOPS.

The P810 is a new 24 SSD capable platform based on Dell hardware. Details and spec forthcoming as of June 2018. It was seen at Computex Taipei 2018 where the H710 was also showcased.

AccelStor is also busy developing its NeoTopaz™ successor to NeoSapphire™, though they will realistically be complimentary but separate products and architectures which both use the FlexiSuite™. NeoTopaz™ focuses on NVMe-oF which uses RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to overcome the data challenges design architects face with shared NVMe-oF access.

NeoTopaz™ is expected Q3/Q4 2018.

In [[engineering]] and [[machining]], an '''allowance''' is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] or [[theoretical]] dimension, or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept is that a certain amount of difference ''allows for'' some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An ''allowance,'' which is a ''planned'' deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]],'' which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.

Allowance is basically the size difference between components that work together. Allowance between parts that are assembled is very important. For example, the axle of a car has to be supported in a bearing otherwise it will fall to the ground. If there was no gap between the axle and the bearing then there would be a lot of friction and it would be difficult to get the car to move. If there was too much of a gap then the axle would be jumping around in the bearing. It is important to get the allowance between the axle and the bearing correct so that the axle rotates smoothly and easily without juddering. 

__TOC__

==Examples of engineering and machining allowances==

* Outer dimensions (such as the length of a bar) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of a hole) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for a predictable dimensional change following future cutting, [[Grinding machine|grinding]], or [[Heat treatment|heat-treating]] operations. For example:
** the outer diameter of a pin may be ground to {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}} oversize because it is known that subsequent heat-treatment of the pin is going to cause it to shrink by {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}}.
** A hole may be drilled {{convert|0.012|in|mm|2}} undersize to allow for the material that will be removed by subsequent [[Reamer|reaming]].
* Outer dimensions (such as the diameter of a railroad car's axle) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of the railroad car's wheel hub) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for an [[interference fit|interference fit (press fit)]].
* A part may be cast intentionally too big when it is desired to later machine the surface. This ensures that the roughness that the casting process leaves is removed, and a smooth machined surface is produced. This machining allowance may be e.g. 1mm, but this depends on the size of the part and the accuracy of the casting process.
* A chain segment may be oversized so that at the end of its useful service life (around 20 years), the corroded chain is still above the minimum diameter required to meet the minimum break strength.  This is called a corrosion allowance and accounts for the steel molecules lost through oxidation, erosion and wear, and Microbially Influenced Corrosion.

==Confounding of the engineering concepts of ''allowance'' and ''tolerance''==
{{see also|Engineering tolerance}}
Often the terms ''allowance'' and ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]'' are used inaccurately and are improperly interchanged in engineering contexts. This is logical because both words generally can relate to the abstract concept of permission — that is, of a limit on what is acceptable. However, in engineering, separate meanings are enforced, as explained below.

A tolerance is the limit of acceptable ''unintended'' deviation from a nominal or theoretical dimension. Therefore, a pair of tolerances, upper and lower, defines a range within which an actual dimension may fall while still being acceptable.

In contrast, an allowance is a ''planned'' deviation from the nominal or theoretical dimension.

=== Example ===
An example of the concept of tolerance is a shaft for a machine is intended to be precisely 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter: 10&amp;nbsp;mm is the ''nominal'' dimension. The engineer designing the machine knows that in reality, the [[grinding machine|grinding]] operation that produces the final diameter may introduce a certain small-but-unavoidable amount of random error. Therefore, the engineer specifies a tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm).

As long as the grinding machine operator can produce a shaft with actual diameter somewhere between 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, the shaft is acceptable. Understanding how much error is predictable in a process and how much is easily avoidable; how much is unavoidable (or whose avoidance is possible but simply too expensive to justify); and how much is truly acceptable involves considerable judgment, intelligence, and experience.

An example of the concept of allowance can be shown in relation to the hole that this shaft must enter. It is evident that the above shaft cannot be certain to freely enter a hole that is also 10&amp;nbsp;mm with the same tolerance. It might, if the actual shaft diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, but it would not if conversely the actual shaft diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm.

To be sure that there will be enough clearance between the shaft and its hole, ''taking account of the tolerance,'' an ''allowance'' is ''intentionally'' introduced in the dimensions specified. The hole diameter might be specified as 10.03&amp;nbsp;mm with a manufacturing tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm). This means that the smallest acceptable hole diameter will be 10.02&amp;nbsp;mm while the largest acceptable shaft diameter will be 10.04&amp;nbsp;mm, leaving an "allowance" of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. The minimum [[Engineering tolerance|clearance]] between the hole and the shaft will then be 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. This will occur when both the shaft and the hole are at [[maximum material condition]].

[[File:Arri35 IIb.jpg|thumb|300px|An Arriflex 35 IIB, with three lenses and a 120 m (400 ft) magazine]]
The '''Arriflex 35''' (1937) was the first reflex 35mm production motion picture camera. It was built around the spinning reflex twin-bladed "butterfly" mirror shutter designed by [[Erich Kästner (camera designer)|Erich Kästner]], chief engineer at  [[Arnold &amp; Richter Cine Technik (ARRI)]], [[Arri|Arri Group]], set at 45 degrees horizontally to the lens axis. Modern standard models have a maximum shutter exposure opening of 165 degrees, (not 180 degrees as claimed in Arri manuals), the 35 IIC-BV model having a variable shutter. The mirror shutter allows the camera operator to see a viewfinder image equal to the recorded picture, without parallax, although there is noticeable image flicker in the viewfinder when the camera is running, caused by the two open exposure segments of the mirror shutter. It is still used extensively in motion pictures for sequences without synchronous sound - [[MOS (filmmaking)|"motor only sync"]] - and unique camera movement, e.g. on [[Steadicam]]. It was widely used with 200&amp;nbsp;ft loads (the smaller 200 ft magazine was in production at that time) as a 'battlefield camera' for the German [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]] for collecting battlefront intelligence, (e.g. for analyzing weapons effectiveness), for training films and for use in propaganda cinema films.

The camera utilizes a three lens turret with three aluminum Arri lens mounts (later 35 IIC/B with one stainless steel bayonet mount and two aluminum Arri mounts), and is capable of frame rates up to 80 frames per second with an accessory speed unit. Film magazines are for 200 ft or 400 ft loads. The DC motor is mounted downwards as a handgrip. Later flat base DC motor mount units were developed e.g. by the Cine 60 company, allowing the camera to have a lower profile, where the motor is mounted on the side of the camera body vertically upwards, allowing the camera to be mounted on standard tripod heads without a special head accommodating the handgrip motor, and providing a more compact profile for 'blimping'.

New models appeared over the years: the 35 II in 1946, the IIA in 1953, the IIB in 1960 and finally, the IIC in 1964. In 1982, the II-series was superseded by the Arriflex 35-3C model, having a IIC film transport movement, a swiveling viewfinder, a quartz-driven handgrip motor, a then-new Arri PL (positive locking) lens mount and a variable shutter. The 35-3C model was put into production to use up 150 sets of 35 IIC camera movement units still inventoried at the factory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">A '''Bendix drive''' is a type of engagement mechanism used in [[starter motor]]s of [[internal combustion engine]]s.  The device allows the [[pinion|pinion gear]] of the starter motor to engage or disengage the [[flywheel]] of the engine automatically when the starter is powered or when the engine fires, respectively.  It is named after its inventor, [[Vincent Hugo Bendix]].

==Operation==

The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to wind the spring forcing the length of the spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, [[backdrive]] from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.

The main drawback to the Bendix drive is that it relies on a certain amount of "clash" between the teeth of the pinion and the ring gears before they slip into place and mate completely; the teeth of the pinion are already spinning when they come into contact with the static ring gear, and unless they happen to align perfectly at the moment they engage, the pinion teeth will strike the teeth of the ring gear side-to-side rather than face-to-face, and continue to rotate until both align.  This increases wear on both sets of teeth.  For this reason the Bendix drive has been largely superseded in starter motor design by the pre-engagement system using a solenoid.

'''Boiler feedwater''' is an essential part of [[boiler]] operations. The feed water is put into the [[steam drum]] from a feed pump. In the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat. After the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser. From the condenser it is then pumped to the deaerated feed tank. From this tank it then goes back to the steam drum to complete its cycle. The feed water is never open to the atmosphere. This cycle is known as a [[closed system]] or [[Rankine cycle]].

==History of feedwater treatment==
During the early development of boilers, water treatment was not so much of an issue, as temperatures and pressures were so low that high amounts of scale and rust would not form to such a high amount, especially if the boiler was cleaned and/or “[[boiler blowdown|blown down]]”. It was general practice though, to install zinc plates and/or [[alkaline]] chemicals to reduce corrosion within the boiler. Many tests had been performed to try to determine the cause and possible protection from corrosion in boilers using distilled water, various chemicals, and sacrificial metals.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon,Frank. Hinds, A.W.Marine And Naval Boilers. (1912). The Lord Baltimore Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver nitrate]] can be added to feedwater samples in order to detect contamination by [[seawater]]. Use of [[Lime (material)|lime]] for alkalinity control had been mentioned as early as 1900, and was used by the French and British Navies up until about 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, Alan. Modern Marine Engineers Manual. (1965). Cornell Maritime Press, inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern boilers though, treatment of boiler feedwater is extremely critical, as many problems can result from the use of untreated water in extreme pressure and temperature environments; this includes lower efficiency in terms of heat transfer, overheating, damage, and high costs of cleaning.

==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== 
Water has higher [[heat capacity]] than most other substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers are part of a closed system as compared to open systems in a [[gas turbine]]. The [[closed system]] that is used is the [[Rankine cycle]]. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. [[Boiler water]] must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, [[corrosion]], foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and [[phosphates]]. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns in order to keep the chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.

==Boiler feedwater treatment== 
Boiler water treatment is used to control alkalinity, prevent scaling, correct pH, and to control conductivity. The boiler water needs to be alkaline and not acidic, so that it does not ruin the tubes. There can be too much conductivity in the feed water when there are too many dissolved solids. These correct treatments can be controlled by efficient operator and use of treatment chemicals. The main objectives to treat and condition boiler water is to exchange heat without scaling, protect against scaling, and produce high quality steam.  The treatment of boiler water can be put into two parts. These are internal treatment and external treatment. (Sendelbach, p.&amp;nbsp;131)&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Sendelbach, M. (1988). Boiler-water treatment: Why, what and how. Chemical Engineering, 95(11), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal treatment is for boiler feed water and external treatment is for make-up feed water and the condensate part of the system. Internal treatment protects against feed water hardness by preventing precipitating of scale on the boiler tubes. This treatment also protects against concentrations of dissolved and suspended solids in the feed water without priming or foaming. These treatment chemicals also help with the alkalinity of the feed water making it more of a base to help protect against boiler corrosion. The correct alkalinity is protected by adding phosphates. These phosphates precipitate the solids to the bottom of the boiler drum. At the bottom of the boiler drum there is a bottom blow to remove these solids. These chemicals also include anti-scaling agents, oxygen scavengers, and anti-foaming agents. Sludge can also be treated by two approaches. These are by coagulation and dispersion. When there is a high amount of sludge content it is better to coagulate the sludge to form large particles in order to just use the bottom blow to remove them from the feed water. When there is a low amount of sludge content it is better to use dispersants because it disperses the sludge throughout the feed water so sludge does not form.

==Deaeration of feed water== 
Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are removed from the feed water by deaeration. [[Deaerator|Deaeration]] can be accomplished by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready to be used in the boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p.&amp;nbsp;129)&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p.&amp;nbsp;130)

The feedwater must be specially treated to avoid problems in the boiler and downstream systems.  Untreated boiler feed water can cause corrosion and fouling.

===Boiler corrosion===
Corrosive compounds, especially [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] must be removed, usually by use of a [[deaerator]]. Residual amounts can be removed chemically, by use of [[oxygen scavenger]]s. Additionally, feed water is typically alkalized to a [[pH]] of 9.0 or higher, to reduce oxidation and to support the formation of a stable layer of [[magnetite]] on the water-side surface of the boiler, protecting the material underneath from further corrosion. This is usually done by dosing alkaline agents into the feed water, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] ([[caustic soda]]) or [[ammonia]]. Corrosion in boilers is due to the presence of dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, or dissolved salts.

===Fouling===
Deposits reduce the heat transfer in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is [[evaporate]]d must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive  [[Boiler blowdown|"blow-down"]] (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form [[boiler scale|scale]]. Therefore, the [[make-up water]] added to replace any losses of feedwater must be [[demineralized water|demineralized]]/[[deionized water]], unless a purge valve is used to remove dissolved minerals.

===Caustic Stress Corrosion Cracking===

===Priming and foaming===
{{main|Priming (steam engine)}}

==Locomotive boilers==
[[Steam locomotives]] usually do not have condensers so the feedwater is not recycled and water consumption is high.  The use of deionized water would be prohibitively expensive so other types of water treatment are used.  Chemicals employed typically include [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium bisulfite]], [[tannin]], [[phosphate]] and an [[anti-foaming agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.portatreatment.com/pdf/york-paper.pdf |title=Porta Treatment Internal Boiler Water Treatment for the 21st Century |first=M. |last=Bane |date=11 December 2006 |booktitle=Developments in Modern Steam Traction for Railways |location=York, UK |accessdate=31 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031143744/http://portatreatment.com/pdf/york-paper.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2381">A '''bond tester''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to measure the [[mechanical strength]] of bonds, evaluate bond strength distributions or determine compliance with specified bond strength requirements of the applicable acquisition document.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ipc.org/TM/2.4.42.3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a load is applied to a bond by a hook or shear tool, whereafter a force measurement is taken and the failure mode of the tested sample is recorded. More often than not bond tests are destructive and samples are scrapped after testing. In aerospace and medical applications, non destructive testing is common, whereby the bond is loaded up to a point to reveal nonacceptable bonds while avoiding damage to acceptable bonds.

Electrical and thermal bonds are such an integral part of electronic and [[semiconductor]] construction that they may often be taken for granted. Modern electronic assembly methods employ a myriad of bonding processes, each one a vital step in the manufacture of the final product. A typical consumer product such as a laptop computer may contain hundreds of thousands of bonds yet if one fails it will probably result in a system breakdown. 

For an automatic test PC controlled moving table allows any number of bonds to be tested automatically from a stored program. 
Results can be analysed and output immediately or exported in a number of data base formats for subsequent analysis as desired.
Powerful extended capabilities enable measurements such as force/time or force/distance curves to be made and deliver more data about the quality of the bond tested.

The most common test types performed on a bond tester are the wire pull test, which generally puts an upward force on a [[gold]]/[[aluminum]]/[[silver]]/[[copper]] wire, and the die shear test, which generally comprises loading a die from the side. When equipped with [[tweezers]], bond testers may also perform cold bump pull tests. During such a test, a solder ball down to 50&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter is reform it to the shape something like a mushroom and then pulled off the surface. Modern bond testers can perform a wide variety of tests with high precision, because automation eliminates human influence on the measurement.

==Standards==
[[MIL-STD-883]], [[JEDEC]] and other standards are commonly followed in the industry.

{{Context|date=October 2009}}&lt;!--*** Article has no intro or context. "variant" OF WHAT?! ***--&gt;
[[Image:PAL and D2-MAC Transmission.png|thumb|300px|The simultaneous [[PAL]] transmission of all TV-picture elements and the multiplexed transmission of the TV picture elements with D2-MAC.]]
[[Image:Multiplexed Analogue Components transmission (simulation).jpg|thumb|300px|Simulated MAC signal. From left to right: digital data, chrominance and luminance]]

'''C-MAC''' is the variant approved by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) for satellite transmissions. The digital information is modulated using 2-4PSK ([[phase-shift keying]]), a variation of quadrature PSK where only two of the phaser angles (±90°) are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/tv/tv.html#MAC |title=MAC (Multiplexed analogue components) in "Analog TV Broadcast Systems" |first=Paul |last=Schlyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[channel capacity|data capacity]] for C-MAC is 3Mbit/s.
* C-MAC data has to be sent to the transmitter separately from the vision.
* The transmitter switches between FM (vision) and PSK (sound/data) modulation during each television line period.

== C-MAC variants : E-MAC ==
E-MAC (Extended MAC) is 16:9 version of C-MAC. Originally E-MAC was designed for 15:9 pictures, it later adopted the 16:9 aspect ratio.
* In E-MAC all the 4:3 information is transmitted exactly as in C-MAC so that C-MAC receivers are still compatible.
* E-MAC hides extra luminance and chrominance information in the field blanking interval and parts of the line blanking interval.
* E-MAC has a lower data capacity because luminance is hidden where data would usually be located.
* A 'steering' signal is transmitted to indicate to the 16:9 receiver whereabouts the 4:3 picture information.
* E-MAC receivers stitch the 4:3 and helper wide-screen data into a seamless 16:9 picture.

== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and [[chrominance]] data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).

Audio and Scrambling (selective access)
* Audio, in a format similar to [[NICAM]] was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM sub-carrier.
* The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, Euro-Crypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

'''Corporate travel management''' ('''CTM''') is the function of managing a company’s strategic approach to travel (travel policy), the negotiations with all [[Distributor (business)|vendors]], day-to-day operation of the corporate travel program, traveler [[safety]] and security, credit-card management and travel and expenses ('T&amp;E') data management.

CTM should not be confused with the work of a traditional Travel Agency. While agencies provide the day-to-day travel services to corporate clients, they are the implementing arm of what the corporation has negotiated and put forth in policy. In other words, CTM decides on the class of service which employees are allowed to fly, negotiates corporate fares/rates with airlines and hotels and determines how corporate credit cards are to be used. The agency on the other hand makes the actual reservation within the parameters given by the corporation.

For many companies T&amp;E costs represent the second highest controllable annual expense, exceeded only by salary and benefits, and is commonly higher than IT or real estate costs. T&amp;E costs are not only limited to travel ([[airline]], [[Rail transport|rail]], [[hotel]], [[car rental]], ferry/boat, etc.) but include all costs incurred during travel such as staff and client meals, taxi fares, gratuities, client gifts, supplies (office supplies and services), etc. Furthermore, this area often includes meeting management, traveler safety and security as well as [[credit card]] and overall travel data management.

The management of these costs are usually handled by the Corporate Travel Manager, a function which may be part of the [[Finance]], [[Human resources|HR]], [[Procurement]] or Administrative Services Department.

==Global Consolidations==
Many companies, especially large multinationals (MNC), opt for global consolidation of their travel procurement. In other words, they may choose to put their entire purchasing of travel arrangements in the hands of one Travel Management Company (TMC). This is almost always done with a global Request for Proposal (RFP), through which the company will invite major TMCs to participate in the RFP. The process and the selection of the TMC could take several months. Once the company has chosen its TMC, the handling of their travel arrangements will be handled by the selected TMC throughout the world.  There could, of course, be exceptions in certain countries. 

The advantages of a global consolidation lie in the game of numbers: the company will be able to bring to the table the advantage of global numbers when negotiating with suppliers.  These negotiations could include airlines, hotel chains, individual hotels (for specific reasons), car-rental companies etc. The main goal of going the route of global consolidation is to create savings in the company's T&amp;E budget.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Travel Management Companies==
{{main|Travel management company}}
The implementation of corporate travel management is often delegated to Travel Management Companies (TMC). A TMC will manage an organization's corporate or business travel program. They will often provide an online booking tool, mobile application, program management and consulting teams, executive travel services, meetings and events support, reporting functionality, and potentially others. These companies use [[Global Distribution System]]s (GDS) to book flights for their clients. This allows the travel consultant to compare different itineraries and costs by displaying availability in real-time, allowing users to access fares for air tickets, [[hotel rooms]] and [[rental cars]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0Fimlcz5E What is a TMC?]. Youtube.com. Retrieved on 2017-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel Management Lite==
Travel Management Lite, is a lightweight version of a Corporate Travel Management [[solution]], generally used by SMEs and growth companies who don't require extensive or bespoke solutions offered by TMCs. The main advantage to a Lite solution is to enhance real-time transparency in travel spending across the company, and provides access to mobile and web apps needed to book and manage a company's travel. This allows business travellers, assistants, and travel managers to book more efficiently, and have faster access to support, than were they to use different leisure booking sites or offline travel agents.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5051">'''Cult of Carts''' is a term coined by the architectural historian [[Arthur Kingsley Porter|A. K. Porter]] to describe various occasions in western Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, when ordinary [[laity|lay-people]] harnessed themselves to carts in the place of oxen in order to transport building materials to cathedral building sites.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Kingsley Porter: ''Medieval Architecture, Vol.2'', New York, 1909, pp. 150–60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precursors to the 'Cults of Carts' ==
Throughout European history there have been several documentary accounts of occasions when the public spontaneously came together to labour on some important building project (the earliest being [[Suetonius]]' account of the rebuilding of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in Rome after a fire in AD 70). In medieval Europe, perhaps the most widely known and influential of these events occurred during the building of the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey]] at [[Montecassino]] (Italy) in 1066. The Abbey's chronicler, [[Peter the Deacon]], described how a crowd of pious lay people spontaneously seized some heavy marble columns which had been delivered from [[Rome]] and carried them up the long steep hill to the building site, singing and praying as they went. 

A similar story was also told of the building of another Benedictine monastery at St Trond (now [[Sint-Truiden]] in Belgium), c.1155, which was included in an early 12th-century account of the Abbey's history by its Abbot, Adelhard II.

== Major 'Cult of Carts' episodes in medieval France ==
The first such account from the Gothic period was written by [[Abbot Suger|Abbot Suger of St Denis]], who had visited Montecassino in 1123 and was familiar with the story of its construction. In his account of the building of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]]&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky (ed.) ''Abbot Suger on the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis and Its Treasures''. Princeton University Press, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; (written c.1144) Suger described how, after finding some Roman marble columns in a disused quarry near [[Pontoise]], he began to despair of ever retrieving them from the forest - until a crowd of local people of all social ranks came together of their own volition, tied ropes to the columns and dragged them to the road, accompanied by many spontaneous displays of pious devotion.

In 1145, a few years after the incident described by Suger, one of the most famous 'Cult of Cart' miracles occurred at [[Chartres]], where [[Fulbert of Chartres|Bishop Fulbert]]'s [[Chartres Cathedral|cathedral]] was nearing completion. The event was described in a letter claiming to be an eye-witness account, written by Abbot Haymo of [[Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives]] to the monks of [[Tutbury]] Abbey in England.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Grace Frisch ''Gothic art 1140-c. 1450: sources and documents'', University of Toronto Press, 1984. (includes translations of Haymo's letter and several other contemporary accounts)&lt;/ref&gt; Haymo described how the citizens of Chartres, of all social classes, harnessed themselves to carts like oxen and dragged materials to the building site as an act of mass piety which involved the singing of hymns and the acceptance of chastisement from members of the clergy. 

In the following years a number of similar events supposedly occurred in other towns around France the last recorded at [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] around 1171. However most of these events are known only from a single source, usually written by a member of the clergy from the relevant church. Several of these contemporary accounts are very similar in style and in details, which casts some doubt on their accuracy and also on the genuine spontaneity of these events, which may instead have been orchestrated by the local clergy.

== Aftermath of the 'Cults of Carts' ==
An attempt was made to revive the practice in early 14th century Rome when material for the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] was supposedly dragged in carts by local women, who would not allow the stones to be 'defiled by animals'. Generally however stories of the practice died out as opportunities for the expression of lay piety became more normalised through confraternities and other social structures.

During the Gothic-revivals of the 19th and early 20th centuries, various writers used the supposedly spontaneous outbreaks of popular piety exemplified by the 'Cults of Carts' to evoke an over-romanticised view of medieval Europe as a religious golden-age.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Adams, ''Mont-St-Michel and Chartres'', 1904&lt;/ref&gt; More modern scholarship has tended to view the stories more sceptically. As with all such [[Founding myth|foundation myths]], evidence from documentary accounts must be tempered by an understanding of the role of such stories in promoting individual churches (and the Benedictine order in general) and also by the tendency of medieval chroniclers to adapt and copy stories from earlier texts (see [[Literary topos|topos]]).

'''CyberPowerPC''', also known as '''CyberPower''', is an American computer manufacturer and retailer. It specializes in low-cost and high-performance hardware, particularly for [[computer gaming]] as well as custom PC builds.

==Business==

CyberPowerPC was founded and incorporated on February 17, 1998 in the City of Industry, California.

In 2003, the company was listed as the fastest growing privately owned business in the Los Angeles area by the [[Los Angeles Business Journal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} &lt;!-- Claim made on manufacturer website; can't find old 2003 LABJ issues to verify --&gt;

From 2011-2016, CyberPowerPC has been consistently ranked within the top 150 largest privately owned companies headquartered in Los Angeles county by the Los Angeles Business Journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbjonline.com/a2labj/lists/2011-Largest-Private-Companies-1-150.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbjonline.com/a2labj/lists/2012-Largest-Private-Companies-1-150.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynamicsystemsinc.com/Downloads/2015_Largest_Private_Companies_LABJ_10.26.15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

CyberPowerPC produces and sells custom-built PCs primarily for use in computer gaming. Their products feature third-party components prepared into complete ready-to-use packages.

===Desktops===

With the advent of VR gaming in 2014, CyberPowerPC, with support from [[Oculus VR]], released the most inexpensive computer capable of running the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality system, according to Oculus CEO [[Brendan Iribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/348531/oculus-rift-will-soon-run-on-a-499-cyberpower-pc|title=Oculus Rift Will Soon Run on a $499 Cyberpower PC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, CyberPowerPC became notable for developing a PC build for the express purpose of streaming video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3019655/ces/cyberpower-pro-streamer-packs-two-computers-in-one.html|title=CyberPower Pro Streamer packs two computers in one|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All desktops released by the company are built to user specifications with several pre-selected builds available. In general, these computers are not given a model name (contrary to laptops) due to the variable nature of each design.

===Laptops===

CyberPowerPC laptops fall into several gaming laptop model sets, called "series". As of 2016, all CyberPowerPC laptops use exclusively [[Intel Core i7]] CPUs and [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce]] GPUs.

====Models====
* Tracer Series (Low Tier)—features previous-generation graphics cards as well as [[Overclocking#CPU Locking|locked]] CPUs.
* Vector Series (Mid Tier)—features mostly current-generation discrete graphics cards and unlocked CPUs.
* Fangbook Series (High Tier)—features high-end mobile graphics cards and unlocked high performance CPUs.

===Gaming Consoles===
In 2014, CyberPowerPC released a [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machine]] designed to compete with the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5280256/cyberpowerpc-steam-machine-will-compete-with-consoles-at-499|title=CyberPowerPC Steam Machine will compete with consoles at $499|first=Sean|last=Hollister|date=6 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational technology in sub-Saharan Africa''' refers to the promotion, development and use of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT), [[m-learning]], media, and other technological tools to improve aspects of education in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=56–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: Radio and television ==
The first initiatives to introduce technologies into education were carried out by States directly, as they were at the time embarking on wide-ranging education reforms. During that period – from [[decolonization]] through to the 1980s – the dominant paradigm in education, common to African States and international organizations, was that of the interventionist State. Against that background, major large- scale programmes were developed, which were to some extent successful. In this way, the Bouaké schools radio in Côte d'Ivoire allowed more than 2,000 teachers per year to be trained in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Radio was one of the first technologies to be put to work in the service of education in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1986, in Guinea, an experimental schools radio project was started at the national educational research and documentation institute (l’Institut national de documentation, de recherche et d’action pédagogique, the present-day Indrap), with the assistance of the cultural and technical cooperation agency that is now the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF). The radio broadcasts were therefore mainly focused on primary teachers’ needs so as to improve their teaching techniques, and on subjects that were considered as priorities for the pupils: French, arithmetic and science. In the early 1990s, radio was given a broader role in the promotion of basic education, with the support of [[UNICEF]], especially with respect to girls’ access to education. While the results in terms of scholastic performance are still not properly understood, these programmes helped to train a large number of teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, the concept of educational television took hold in Africa. One of the most iconic examples of the development of these programmes can be found in Côte d'Ivoire. After initial trials in Senegal and Niger (where educational television existed before national television) in 1965 and 1966, Côte d'Ivoire was chosen in 1971 as the testing ground, then for the large-scale roll-out, of a massive project for schooling via television. The [[Programme for Education by Television]] (PETV) was made the responsibility of [[UNESCO]], assisted by cooperation from Belgium, France and the [[Ford Foundation]]. The PETV gave an illustration of how, from the 1970s, innovative programmes could be launched with the aid of the “new” ICT.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the first five years, the rate of school enrolment in that country went from 20% to over 60%. While 300,000 pupils were receiving the programmes in 1975-1976, this had increased to 700,000 by 1980 (out of a total of one million pupils). Some evaluation reports indicate that the proportion of pupils who had had the benefit of television courses entering the sixth year of study was significantly higher than for the others, that the percentage having to retake a year had fallen from 30% to 10% during the lifetime of the project, and that pupils had acquired a better mastery of spoken French. The programme ran for 14 years and finally ended in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Introduction of computer technology ==
Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like [[Computer Aid International]], Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and [[World Computer Exchange]]. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the African Bank or the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Africa Information Society Initiative (AISI) ===
A large part of the backbone of ICT4D was the action framework called the Africa Information Society Initiative (AISI). Seeking to install the ICT infrastructure in Africa, its goals were to were connect every single African village with the global information network by 2010 and spur growth of smaller ICT initiatives in different sectors.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojo|first=Tokunbo|date=March 20, 2016|title=Global agenda and ICT4D in Africa: Constraints of localizing 'universal norm|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0308596116300404/1-s2.0-S0308596116300404-main.pdf?_tid=03acf1ab-87ec-4d71-b15d-549288b22b36&amp;acdnat=1524815265_079cc2142e7b1c27673ef63ba5a6c7f0|journal=Telecommunications Policy|volume=40|pages=|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade after its enactment, there are still hundreds of villages without electricity and connectivity between disparate ICTs is lacking.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

=== One Laptop per Child (OLPC) ===
{{Main|One Laptop per Child}}

In the 2000s, various projects were begun, mainly aimed at giving each school child access to IT tools, individually or shared among a small group. Personalizing the practice of computer technology multiplies the potential uses of ICT in education, not just by familiarization with the technology tools themselves (learning technology), but also by the acquisition of cognitive skills (learning through technology). The American One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$200 and US$500, OLPC offered its ultraportable XO-1 computer at the price of US$100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was “bought” by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the large-scale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered. Sugar is the free teaching platform installed on the XO computers from the OLPC Foundation. Sugar is both a graphic interface at the same time as containing applications, and was designed specifically for children, to support them in their learning with a variety of available content: reading courses, drawing tools, e-books, interactive applications and so on.

=== Criticisms of One Laptop per Child in Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Unlike more large scale efforts to integrate and enhance education, the [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) program faces criticism on the premise that targeting the poorest areas in Africa that may not have the financial viability to afford laptop computers and maintenance costs for the children. Despite its objectives of distributing 100 to 150 million laptops by the year 2008 to the developing countries with the most need, it is measured that as of August 2010, more than 80 percent of the 1.5 million laptops have been sent to high or upper middle income countries according to the World Bank’s classifications.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warschauer|first1=Mark, and Morgan Ames|date=2010|title=CAN ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD SAVE THE WORLD'S POOR?|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume=64|issue=1|pages=33–51|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternatives to One Laptop Per Child ===
In comparing the distribution of money of the [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) program with other channels of education betterment, there are many low-cost programs that have more definitive impact than OPLC's distribution laptops to "low-income" countries. Some other proposed cost-benefit ratios for other aid programs seeking to improve educational and socioeconomic conditions include:&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

* Spending $8 per individual per year over a span of 5 years could potentially save 11 million lives.
* Spending $0.50 per student (this was implemented in Kenya), which was successful in increasing school participation by 14 percent.
* Building schools.
* Hiring additional instructors.
* Focusing on minimizing and mitigating costs of attention school and getting textbooks.

Many of these low-cost programs have sought to specifically increase the access to education fo women in hopes of increase literacy, equality in pay, economic viability, better productivity, more democratic and responsive political institutions, and better overall public health.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

=== Classmate PC ===
{{Main|Classmate PC}}

Following on from OLPC, the Intel group launched Classmate PC, a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the Seychelles and Kenya, particularly in rural areas.

=== Computer for School in Kenya (CFSK) ===
The CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya) project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.

== Open Educational Resources (OER) ==
According to UNESCO in 2002, [[open educational resources]] (OERs) are open provisions of educational resources that are enabled by ICTs for use and adaptation by users for non-commercial users.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorpe|first=Mary|date=March 2012|title=Educational Technology: Does Pedagogy Still Matter?|jstor=44430021|journal=Educational Technology|volume=52|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayshree|first=Thakrar|date=September 2009|title=Harnessing Open Educational Resources to the Challenges of Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/705/1342|journal=International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning|volume=10|pages=|via=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of teacher education in Sub-Saharan Africa, the most notable OER project is TESSA, Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa, which constitutes 13 African institutions and five international organizations working to equip teachers with practical activities for classrooms and language specific modules.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

There are three different modes of use for OERs across the 200,000 teachers in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia: very structured modules, loosely structured modules, and guided modules.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Specifically in Nigeria and Sudan, large-scale distance education is primarily used for teacher education and thus highly structured guides with TESSA study units are given to trainee teachers, who are often in rural areas with limited Internet access.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Some criticisms of TESSA OERs cited by teachers include lack of relevance of curriculum materials and existing satisfaction with current resources.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Sustainable ICT for development in Sub-Saharan Africa ==
One of the most prominent paradigms for technological change and innovation in Sub-Saharan African has been the [[information and communication technologies for development]] (ICT4D) initiative. Positioned as an avenue to move millions of individuals out of poverty in developing regions, few reports on experiments of such practices have demonstrated success of ICT4D on the standard of living in Africa.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bissyande|first=Tegawende|date=2014|title=Sustainable ICT4D in Africa: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-08368-1_11.pdf|journal=Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering|volume=135|pages=95–103|via=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08368-1_11|isbn=9783319083674 9783319083681|series=Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, ICT4D is still rendered as one of the most prominent technological interventions in the region. Every year, proposals for more sustainable ICT4D initiatives are suggested by researchers from around the world at the AFRICOMM Conference.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Motivations for Sustainable ICT ===

==== Landscape ====

With the advent of new technologies and communication as a means for organization and development between public and private sectors in developing countries, in addition to the growing penetration of mobile devices due to their increasing affordability, the poor in Sub-Saharan African have largely been seen as both producers and consumers of information and communication technologies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to a 2013 study conducted by the [[GSM Association]], the number of mobile subscribers in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased 18 percent per year between the years 2007 and 2012.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafriquedesidees.org/ict-and-sustainable-development-in-africa/|title=ICT and sustainable development in Africa|last=Essamba|first=Rafaela|date=February 12, 2017|website=L'Afrique Des Idees|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the number of mobile subscriptions in Sub-Saharan African reached almost 650 million, greater than both that in the US and EU.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayisire|first=David|date=September 29, 2015|title=ICT Adoption and Usage in Africa: Towards an Efficiency Assessment|journal=Information Technology for Development|volume=22|issue=4|pages=630–653|doi=10.1080/02681102.2015.1081862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android penetration is the highest due to easy integration of social innovation tools in areas of e-health, e-learning, waste management, mobile banking, etc., and phones are the preferred way for many to access the internet.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Initially, ICT in Sub-Saharan Africa was primarily restricted to private use, but today it has been introduced in formal and institutional spheres as a tool for development, social growth, economic expansion and population growth. A study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGC) released in November 2015 highlights that the internet only contributes 2.9 percent to Kenya's GDP and 1.2 percent to South Africa's GDP.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Mobile ICT ====

There is a huge push for mobile ICT in Sub-Saharan Africa for three key reasons:&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meso|first=Peter|date=March 9, 2005|title=Towards a model of consumer use of mobile information and communication technology in LDCs: the case of sub‐Saharan Africa|journal=Information Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=2|pages=119–146|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Nations in this region are expanding their telecommunications sectors.
# Consumers are unsatisfied with the inadequate fixed-line ICT.
# Wireless technology has rapidly diffused, and this is the base for mediating business transactions. This lends to the growth of a sustainable m-commerce sector.

==== Motivations for Growth ====

Beyond trying to increase GDP growth in the short-term, ICT is covered in four of the 17 different [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which were selected by the UN in September 2015.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Seen and described as a catalyst for education, infrastructure development, sustainable industrialization and gender equality, the motivations for ICT's spread are outlined below:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

# '''Catalyst for development -''' Initially more pertinent to leisure use cases, ICT intersects with a wide array of basic need issues in areas of education, transportation, health, energy use, nutrition, water accessibility, etc. There have been many successful catalyst companies as a result, and some notable ones include:
## '''Obami''' - a social and educational learning platform that started in South Africa and has been adopted by more than 30,000 educators in schools across Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vc4a.com/ventures/obami/|title=OBAMI|last=|first=|date=|website=VC4A|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
## '''Gifted Mom -''' a mobile health platform that started in Cameroon and betters the health conditions of women who are pregnant and newborn children in rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://giftedmom.co/|title=Home|last=|first=|date=2017|website=giftedMom|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
## '''[[M-Pesa]] -''' a mobile payment system that originally launched in Kenya and now has more than 30 million users who utilize it for loans, health provisions, purchases and international transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile money success story turns 10|last=Monks|first=Kieron|date=February 24, 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
### '''Significance''': This example is particularly important to educational technology, because it was largely dependent on policy decisions from the Kenyan government to encourage competition in the sector of telecommunications and ICT-driven innovation, which broke the monopoly of state-led telecommunications and fostered competition among firms.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; The case of M-Pesa also highlights the importance of communal trust that enables the successful integration of ICTs into various socio-economic activities on an institutional level. Without the incorporation and on-boarding of ICT objectives on the national development agenda, coupled with agreement of local stakeholders, M-Pesa would not have been as successful as it has been.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Applied to the case of educational technology, unilaterally funded ICTs may be largely unsuccessful to enact institutional change without the willingness of the local and national governments.
## '''[[Jumia]] -''' an online shopping marketplace that began in Nigeria and has spread to 23 different African countries.
## '''W Afate -''' a $100 3-D printer that is constructed from discarded [[electronic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3019880/this-african-inventor-created-a-100-3-d-printer-from-e-waste|title=This African Inventor Created A $100 3-D Printer From E-Waste|last=Ungerleider|first=Neal|date=October 11, 2013|website=Fast Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
## '''M-Louma -''' a web and mobile platform that connects farmers with food buyers using real-time market price estimates, localizations and information for improving the agriculture supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mlouma: to connect the agricultural products market players|journal = Emerald Emerging Markets Case Studies|volume = 6|issue = 3|pages = 1–18|last=Ndour|first=Mamour|date=October 2016|doi=10.1108/EEMCS-10-2016-0276}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Inclusive growth -''' Proponents of ICT suggest that its worthiness extends beyond a luxury for Africa and seeks to efficiently contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth for many different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# '''Opportunity for sustainability -''' Currently, little has been done in the management of electrical and electronic waste (EEW). Without necessary regulations for dealing with recycling waste, there is a large market for tools in sustainability.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# '''Improving education -''' In a study on ICT adoption and the digital divide, it was found that the usage of computers and Internet access is directly linked to education. If the growth of the Internet aligns with mobile emergence in early 2000s, then it is projected that ICT can add approximately $300 billion to Africa's GDP by the year 2025.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Dr. Hamadoun I. Toure, the secretary general of [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], explains the extent of educational tech possibilities in his remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"ICTs are truly transformational. With the power of technology, we can educate every African citizen, right across the continent. With the power of technology, we can open new opportunities and create new well-paid jobs for our people. With the power of technology we can deliver healthcare services to every African citizen, even in the remotest villages. And with the power of technology we can empower African women and leverage the fantastic energy and passion of young Africans. This is not just a pipe-dream: this is real." &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

#

==== Criticisms ====

# '''Vague agenda -''' From 2005, the UN ICT Task Force has attempted to implement a clear agenda about ICT priorities and implementation strategy, yet this has not been created. Only broad, global goals have been set, and the major players in these have largely been the government bodies administration and non-governmental organizations that have been funded by the respective UN agency.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# '''Knowledge gap''' - In order for ICT to truly provide inclusive growth, there needs to be educational structures and resources made available to understand how to use ICT. Currently, most of the learning is very informal (through friends or family) because administrations have typically refrained from investing in the digital sphere among other initiatives.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# '''Minimal return on experiences -''' Questions about the success of ICT initiatives remain as there is a lack of documentation on failed and successful experiences.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Avenues for ICT Research in Education in Sub-Saharan Africa ===
The success or failure of ICTs in Sub-Saharan Africa is highly dependent on and challenged by regional problems such as food and water shortage, pandemic diseases, wars, or heritage loss. Some areas that have been identified for more immediate ICT4D action include health management, food and water, peace, and heritage.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In terms of research initiatives that pertain to educational technology, one important use case is e-Learning, where the issue of penetration results from its targets. For example, in rural areas, e-Learning serves the purpose of advertisement and even propaganda, while in urban areas the purpose is more oriented to overcoming the shortage of teaching personnel.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

#

== Barriers to ICT Use by Teachers in SSA ==
There are many physical and cultural factors that inhibit the complete adoption and integration of ICT practices by teachers in Sub-Saharan including and not limited to: unreliable access to electricity, limited software and hardware provisions, language limitation, country size and terrain, and population dispersion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hennessy|first=Sara|date=2010|title=Teacher Factors Influencing Classroom Use of ICT in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/40256907/Teacher_factors_influencing_classroom_us20151122-25582-1gvusha.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1524873331&amp;Signature=4P8RbZQyRictUw3MnT6JZY4FvBY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTeacher_Factors_Influencing_Classroom_Us.pdf|journal=Itupale Online Journal of African Studies|volume=2|pages=39–54|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational limiting factors include teachers' literacy rates, access to professional development, and missing unified national policy on computer use in schools.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Distance learning in higher education ==
The main initiatives based on the use of ICT and the Internet in education originally focused on distance learning at university level. Thus, the [[African Virtual University]] (AVU), set up by the [[World Bank]] in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU currently has ten e-learning centres.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Agence universitaire de la Francophonie]] (AUF) has also, since 1999, set up around forty French-speaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and master's degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More recently, the [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] (Massive Open On- line Courses) phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe. The AUF is funding the development of the first MOOCs in higher education in Africa, in partnership with the French Ministry for Higher Education and with the support of UNESCO, and will use this form of remote learning to offer training and certification in ICTE skills for teachers. The African universities are taking a growing interest in this new method of learning, especially in view of the ever-increasing demand for higher education at a time when the continent is experiencing a deficit in qualified teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== M-learning ==
[[M-learning]] (or m-education), or the use of mobile technology in the service of education, is a recent practice, opening up fresh possibilities in the educational field. Given the shortage of books in many African schools, the digital tablet was soon seen as a solution to make up for the missing textbooks, and taken up both by governments and international organizations. In practice, this shortage is one that affects almost every African country. In Cameroon there is on average one textbook on reading per 11 pupils and one mathematics book per 13 children.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Information bulletin: School and teaching resources in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/ib9-regional-education-africa-2012-en-v5.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to the traditional media (books, CD and DVD, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook,&lt;ref&gt;AFD, Les TIC au service de l’Éducation. Étude de cas : WorldReader, collaborative seminar, 4–5 October 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.afd.fr/&lt;/nowiki&gt; webdav/shared/PORTAILS/SECTEURS/EDUCATION/pdf/20120905Etude%20de%20cas%20WorldReader.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with zero marginal cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The digital tablet today has potential uses that extend beyond the classroom. The American NGO WorldReader has set itself the goal of extending access to reading to the most underprivileged children by distributing readers designed by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. With the financial support of USAID, [[Amazon Kindle|Kindles]] have been made available to 600,000 children in nine States in sub-Saharan Africa. The NGO has stated that children using this system spend 50% more time on reading, and read up to 90 books per year. Moreover, the report published by USAID following the iRead impact study in Ghana of 337 pupils in six different schools in 2010-2011 shows a number of positive aspects of the use of readers. The pupils using Kindles proved to be more enthusiastic about reading, which allowed them to improve their technical skills and achieve better scores in the standardized tests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Old and outdated traditional computer hardware and the costs of maintenance have prompted those devising projects to turn to technologies that are cheaper to buy and easier to handle. Internet access is made easier by tablets and by the possibility of connecting via the mobile networks. Relatively cheap compared to the laptop computer and more flexible in its uses, tablets have the potential to provide an efficient response to part of the educational needs of sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Electronic markets''' (or electronic marketplaces) are [[information systems]] (IS) which are used by multiple separate organizational entities within one or among multiple tiers in economic [[value chain]]s. In analogy to the market concept which can be viewed from a macroeconomic (describing relationships among actors in an economic systems, e.g. a [[monopoly]]) as well as from a microeconomic (describing different allocation mechanisms, e.g. public auctions of telephone frequencies) perspective, electronic markets denote networked forms of business with many possible configurations: 

First, the topology of electronic markets may be centralized or decentralized in nature. Centralized electronic markets are hubs which often provide services to their participants. Decentralized settings involve sequential relationships within value chains which often are found when electronic messages are exchanged directly between businesses ([[electronic data interchange]], EDI). 

Second, the services provided by electronic markets may serve infrastructural or allocation purposes. Among the infrastructure services are routing, messaging, identification and partner directories whereas allocation services enable pricing process which in turn may be static or dynamic in nature. Typical implementations are catalogs, exchanges and auctions.

Third, the relationships of actors involved in electronic markets may be stable or atomistic in nature. The former usually refers to classical supply chains where business collaborate during a longer period of time. In the latter case, the transaction partners are only stable for a single transaction. This is usually to be found in auction and other exchange settings.  

This leads to two definitions: In a narrow sense Electronic Markets are mainly conceived as allocation platforms with dynamic price discovery mechanisms involving atomistic relationships. Popular examples originate from the financial and energy industries. In a broader sense, [[price discovery]] is not critical for electronic markets. This covers all forms of electronic collaboration between organizations and consumer as well as vice versa.

==Examples==
* company websites that serve communication and transaction purposes
* electronic purchasing systems on EDI-basis as well as based on catalogs
* systems that support the configuration of products, such as car configurators
* automated download of product information based on the scan of an article numbervn
* activation of an emergency chain based on the monitoring of heart frequency
* social networks that link consumers, such as recommendation communities

==Impacts on business efficiencies==
Electronic markets are attributed important impacts on business efficiencies. From an industry perspective, transaction cost economics were used to illustrate the relationship between electronic markets and electronic hierarchies. While the former are in line with the narrow electronic markets definition, the latter are also included in the broader definition. This may be explained since in reality electronic markets have emerged as platforms which combine several modes of governance or types of coordination mechanisms. These “all-in-one-markets” link the possibility of competitive bidding for price discovery with the advantages of a predictable relationship to encourage relationship specific investments (non-contractible issues) and functionalities for closer collaboration. This perspective shows that it is important to distinguish between the market platform itself which creates an infrastructure between multiple parties and the coordination mechanisms operated on this platform which might be market-like or hierarchical in nature.

'''''GSP Orizont''''' is a [[semi-submersible]], jackup independent leg cantilever [[offshore drilling|drilling rig]] operated by [[Grup Servicii Petroliere|GSP Drilling]], a [[Grup Servicii Petroliere]] subsidiary, and currently contracted by [[Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Company]] for drilling in the [[Iran]]ian section of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="rigzone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/rig_detail.asp?rig_id=627|title=Rig Data: GSP Orizont|year=2010|publisher=Rigzone|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drilling unit is registered in [[Malta]].

==Description==
''GSP Orizont'' drilling rig was designed by [[Sonnat Offshore]] and was built by [[Petrom]] at the [[Port of Galați|Galaţi Shipyard]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="orizont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gspoffshore.com/download/technical_documents/GSP%20Orizont.pdf|title=GSP Orizont|year=2010|publisher=Grup Servicii Petroliere|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was completely reconstructed and refurbished in 2010 at a cost of US$50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/upetrom/docs/curierul-martie-2010|title=GsP OrizOnt|date=21 April 2010|publisher=''Curierul''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was owned and operated by [[Petrom]] from 1982 to 2005 when the company sold its six offshore platforms (including [[GSP Atlas|Atlas]], [[GSP Jupiter|Jupiter]], Orizont, [[GSP Prometeu|Prometeu]] and [[GSP Saturn|Saturn]]) to [[Grup Servicii Petroliere]] for US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfin.ro/articol_9126/gsp_vrea_platforme_de_foraj_in_marea_nordului.html|title=GSP vrea platforme de foraj in Marea Nordului|date=25 May 2007|publisher=''Săptămâna Financiară''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GSP Orizont'' has a length of {{convert|52.4|m|ft}}, breadth of {{convert|40.8|m|ft}}, draft of {{convert|9.75|m|ft}}, height of {{convert|120|m|ft}} and depth of {{convert|6.4|m|ft}}. She has a maximum drilling depth of {{convert|9100|m|ft}} and she could operate at a water depth of {{convert|91|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name="orizont"/&gt; As a drilling rig, ''GSP Orizont'' is equipped with advanced drilling equipment and has to meet strict levels of certification under international law. ''GSP Orizont'' is able to maneuver with its own [[engine]]s (to counter [[Stokes drift|drift]] and ocean currents), but for long-distance relocation it must be moved by specialist [[tugboat]]s. The rig is capable of withstanding severe sea conditions including {{convert|12|m|ft}} waves and {{convert|155|km/h|mi/h}} winds.&lt;ref name="orizont"/&gt;

==Operations==
Currently the GSP Orizont is operated by the [[Iran]]ian company [[Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Company]] which uses the drilling rig at its [[Persian Gulf]] [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] prospects.&lt;ref name="rigzone"/&gt;

'''Gun f/x Tactical Development''' is an [[R&amp;D]] firm serving the [[paintball]] industry. It was founded as Gun f/x in 1994 as a spin-off of Pro-Team Products, Inc.

==Overview==
Gun f/x Tactical Development developed a paintball-based force-on-force simulated [[M16 rifle]] training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gun F/X History |work=Paintball Industry Magazine |date=November 1995|url=http://68caliber.com/gun-fx-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also involved in the design and development of [[Non-Lethal Weapons]], [[Improvised Explosive Device]] training devices, and recoil simulators for firearms marksmanship training. The company is currently based in Maine and is associated with Armson USA, Pro-Team Products, and Pro-Team Manufacturing, a Florida-based CNC facility that produces the majority of their products. The company has been issued several patents for pneumatic devices that create air pressure.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=7175499 |status=patent |title=Method for creating controlled pressure release in a pneumatic device |gdate =2007-02-13 |fdate=2004-03-06 |invent1 = Hatcher, Forest |assign1= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

=== CAR 68 ===
The paintball-based M16 simulator is designated to the CAR 68.  The CAR 68 has been used by military and law enforcement entities including the Israeli military,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isayeret.com/content/gear/training/paintball/article.shtml isayeret.com]&lt;/ref&gt; US Marine Corps, US Army, Secret Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunfx.com/pages/photos.html |title=Gun f/x has been there... |quote=...with the Secret Service... |publisher=Gun f/x Tactical Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian Special Forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunfx.com/pages/photos.html |title=Gun f/x has been there... |quote=...in Latvia... |publisher=Gun f/x Tactical Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Navy Seal teams. The CAR68 training weapon simulates the look, feel and performance characteristics of the standard duty weapon.  The primary limitation of the CAR 68 is its effective range, which is restricted to a maximum of approximately 200 feet.  The simulator is therefore mainly utilized in training scenarios in which range is not the factor such as Close Quarters Battle drills, urban combat (in which most fighting is done within structures), police encounter training (road stops, suspect take-down), and similar close-range situations.  The CAR 68 was also adapted for use as a recoil simulator for marksmanship training with laser based target system such as Beamhit and others. The company has also developed weapons simulators for the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], [[M203 grenade launcher]] and LAWS anti-tank weapon, though none of these devices is in wide distribution.

===Non-lethal===
Following the introduction of the CAR68, Gun f/x was approached by the Monterey Bay Corporation to provide concept and development for a less-lethal projectile launcher for use by military and law enforcement. Working with [[Airgun Designs]], this project produced the concept less-lethal weapon known as the UTPBS, which eventually became FN Herstal's [[FN 303]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This design could be attached to an M16 rifle and was conceived as a less-lethal weapon coupled with a lethal weapon system, providing a wide range of response capabilities that were immediately available. A stand-alone version was also developed. The UTPBS also featured a rotating barrel magazine, allowing for a wide range of different projectiles to be available and selectable without the need to change magazines. The company is currently working on further development of the burst disc concept, as well as a variety of less-lethal weapons and simulators.

In conjunction with the UTPBS development project, Gun f/x Tactical Development was also tasked with developing a projectile for the system.  The "bismuth round" (so-called due to the inclusion of bismuth for added mass that was required for extended range) and others including training and marking rounds were developed in conjunction with [http://www.pcpaintball.com/ Perfect Circle Paintballs], which currently manufactures [[pepperball]]s and other specialty projectiles.

In 2002, the company began work on "burst disc technologies" - various methods for producing the rapid release of a high volume of pressurized gas.  The technology allows for the simulation of weapon systems that produce high decibel reports and are capable of discharging projectiles (or other payloads such as smoke simulation powders, marking dyes, etc.) with a greater mass than a standard paintball.

===IED Simulators===
Gun f/x has also developed [[Improvised Explosive Device]] and Mine Training Simulators &lt;ref name="patent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US DoD Sole Source Contract, IED Simulator Kit, Solicitation Number: W912L7-08-T-0029|url=https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=52fd2a1a45f133f7b8c115e150844de0&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1 |publisher=Federal Business Opportunities |date=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IED and mine simulators have been used to train troops in the deployment, detection, and disarming of mines and IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The IED and mine simulators utilize a 12&amp;nbsp;gram CO2 cartridge and frangible burst cup. The devices are used with an inert talc powder that gives off a smoke effect.  Both designs give a concussive report in the 100 decibel range, which simulates the sound made by real IEDs and mines.  Both models can be configured for remote command detonation.

In [[ancient Greek sports]], ''halteres'' were used as lifting weights,&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gardiner, ''Athletics in the Ancient World'', Dover, 2002, on [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdRZkKCHoXoC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=halteres+galen&amp;lr=&amp;ei=dHv9S5_5OIyYzASliYG9Dw&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=halteres%20galen&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Pearl]], ''Getting Stronger: Weight Training for Sports'', Shelter, 2005, on [https://books.google.com/books?id=wQD2PgD85O8C&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=halteres+galen&amp;lr=&amp;ei=dHv9S5_5OIyYzASliYG9Dw&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=halteres%20galen&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and also as weights in their version of the [[long jump]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

''Halteres'' were held in both hands to allow an athlete to jump a greater distance; they may have been dropped after the first or second jump. According to [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence, the athlete would swing the weights backwards and forwards just before take-off, thrust them forwards during take-off, and swing them backwards just before releasing them and landing. ''Halteres'' were made of stone or metal, and weighed between {{convert|2|and|9|kg|0|abbr=on}}.

The '''history of rail transport''' began in 6th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of track material and motive power used.

== Ancient systems ==
Evidence indicates that there was 6 to 8.5&amp;nbsp;km long ''[[Diolkos]]'' paved trackway, which transported boats across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in [[Greece]] from around 600 BC.&lt;ref name="Verdelis, mikolaos (1950stas), 526"&gt;Verdelis, Nikolaos: "Le diolkos de L'Isthme", ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique'', vol. 81 (1957), pp. 526–529 (526)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook, R.

The Diolkos was in use for over 650 years, until at least the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Lewis, M. J. T.

=== Wooden rails introduced ===

[[File:Reiszug, Hohensalzburg.jpg|thumb|[[Reisszug]], as it appears today]]
In 1515, [[Matthäus Lang|Cardinal Matthäus Lang]] wrote a description of the [[Reisszug]], a [[funicular]] railway at the [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] in Austria. The line originally used wooden rails and a [[hemp]] haulage rope and was operated by human or animal power, through a [[treadwheel]].&lt;ref name=fm1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funimag.com/funimag10/RESZUG01.HTM |title=Der Reiszug: Part 1 – Presentation |publisher=Funimag |accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line still exists and is operational, although in updated form and is possibly the oldest operational railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Reinhard |last=Kriechbaum |url=http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120628225245/http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-06-28 |title=Die große Reise auf den Berg |work=der Tagespost |date=2004-05-15 |accessdate=2009-04-22 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mining cart.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minecart]] shown in ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). The guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks.]]
[[Wagonway]]s (or [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]]s), with wooden rails and horse-drawn traffic, are known to have been used in the 1550s to facilitate transportation of ore tubs to and from mines. They soon became popular in Europe and an example of their operation was illustrated by [[Georgius Agricola]] (image left) in his 1556 work ''[[De re metallica]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgius Agricola 1913 p. 156"&gt;Georgius Agricola (trans Hoover), ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1913), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; This line used "Hund" carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the truck fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the wagons ''Hunde'' ("dogs") from the noise they made on the tracks.&lt;ref name="Lee 1943 16"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Charles E. |title=The Evolution of Railways |edition=2 |year=1943 |publisher=Railway Gazette |location=London |page=16 |oclc=1591369}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many references to wagonways in central Europe in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Early wooden railways'', pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wagonway was introduced to England by [[German mines at Caldbeck|German miners]] at [[Caldbeck]], [[Cumbria]], possibly in the 1560s.&lt;ref name="Warren Allison 2010 pp. 52"&gt;Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy and Richard Smith, ''An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck'' in G. Boyes (ed.), ''Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008'' (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), pp. 52–69.&lt;/ref&gt; A wagonway was built at [[Prescot]], near [[Liverpool]], sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away.&lt;ref name="Jones 2012 5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Mark |title=Lancashire Railways – The History of Steam |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |date=2012 |page=5 |isbn=978 1 84674 298 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A funicular railway was made at [[Broseley]] in [[Shropshire]] some time before 1604. This carried coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the [[river Severn]] to be loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter King, ''The First Shropshire Railways'' in G. Boyes (ed.), ''Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008'' (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), pp. 70–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wollaton Wagonway]], completed in 1604 by [[Huntingdon Beaumont]], has sometimes erroneously been cited as the earliest British railway. It ran from [[Strelley, Nottingham|Strelley]] to [[Wollaton]] near [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/huntingdon-beaumonts-wollaton-to-strelley-waggonway/ |title=Huntingdon Beaumont's Wollaton to Strelley Waggonway |publisher=Nottingham Hidden History |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middleton Railway]] in [[Leeds]], which was built in 1758, later became the world's oldest operational railway (other than funiculars), albeit now in an upgraded form. In 1764, the first railway in America was built in [[Lewiston, New York]].&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite book | last=Porter |first=Peter |title=Landmarks of the Niagara Frontier |publisher=The Author |year=1914 | isbn=0-665-78347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metal rails introduced ===
The introduction of steam engines for powering blast air to [[blast furnace]]s led to a large increase in British iron production after the mid 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123–25}}

In the late 1760s, the [[Coalbrookdale]] Company began to fix plates of [[cast iron]] to the upper surface of wooden rails, which increased their durability and load-bearing ability. At first only [[balloon loop]]s could be used for turning wagons, but later, movable points were introduced that allowed [[passing loops]] to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vaughan, A. |year=1997 |title=Railwaymen, Politics and Money |location=London |publisher=John Murray |isbn=0-7195-5746-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Little Eaton Tramway Replica Wagon small.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of a "Little Eaton Tramway" wagon, the tracks are plateways.]]
A system was introduced{{when|date=September 2018}} in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal plates{{snd}} these became known as [[plateway]]s. [[John Curr]], a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail in 1787, though the exact date of this is disputed{{who|date=September 2018}}. The plate rail was taken up by [[Benjamin Outram]] for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his [[Butterley Company|Butterley ironworks]]. In 1803, [[William Jessop]] opened the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], a double track plateway, sometimes erroneously cited as world's first public railway, in south London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stephensonloco.fsbusiness.co.uk/surreyiron.htm| title=Surrey Iron Railway 200th – 26th July 2003| publisher=Stephenson Locomotive Society| work=Early Railways| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512032233/http://www.stephensonloco.fsbusiness.co.uk/surreyiron.htm| archivedate=12 May 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789, [[William Jessop]] had introduced a form of all-iron [[edge rail]] and flanged wheels for an extension to the [[Charnwood Forest Canal]] at [[Nanpantan]], [[Loughborough]], [[Leicestershire]]. In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Jessop became a partner in the Butterley Company in 1790. The first public edgeway (thus also first public railway) built was the [[Lake Lock Rail Road]] in 1796. Although the primary purpose of the line was to carry coal, it also carried passengers.

These two systems of constructing iron railways, the "L" plate-rail and the smooth edge-rail, continued to exist side by side into the early 19th century. The flanged wheel and edge-rail eventually proved its superiority and became the standard for railways.

Cast iron was not a satisfactory material for rails because it was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The [[wrought iron]] invented by [[John Birkinshaw]] in 1820 replaced cast iron. [[Wrought iron]] (usually simply referred to as "iron") was a [[Ductility|ductile]] material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But wrought iron was expensive to produce until [[Henry Cort]] patented the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] in 1784. In 1783, Cort also patented the [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling process]], which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first= David.

The next important development in iron production was [[hot blast]] developed by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of [[coke (fuel)]] or charcoal needed to produce [[pig iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or ''dross''. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they typically lasted less than 10 years in use, and sometimes as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments in the production of iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all-iron rails.

The introduction of the [[Bessemer process]], enabling steel to be made inexpensively, led to the era of great expansion of railways that began in the late 1860s. Steel rails lasted several times longer than iron.&lt;ref name="Wells1891"&gt;{{cite book

Steel completely replaced the use of iron in rails, becoming standard for all railways.

== Steam power introduced ==
{{See also|Steam locomotive}}

[[James Watt]], a Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer, greatly improved the [[steam engine]] of [[Thomas Newcomen]], hitherto used to pump water out of mines. Watt developed a [[reciprocating engine]] in 1769, capable of powering a wheel. Although the Watt engine powered cotton mills and a variety of machinery, it was a large [[stationary engine]]. It could not be otherwise: the state of boiler technology necessitated the use of low pressure steam acting upon a vacuum in the cylinder; this required a separate [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] and an [[air pump]]. Nevertheless, as the construction of boilers improved, Watt investigated the use of high-pressure steam acting directly upon a piston. This raised the possibility of a smaller engine, that might be used to power a vehicle and he patented a design for a [[steam locomotive]] in 1784. His employee [[William Murdoch]] produced a working model of a self-propelled steam carriage in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:TrevithicksEngine.jpg|thumb|A replica of Trevithick's engine at the [[National Waterfront Museum]], Swansea]]
The first full-scale working railway [[steam locomotive]] was built in the United Kingdom in 1804 by [[Richard Trevithick]], a British engineer born in [[Cornwall]]. This used high-pressure steam to drive the engine by one power stroke. The transmission system employed a large [[flywheel]] to even out the action of the piston rod. On 21 February 1804, the world's first steam-powered railway journey took place when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the [[Penydarren]] ironworks, near [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/trevithic_loco/|title=Richard Trevithick's steam locomotive|work=National Museum Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Blenkinsop's rack locomotive, 1812 (British Railway Locomotives 1803-1853).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Salamanca'' locomotive]]
The first commercially successful steam locomotive was [[Matthew Murray]]'s [[rack railway|rack]] locomotive ''[[The Salamanca|Salamanca]]'' built for the [[Middleton Railway]] in [[Leeds]] in 1812. This twin-cylinder locomotive was not heavy enough to break the [[wagonway|edge-rails]] track and solved the problem of [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] by a [[cog-wheel]] using teeth cast on the side of one of the rails. Thus it was also the first [[rack railway]].

This was followed in 1813 by the locomotive ''[[Puffing Billy (locomotive)|Puffing Billy]]'' built by [[Blackett of Wylam|Christopher Blackett]] and [[William Hedley]] for the [[Wylam]] Colliery Railway, the first successful locomotive running by [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] only. This was accomplished by the distribution of weight between a number of wheels. ''Puffing Billy'' is now on display in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, making it the oldest locomotive in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pictorial Encyclopedia of Railways |author=Hamilton Ellis |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |year=1968 |pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Locomotion No. 1..jpg|thumb|The ''Locomotion'' at Darlington Railway Centre and Museum]]
In 1814 [[George Stephenson]], inspired by the early locomotives of Trevithick, Murray and Hedley, persuaded the manager of the [[Killingworth]] [[Coal mining|colliery]] where he worked to allow him to build a [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] machine. Stephenson played a pivotal role in the development and widespread adoption of the steam locomotive. His designs considerably improved on the work of the earlier pioneers. He built the locomotive ''[[Blücher (locomotive)|Blücher]]'', also a successful [[flange]]d-wheel adhesion locomotive. In 1825 he built the locomotive ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in the north east of England, which became the first public steam railway in the world, although it used both horse power and steam power on different runs. In 1829, he built the locomotive ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', which entered in and won the [[Rainhill Trials]]. This success led to Stephenson establishing his company as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in Great Britain and Ireland, the United States, and much of Europe.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pictorial Encyclopedia of Railways |last=Ellis |first=Hamilton |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|24–30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pictorial Encyclopedia of Railways |author=Hamilton Ellis |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |year=1968 |pages=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public railway which used only steam locomotives, all the time, was [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], built in 1830.

Steam power continued to be the dominant power system in railways around the world for more than a century.

{{See also|Electric locomotive|Railway electrification system}}

The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837 by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]] in Scotland, and it was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Thus it was also the earliest battery electric locomotive. Davidson later built a larger locomotive named ''Galvani'', exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two [[direct-drive]] [[reluctance motor]]s, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple [[commutator (electric)|commutators]]. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off|spell=in}}. It was tested on the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Lance|last2=McNeil|first2=Ian|title=Biographical dictionary of the history of technology|year=1966|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-06042-4|chapter=Davidson, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=William|title=Our Home Railways|publisher=Frederick Warne and Co|location=London|year=1910|volume=2|page=156|chapter=The Underground Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Renzo Pocaterra, ''Treni'', De Agostini, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First electric tram- Siemens 1881 in Lichterfelde.jpg|thumb|left|Lichterfelde tram, 1882]]
[[Werner von Siemens]] demonstrated an electric railway in 1879 in Berlin. The world's first electric tram line, [[Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway]], opened in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]] near [[Berlin]], Germany, in 1881. It was built by Siemens. The tram ran on 180 Volt DC, which was supplied by running rails. In 1891 the track was equipped with an [[Overhead line|overhead wire]] and the line was extended to [[Berlin-Lichterfelde West station]]. The [[Volk's Electric Railway]] opened in 1883 in [[Brighton]], England. The railway is still operational, thus making it the oldest operational electric railway in the world. Also in 1883, [[Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram]] opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first tram line in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line. Five years later, in the [[United States|US]] electric [[Tram|trolleys]] were pioneered in 1888 on the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]], using equipment designed by [[Frank Julian Sprague|Frank J. Sprague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

[[File:B-and-O electric.jpg|thumb|right|Baltimore &amp; Ohio electric engine]]
The first use of electrification on a main line was on a four-mile stretch of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B&amp;O to the new line to [[New York City|New York]] through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore's downtown.

Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. By early 1900s most street railways were electrified.

The first practical [[Alternating current|AC]] electric locomotive was designed by [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown|Charles Brown]], then working for [[Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon|Oerlikon]], Zürich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission, using [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase AC]], between a [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric plant]] at [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] West, a distance of 280&amp;nbsp;km. Using experience he had gained while working for [[Heilmann locomotive|Jean Heilmann]] on steam-electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that [[AC motor#Three-phase AC synchronous motors|three-phase motors]] had a higher power-to-weight ratio than [[Direct current|DC]] motors and, because of the absence of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], were simpler to manufacture and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Heilmann evaluated both AC and DC electric transmission for his locomotives, but eventually settled on a design based on [[Thomas Edison]]'s DC system{{snd}} Duffy (2003), pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor [[bogie]]s: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=129}}

In 1894, Hungarian engineer [[Kálmán Kandó]] developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. Kandó's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew L.

In 1896, Oerlikon installed the first commercial example of the system on the [[Trams in Lugano|Lugano Tramway]]. Each 30-tonne locomotive had two {{convert|110|kW|hp|-1|abbr=on}} motors run by three-phase 750&amp;nbsp;V 40&amp;nbsp;Hz fed from double overhead lines. Three-phase motors run at constant speed and provide [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], and are well suited to steeply graded routes, and the first main-line three-phase locomotives were supplied by Brown (by then in partnership with [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Walter Boveri]]) in 1899 on the 40&amp;nbsp;km [[List of railway electrification systems#Burgdorf-Thun Bahn|Burgdorf—Thun line]], Switzerland.

[[File:Ganz engine Valtellina.jpg|thumb|A prototype of a Ganz AC electric locomotive in Valtellina, Italy, 1901]]
Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106&amp;nbsp;km [[Valtellina]] line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|pp=120–121}}&lt;ref name="Patent Office" /&gt; The electrical system was three-phase at 3&amp;nbsp;kV 15&amp;nbsp;Hz.

An important contribution to the wider adoption of AC traction came from SNCF of France after World War II. The company conducted trials at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, and established it as a standard.

Earliest recorded examples of an internal combustion engine for railway use included a prototype designed by [[William Dent Priestman]], which was examined by [[Sir William Thomson]] in 1888 who described it as a ''"[Priestman oil engine] mounted upon a truck which is worked on a temporary line of rails to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|magazine= The Engineer| date = 24 April 1956| page = 254| title = Motive power for British Railways|url = http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/5/56/Er19560824.pdf| volume =202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = |journal = The Electrical Review| volume =22|page = 474| date= 4 May 1888|quote = ''A small double cylinder engine has been mounted upon a truck, which is worked on a temporary line of rails, in order to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes, on tramways''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, a {{convert|20|hp|kW|abbr=on}} two axle machine built by [[Priestman Brothers]] was used on the [[Hull Docks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal = Diesel Railway Traction|volume = 17|publisher= Railway Gazette|year= 1963|page=25| quote=''In one sense a dock authority was the earliest user of an oil-engined locomotive, for it was at the Hull docks of the North Eastern Railway that the Priestman locomotive put in its short period of service in 1894''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[Rudolf Diesel]], [[Adolf Klose]] and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer [[Gebrüder Sulzer]] founded Diesel-Sulzer-Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel-powered locomotives. Sulzer had been manufacturing diesel engines since 1898. The Prussian State Railways ordered a diesel locomotive from the company in 1909. The world's first diesel-powered locomotive was operated in the summer of 1912 on the [[Winterthur–Romanshorn railway]] in Switzerland, but was not a commercial success.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=12}} The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was 883&amp;nbsp;kW with a maximum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Glatte | first = Wolfgang | title = Deutsches Lok-Archiv: Diesellokomotiven 4.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s.

[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] &amp; [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel–electric railcar 1914]]
A significant breakthrough occurred in 1914, when [[Hermann Lemp]], a [[General Electric]] electrical engineer, developed and patented a reliable [[direct current]] electrical control system (subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp).&lt;ref&gt;Lemp, Hermann. US Patent No. 1,154,785, filed April 8, 1914, and issued September 28, 1915. ''Accessed via Google Patent Search at: [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT1154785&amp;id=UhpBAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1154785 US Patent #1,154,785] on February 8, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Lemp's design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion, and was the [[prototype]] for all [[diesel–electric locomotive]] control systems. In 1914, world's first functional diesel–electric railcars were produced for the ''Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as {{ill|Sächsischer DET 1–2|de|lt=DET 1 and DET 2}}. The first regular use of diesel–electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications. General Electric produced several small switching locomotives in the 1930s (the famous "[[44-tonner]]" switcher was introduced in 1940) Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.

In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}

The first electrified [[high-speed rail]] [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] was introduced in 1964 between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] in Japan. Since then [[high-speed rail]] transport, functioning at speeds up and above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h, has been built in Japan, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan (Republic of China), the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Korea]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The construction of many of these lines has resulted in the dramatic decline of short haul flights and automotive traffic between connected cities, such as the London–Paris–Brussels corridor, Madrid–Barcelona, Milan–Rome–Naples, as well as many other major lines.{{Citation needed|reason=
If this is correct, it's a strong argument in favor of building more high speed rail lines. It would help to have quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this effect including as a function of distance with credible sources for those estimates. For example, could similar effects be obtained from high speed rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles, where the distances are 60 percent more than between [[London]], [[Paris]] and Brussels?|date=December 2013}}

High-speed trains normally operate on [[standard gauge]] tracks of [[continuously welded rail]] on [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] that incorporates a large [[Minimum railway curve radius|turning radius]] in its design. While high-speed rail is most often designed for passenger travel, some high-speed systems also offer freight service.

{{Main|History of rail transport in Belgium}}
Belgium took the lead in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent starting in the 1820s. It provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the industrial revolution. After splitting from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1830, the new country decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas and linked to neighboring countries. Unusually, the Belgian state became a major contributor to early rail development and championed the creation of a national network with no duplication of lines. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region.

The system was built along British lines, often with British engineers doing the planning. Profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O'Brien, ''Railways and the economic development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; The first railway in Belgium, running from northern [[Brussels]] to [[Mechelen]], was completed in May 1835.

The earliest railway in Britain was a [[wagonway]] system, a horse drawn wooden rail system, used by German miners at [[Caldbeck]], [[Cumbria]], England, perhaps from the 1560s.&lt;ref name="Warren Allison 2010 pp. 52"/&gt; A wagonway was built at [[Prescot]], near [[Liverpool]], sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away.&lt;ref name="Jones 2012 5"/&gt; On 26 July 1803, Jessop opened the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], south of London erroneously considered first railway in Britain, also a horse-drawn one. It was not a railway in the modern sense of the word, as it functioned like a [[turnpike road]]. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.

The [[Middleton Railway]] in [[Leeds]], which was built in 1758, later became the world's oldest operational railway (other than funiculars), albeit now in an upgraded form. In 1764, the first railway in the Americas was built in [[Lewiston, New York]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;
The first passenger [[Horsecar]] or [[tram]], [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] was opened between [[Swansea]] and [[Mumbles]] in [[Wales]] in 1807.&lt;ref name="Early Days of Mumbles Railway"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/mumbles_trainanniv.shtml| title=Early Days of Mumbles Railway| date=15 February 2007| publisher=BBC| accessdate=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse remained preferable mode for tram transport even after arrival of steam engines, well till the end of 19th century. The major reason was that the horse-cars were clean as compared to steam driven trams which caused smoke in city streets.

In 1812, [[Oliver Evans]], an American engineer and inventor, published his vision of what steam railways could become, with cities and towns linked by a network of long distance railways plied by speedy locomotives, greatly speeding up personal travel and goods transport. Evans specified that there should be separate sets of parallel tracks for trains going in different directions. However, conditions in the infant United States did not enable his vision to take hold. This vision had its counterpart in Britain, where it proved to be far more influential. [[William James (railway promoter)|William James]], a rich and influential surveyor and land agent, was inspired by the development of the steam locomotive to suggest a national network of railways. It seems likely&lt;ref name="Macnair"&gt;{{cite book|author=Macnair, Miles|title=William James (1771–1837): the man who discovered George Stephenson|publisher=[[Railway and Canal Historical Society]]|location=Oxford|year=2007|isbn=978-0-901461-54-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in 1808 James attended the demonstration running of [[Richard Trevithick]]'s [[steam locomotive]] ''[[Catch me who can]]'' in London; certainly at this time he began to consider the long-term development of this means of transport. He proposed a number of projects that later came to fruition and is credited with carrying out a survey of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Unfortunately he became bankrupt and his schemes were taken over by George Stephenson and others. However, he is credited by many historians with the title of "Father of the Railway".&lt;ref name="Macnair"/&gt;

It was not until 1825, that the success of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], world's first public railway, proved that the railways could be made as useful to the general shipping public as to the colliery owner. This railway broke new ground by using rails made of [[rolling mill|rolled]] [[wrought iron]], produced at [[Bedlington Ironworks]] in [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Pacey, ''Technology in World Civilisation'' (MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1990), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Such rails were stronger. This railway linked the town of [[Darlington]] with the port of [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and was intended to enable local collieries (which were connected to the line by short branches) to transport their coal to the docks. As this would constitute the bulk of the traffic, the company took the important step of offering to haul the colliery wagons or chaldrons by locomotive power, something that required a scheduled or timetabled service of trains. However, the line also functioned as a toll railway, on which private horse-drawn wagons could be carried. This curious hybrid of a system (which also included, at one stage, a horse-drawn passenger wagon) could not last and within a few years, traffic was restricted to timetabled trains. (However, the tradition of private owned wagons continued on railways in Britain until the 1960s.)

[[File:Planet replica.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''Planet'', which ran on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830]]
The success of the Stockton and Darlington encouraged the rich investors in the rapidly industrialising [[North West of England]] to embark upon a project to link the rich cotton manufacturing town of [[Manchester]] with the thriving port of [[Liverpool]]. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was the first modern railway, in that both the goods and passenger traffic were operated by scheduled or timetabled locomotive hauled trains. When it was built, there was serious doubt that locomotives could maintain a regular service over the distance involved. A widely reported competition was held in 1829 called the [[Rainhill Trials]], to find the most suitable [[steam engine]] to haul the trains. A number of locomotives were entered, including ''[[Novelty (locomotive)|Novelty]]'', ''[[Perseverance (steam locomotive)|Perseverance]]'' and ''[[Sans Pareil]]''. The winner was [[Stephenson's Rocket]], which steamed better because of its [[Fire-tube boiler|multi-tubular boiler]] (suggested by [[Henry Booth]], a director of the railway company).

The promoters were mainly interested in goods traffic, but after the line opened on 15 September 1830, they were surprised to find that passenger traffic was just as remunerative. The success of the Liverpool and Manchester railway influenced the development of railways elsewhere in Britain and abroad. The company hosted many visiting deputations from other railway projects and many railwaymen received their early training and experience upon this line. The Liverpool and Manchester line was, however, only {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} long. The world's first trunk line can be said to be the [[Grand Junction Railway]], opening in 1837 and linking a midpoint on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway with [[Birmingham]], via [[Crewe]], [[Stafford]] and [[Wolverhampton]].

===== Further development =====
The earliest locomotives in revenue service were small four-wheeled ones similar to the Rocket. However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his "Planet" design, were mounted inside the frames. While this improved stability, the "crank axles" were extremely prone to breakage. Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for wheel slip when starting. Greater tractive effort was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by the fragility of the cast iron connecting rods. Hence, from the beginning, there was a distinction between the light fast passenger locomotive and the slower more powerful goods engine. [[Edward Bury and Company|Edward Bury]], in particular, refined this design and the so-called [[Bury Bar Frame locomotive|"Bury Pattern"]] was popular for a number of years, particularly on the [[London and Birmingham Railway|London and Birmingham]].

Meanwhile, by 1840, Stephenson had produced larger, more stable, engines in the form of the [[2-2-2]] [[Patentee locomotive|"Patentee"]] and six-coupled goods engines. Locomotives were travelling longer distances and being worked more extensively. The [[North Midland Railway]] expressed their concern to [[Robert Stephenson]] who was, at that time, their general manager, about the effect of heat on their fireboxes. After some experiments, he patented his so-called [[Long Boiler locomotive|Long Boiler design]]. These became a new standard and similar designs were produced by other manufacturers, particularly [[Sharp Brothers]] whose engines became known affectionately as "Sharpies".

The longer wheelbase for the longer boiler produced problems in cornering. For his six-coupled engines, Stephenson removed the flanges from the centre pair of wheels. For his express engines, he shifted the trailing wheel to the front in the [[4-2-0]] formation, as in his "Great A". There were other problems: the firebox was restricted in size or had to be mounted behind the wheels; and for improved stability most engineers believed that the centre of gravity should be kept low.

The most extreme outcome of this was the [[Crampton locomotive]] which mounted the driving wheels behind the firebox and could be made very large in diameter. These achieved the hitherto unheard of speed of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} but were very prone to wheelslip. With their long wheelbase, they were unsuccessful on [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s winding tracks, but became popular in the USA and France, where the popular expression became ''prendre le Crampton''.

John Gray of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] disbelieved the necessity for a low centre of gravity and produced a series of locomotives that were much admired by [[David Joy (engineer)|David Joy]] who developed the design at the firm of [[E. B. Wilson and Company]] to produce the [[2-2-2]] [[Jenny Lind locomotive]], one of the most successful passenger locomotives of its day. Meanwhile, the Stephenson [[0-6-0]] Long Boiler locomotive with inside cylinders became the archetypal goods engine.

===== Expanding network =====
Railways quickly became essential to the swift movement of goods and labour that was needed for [[industrialization]]. In the beginning, [[canal]]s were in competition with the railways, but the railways quickly gained ground as [[Steam engine|steam]] and rail technology improved and railways were built in places where canals were not practical.

By the 1850s, many steam-powered railways had reached the fringes of built-up London. But the new companies were not permitted to demolish enough property to penetrate the City or the West End, so passengers had to disembark at [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[Euston railway station|Euston]], [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]], [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]], [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] or [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and then make their own way by [[hackney carriage]] or on foot into the centre, thereby massively increasing [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] in the city. A [[Metropolitan Railway]] was built underground to connect several of these separate railway terminals and was the world's first "Metro".

===== Social and economic consequences =====
The railways changed British society in numerous and complex ways. Although recent attempts to measure the economic significance of the railways have suggested that their overall contribution to the growth of GDP was more modest than an earlier generation of historians sometimes assumed, it is nonetheless clear that the railways had a sizeable impact in many spheres of economic activity. The building of railways and locomotives, for example, called for large quantities of heavy materials and thus provided a significant stimulus or ‘backward linkage’, to the coal-mining, iron-production, engineering and construction industries.

They also helped to reduce transaction costs, which in turn lowered the costs of goods: the distribution and sale of perishable goods such as meat, milk, fish and vegetables were transformed by the emergence of the railways, giving rise not only to cheaper produce in the shops but also to far greater variety in people's diets.

Finally, by improving personal mobility the railways were a significant force for social change. Rail transport had originally been conceived as a way of moving coal and industrial goods but the railway operators quickly realised the potential market for railway travel, leading to an extremely rapid expansion in passenger services. The number of railway passengers trebled in just eight years between 1842 and 1850: traffic volumes roughly doubled in the 1850s and then doubled again in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Patterns of Industrialisation|url=https://www.academia.edu/840198/Patterns_of_Industrialisation|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the historian Derek Aldcroft has noted, ‘in terms of mobility and choice they added a new dimension to everyday life’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Digby et al eds|first=A|title=New Directions in Economic and Social History|year=1989|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
[[File:Fete de Calais - Benediction du Chemin de Fer 1848.jpg|thumb|Catholic priests bless a railway engine in [[Calais]], 1848]]
{{Main|History of rail transport in France}}
In France, railways were first operated by private coal companies the first legal agreement to build a railway was given in 1823 and the line (from [[Saint-Étienne to Andrézieux Railway|Saint-Étienne to Andrézieux]]) was operated in 1827. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain but this stimulated machinery makers, which soon created a national heavy industry. Trains became a national medium for the modernization of backward regions and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]]. One writer hoped that railways might improve the lot of "populations two or three centuries behind their fellows" and eliminate "the savage instincts born of isolation and misery." Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus lines that cut east to west in the south). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency.

After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances and even minute technical details. The central government department of Ponts et Chaussées [bridges and roads] brought in British engineers and workers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border, which was considered necessary for the national defense. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. .

[[File:France1860railways.png|thumb|Development of the network up to 1860]]

Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Bourse in Paris, so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached and help to develop many local industrial centers, mostly in the North (coal and iron mines) and in the East (textiles and heavy industry). Critics such as [[Émile Zola]] complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it.

The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses and imported and exported manufactured products. In ''The Rise of Rail-Power in War and Conquest, 1833–1914'', published in 1915, Edwin A. Pratt wrote, "the French railways … attained a remarkable degree of success. … It was estimated that the 75,966 men and 4,469 horses transported by rail from Paris to [[Mediterranean Sea|the Mediterranean]] or to the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] between April 20 and 30 April [during the 1859 [[Second Italian War of Independence]]] would have taken sixty days to make the journey by road. … This… was about twice as fast as the best achievement recorded up to that time on the German railways.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Edwin, A., ''The rise of rail-power in war and conquest, 1833–1914'', J. B. Lippincott company, 1915, 405 p.&lt;/ref&gt; " Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of rail transport in Germany}}

An operation was illustrated in Germany in 1556 by [[Georgius Agricola]] in his work ''[[De re metallica]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgius Agricola 1913 p. 156"/&gt; This line used "Hund" carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the truck fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the wagons ''Hunde'' ("dogs") from the noise they made on the tracks.&lt;ref name="Lee 1943 16"/&gt; This system became very popular across Europe.

[[File:Friedrich List und die erste grosse Eisenbahn 2.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich List]]'s concept for a German railway net from 1833]]
The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron.&lt;ref&gt;Colleen A. Dunlavy, ''Politics and Industrialization: Early Railroads in the United States and Prussia'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist [[Friedrich List]] summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:

# As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.
# It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.
# It secures the community against dearth and famine and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.
# It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.&lt;ref&gt;List quoted in John J. Lalor, ed. ''Cyclopædia of Political Science'' (1881) 3:118; see Nipperdey (1996) p.&amp;nbsp;165&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain’s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day and forged ahead of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allan |last=Mitchell | title=Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail transport in the Netherlands is generally considered to have begun on 20 September 1839 when the first train, drawn by the locomotive ''[[Arend (locomotive)|De Arend]]'', successfully made the 16&amp;nbsp;km trip from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Haarlem]]. However, the first plan for a railroad in the Netherlands was launched only shortly after the first railroad opened in Britain.

In the early 1830s, the Russian father and son inventors the Cherepanovs built the first Russian steam locomotive. The first railway line was built in Russia in 1837 between Saint-Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo. It was 27&amp;nbsp;km long and linked the Imperial Palaces at Tsarskoye Selo and Pavlovsk. The track gauge was {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Russia was in need of big transportation systems and geographically suited to railroads, with long flat stretches of land and comparatively simple land acquisition. It was hampered, however, by its outmoded political situation and a shortage of capital. Foreign initiative and capital were required. It was the Americans who brought the technology of railway construction to Russia. In 1842, planning began for the building of Russia's first important railway; it linked Moscow and St Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Mowbray Haywood|title=Russia Enters the Railway Age, 1842–1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7tPAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=East European Monographs|page=9ff}}

The history of rail transport in [[peninsular Spain]] begins in 1848 with the construction of a railway line between Barcelona and [[Mataró]]. In 1852, the first narrow gauge line was built. In 1863 a line reached the Portuguese border. By 1864, the Madrid-[[Irun]] line had been opened and the French border was reached.

==== Canada ====
{{Further|History of rail transport in Canada}}
[[File:Grand Trunk Railway Station, Montreal.jpg|thumb|Grand Trunk's [[Bonaventure Station (1887–1952)|Bonaventure Station]], Montreal, 1900s]]

The first Canadian railway, the [[Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad]], was opened in 1836 outside of [[Montreal]], a seasonal portage railway to connect river traffic. It was followed by the Albion Railway in [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia]] in 1840, a collier railway connecting coal mines to a seaport. In [[History of Canada|Canada]], the national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together and second, it wanted to maximize trade inside Canada and minimize trade with the United States, to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853, then opened a line to Portland, Maine (which was ice-free) and lines to Michigan and Chicago. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world. The Intercolonial line, finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]], tying them to the new Confederation.

Anglo entrepreneurs in [[Montreal]] sought direct lines into the US and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. [[Joseph Howe]], [[Charles Tupper]] and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a "civilizing mission" centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. [[Leonard Tilley]], New Brunswick's most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of "economic progress," stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second and routes into central Canada last. Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. den Otter, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Den Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west. The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk's expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the US in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Den Otten (1997); Bill Waiser, ''Saskatchewan: A New History'' (2005) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Pacific, paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with [[James J. Hill]]'s American railways and opened even more connections to the South. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.

Two additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast—three in all—but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923, the government merged the Grand Trunk, Grand Trunk Pacific, Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new the Canadian National Railways system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the US and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace and many short lines were built to river ports.&lt;ref&gt;M. L.

[[File:69workmen.jpg|thumb|The [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869.]]

===== Overview =====
The earliest railway in Canada is a wooden railroad reportedly used in the construction of the French fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Canada's Earliest Railway Lines |last=Brown |first=Robert R. |date=October 1949 |journal=[[Railway and Locomotive Historical Society Bulletin]] |volume=78 |pages=49-63 |jstor=43517553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads played a large role in the development of the United States from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] 1810–50 to the settlement of the West 1850–1890. The American railroad mania began with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1828 and flourished until the [[Panic of 1873]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily ended growth.

Although the South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]]. The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within 10 miles of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.

The system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. The use of diesel electric locomotives (after 1940) made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.

===== Mileage =====
Route mileage peaked at 254,000 in 1916 and fell to 140,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.'' Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 2011; pp. 1064, 1068.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, there were about {{convert|75|mi|km}} of railroad track, in short lines linked to coal and granite mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry V. Poor |title= Railroads and Canals of the United States of America |pages=85, 415}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After this, railroad lines grew rapidly. Ten years later, in 1840, the railways had grown to {{convert|2800|mi|km}}. By 1860, on the eve of civil war, the length had reached {{convert|29000|mi|km}}, mostly in the North. The South had much less trackage and it was geared to moving cotton short distances to river or ocean ports. The Southern railroads were destroyed during the war but were soon rebuilt. By 1890, the national system was virtually complete with {{convert|164000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Census Bureau |title= Report on the Agencies of Transportation in the United States at Tenth Census 1880 |pages=308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, the symbolically important [[Transcontinental railroad#United States|transcontinental railroad]] was completed in the United States with the driving of a golden spike (near the city of [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]).

=== Latin America ===

In Latin America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries railways were critical elements in the early stages of modernization of the [[Latin American economy]], especially in linking agricultural regions to export-oriented seaports.&lt;ref&gt;Summerhill, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After 1870 Latin American governments encouraged further rail development through generous concessions that included government subsidies for construction. Railway construction is the subject of considerable scholarship, examining the economic, political, and social impacts of railroads. Railways transformed many regions of Latin America beginning in the late nineteenth century. "Increasing exports of primary commodities, rising imports of capital goods, the expansion of activities drawing directly and indirectly on overseas investment, the rising share of manufacturing in output, and a generalized increase in the pace and scope of economic activity were all tied closely to the timing and character of the region's infrastructural development.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Summerhill, "The Development of Infrastructure" in ''The Cambridge Economic History of Latin America, vol. 2: The Long Twentieth Century'', Victor Bulmer-Thomas, John H. Coatsworth, and Roberto Cortés Conde, eds. New York: Cambridge University Press 2006, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of railway line construction were not uniform, but by 1870 railway line construction was underway, with Cuba leading with the largest railway track in service (1,295&amp;nbsp;km), followed by Chile (797&amp;nbsp;km), Brazil (744&amp;nbsp;km), Argentina (732&amp;nbsp;km), Peru (669&amp;nbsp;km), and Mexico (417&amp;nbsp;km). By 1900, Argentina (16,563&amp;nbsp;km), Brazil (15,316&amp;nbsp;km) and Mexico (13,615&amp;nbsp;km) were the leaders in length of track in service, and Peru, which had been an early leader in railway construction, had stagnated (1,790&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;Summerhill, "The Development of Infrastructure", Table 8.1. Length of railway track service by country 1870–1930, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, growing nationalistic fervor led the government to bring the bulk of the nation's railroads under national control in 1909, with a new government corporation, [[Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México]] (FNM), that exercised control of the main trunk rail lines through a majority of share ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India railways1909a.jpg|thumb|The 1909 map of railways in India]]

The first proposals for railways in [[India]] were made in [[Madras]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="irfca.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/history/india-first-railways.html|title=[IRFCA] India's First Railways|website=www.irfca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first train in India ran from [[Red Hills, Chennai|Red Hills]] to [[Chintadripet]] bridge in [[Madras]] in 1837. It was called ''Red Hill Railway''. It was hauled by a rotary steam engine locomotive manufactured by William Avery. It was built by Sir [[Arthur Cotton]]. It was primarily used for transporting granite stones for road building work in Madras.&lt;ref name="irfca.org"/&gt; In 1845, a railway was built at [[Dowleswaram]] in [[Rajahmundry]]. It was called ''Godavari Dam Construction Railway''. It was also built by Arthur Cotton. It was used to supply stones for construction of a dam over [[Godavari]].&lt;ref name="irfca.org"/&gt;

On 8 May 1845, [[Madras Railway]] was incorporated. In the same year, the [[East India Railway]] company was incorporated. On 1 August 1849, [[Great Indian Peninsular Railway]] (GIPR) was incorporated. In 1851, a railway was built in [[Roorkee]]. It was called ''Solani Aqueduct Railway''. It was hauled by steam locomotive Thomason, named after a British officer-in-charge. It was used for transporting construction materials for building of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] over Solani river.&lt;ref name="irfca.org"/&gt; In 1852, the "Madras Guaranteed Railway Company" was incorporated.

The first passenger train in [[India]] ran between [[Bombay]] ([[Bori Bunder railway station|Bori Bunder]]) and [[Thane]] on 16 April 1853. The 14-carriage train was hauled by three steam locomotives: Sahib, Sindh and Sultan. It ran for about 34 kilometers between these two cities carrying 400 people. The line was built and operated by GIPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/164-years-ago-on-this-day-india-s-first-train-ran-from-mumbai-to-thane-275748.html|title=164 Years Ago On This Day, India's First Train Ran From Mumbai To Thane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/Indias-1st-train-When-Sahib-Sindh-Sultan-blew-steam/articleshow/19717248.cms|title=India’s 1st train: When Sahib, Sindh &amp; Sultan blew steam |work=Times of India |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This railway line was built in {{RailGauge|1676mm|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]], which became the standard for the railways in the country. The first passenger railway train in eastern India ran from [[Howrah]], near [[Calcutta]] to [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hoogly]], for distance of 24 miles, on 15 August 1854. The line was built and operated by EIR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-hist.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: IR History: Early Days - 1|website=www.irfca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first passenger train in South India ran from [[Royapuram]] / Veyasarapady ([[Madras]]) to Wallajah Road ([[Arcot]]) on 1 July 1856, for a distance of 60 miles. It was built and operated by Madras Railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/royapuram-railway-station-legacy-through-the-ages/|title=Legacy of First Railway Station of South India|website=RailNews Media India Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 1873, the first [[tram]]way (a [[horse-drawn tramway]]) opened in Calcutta between [[Sealdah]] and Armenian Ghat Street, a distance of 3.8&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturebowl.com/kolkatas-trams-a-ride-through-history/|title=Kolkata’s trams – A ride through history|date=2 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iran ====
{{Main|Islamic Republic of Iran Railways#History}}
[[Iran]]ian railway history goes back to 1887 when an approximately 20-km long railway between Tehran and Ray was established. After this time many short railways were constructed but the main railway, [[Trans-Iranian Railway]], was started in 1927 and operated in 1938 by connecting the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea.

==== Japan ====
{{Main|History of rail transport in Japan}}
[[Japan]] developed its first railway line in 1872 with technical and materiel assistance provided by several western nations such as Britain and America.

==== Pakistan ====
{{Main|History of rail transport in Pakistan}}
It was in 1847 when the first railway was imagined but it was not until 1861 when it came into existence in the form of the railway built from [[Karachi]] to [[Kotri]]. Since then [[Pakistan Railways|rail transport]] is a popular mode of non-independent transport in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakrail.com/history.php Pakistan railways History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imec''' is an international [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] and innovation hub, active in the fields of [[nanoelectronics]] and [[Digital Technologies|digital technologies]]. It is led since 2009 by [[Luc Van den Hove]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leuveninc.com/event/36/831/IMEC_names_Luc_Van_den_hove_to_serve_as_President_and_CEO/|title=IMEC names Luc Van den hove to serve as President and CEO - Leuven.Inc - Leuven Innovation Networking Circle|last=Abusol|website=www.leuveninc.com|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, imec merged with the [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] digital research center, [[iMinds]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/160844/|title=Newswire &amp; Press Release / Merger Between Centers Imec and iMinds Completed - Electronics/Instrumentation/RFID - Imec {{!}} NewswireToday|website=www.newswiretoday.com|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Imec is one of the leading organizations for R&amp;D in nanoelectronics and digital technologies. The institute employs around 3,500 researchers from more than 75 countries and has numerous facilities dedicated to research and development around the world, including 12,000 square meters of [[cleanroom]] capacity for [[semiconductor]] processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.flandersinvestmentandtrade.com/invest/en/news/imec-flanders-opens-new-state-art-rd-center|title=Imec (Flanders) opens new state-of-the-art R&amp;D center|date=9 November 2016|work=Invest In Flanders|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]]), imec is present in seven other international locations in six other countries: [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[United States|the United States]] and [[Japan]].

===History===
In 1982 the [[Flemish Government]] set up a program in the field of microelectronics with the goal to strengthen the microelectronics industry in Flanders. This program included setting up a laboratory for advanced research in microelectronics (IMEC), a semiconductor foundry (former Alcatel Microelectronics, now STMicroelectronics and AMI Semiconductor), and a training program for VLSI design engineers. The latter is now fully integrated in the IMEC activities.

IMEC was founded in 1984 as a non-profit organization led by [[Roger Van Overstraeten|Prof. Roger Baron Van Overstraeten]]. The name Imec is an acronym of the original full name: Interuniversitair Micro-Electronica Centrum VZW. It is supervised by a Board of Directors, which includes delegates from industry, Flemish universities and the Flemish Government. Since 1984, IMEC has been led by Roger Van Overstraeten, Gilbert Declerck (as of June 1999), and Luc Van den hove (as of July 2009).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Merger with iMinds===
In February 2016 it was announced that imec would be merging with the Flemish digital research center, iMinds. The goal was to strengthen Flanders’ international authority as a technology hub.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2016/02/20/_a_baby_with_majorpotential-1-2577830/|title="A baby with major potential"|work=flandersnews.be|date=20 February 2016|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippe Muyters]], Flemish Minister of Innovation, stated: “When [imec and iMinds] were founded, the line between hardware and software was still very clear. Today, and especially in the future, this line is increasingly blurring – with technology, systems and applications being developed in close conjunction. The merger anticipates this trend and creates a high-tech research center for the digital economy that keeps Flanders on the world map.”&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

The merger was finalized on September 21, 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Campus==
The IMEC campus in Leuven, Belgium includes 24,400m² of office space, laboratories, training facilities, and technical support rooms. At the heart of the campus are 2 cleanrooms which run a semi-industrial operation (24/7). There is a 300mm cleanroom (450mm ready) that focuses on R&amp;D towards (sub-)10&amp;nbsp;nm process technology and a 200mm cleanroom for R&amp;D, development-on-demand, prototyping and low volume manufacturing on more-than-Moore technologies (sensors, actuators, and MEMS, NEMS etc.). IMEC has, among others, a pilot line for silicon and organic solar cells, unique laboratories for bioelectronics research, and equipment for materials characterization and reliability testing. For research on technologies for the intuitive internet of things, IMEC has dedicated labs for sensor and imaging technologies, wireless connectivity.

==Research domains==
IMEC performs research on different application fields of nanoelectronics, applications related to the intuitive internet of things,
healthcare and energy. More specifically this includes wearable health monitoring (EEG, ECG sensors, ...), life sciences (lab-on-chip, cells-on-chip, neuroprobes); wireless communication (reconfigurable radios, radar, ...); image sensors and vision systems (hyperspectral imaging, lens free microscopy, ...); large-area flexible electronics; solar cells and batteries; GaN power electronics, ….

Lower-temperature fuel cell types such as the [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]], [[phosphoric acid fuel cell]], and [[alkaline fuel cell]] require pure [[hydrogen]] as fuel, typically produced from external [[methane reformer|reforming]] of [[natural gas]]. However, fuels cells operating at high temperature such as the [[solid oxide fuel cell]] (SOFC)  are not poisoned by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in fact can accept hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and methane mixtures as fuel directly, because of their internal [[water-gas shift reaction|shift]] and reforming capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Badwal|first2=S.P.S.|last3=Kulkarni|first3=A.|last4=Munnings|first4=C.|title=A comprehensive review of direct carbon fuel cell technology|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|date=June 2012|volume=38|issue=3|pages=360–399|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0360128512000044/1-s2.0-S0360128512000044-main.pdf?_tid=dac4f74e-2c62-11e4-bc12-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1408976561_83a17eb6042d5a0d998d6f7b0829be93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens up the possibility of efficient fuel cell-based power cycles consuming solid fuels such as [[coal]] and [[biomass]], the [[gasification]] of which results in [[syngas]] containing mostly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane which can be cleaned and fed directly to the SOFCs without the added cost and complexity of methane reforming, water gas shifting and hydrogen separation operations which would otherwise be needed to isolate pure hydrogen as fuel.
A power cycle based on gasification of solid fuel and SOFCs is called an Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) cycle; the IGFC power plant is analogous to an [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] power plant, but with the [[gas turbine]] power generation unit replaced with a fuel cell (high temperature type such as SOFC) power generation unit.&lt;ref name=BAH&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netl.doe.gov/File%20Library/Research/Energy%20Analysis/Coal/IGFC_FR_20110225.pdf|title= Analysis of Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Plant Configurations, DOE/NETL-2011/1482|date=February 2011|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking advantage of intrinsically high energy efficiency of SOFCs and process integration, exceptionally high power plant efficiencies are possible. Furthermore, SOFCs in the IGFC cycle can be operated so as to isolate a carbon dioxide-rich anodic exhaust stream, allowing efficient [[carbon capture and storage|carbon capture]] to address [[greenhouse gas]] emissions concerns of [[fossil-fuel power station|coal-based power generation]].

==Process Configuration==
The IGFC system combines use of SOFCs as a topping cycle to the gas turbine or heat recovery steam generator-based bottoming cycle. Typical major components of the IGFC system, this one centered on a SOFC module running at atmospheric pressure, are identified in the simplified cycle diagram.
[[File:IGFC Atmospheric Pressure.png|thumb|Simplified Process Diagram of Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Power Cycle at Atmospheric Pressure]]
The system fuel as depicted is coal, converted to syngas by the gasifier, which is then supplied to the SOFC module after cleanup and pressure reduction. The syngas pressure reduction step is accomplished in this system concept by an [[turboexpander|expander/generator]], which thereby produces part of the cycle's gross power generation. Oxygen for the coal gasification process is provided by a conventional [[air separation]] unit, and steam for the gasifier is raised by power system heat and recycled water. Note that the SOFC module is configured to maintain the anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, and the anode off-gas, which contains some electrochemically-unreacted hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is combusted to completion at the [[oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-combustor]]. Maintaining separation of the off-gas streams restricts the large atmospheric nitrogen content to the cathode side, and simplifies the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture process to anode off-gas cooling, water-vapor condensation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; drying, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compression. Compressed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is suitable for [[carbon capture and utilization|carbon utilization or storage]] (CUS) as appropriate. Heat recovered from the anode-side process can be used by a power-generating bottoming cycle consisting of a heat recovery steam generator and steam turbine. On the cathode side, process air for the SOFC electrochemical process and for module cooling is provided by an air blower; heat can be recovered from the hot cathode off-gas stream to preheat the process air as needed, and for the generation of additional power.
Due to the inherently efficient SOFC, and to using recovered SOFC exhaust heat to generate additional electric power, an IGFC system is capable of operating at a high electric efficiency that significantly exceeds those associated with [[pulverized coal-fired boiler|conventional pulverized coal]] and [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] power systems. IGFC efficiency margins considered achievable, based upon the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory comparative studies of advanced power systems, are apparent in the table provided in subsequent discussion.
[[File:IGFC Pressurized.png|thumb|Simplified Process Diagram of Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Power Cycle at Elevated Pressure]]
Improvement in the IGFC cycle efficiency is possible by pressurized operation of the SOFCs, as depicted in the diagram of IGFC with pressurized SOFC cycle. The process is basically similar to the atmospheric-pressure cycle, but it would run the SOFC module at elevated pressure, achieving an SOFC voltage boost, and would replace the cathode-side process-air blower with an air compressor. Also, an expander/generator would be installed in the cathode off-gas stream to reduce gas pressures and generate additional power (this tends to drop the temperature of the gases so much that steam generation to run a steam turbine is not a viable option). Optionally, an expander/generator set could also be placed in the anode off-gas stream, just downstream of the oxy-combustor, and ahead of off-gas heat recovery.

==Gasification Choices for IGFC==
Multiple types of solid fuel gasifiers are commercially available for coal, [[petroleum coke|petcoke]], and biomass gasification. Designs vary depending on fuel and intended application. As a result, they can differ in the composition of the syngas produced and the efficiency with which they convert coal energy content to syngas energy content - a performance parameter typically termed cold gas efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higman|first1=Christopher|last2=van der Burgt|first2=Maarten|title=Gasification|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7506-8528-3|pages=28–30|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gasifiers also vary in their main operating parameters – e.g., process temperature, pressure, and demands for oxygen and steam. For power systems based upon the integration of coal gasification and SOFC technologies, these parameters, particularly cold gas efficiency and the oxygen and steam demands, will affect electricity production efficiency.

Gasifiers are of three main types – entrained flow, moving bed, and fluidized bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Gasifiers-Types of Gasifiers|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/types-gasifiers|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Entrained flow gasifiers (e.g., GE Energy, Shell, E-Gas™, Siemens) could attract early interest for fuel cell power system applications because they are relatively well developed and are used in current integrated gasification combined cycle power system designs and applications. Entrained flow gasification typically proceeds at relatively high process temperatures, requires oxygen input at relatively high rates, steam input at low to moderate rates, and it produces a syngas product with very small methane content, typically less than 1% (vol). Cold gas efficiencies for entrained flow gasification are usually in the 80% range.
The moving-bed gasifier (e.g., Lurgi) operates at moderate temperature levels, and with moderate oxygen and steam supply requirements. The cold gas efficiency achieved by this gasifier is higher, circa 90%, and its syngas product stream will have methane content nominally in the 4-5% (vol) range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixed (Moving)Bed Gasifiers-Lurgi Dry-Ash Gasifier|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/lurgi|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluidized-bed gasification (e.g., KBR Transport) proceeds with similar characteristics, but will exhibit somewhat lower syngas methane content, typically in the 2-3% (vol) range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Gasifiers-Fluidized Bed Gasifiers|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/fluidizedbed|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to the SOFC-based IGFC power system is catalytic coal gasification, because of the characteristically high methane content of its resultant syngas. This process experienced development in the 1980s for synthetic natural gas production purposes. Compared to conventional gasification summarized above, a catalytic gasifier would require less oxygen input, run at a lower process temperature, and produce a syngas stream with a higher methane concentration [15-30% (vol)], in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gasifiers &amp; Gasification Tech for Special Apps &amp; Alt Feedstocks-Catalytic Gasification|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/catalytic|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its lower operating temperature, a relatively high cold gas efficiency of at least 90% is projected for catalytic gasification, and this characteristic, as well as the process need for less oxygen input, would directly support high-efficiency IGFC power system operation. Furthermore, internal reformation of the substantial methane content of its syngas within the SOFC module can be used by design to assist module cooling, and can thereby lead to reductions in the parasitic power demand associated with cooling air supply.
The SOFC electric power generator module in an IGFC system could conceivably be fueled with syngas supplied by any of the available conventional coal gasifiers, and studies indicate that power system electric efficiencies in the 45-50% range are achievable, depending on whether the power system uses atmospheric-pressure or pressurized SOFC modules. However, from the efficiency viewpoint particularly, the preferred coal gasification approach for the application is catalytic. Using that technology, IGFC system efficiencies in 56-60% range are projected, again depending on SOFC module pressurization. Estimates and comparisons are tabulated below.

&lt;small&gt;† The efficiency estimates include the effects of parasitic power loads due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compression for carbon sequestration/storage.&lt;/small&gt;

In addition to high power system efficiencies, studies&lt;ref name=BAH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanzini|first1=Andrea|last2=Kreutz|first2=Thomas G.|last3=Martelli|first3=Emanuele|title=Techno-economic Analysis of Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Power Plants Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Proceedings of ASME Turbo Expo 2012|date=June 11–15, 2012|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pei/energy/people/staff/kreutz/P47-ASME-Turbo-Expo-1-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also project significant IGFC system power plant capital cost, cost of electricity, and net water usage advantages: IGFC electric power systems integrating catalytic coal gasification with SOFC module designs that separate anode and cathode off-gas streams, and feature methane reformation-augmented SOFC cooling, would operate cleanly with very high electric efficiencies, while providing for high levels of carbon capture, and requiring low net water input.

==Carbon Dioxide Capture in IGFC Cycles==
SOFC design and IGFC process configuration can greatly simplify the [[carbon capture and storage|capture of carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spallina|first1=Vincenzo|last2=Romano|first2=Matteo C.|last3=Campanari|first3=Stefano|last4=Lozza|first4=Giovanni|title=A SOFC-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Cycle With CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture|journal=J. Eng. Gas Turbines Power|date=March 24, 2011|volume=133|issue=7|url=http://gasturbinespower.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1429428|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will increasingly be demanded for low [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of most fossil-fuel utilization processes. In [[pulverized coal-fired boiler|conventional combustion]], fuel is burned in air, resulting in exhaust gases containing large amount of nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream (needed for storage of carbon in greenhouse gas emissions control scenarios) is inefficient. In [[oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-combustion]], oxygen is extracted from air and used for fuel combustion, resulting in exhaust gases uncontaminated with nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream is efficient. However, a large energy penalty for doing the air separation required for isolating the oxygen stream in the first place is incurred. In contrast, for SOFC function neither inefficient carbon capture from exhaust gases nor air separation is required: the only required interaction of the anode and cathode reactant streams is the transfer of oxygen from cathode side (air) to anode side (fuel). All carbon, excepting the negligible amount in atmospheric air coming in at the cathode, will enter the module with fuel on the anode side, and it must exit the anode as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. By designing the SOFC module to keep anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, dilution of that carbon-rich stream with atmospheric nitrogen from the cathode side is avoided, allowing simple and inexpensive carbon dioxide separation and capture downstream.

{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:Mason at work.jpg|thumb|300px|A mason laying mortar on top of a finished course of blocks, prior to placing the next course.]]
'''Masonry''' is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; the term ''masonry'' can also refer to the units themselves. The common materials of masonry construction are [[brick]], building [[rock (geology)|stone]] such as [[marble]], [[granite]], [[travertine]], and [[limestone]], [[cast stone]], [[concrete block]], [[glass]] block, and [[adobe]]. Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction. A person who constructs masonry is called a mason or [[bricklayer]]. These are both classified as [[construction worker|construction trades]].

==Applications==
Masonry &lt;ref name="Masonry Repair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipernity.com/blog/1581268/888396|title=Tips for Repairing Masonry|accessdate=2015-04-14|year=2015|author=Repairing Masonry}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used for walls and buildings. Brick and concrete block are the most common types of masonry in use in industrialized nations and may be either weight-bearing or a [[#Veneer masonry|veneer]]. Concrete blocks, especially those with hollow cores, offer various possibilities in masonry construction. They generally provide great compressive strength, and are best suited to structures with light transverse loading when the cores remain unfilled. Filling some or all of the cores with concrete or concrete with steel reinforcement (typically [[rebar]]) offers much greater tensile and lateral strength to structures.

===Advantages===
* The use of material such as bricks and stones can increase the thermal mass of a building.
* Masonry is non-combustible product and can protect the building from fire.
* Masonry walls are more resistant to projectiles, such as debris from hurricanes or tornadoes.

===Disadvantages===
* Extreme weather, under certain circumstances, can cause degradation of masonry due to expansion and contractions forces associated with freeze-thaw cycles.
* Masonry tends to be heavy and must be built upon a strong foundation, such as reinforced concrete, to avoid settling and cracking.
* Other than concrete, masonry construction does not lend itself well to mechanization, and requires more skilled labor than [[Balloon framing|stick-framing]].
* Masonry consists of loose components and has a low tolerance to oscillation as compared to other materials such as reinforced concrete, plastics, wood, or metals.

===Structural limitations===
Masonry has high compressive strength under vertical loads but has low tensile strength (against twisting or stretching) unless reinforced. The tensile strength of masonry walls can be increased by thickening the wall, or by building masonry ''piers'' (vertical columns or ribs) at intervals. Where practical, steel reinforcements such as [[windpost]]s can be added.

==Veneer masonry==
A masonry veneer wall consists of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed on one or both sides of a structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the structural wall by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the structural wall, as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually [[tar paper]]) and [[weep hole]]s can be left at the base of the brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer [[adobe]] are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.

Most insulated buildings that utilize concrete block, brick, adobe, stone, veneers or some combination thereof feature interior [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] in the form of [[Glass wool|fiberglass]] batts between wooden wall studs or in the form of rigid insulation boards covered with [[plaster]] or [[drywall]]. In most climates this insulation is much more effective on the exterior of the wall, allowing the building interior to take advantage of the aforementioned thermal mass of the masonry. This technique does, however, require some sort of weather-resistant exterior surface over the insulation and, consequently, is generally more expensive.

==Dry set masonry==
[[Image:Vallorcine bridge abutment 2003-12-13.jpg|thumb|Dry set masonry supports a rustic [[log bridge]], where it provides a well-drained support for the log (which will increase its service life).|219x219px]]
{{See also|dry stone}}
The strength of a masonry wall is not entirely dependent on the bond between the building material and the mortar; the [[friction]] between the interlocking blocks of masonry is often strong enough to provide a great deal of strength on its own. The blocks sometimes have grooves or other surface features added to enhance this interlocking, and some ''dry set'' masonry structures forgo mortar altogether.

==Brick==
{{main|Brickwork}}
[[File:Brick Work 2015-02-8 278.jpg|thumb|Brick Work]]
Solid [[brickwork]] is made of two or more [[wythe]]s of bricks with the units running horizontally (called ''stretcher'' bricks) bound together with bricks running [[:wikt:transverse|transverse]] to the wall (called "header" bricks). Each row of bricks is known as a course. The pattern of headers and stretchers employed gives rise to different 'bonds' such as the common bond (with every sixth course composed of headers), the English bond, and the Flemish bond (with alternating stretcher and header bricks present on every course). Bonds can differ in strength and in insulating ability. Vertically staggered bonds tend to be somewhat stronger and less prone to major cracking than a non-staggered bond.

===Uniformity and rusticity===
[[Image:Athruzmasonry.jpg|thumb|Masonry repair work done to a brick wall.]]
The wide selection of brick styles and types generally available in industrialized nations allow much variety in the appearance of the final product. In buildings built during the 1950s-1970s, a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical. In the period since then this style was thought to be too sterile, so attempts were made to emulate older, rougher work. Some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including ''burnt'' bricks, which have a darker color or an irregular shape. Others may use antique salvage bricks, or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments, such as tumbling. The attempts at rusticity of the late 20th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free, artistic style, where the courses are intentionally ''not'' straight, instead weaving to form more organic impressions.

===Serpentine masonry===
{{main|Crinkle crankle walls}}
A crinkle-crankle wall is a brick wall that follows a serpentine path, rather than a straight line. This type of wall is more resistant to toppling than a straight wall; so much so that it may be made of a single wythe of unreinforced brick and so despite its longer length may be more economical than a straight wall.

==Concrete block==
[[Image:CMUs.jpg|thumb|Concrete masonry units (CMUs) or blocks in a basement wall before burial.]]
Blocks of cinder concrete (''[[Concrete masonry unit|cinder blocks]]'' or ''breezeblocks''), ordinary concrete (''[[Concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]]''), or hollow tile are generically known as Concrete Masonry Units (CMUs). They usually are much larger than ordinary bricks and so are much faster to lay for a wall of a given size. Furthermore, cinder and concrete blocks typically have much lower [[water]] absorption rates than brick. They often are used as the structural core for veneered brick masonry, or are used alone for the walls of factories, garages and other [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] buildings where such appearance is acceptable or desirable. Such blocks often receive a [[stucco]] surface for decoration. Surface-bonding [[cement]], which contains synthetic fibers for reinforcement, is sometimes used in this application and can impart extra strength to a block wall. Surface-bonding cement is often pre-coloured and can be stained or painted thus resulting in a finished stucco-like surface.

The primary structural advantage of concrete blocks in comparison to smaller clay-based bricks is that a CMU wall can be reinforced by filling the block voids with [[concrete]] with or without steel [[rebar]]. Generally, certain voids are designated for filling and reinforcement, particularly at corners, wall-ends, and openings while other voids are left empty.  This increases wall strength and stability more economically than filling and reinforcing all voids. Typically, structures made of CMUs will have the top course of blocks in the walls filled with concrete and tied together with steel reinforcement to form a bond beam. Bond beams are often a requirement of modern [[building code]]s and controls. Another type of steel reinforcement, referred to as [[ladder-reinforcement]], can also be embedded in horizontal mortar joints of concrete block walls. The introduction of steel reinforcement generally results in a CMU wall having much greater lateral and tensile strength than unreinforced walls.

"Architectural masonry is the evolvement of standard concrete masonry blocks into aesthetically pleasing concrete masonry units (CMUs)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echelonmasonry.com/standard-masonry-brick|title=Concrete Masonry Units &amp; Oldcastle Architectural Brick Blocks|website=www.echelonmasonry.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMUs can be manufactured to provide a variety of surface appearances. They can be colored during manufacturing or stained or painted after installation. They can be split as part of the manufacturing process, giving the blocks a rough face replicating the appearance of natural stone, such as [[brownstone]]. CMUs may also be scored, ribbed, sandblasted, polished, striated (raked or brushed), include decorative aggregates, be allowed to slump in a controlled fashion during curing, or include several of these techniques in their manufacture to provide a decorative appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncma.org/resources/productuse/products/concrete/Pages/GroundFaceUnits%28Burnished,Honed%29.aspx |title={title} |access-date=2009-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521200939/http://www.ncma.org/resources/productuse/products/concrete/Pages/GroundFaceUnits(Burnished,Honed).aspx |archive-date=2009-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Glazed concrete masonry units are manufactured by bonding a permanent colored facing (typically composed of polyester resins, silica sand and various other chemicals) to a concrete masonry unit, providing a smooth impervious surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncma.org/resources/productuse/products/concrete/Pages/Glazed%28Prefaced%29Units.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521200923/http://www.ncma.org/resources/productuse/products/concrete/Pages/Glazed%28Prefaced%29Units.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass block]] or glass brick are blocks made from glass and provide a translucent to clear vision through the block.

==Stonework==
[[File:Kélibia stone masonry.JPG|thumb|Stone Masonry]]
Stone blocks used in masonry can be dressed or rough, though in both examples: corners, door and window jambs, and similar areas are usually dressed.
Stone masonry utilizing dressed stones is known as [[ashlar]] masonry, whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as [[rubble masonry]]. Both rubble and ashlar masonry can be laid in coursed rows of even height through the careful selection or cutting of stones, but a great deal of stone masonry is uncoursed.
* [[Slipform stonemasonry]] produces a hybrid wall of reinforced concrete with a rubble stone face.
* Natural [[stone veneer]]s over CMU, cast-in-place, or tilt-up concrete walls are widely used to give the appearance of stone masonry.
* Sometimes river rock of smooth oval-shaped stones is used as a veneer. This type of material is not favored for solid masonry as it requires a great amount of mortar and can lack intrinsic structural strength.
* Manufactured-stone, or cultured stone, veneers are popular alternatives to natural stones.
* Manufactured-stone veneers are typically made from concrete.
* Natural stones from quarries around the world are sampled and recreated using molds, aggregate, and colorfast pigments.
* To the casual observer there may be no visual difference between veneers of natural and manufactured stone.'''

==Gabions==
[[File:A Vörös és a Kék kápolnák közötti sétány kerti lugassal, gabion támfalrendszerrel, 2018 Balatonboglár.jpg|thumb|Gabion Wall]]
[[Gabion]]s are baskets, usually now of [[zinc]]-protected [[steel]] ([[Hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized steel]]) that are filled with fractured stone of medium size. These will act as a single unit and are stacked with setbacks to form a revetment or [[retaining wall]]. They have the advantage of being both well drained and flexible, and so resistant to flood, water flow from above, frost damage, and soil flow. Their expected useful life is only as long as the wire they are composed of and if used in severe climates (such as shore-side in a salt water environment) must be made of appropriate corrosion-resistant wire.  Most modern gabions are rectangular.

Earlier gabions were often cylindrical wicker baskets, open at both ends, used usually for temporary, often military, construction.

Similar work can be done with finer aggregates using [[cellular confinement]].

==Bagged concrete==
A low grade concrete may be placed in woven plastic sacks similar to that used for [[sandbag]]s and then emplaced. The sacks are then watered and the emplacement then becomes a series of artificial stones that conform to one another and to adjacent soil and structures. This conformation makes them resistant to displacement. The sack becomes non-functional and eventually disintegrates. This type of masonry is frequently used to protect the entrances and exits of water conduits where a road passes over a stream or dry wash. It is also used to protect stream banks from erosion, especially where a road passes close by.

==Passive fire protection (PFP)==
Masonry walls have an [[endothermic]] effect of its [[hydrate]]s, as in chemically bound [[water]], as well as unbound moisture from the concrete block, as well as the poured concrete if the hollow cores inside the blocks are filled.

Masonry buildings can also be built to increase safety by reducing fire damage, such as the use of [[fire cut]]s during construction.

==Mechanical modelling of masonry structures==

[[Image:Comparison masonry.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A comparison (using transmission [[photoelasticity]]) between the stress diffusion in an elastic body (on the left) and a model of masonry (on the right). A highly localized stress percolation is visible on the right.]]

From the point of view of material modelling, masonry is a special material of extreme mechanical properties (with a very high ratio between strength in compression and in tension), so that the applied loads do not diffuse as they do in elastic bodies, but tend to percolate along lines of high stiffness,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni|title=Davide Bigoni - Solid and Structural Mechanics Group - University of Trento|website=www.ing.unitn.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; see the figure on the right and watch a [http://www.ing.unitn.it/dims/ssmg/masonry.html video] for more details.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face.jpg|thumb|[[World Health Organization]] Headquarters in [[Geneva]]]]
Four major elements define a medical encyclopaedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
* Encyclopaedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field.  A medical encyclopedia provides valuable health information, tools for managing your health, and support to those who seek information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/about-webmd-policies/default.htm?ss=ftr|title=Medical Encyclopedia WebMD| date=17 May 2009}} About WebMD.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopaedia of medicine.
* The articles on subjects in a medical encyclopedia are usually accessed alphabetically by article name or for health topics.
* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, they have had an ever-increasing effect on the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Medical encyclopedias such as [[Medline Plus]], [[WebMD]], and the [[Merck Manual]] are examples of new forms of the medical encyclopedias as information retrieval becomes simpler.  Some online encyclopedias are [[List of medical wikis|medical wikis]], which use [[wiki software]] to write the information collaboratively.

== Medical Encyclopedia MedlinePlus ==

[[MedlinePlus]] is a free Web site that provides consumer health information for [[patients]], [[families]], and [[health care provider]]s. MedlinePlus brings together quality information from the United States [[National Library of Medicine]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations.  The U.S. National Library of Medicine produces and maintains MedlinePlus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">Mentec Limited was founded in 1978 and initially focused on the development of monitoring and control software and systems. It was a significant [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] reseller and OEM in Ireland. Mentec Computer Systems Limited was a subsidiary of Mentec Limited that developed [[PDP-11]] processors. Mentec Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentec-inc.com/|title=PDP-11 RSX RT RSTS Emulator Osprey Charon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813131029/http://www.mentec-inc.com/|archive-date=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a US-based subsidiary of Mentec Limited. In the early 1980s it had a range of [[remote terminal unit]]s based on the SBC/11-21 (Falcon).

Once the [[DEC J-11]] PDP-11 processor chip set became available in 1982 Mentec commenced the design of its first PDP-11 single board computer the M70. In 1994 Digital transferred the PDP-11 operating systems to Mentec Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/biz.digital.announce/group$3Abiz.digital.announce$20mentec%7Csort:date/biz.digital.announce/mnNlxqdYTwo/Bh84UGO09kEJ|title=Digital And Mentec, Inc. Announce PDP-11 Software Agreement|date=June 29, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product Range ==

===M70===
The M70 was developed between 1982 and 1984. It was a quad [[Q-bus]] module based on the J-11 chipset incorporating onboard [[ECC memory|ECC]] [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]], bootstrap [[EPROM]]s and 4 serial lines implemented using DEC DC319 DLART chips.

===M71===
The M71 was a version of the M70 intended for process control.&lt;ref&gt;SBC M71 Single Board Computer Users Guide, Mentec,1987&lt;/ref&gt; It provided for 1/4 or 1 M Byte of ECC DRAM, up to 1/2 MB of [[EPROM]], {{nowrap|4 serial}} lines (DC-319 DLARTs) and two parallel ports implemented using [[Intel 8255|8255]]&lt;!--correct?--&gt; chips. It was initially designed by Mentec for use in its own [[Remote Terminal Unit]]s.

===M80===
The M80 was a further development of the M70 but using parity memory and a slightly higher clock rate. It also introduced software configuration via the bootstrap which all but eliminated wire-wrap configuration.

===M90===
This was effectively merely a clock tweaked version of the M80.

===M100===
The M100 was the last of Mentec's J-11 based processor boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentec.com/PDP/m100brochu.htm|title=Mentec's M100 Brochure|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990819133553/http://mentec.com/PDP/m100brochu.htm|archive-date=19 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SBC M100 Series User Manual, Mentec Computer Systems, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; It was a somewhat tidied up and faster re-design of the M90.

Some late models incorporated a daughter card with a [[Xilinx]] part which replaced the DLARTs and implemented a FIFO to prevent overruns for OEM applications.

A small number of late models incorporated an [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] daughter card which replaced the on-board [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]].

===M11===
The M11 was a [[microcode]]d re-implementation from scratch of the M100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentec.com/PDP/m11brochu.htm|title=Mentec's M11 Brochure|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990819134502/http://mentec.com/PDP/m11brochu.htm|archive-date=19 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was based around two [[Texas Instruments]] TI8832 ALUs and a TI 8818 microsequencer.
One of the ALUs was used as the processor ALU while the second was used to implement the memory management unit. An [[Intel i960]] processor was used to load the microcode, perform floating point (in IEEE format) and provide [[Octal Debugging Technique|ODT]].
The 4 DLARTs of the earlier M100 were emulated on a single [[Xilinx]] part.
All of the memory (both microcode and PDP-11 main memory) was implemented using SRAM.
While not of any significant effect in the field it suffered from the fact that it used a large number of microcode controlled drivers onto tri-state buses, which made developing microcode somwehat hazardous.

The M11 design was implemented in [[VHDL]] and fully simulated using [[Mentor Graphics]] QuickSim II with behavioural language models for both the [[Q-Bus]] and console [[UART]]. It ran patched versions of the [[Digital data|Digital]] [[PDP-11/23]] CPU diagnostics on the simulator before any hardware was constructed.

===M1===
The M1 was an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] re-implementation of the M11. Despite being an ASIC implementation it was also fully microcoded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuse-network.com/fuse/demonstration/30/24675/24675.pdf Development Project Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Millipede storage technology was pursued as a potential replacement for magnetic recording in hard drives, at the same time reducing the form-factor to that of [[flash memory|flash]] media. IBM demonstrated a prototype millipede storage device at [[CeBIT]] 2005, and was trying to make the technology commercially available by the end of 2007. However, because of concurrent advances in competing storage technologies, no commercial product has been made available since then.

== Technology ==

=== Basic concept ===
The [[main memory]] of modern computers is constructed from one of a number of [[DRAM]]-related devices. DRAM basically consists of a series of [[capacitor]]s, which store data as the presence or absence of electrical charge. Each capacitor and its associated control circuitry, referred to as a ''cell'', holds one [[bit]], and bits can be read or written in large blocks at the same time. In contrast, [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] store data on a disk that is covered with a [[magnetic storage|magnetic material]]; data is represented as local magnetisation of this material. Reading and writing are accomplished by a single head, which waits for the requested memory location to pass under the head while the disk spins. As a result, the drive's performance is limited by the mechanical speed of the motor, and is generally hundreds of thousands of times slower than DRAM. However, since the "cells" in a hard drive are much smaller, the storage density is much higher than DRAM.

Millipede storage attempts to combine features of both. Like a hard drive, millipede stores data in a substrate or medium and accesses the data by moving the medium under the head as well. However, millipede uses many nanoscopic heads that can read and write in parallel, thereby increasing the throughput. Additionally, millipede's physical medium stores a bit in a small area, leading to high storage densities. Mechanically, millipede uses numerous [[atomic force microscope|''atomic force probes'']] each of which is responsible for reading and writing a large number of bits associated with it. Bits are stored as a pit, or the absence of one, in the surface of a thermo-active [[polymer]] deposited as a thin film on a carrier known as the ''sled.'' Any one probe can only read or write a fairly small area of the sled available to it, a ''storage field''. Normally the sled is moved to position the selected bits under the probe using electromechanical actuators similar to those that position the read/write head in a typical hard drive, although the actual distance moved is tiny. The sled is moved in a scanning pattern to bring the requested bits under the probe, a process known as ''x/y scan.''

The amount of memory serviced by any one field/probe pair is fairly small, but so is its physical size. Many such field/probe pairs are used to make up a memory device. Data reads and writes can be spread across many fields in parallel, increasing the throughput and improving the access times. For instance, a single [[32-bit]] value would normally be written as a set of single bits sent to 32 different fields. In the initial experimental devices, the probes were mounted in a 32x32 grid for a total of 1,024 probes. As the layout looked like the legs on a [[millipede]] (animal), the name stuck. The design of the [[cantilever]] array involves making numerous mechanical cantilevers, on which a probe has to be mounted. All the cantilevers are made entirely out of silicon, using [[surface micromachining]] at the wafer surface.

Non-[[Crosslinked polymer|crosslinked]] polymers retain a low [[Glass transition|glass temperature]], around 120&amp;nbsp;°C for PMMA&lt;ref name="Maman2"&gt;Mamin &amp; Rugar "Thermomechanical writing with an atomic force microscope tip" Applied Physics Letters (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and if the tip is heated to above the glass temperature, it leaves a small indentation. Indentations have been made at 3&amp;nbsp;nm lateral resolution.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=William P.|last2=Goodson|first2=Kenneth E.|title=Thermal Writing and Nanoimaging With a Heated Atomic Force Microscope Cantilever|journal=Journal of Heat Transfer|date=2002|volume=124|issue=4|pages=597|doi=10.1115/1.1502634}}&lt;/ref&gt; By heating the probe immediately next to an indentation, the polymer will re-melt and fill in the indentation, erasing it (see also: thermo-mechanical [[scanning probe lithography]]). After writing, the probe tip can be used to read the indentations. If each indentation is treated as one bit then a storage density of 0.9&amp;nbsp;Tb/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; could theoretically be achieved.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;
[[File:Write erase bit.tiff|thumb|Thermal writing and erasing of a bit]]

=== Reading and writing data ===
Each probe in the cantilever array stores and reads data thermo-mechanically, handling one bit at a time. To accomplish a read, the probe tip is heated to around 300 [[degrees Celsius|°C]] and moved in proximity to the data sled. If the probe is located over a pit the cantilever will push it into the hole, increasing the surface area in contact with the sled, and in turn increasing the cooling as heat leaks into the sled from the probe. In the case where there is no pit at that location, only the very tip of the probe remains in contact with the sled, and the heat leaks away more slowly. The electrical resistance of the probe is a function of its temperature, rising with increasing temperature. Thus when the probe drops into a pit and cools, this registers as a drop in resistance. A low resistance will be translated to a "1" bit, or a "0" bit otherwise. While reading an entire storage field, the tip is dragged over the entire surface and the resistance changes are constantly monitored. 

To write a bit, the tip of the probe is heated to a temperature above the ''glass transition temperature'' of the polymer used to manufacture the data sled, which is generally [[acrylic glass]]. In this case the transition temperature is around 400&amp;nbsp;°C. To write a "1", the polymer in proximity to the tip is softened, and then the tip is gently touched to it, causing a dent. To erase the bit and return it to the zero state, the tip is instead pulled up from the surface, allowing [[surface tension]] to pull the surface flat again. Older experimental systems used a variety of erasure techniques that were generally more time consuming and less successful. These older systems offered around 100,000 erases, but the available references do not contain enough information to say if this has been improved with the newer techniques. 

As one might expect, the need to heat the probes requires a fairly large amount of power for general operation. However, the exact amount is dependent on the speed that data is being accessed; at slower rates the cooling during read is smaller, as is the number of times the probe has to be heated to a higher temperature to write. When operated at data rates of a few megabits per second, Millipede is expected to consume about 100 milliwatts, which is in the range of flash memory technology and considerably below hard drives. However, one of the main advantages of the Millipede design is that it is highly parallel, allowing it to run at much higher speeds into the [[gigabyte|GB]]/s. At these sorts of speeds one might expect power requirements more closely matching current hard drives. Data transfer speed is limited to the kilobits-per-second range for an individual probe, which amounts to a few megabits for an entire array. Experiments done at IBM's [[Almaden Research Center]] showed that individual tips could support data rates as high as 1 - 2 megabits per second, potentially offering aggregate speeds in the GB/s range.

=== First devices ===
The earliest generation millipede devices used probes 10 nanometers in diameter and 70 nanometers in length, producing pits about 40&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter on fields 92&amp;nbsp;µm x 92&amp;nbsp;µm. Arranged in a 32 x 32 grid, the resulting 3&amp;nbsp;mm x 3&amp;nbsp;mm chip stores 500 megabits of data or 62.5 MB, resulting in an [[areal density]], the number of bits per square inch, on the order of 200 Gbit/in². IBM initially demonstrated this device in 2003, planning to introduce it commercially in 2005. By that point hard drives were approaching 150 Gbit/in², and have since surpassed it.

Devices demonstrated at [[CeBIT]] in 2005 have improved on the basic design, using a 64 x 64 cantilever chips with a 7&amp;nbsp;mm x 7&amp;nbsp;mm data sled, boosting the data storage capacity to 800 Gbit/in² using smaller pits. It appears the pit size can scale to about 10&amp;nbsp;nm, resulting in a theoretical areal density just over 1Tbit/in². IBM planned to introduce devices based on this sort of density in 2007.  For comparison, as of late 2011, laptop hard drives are shipping with a density of 636 Gbit/in²,&lt;ref name="636-gigabits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hitachigst.com/press-room/2011/hitachi-gst-ships-one-terabyte-per-platter-hard-drives | title = Hitachi GST Ships One Terabyte Per Platter Hard Drives | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Hartin | first = Erin | date = 2011-08-03 | publisher = [[Hitachi Global Storage Technologies]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111026210519/http://www.hitachigst.com/press-room/2011/hitachi-gst-ships-one-terabyte-per-platter-hard-drives | archivedate = 2011-10-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is expected that [[heat-assisted magnetic recording]] and [[patterned media]] together could support densities of 10 Tbit/in².&lt;ref name="10-terabits"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/05/new-hard-drive-write-method-packs-in-one-terabyte-per-inch.ars | title = New hard drive write method packs in one terabit per inch | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Johnston | first = Casey | date = 2011-05-07 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flash reached almost 250 Gbit/in² in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mearian |first=Lucas |date=January 31, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9150050/Intel_Micron_to_announce_world_s_densest_flash_memory |title=Intel Micron to announce world's densest flash memory |publisher= computerworld.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, because of concurrent advances in competing storage technologies, no commercial product has been made available so far.

The '''National Safety Council''' ('''NSC''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit]],  [[public services|public service]] organization  promoting [[health]] and safety in the United States of America. Headquartered in [[Itasca, Illinois]], NSC is a member organization, founded in 1913 and granted a [[congressional charter]] in 1953. Members include more than 55,000 [[businesses]], [[labor organization]]s, [[school]]s, public agencies, private groups and [[individual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineehssupply.com/2017/02/09/value-involved-connected/|title=The Value of Being Involved and Connected}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group focuses on areas where the greatest number of preventable injuries and deaths occur, including [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], prescription medication abuse, teen driving, [[Restrictions on cell phone use by US drivers|cell phone use while driving]] and safety in homes and communities.

==History==
In 1912, the first Cooperative Safety Congress was held in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The event was sponsored by the [[Association of Iron and Steel Electrical Engineers]]. The approximately 200 attendees, representing industry and government, resolved to “organize and create a permanent body for the promotion of the safety to human life in the industries of the [[United States of America|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;''First Co-operative Safety Congress'', National Safety Council, Chicago, IL, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Second Safety Congress in 1913, the National Council for Industrial Safety was established. It was headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and Robert W. Campbell served as first president and William H. Cameron served as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;''Second Safety Congress of the National Council for Industrial Safety'', National Safety Council, Chicago, IL 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;
The name was changed to National Safety Council in 1914, to reflect the organization's expanded scope to include traffic and home safety. As membership increased, the NSC began producing posters, technical fact sheets, and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Annual Safety Congress of the National Safety Council'', Chicago, IL, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1953, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recognized the importance of the NSC’s efforts with a [[Congressional charter]] to: “…arouse and maintain the interest of the people of the United States… in safety and in accident prevention, and to encourage the adoption and institution of safety methods by all persons, corporations, and other organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the National Safety Council, ''Forty-First Annual Safety Congress'', Chicago, IL, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
*Traffic safety: [[Motor vehicle]] crashes are the number one cause of unintentional injury deaths in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinesafetydepot.com/motor-vehicle-crashes-safety-hazards-often-overlooked/|title=Motor Vehicle Safety Hazards Overlooked Because of Familiarity}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSC works with public and private groups to help reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the road.
*Defensive driving: the National Safety Council has offered [[defensive driving]] courses since 1964 with the first approved courses in New Jersey and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Imhoff, C. "DDC - The First 10 Years." ''Traffic Safety'' v.74 no.10, October 1974, pp.8-11,35-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*First aid: NSC offers [[first aid]] training courses for safety, compliance and wellness. Classroom programs are available, as well as [[online training]]. The group is a member of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]’s [[Citizen Corps]], a network of organizations and individuals dedicated to raising awareness about the need for preparedness. Since the NSC’s Emergency Care Services program began in 1991, more than 8 million rescuers have been trained in the program.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
*Fleet safety: the NSC and partner groups have hosted various symposia to bring attention to the number of fleet driver fatalities that occur, and to develop strategies for protecting workers while on the road.
*Teen driving: NSC strategy aims to reduce teen driving motor vehicle fatalities through education about [[graduated driver licensing]] (GDL), an education process proven to reduce teen driving fatalities by 20 to 40 percent by gradually exposing teen drivers to higher crash risk situations.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} GDL puts restrictions on high crash risk factors such as passengers and nighttime driving.
*Workplace safety: NSC works with the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], to strengthen workplace safety and help reduce the number of unintentional injuries and fatalities.
*Training: NSC offers training courses based on best practices for [[occupational safety and health]], driver improvement and emergency care.
*Off-the-job: NSC and multi-national corporate leaders and federal safety experts{{who|date=November 2014}} establish the first symposium on off-the-job safety in the U.S., to help reduce injury-related fatalities that occur off-the-job.
*Elder falls: falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults.&lt;ref name="CDC Falls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Falls are leading cause of injury and death in older Americans|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0922-older-adult-falls.html|website=CDC|publisher=CDC|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSC is part of the Falls Free Coalition, which hopes to advance a national action plan to build community awareness and support for fall prevention activities among older adults.
*Safe Communities America: NSC is an affiliate of the [[World Health Organization]]’s Safe Communities program, and operates a support center and a Safe Communities Certifying Center for the United States. Communities apply for the Safe Communities designation by indicating their long-term commitment to the promotion of safety.

==Organization==
NSC is governed by a [[Board of Directors]] and a Board of Delegates. The Board of Directors manages fiduciary and strategic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/ABOUT_US/Pages/BoardofDirectors.aspx|title=National Safety Council Board of Directors|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103172023/http://www.nsc.org/ABOUT_US/Pages/BoardofDirectors.aspx|archivedate=3 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Delegates develops the mission agenda, creates public policies, and tracks safety, health and environmental trends. More than 2,000 volunteers, drawn from NSC industry volunteer divisions, assist the boards in determining policies, operating procedures and programs to be developed and implemented by the Council’s professional staff.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The National Safety Council’s network of 40 local chapters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/nsc_near_you/FindYourLocalChapter/Pages/find_your_local_chapter.aspx|title=Find Your Local Chapter - Contact List of all National Chapters|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducts safety, health and environmental efforts at the community level, providing training, conferences, workshops, consultation, newsletters, updates and safety support materials, as well as networking avenues.

Members of NSC are segmented into Divisions, also known as special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/get_involved/divisions/Pages/Home.aspx|title=Become a member of a NSC Division|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Division members plan and create programs for the annual NSC Congress &amp; Expo, and participate in discussions of research findings, new concepts, trends, and ideas for safety challenges. Divisions meet twice a year. The divisions are Business &amp; Industry, Construction, Highway Traffic Safety, Labor, Motor Transportation, and Utilities. Some divisions are further segmented into sections.

=== NSC Congress and Expo===
Held each fall, the NSC Congress &amp; Expo attracts between 15,000-18,000 safety and health professionals,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} plus industry suppliers from several countries. The event promotes safety and health products and services, and new safety technologies and training methods. Members attending the annual Congress can also earn [[continuing education]] credits by participating in technical sessions and professional development seminars.

== National Safety Month==
In 1996 NSC established June as [[National Safety Month]], aiming to increase awareness of the leading safety and health risks and ultimately decrease the number of unintentional injuries and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/nsc_events/Nat_Safe_Month/Pages/home.aspx|title=National Safety Month - Get involved and participate in this annual observance|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each week focuses on a specific safety venue: workplace, traffic, home, and community.&lt;ref&gt;"June is National Safety Month."

The '''EBEC (European BEST Engineering Competition) Nordic''' is an engineering competition. It was first conceived at the regional meeting in [[Røros]] in autumn 2007. The Nordic [[engineering]] competition did not officially begin until the regional meeting in [[Copenhagen]] in spring 2009. Shortly after, a coordinator was selected, followed by the selection of a hosting BEST group. At the regional meeting in [[Uppsala]] in spring 2009, the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] engineering competition was established as '''nordBEC''', standing for Nordic BEST Engineering Competition. The first nordBEC was held in Copenhagen, from 27–31 March 2010, and the second one in [[Trondheim]], from 16–20 April 2011

==Structure==
NordBEC gathers the winners of local rounds of engineering competitions organized in top Scandinavian universities. As a result, the best students from the entire region will be selected. During the competition, students work in teams of 4, using their creativity, innovative thinking, and teamwork skills in order to come up with solutions for challenges set for them.

NordBEC has two categories:
*Team Design: This category consists of solving a given technical problem within a limited amount of time. The outcome is a device that has to solve the problem.
*Case Study: It is a task, where a theoretical issue is being considered, and a solution has to be presented. In the end the teams give a presentation of the solutions they came up with.

==Local rounds==
In the Nordic region there are 10 different BEST groups. In 2010, eight of these groups have decided to have a local engineering competition. The winning teams in each local engineering competition attend the nordBEC. The following universities actively participate:
* [[Aalborg University]]
* [[Technical University of Denmark]]
* [[Chalmers University of Technology]]
* [[Aalto University]]
* [[Lund University]]
* [[Royal Institute of Technology]]
* [[Tampere University of Technology]]
* [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]
* [[Uppsala University]]

==2010 Edition==
nordBEC (Nordic BEST Engineering Competition) was organised for the first time by Local BEST Group Copenhagen between the 27th and 31 March 2010. 60 students representing 8 Nordic Universities of Technology obtained passes for nordBEC by winning Local BEST Engineering Competitions (LBECs) at their home universities. The winners won a chance to participate the European BEST Engineering Competition, which took place in [[Cluj-Napoca]], August 2010.

==2011 Edition==
The Second edition was organised by Local BEST Group Trondheim from the 16th till 20 April 2011.

[[File:DHR 787 at Siliguri Shed 05-02-18 19.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] Locomotive No.787 after conversion to oil firing.]]
An '''oil burner engine''' is a [[steam engine]] that uses [[Fuel oil|oil]] as its fuel. The term is usually applied to a [[locomotive]] or [[ship]] engine that burns oil to heat water, to produce the steam which drives the [[piston]]s, or [[steam turbine|turbine]]s, from which the power is derived.

This is mechanically very different from [[diesel engine]]s, which use [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], although they are sometimes [[colloquially]] referred to as oil burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spinelli|first1=Mike|title=Diesel on the Range: Land Rover Flagship to Come in Oil-Burner|url=http://jalopnik.com/176359/diesel-on-the-range-land-rover-flagship-to-come-in-oil-burner|accessdate=2017-09-08|work=[[Jalopnik]]|date=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early pioneer of this form of engine was [[James Holden (engineer)|James Holden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marine Fuels |author= Cletus H. Jones|year=1985|publisher=[[ASTM International]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803104251&amp;id=I8se_2fK9R0C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Oil+Burner%22+ship&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=MneYYV9yjekEI24_G0_vQT8xRGA|isbn=0-8031-0425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Steam Locomotives Really Work|author= Alan J. Goldfinch|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0198607822&amp;id=XzEjhUmRut4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22James+Holden%22+oil&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=8pckazzb-yoBXQmFmJKIuwFkf_0|isbn=0-19-860782-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Britain's [[Great Eastern Railway]]. In James Holden's system, steam was raised by burning coal before the oil fuel was turned on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lner.info/co/GER/locomotives.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
Some oil-burning engines were originally designed to be coal powered but were converted. When a coal-burning steam locomotive is converted to burn oil, various modifications are usual:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
# the grate is covered with broken [[firebrick]] to act as a reservoir of heat.  If the oil flame is blown out (e.g. by a downdraft when entering a tunnel) the hot firebrick will re-ignite it
# the lower part of the inner [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] is lined with firebrick
# shorter [[superheater]] elements are fitted

The latter two changes are needed because oil firing produces higher temperatures than coal firing, and can cause rapid erosion of metal.  For a similar reason, the [[smokebox]] is sometimes painted with silver-coloured heat-resisting paint.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Uses==
A number of [[cultivar]]s of ''P. arundinacea'' have been selected for use as [[ornamental plant]]s, including variegated (striped) cultivars &amp;ndash; sometimes called '''ribbon grass''' &amp;ndash; such as 'Castor' and 'Feesey'. The latter has a pink tinge to the leaves.&lt;ref name=mobot&gt;[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/t250/phalaris-arundinacea-var.-picta-feesey.aspx ''Phalaris arundinacea'' var.

Edible Uses
Edible Parts: Leaves;  Root;  Seed;  Stem.
Edible Uses: Sweetener.

Root - raw or cooked like potatoes[2, 13, 74, 102, 106, 183]. It contains up to 5% sugar. The flavour and texture are best when the root is young and still growing[144]. It can be dried, ground coarsely and used as a porridge[12, 46, 62]. In Russia they are harvested and processed into starch[269]. Young shoots - raw or cooked[61, 62, 102, 179]. They are best if used before the leaves form, when they are really delicious[144]. They can be used like bamboo shoots[183]. The partly unfolded leaves can be used as a potherb and the Japanese dry young leaves, grind them into a powder and mix them with cereal flour when making dumplings[183]. The stems are reported to contain 4.8 g protein, 0.8 g fat, 90.0 g total carbohydrate, 41.2 g fiber, and 4.4 g ash[269]. Seed - raw or cooked[257]. It can be ground into a powder and used as a flour[57, 62, 102, 106]. The seed is rather small and difficult to remove from the husk but it is said to be very nutritious[183]. A sugar is extracted from the stalks or wounded stems[2, 5, 62, 95]. A sweet liquorice-like taste[95], it can be eaten raw or cooked[62]. The stems can be boiled in water and then the water boiled off in order to obtain the sugar[178]. A sugary gum that exudes from the stems can be rolled into balls and eaten as sweets[183]. A powder extracted from the dried stems can be moistened and roasted like marshmallow[62, 95, 102, 183]. 

Reed canarygrass grows well on poor soils and contaminated industrial sites, and researchers at [[Teesside University]]'s Contaminated Land &amp; Water Centre have suggested it as the ideal candidate for [[phytoremediation]] in improving soil quality and biodiversity at [[brownfield land|brownfield]] sites.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The grass can also easily be turned into bricks or pellets for burning in [[biomass]] power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bond|first1=Sam|title=Candidate crops for contaminated land biofuels crop considered|website=edie.net/crc|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=17706&amp;channel=0|date=2010-02-23|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it provides fibers which find use in pulp and papermaking processes.&lt;ref name=anders&gt;Andersson, B. and E. Lindvall.

''P. arundinacea'' is also planted as a [[hay]] crop or for [[forage]].

This species of ''Phalaris'' may also be used as a source for the [[psychedelic drug]]s [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], [[5-MeO-DMT]] and [[Bufotenin|5-OH-DMT]] (bufotenin), as well as [[Hordenine]] and [[5-MeO-NMT]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=S.|title=428. 5-Methoxy-N-methyltryptamine: a new indole alkaloid from Phalaris arundinacea L|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|date=1958|pages=2079|doi=10.1039/jr9580002079}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, N,N-DMT is considered most desirable. Although the concentrations of these compounds is lower than in other potential sources, such as ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' and ''[[Mimosa tenuiflora]]'', large enough quantities of the grass can be refined to make an ad hoc [[ayahuasca]] brew.

==Ecology==
In many places, ''P. arundinacea'' is an [[invasive species]] in [[wetland]]s, particularly in disturbed areas. It has been reported as an invasive weed in [[floodplain]]s, riverside [[meadow]]s, and other wetland habitat types around the world. When ''P. arundinacea'' invades a wetland, it inhibits native vegetation and reduces [[biological diversity]].&lt;ref name=kim&gt;Kim, K. D., et al. (2006).

A '''printed circuit board''' ('''PCB''') mechanically supports and electrically connects [[electronic components]] or [[electrical]] components using [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] tracks, pads and other features [[industrial etching|etch]]ed from one or more sheet layers of copper [[laminated]] onto and/or between sheet layers of a [[insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]]. Components are generally [[Soldering|soldered]] onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.

Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products. They are also used in some electrical products, such as passive switch boxes.

Alternatives to PCBs include [[wire wrap]] and [[point-to-point construction]], both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Specialized CAD software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation.  Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout only has to be done once.  PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.

PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper, alternating with layers of substrate).  Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components.  The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of [[surface mount technology]].  However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.

The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/92973/world-pcb-production-in-2014-estimated-at-602b/92976/?skin=pcb|title=iconnect007 :: Article|website=www.iconnect007.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market Analysis Report estimated that the PCB market would reach $79 billion by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/30/1543947/0/en/Global-Printed-Circuit-Board-PCB-Market-to-Witness-a-CAGR-of-3-1-during-2018-2024.html|title=Global Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Market to Witness a CAGR of 3.1% during 2018-2024|last=Research|first=Energias Market|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theindustryherald.com/2018/08/21/global-single-sided-printed-circuit-board-market-growth-future-prospects-and-competitive-analysis-and-forecast-2018-2023/|title=Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market - Growth, Future Prospects and Competitive Analysis and Forecast 2018 - 2023 - The Industry Herald|date=2018-08-21|work=The Industry Herald|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the development of printed circuit boards electrical and electronic circuits were [[point-to-point construction|wired point-to-point]] on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.

Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. [[Thomas Edison]] experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|1256599}}&lt;/ref&gt; to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1927 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.&lt;ref name="Harper03"&gt;Charles A. Harper, ''Electronic materials and processes handbook'', McGraw-Hill,2003 {{ISBN|0-07-140214-4}}, pages 7.3 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian engineer [[Paul Eisler]] invented the printed circuit as part of a [[radio]] set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines. Around 1943 the USA began to use the technology on a large scale to make [[proximity fuse]]s for use in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Harper03" /&gt; After the war, in 1948, the USA released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the ''Auto-Sembly'' process was developed by the [[United States Army]]. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by [[Geoffrey Dummer]], then at the [[Royal Radar Establishment|RRDE]].

Even as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to  reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain  one or more circuit boards.

[[File:Hand Etched PCB.png|thumb|An example of hand-drawn etched traces on a PCB]]

Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was [[John Sargrove]]'s 1936–1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a [[Bakelite]] plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.

During World War II, the development of the anti-aircraft [[proximity fuse]] required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be [[screenprinting|screenprinted]] with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for [[resistor]]s, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brunetti| first = Cledo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = New Advances in Printed Circuits | publisher = National Bureau of Standards | date = 22 November 1948 | location = Washington DC | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]] awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein the [[IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award|Cledo Brunetti Award]] for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate.  Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]], for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers' Day, [https://www.engr.wisc.edu/engage/alumni-relations/our-distinguished-alumni/ 1984 Award Recipients], College of Engineering, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE_Recipient_list"&gt;{{web cite|title=IEEE CLEDO BRUNETTI AWARD RECIPIENTS|url=https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/awards/recipients/brunetti_rl.pdf|publisher=[[IEEE]]|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention also represents a step in the development of [[integrated circuit]] technology, as not only wiring but also passive components were fabricated on the ceramic substrate.

[[File:PCB design and realisation smt and through hole.png|thumb|A PCB as a design on a computer (left) and realized as a board assembly populated with components (right). The board is double sided, with through-hole plating, green solder resist and a white legend. Both surface mount and through-hole components have been used.]]

Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and [[solder]]ed to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called [[Through-hole technology|''through-hole'' construction]]. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the [[United States Army Signal Corps]] developed the ''Auto-Sembly'' process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and [[Dip soldering|dip soldered]]. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2756485}} assigned to US Army. July 31, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a [[Wave soldering|wave-soldering]] machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.

From the 1980s onward, small surface mount parts have been used increasingly instead of through-hole components; this has led to smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.

In the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://falconerelectronics.com/history-of-circuit-boards/|title=History of Circuit Boards Through the 20th Century|date=2017-08-18|work=Falconer Electronics|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 5434751 | issue-date = 18 July 1995 | inventor = Herbert S. Cole, Jr., Theresa A. Sitnik-Nieters, Robert J. Wojnarowski, John H. Lupinski | title = Reworkable high density interconnect structure incorporating a release layer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDI technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and significantly smaller components. As a result, components can be closer and the paths between them shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of stacked vias is even stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB Cost is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB. However, the cost is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativehitech.com/blog/rise-high-density-interconnect-pcbs/|title=The Rise of High Density Interconnect PCBs - HDI PCBs|website=www.creativehitech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manufacturing.net/blog/2017/10/4-new-technologies-changing-pcb-market|title=4 New Technologies Changing The PCB Market|date=2017-10-26|work=Manufacturing.net|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.

Manufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer's point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of good components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part such as a resistor or capacitor. This practice is a significant contributor to the problem of [[e-waste]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Overview==
A basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or ''circuit traces'', pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for EM shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material.  The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist.

A printed circuit board can have multiple copper layers.  A two-layer board has copper on both sides; multi layer boards sandwich additional copper layers between layers of insulating material. Conductors on different layers are connected with [[via (electronics)|vias]], which are copper-plated holes that function as electrical tunnels through the insulating substrate. Through-hole component leads sometimes also effectively function as vias.  After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is usually four-layer. Often two layers are dedicated as power supply and ground planes, and the other two are used for signal wiring between components.

"Through hole" components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. "Surface mount" components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board.  A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.

The  pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the "artwork".  The etching is usually done using [[photoresist]] which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution.  The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.

In multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.

[[FR-4]] [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|glass epoxy]] is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.

When a PCB has no components installed, it is less ambiguously called a ''printed wiring board'' (''PWB'') or ''etched wiring board''. However, the term "printed wiring board" has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a ''printed circuit assembly'' (''PCA''), ''printed circuit board assembly'' or ''PCB assembly'' (''PCBA''). In informal usage, the term "printed circuit board" most commonly means "printed circuit assembly" (with components). The [[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] preferred term for assembled boards is ''circuit card assembly'' (''CCA''),&lt;ref&gt;IPC-14.38&lt;/ref&gt; and for assembled [[backplane]]s it is ''backplane assemblies''. "Card" is another widely used informal term for a "printed circuit assembly".

A PCB may be "silkscreen" printed with a legend  identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, an actual silkscreen printing process was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used instead.  Normally the screen printing is not significant to the function of the PCBA.

A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a ''breakout board''. The purpose of a breakout board is to "break out" the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.

Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Characteristics==
===Through-hole technology===
{{Main article|Through-hole technology}}
[[File:Resistors (1).jpg|thumb|Through-hole (leaded) resistors]]

The first PCBs used through-hole technology, mounting electronic components by [[Lead (electronics)|lead]]s inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides.  Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be [[Soldering|soldered]] either manually or by a [[wave soldering]] machine.&lt;ref name= MAT2001&gt;''Electronic Packaging:Solder Mounting Technologies'' in K.H. Buschow et al (ed), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TyVVAAAAMAAJ Encyclopedia of Materials:Science and Technology]'', Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0-08-043152-6}},  pages 2708–2709&lt;/ref&gt;

Through-hole manufacture adds to board cost by requiring many holes to be drilled accurately, and it limits the available routing area for [[signal trace]]s on layers immediately below the top layer on multi-layer boards, since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. Once surface-mounting came into use, small-sized SMD components were used where possible, with through-hole mounting only of components unsuitably large for surface-mounting due to power requirements or mechanical limitations, or subject to mechanical stress which might damage the PCB (e.g. by lifting the copper off the board surface).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Surface-mount technology===
{{Main article|Surface-mount technology}}
[[File:Surface Mount Components.jpg|thumb|Surface mount components, including resistors, [[transistor]]s and an integrated circuit]]

Surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early 1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s.
Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes.  Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.
Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates.  Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper.  However, prices of semiconductor [[surface mount device]]s (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

===Circuit properties of the PCB===
Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the [[copper]] foil that remains after etching. Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]], determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a [[ground plane]] for shielding and power return. For [[microwave]] circuits, [[transmission line]]s can be laid out in [[planar transmission line|a planar form]] such as [[stripline]] or [[microstrip]] with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]]. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; conversely, they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, as in [[Distributed element filter]]s, obviating the need for additional discrete components.

===Materials===
====RoHS compliant PCB====

The European Union bans the use of lead (among other heavy metals) in consumer items, a piece of legislature called the [[RoHS]], for Restriction of Hazardous Substances, directive. PCBs to be sold in the EU must be RoHS-compliant, meaning that all manufacturing processes must not involve the use of lead, all solder used must be lead-free, and all components mounted on the board must be free of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;1.	“You Are HereDEQ Pollutants and Toxicants Environmental Lead (Pb).” DEQ - How Does Lead Affect Our Environment?, Agency: Environmental Quality, www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3307_29693_30031-90418--,00.html. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2.	“RoHS Guide.” RoHS Compliance Guide: FAQ on RoHS Compliance, www.rohsguide.com/rohs-faq.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laminates====
Laminates are manufactured by curing under pressure and temperature layers of cloth or paper with [[thermoset]] [[resin]] to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness. The size can be up to {{Convert|4|by|8|ft|m}} in width and length.  Varying cloth weaves (threads per inch or cm), cloth thickness, and resin percentage are used to achieve the desired final thickness and [[dielectric]] characteristics. Available standard laminate thickness are listed in
ANSI/IPC-D-275.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design Standard for Rigid Printed Boards and Rigid Printed Board Assemblies|id=IPC-4101|publisher=IPC|date=September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is [[fire retardant]], the [[dielectric constant]] (e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[loss factor]] (tδ), the [[tensile strength]], the [[shear strength]], the [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and the Z-axis [[coefficient of expansion|expansion coefficient]] (how much the thickness changes with temperature).

There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are [[FR-2]] (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), [[FR-4]] (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with [[ball grid array]] (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.

FR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called "copper-clad laminate".

With decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small nonhomogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.

====Key substrate parameters====
The circuitboard substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes nonwoven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).

The reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Nonwoven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.

The substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical ([[glass transition temperature]], [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]], [[thermal expansion]]), electrical ([[dielectric constant]], [[loss tangent]], [[breakdown voltage|dielectric breakdown voltage]], [[leakage current]], [[tracking resistance]]...), and others (e.g. [[moisture absorption]]).

At the [[glass transition temperature]] the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.

The materials used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the [[phase velocity|signal propagation speed]], frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.

Dielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).

Tracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.

Loss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an [[eye pattern]].

Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination,&lt;ref&gt;Sood, B. and Pecht, M. 2011. Printed Circuit Board Laminates. Wiley Encyclopedia of Composites. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; the same effect responsible for "popcorning" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required to dry them prior to soldering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=By Lee W.

====Common substrates====
Often encountered materials:
* [[FR-2]], [[phenolic paper]] or phenolic cotton paper, paper impregnated with a [[phenol formaldehyde resin]]. Common in consumer electronics with single-sided boards. Electrical properties inferior to FR-4. Poor arc resistance. Generally rated to 105&amp;nbsp;°C.

* [[Aluminum]], or ''metal core board'' or [[insulated metal substrate]] (IMS), clad with thermally conductive thin dielectric - used for parts requiring significant cooling - power switches, LEDs. Consists of usually single, sometimes double layer thin circuit board based on e.g. FR-4, laminated on aluminum sheet metal, commonly 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The thicker laminates sometimes also come with thicker copper metalization.

* [[Polyimide]], a high-temperature polymer. Expensive, high-performance. Higher water absorption (0.4%). Can be used from cryogenic temperatures to over 260&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Copper thickness====
Copper thickness of PCBs can be specified directly or as the weight of copper per area (in ounce per square foot) which is easier to measure. One [[ounce]] per [[square foot]] is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness. ''Heavy copper'' is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 0.0042&amp;nbsp;inches (4.2&amp;nbsp;mils, 105&amp;nbsp;μm) thick.  Heavy copper layers are used for high current or  to help dissipate heat.

On the common FR-4 substrates, 1 [[Ounce|oz]] copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (35&amp;nbsp;µm) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70&amp;nbsp;µm) and 0.5 oz (18&amp;nbsp;µm) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105&amp;nbsp;µm, 9&amp;nbsp;µm is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35&amp;nbsp;µm is usual but also 140 and 400&amp;nbsp;µm can be encountered.

====Safety certification (US)====
Safety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum [[operating temperature]], electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.

==Design==
&lt;!-- [[PCB design]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:S111FlipChipBack.jpg|thumb|A board designed in 1967; the sweeping curves in the traces are evidence of freehand design using adhesive tape]]

Initially PCBs were designed manually by creating a [[photomask]] on a clear [[mylar]] sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on [[dry transfer]]s of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. The finished photomask was [[Photolithography|photolithographically]] reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.

Modern PCBs are designed with dedicated layout software, generally in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/teaching/cs194-05-s08/cs194-designflow.ppt Printed Circuit Board Design Flow Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Schematic capture]] through an [[electronic design automation]] (''EDA'') tool.
# Card dimensions and template are decided based on required circuitry and case of the PCB.
# The positions of the components and [[heat sink]]s are determined.
# Layer stack of the PCB is decided, with one to tens of layers depending on complexity. [[Ground plane|Ground]] and [[power plane]]s are decided. A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an [[alternating current|AC]] signal ground while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB. Signal interconnections are traced on signal planes. Signal planes can be on the outer as well as inner layers. For optimal [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] performance high frequency signals are routed in internal layers between power or ground planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lg-advice.ro/pdf/IPC-2251-cuprins.pdf|title=See appendix D of IPC-2251|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Line impedance]] is determined using dielectric layer thickness, routing copper thickness and trace-width. Trace separation is also taken into account in case of differential signals. [[Microstrip]], [[stripline]] or dual stripline can be used to route signals.
# Components are placed. Thermal considerations and geometry are taken into account. [[Via (electronics)|Via]]s and lands are marked.
# [[Signal trace]]s are [[routing (electronic design automation)|routed]]. Electronic design automation tools usually create clearances and connections in power and ground planes automatically.
# [[Gerber file]]s are generated for manufacturing.

==Manufacturing==
{{anchor|pcbmanufac}}

PCB manufacturing consists of many steps.

===PCB CAM===
Manufacturing starts from the fabrication data generated by [[computer aided design]], and component information. The  fabrication data is read into the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software. CAM performs the following functions:

# Input of the fabrication data.
# Verification of the data
# Compensation for deviations in the manufacturing processes (e.g. scaling to compensate for distortions during lamination)
# Panelization
# Output of the digital tools (copper patterns, drill files, inspection, and others)

===Panelization===
Several small printed circuit boards can be grouped together for processing as a panel. A panel consisting of a design duplicated ''n''-times is also called an ''n''-panel, whereas a ''multi-panel'' combines several different design onto a single panel. The outer tooling strip often includes [[tooling hole]]s, a set of [[panel fiducial]]s, a [[test coupon (PCB)|test coupon]], and may include [[hatched copper pour]] or similar patterns for even copper distribution over the whole panel in order to avoid bending. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient.

The panel is eventually broken into individual PCBs along perforations or grooves in the panel.&lt;ref&gt;Kraig Mitzner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7RCh8bK6_8C Complete PCB Design Using OrCad Capture and Layout]'', pages 443–446, Newnes, 2011 {{ISBN|0080549209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today depaneling is often done by lasers which cut the board with no contact. Laser depaneling reduces stress on the fragile circuits, improving the yield of defect-free units.

===Copper patterning===
The first step is to replicate the pattern in the fabricator's CAM system on a protective mask on the copper foil PCB layers.  Subsequent etching removes the unwanted copper. (Alternatively, a conductive ink can be ink-jetted on a blank (non-conductive) board. This technique is also used in the manufacture of [[hybrid circuit]]s.)
# '''[[Silk screen|Silk screen printing]]''' uses etch-resistant inks to create the protective mask.
# '''[[Photoengraving]]''' uses a photomask and developer to selectively remove a UV-sensitive photoresist coating and thus create a photoresist mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments were made with thermal resist.&lt;ref name="Thermal DI"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Liquid Photoresists for Thermal Direct Imaging
 |authors=Itshak Taff, Hai Benron
 |publisher=The Board Authority, October 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[PCB Milling|PCB milling]]''' uses a two or three-axis mechanical milling system to mill away the copper foil from the substrate. A PCB milling machine (referred to as a 'PCB Prototyper') operates in a similar way to a [[plotter]], receiving commands from the host software that control the position of the milling head in the x, y, and (if relevant) z axis.
# '''Laser resist ablation''' Spray black paint onto copper clad laminate, place into [[CNC]] laser plotter. The laser raster-scans the PCB and ablates (vaporizes) the paint where no resist is wanted. (Note: laser copper ablation is rarely used and is considered experimental.{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=is laser COPPER ablation distinct from resist ablation, and experimental?}})
# '''Laser etching''' The copper may be removed directly by a CNC laser.  Like PCB milling above this is used mainly for prototyping.

The method chosen depends on the  number of boards to be produced and the required resolution.

====Large volume====
* Silk screen printing – Used for PCBs with bigger features
* Photoengraving – Used when finer features are required

====Small volume====
* Print onto transparent film and use as photo mask along with photo-sensitized boards, then etch. (Alternatively, use a film photoplotter)
* Laser resist ablation
* PCB milling
* Laser etching

====Hobbyist====
* Laser-printed resist: Laser-print onto toner transfer paper, heat-transfer with an iron or modified laminator onto bare laminate, soak in water bath, touch up with a marker, then etch.
* Vinyl film and resist, non-washable marker, some other methods. Labor-intensive, only suitable for single boards.

===Subtractive, additive and semi-additive processes===
[[File:Double side PCB process flow chart.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The two processing methods used to produce a double-sided PWB with plated-through holes]]

Subtractive methods remove copper from an entirely copper-coated board to leave only the desired copper pattern.  In additive methods the pattern is [[Electroplating|electroplated]] onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate is covered with a photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film).  The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for through hole plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions.  The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas.  When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.

Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it. A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a subtractive process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the traces.) Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces.  Some single-sided boards which have plated-through holes are made in this way.  [[General Electric]] made consumer radio sets in the late 1960s using additive boards.

The (semi-)additive process is commonly used for multi-layer boards as it facilitates the [[plating]]-through of the holes to produce conductive [[via (electronics)|vias]] in the circuit board.

===Chemical etching===
[[Industrial etching|Chemical etching]] is usually done with [[ammonium persulfate]] or [[ferric chloride]]. For PTH (plated-through holes), additional steps of [[Electroplating#Electroless deposition|electroless deposition]] are done after the holes are drilled, then copper is electroplated to build up the thickness, the boards are screened, and plated with tin/lead. The tin/lead becomes the resist leaving the bare copper to be etched away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFjuCAAAQBAJ|title=The Electronics Assembly Handbook|last=Riley|first=Frank|last2=Production|first2=Electronic Packaging and|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783662131619|location=|pages=285|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest method, used for small-scale production and often by hobbyists, is immersion etching, in which the board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride. Compared with methods used for mass production, the etching time is long.  Heat and agitation can be applied to the bath to speed the etching rate. In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.&lt;ref name="Khandpur05"&gt;R. S. Khandpur,''[https://books.google.com.bd/books/about/Printed_Circuit_Boards.html?id=VY8iBAAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Printed circuit boards: design, fabrication, assembly and testing]'', Tata-McGraw Hill, 2005 {{ISBN|0-07-058814-7}}, pages 373–378&lt;/ref&gt;

As more copper is consumed from the boards, the etchant becomes saturated and less effective; different etchants have different capacities for copper, with some as high as 150 grams of copper per litre of solution. In commercial use, etchants can be regenerated to restore their activity, and the dissolved copper recovered and sold.  Small-scale etching requires attention to disposal of used etchant, which is corrosive and toxic due to its metal content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OwRb7N3j14C|title=Printed Circuit Boards: Design and Technology|last=Bosshart|first=|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780074515495|location=|pages=298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etchant removes copper on all surfaces exposed by the resist.  "Undercut" occurs when etchant attacks the thin edge of copper under the resist; this can reduce conductor widths and cause open-circuits. Careful control of etch time is required to prevent undercut.  Where metallic plating is used as a resist, it can "overhang" which can cause short-circuits between adjacent traces when closely spaced. Overhang can be removed by wire-brushing the board after etching.&lt;ref name=Khandpur05 /&gt;

==={{Anchor|multi-layer}}Lamination===
[[File:Bga und via IMGP4531 wp.jpg|thumb|Cut through a SDRAM-module, a multi-layer PCB. Note the [[Via (electronics)|via]], visible as a bright copper-colored band running between the top and bottom layers of the board.]]

Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board. This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learnemc.com/pcb-layout|title=PCB Layout|accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner layers are given a complete machine inspection before lamination because afterwards mistakes cannot be corrected. The automatic optical inspection system compares an image of the board with the digital image generated from the original design data.

Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with [[drill bit]]s made of solid coated [[tungsten carbide]]. Coated tungsten carbide is used because board materials are abrasive.  High-speed-steel bits would dull quickly, tearing the copper and ruining the board. Drilling is done by computer-controlled drilling machines, using a ''drill file'' or [[Excellon file]] that describes the location and size of each drilled hole.

Holes may be made conductive, by electroplating or inserting hollow metal eyelets, to connect board layers. Some conductive holes are intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others used to connect board layers, are called [[Via (electronics)|vias]].

When very small vias are required, drilling with mechanical bits is costly because of high rates of wear and breakage. In this case, the vias may be [[laser drilling|laser drilled]]—evaporated by [[laser]]s. Laser-drilled vias typically have an inferior surface finish inside the hole. These holes are called ''micro vias''.  It is also possible with ''controlled-depth'' drilling, laser drilling, or by pre-drilling the individual sheets of the PCB before lamination, to produce holes that connect only some of the copper layers, rather than passing through the entire board. These holes are called ''blind vias'' when they connect an internal copper layer to an outer layer, or ''buried vias'' when they connect two or more internal copper layers and no outer layers.

The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form ''plated-through holes''. These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a ''smear'' of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical ''de-smear'' process, or by ''plasma-etch''. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.

===Plating and coating===
Proper plating or surface finish selection can be critical to process yield, the amount of rework, field failure rate, and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Selecting-a-PCB-Surface-Finish.pdf?t=1509023781105|title=Considerations for Selecting a PCB Surface Finish|last=|first=|date=8 October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs are plated with solder, tin, or gold over nickel and a resist for [[etching]] away the unneeded underlying copper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11515&amp;page=77 Appendix F Sample Fabrication Sequence for a Standard Printed Circuit Board], Linkages: Manufacturing Trends in Electronics Interconnection Technology, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.gov/dfe/pubs/pwb/tech_rep/p2_report/p2_sec3.htm Production Methods and Materials 3.1 General] Printed Wiring Board Project Report – Table of Contents, Design for the Environment (DfE), US EPA&lt;/ref&gt;

After PCBs are etched and then rinsed with water, the solder mask is applied, and then any exposed copper is coated with solder, nickel/gold, or some other anti-corrosion coating.&lt;ref&gt;George Milad and Don Gudeczauskas. "[http://www.uyemura.com/solder-joint-reliability-of-gold-surface-finishes-ENIG-ENEPIG-DIG.htm Solder Joint Reliability of Gold Surface Finishes (ENIG, ENEPIG and DIG) for PWB Assembled with Lead Free SAC Alloy]."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Matte solder is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface for bare copper. Treatments, such as [[benzimidazolethiol]], prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by [[hot air solder levelling]] (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a [[tin]]-[[lead]] alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the [[RoHS]] directive in the [[European Union|EU]], which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60&amp;nbsp;ppm germanium.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

It is important to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is [[ball grid array]] (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free solder paste.

Other platings used are OSP (organic surface protectant), immersion silver ([[IAg]]), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ([[ENIG]]), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ([[ENEPIG]]) and direct [[gold plating]] (over nickel).  [[Edge connector]]s, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then [[gold-plated]]. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.

''Electrochemical migration'' (ECM) is the growth of conductive metal filaments on or in a printed circuit board (PCB) under the influence of a DC voltage bias.&lt;ref&gt;[[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] Publication IPC-TR-476A, "Electrochemical Migration: Electrically Induced Failures in Printed Wiring Assemblies," Northbrook, IL, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.Zhan, M. H. Azarian and M. Pecht, "[https://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/2005/density.htm Reliability Issues of No-Clean Flux Technology with Lead-free Solder Alloy for High Density Printed Circuit Boards]", 38th International Symposium on Microelectronics, pp. 367–375, Philadelphia, PA, September 25–29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver, zinc, and aluminum are known to grow [[Whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] under the influence of an electric field. Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow "whiskers" due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by reducing the percentage of tin. Reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence. Another coating issue is [[tin pest]], the transformation of tin to a powdery  allotrope at low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde F. Coombs ''Printed Circuits Handbook'' McGraw–Hill Professional, 2007 {{ISBN|0-07-146734-3}}, pages 45–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solder resist application===
Areas that should not be soldered may be covered with [[solder mask|solder resist]] (solder mask). One of the most common solder resists used today is called "LPI" ([[liquid photoimageable solder mask]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coates.de/ccp/connections/liquid.pdf|title=liquid photoimageable solder masks|publisher=Coates Circuit Products|accessdate=2 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the PWB, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away.  Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching.  After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and developed as LPI.  Once but no longer commonly used, because of its low accuracy and resolution, is to screen print epoxy ink. In addition to repelling solder, solder resist also provides protection from the environment to the copper that would otherwise be exposed.

===Legend printing===
A legend is often printed on one or both sides of the PCB. It contains the [[Reference designator|component designators]], switch settings, test points and other indications helpful in assembling, testing, servicing, and sometimes using the circuit board.

There are three methods to print the legend.
#[[screen-printing|Silk screen printing]] epoxy ink was the established method. It was so common that legend is often misnamed silk or silkscreen.
#Liquid photo imaging is a more accurate method than screen printing.
#Ink jet printing is new but increasingly used. Ink jet can print variable data, unique to each PWB unit, such as text or a [[bar code]] with a [[serial number]].

===Bare-board test===
Boards with no components installed are usually ''bare-board tested'' for "shorts" and "opens". A short is a connection between two points that should not be connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production, a fixture or a [[rigid needle adapter]] makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production ''[[flying probe]]'' testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system ''instructs'' the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.

===Assembly===
[[File:Testpad.JPG|thumb|PCB with test connection pads]]
In assembly the bare board is populated (or "stuffed") with electronic components to form a functional ''printed circuit assembly'' (PCA), sometimes called a "printed circuit board assembly" (PCBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2008 | title = A Survey of Surface Mount Device Placement Machine Optidmisation: Machine Classification | url = | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 186 | issue = 3| pages = 893–914 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2007.03.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2005 | title = A Triple Objective Function with a Chebychev Dynamic Pick-and-place Point Specification Approach to Optimise the Surface Mount Placement Machine | url = http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gxk/gxk1/../papers/mxaejor2005.pdf| journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 164 | issue = 3| pages = 609–626 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2003.09.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[through-hole technology]], the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive ''pads''; the holes keep the components in place. In [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT), the component is placed on the PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive ''pads'' or ''lands'' on the surfaces of the PCB; solder paste, which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place temporarily; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both through hole and surface mount, the components are then [[soldering|soldered]]; once cooled and solidified, the solder holds the components in place permanently and electrically connects them to the board.

There are a variety of [[soldering]] techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a "Pick and place machine" or [[SMT placement equipment|SMT placement machine]] and bulk wave soldering or [[reflow oven]]s, but skilled technicians are able to hand-solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smta.org/files/smta_techscan_0201_overview.pdf |title=SMTA TechScan Compendium: 0201 Design, Assembly and Process |accessdate=2010-01-11 |last=Borkes |first=Tom |publisher=Surface Mount Technology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a [[microscope]], using tweezers and a fine-tip [[soldering iron]], for small volume prototypes. Some SMT parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as [[ball grid array|BGA]] packages. All through-hole components can be hand soldered, making them favored for prototyping where size, weight, and the use of the exact components that would be used in high volume production are not concerns.

Often, through-hole and surface-mount construction must be combined in a single assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Or, even if all components are available in through-hole packages, it might be desired to take advantage of the size, weight, and cost reductions obtainable by using some available surface-mount devices. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress (such as connectors that are frequently mated and demated or that connect to cables expected to impart substantial stress to the PCB-and-connector interface), while components that are expected to go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques. ''For further comparison, see the [[Surface-mount technology#Advantages|SMT page]].''

After the board has been populated it may be tested in a variety of ways:
* While the power is off, [[visual inspection]], [[automated optical inspection]]. [[JEDEC]] guidelines for PCB component placement, soldering, and inspection are commonly used to maintain [[quality control]] in this stage of PCB manufacturing.
* While the power is off, [[analog signature analysis]], [[power-off testing]].
* While the power is on, [[in-circuit test]], where physical measurements (for example, voltage) can be done.
* While the power is on, [[functional test]], just checking if the PCB does what it had been designed to do.
To facilitate these tests, PCBs may be designed with extra pads to make temporary connections. Sometimes these pads must be isolated with resistors. The in-circuit test may also exercise [[boundary scan]] test features of some components. In-circuit test systems may also be used to program nonvolatile memory components on the board.

In boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs on the board form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) standard. The [[JTAG]] test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes, by using circuitry in the ICs to employ the IC pins themselves as test probes. [[JTAG]] tool vendors provide various types of stimuli and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.

When boards fail the test, technicians may [[desoldering|desolder]] and replace failed components, a task known as ''[[Rework (electronics)|rework]]''.

===Protection and packaging===
PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a [[conformal coating]], which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were [[wax]]; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be [[sputter deposition|sputtered]] onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Shibu | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Intro To Embedded Systems 1E | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill | date = | location = | page = 293 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-07-014589-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many assembled PCBs are [[Electrostatic discharge|static]] sensitive, and therefore they must be placed in [[antistatic bag]]s during transport. When handling these boards, the user must be [[Ground (electricity)|grounded (earthed)]]. Improper handling techniques might transmit an accumulated static charge through the board, damaging or destroying components. The damage might not immediately affect function but might lead to early failure later on, cause intermittent operating faults, or cause a narrowing of the range of environmental and electrical conditions under which the board functions properly. Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive: traces have become so fine that it's quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as [[Multi-Chip Module|MCMs]] and microwave PCBs.

==Cordwood construction==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Cordwoodcircuit.agr.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A cordwood module]]
[[File:MK53 fuze.jpg|thumb|Cordwood construction was used in [[proximity fuze]]s.]]

Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with [[Through-hole technology|wire-ended components]] in applications where space was at a premium (such as [[fuze]]s, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed [[computer]]s, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagner |first=G. Donald |title=History of Electronic Packaging at APL: From the VT Fuze to the NEAR Spacecraft |journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=1999 |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td2001/Wagner.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-19 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special [[nickel]]-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause mechanical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.

Before the advent of [[integrated circuit]]s, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used by a number of computer vendors including [[Control Data Corporation]]. The cordwood method of construction was used only rarely once semiconductor electronics and PCBs became widespread.

==Multiwire boards==
Multiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin). It was used during the 1980s and 1990s. (Kollmorgen Technologies Corp, {{US Patent|4175816}} filed 1978) As of 2010, Multiwire was still available through Hitachi.

Since it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in a straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced [[crosstalk]] (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other&amp;mdash;which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.

Corrections can be made to a Multiwire board more easily than to a PCB.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weisberg.

&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other competitive discrete wiring technologies that have been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11827">'''Project Sherwood''' was the codename for a [[United States]] program in controlled [[nuclear fusion]] during the period it was [[classified information|classified]]. The prospect of turning cheap and inexhaustible hydrogen into inexpensive power captured the imagination of [[Lewis Strauss]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) chairman from 1953 to 1958, who believed fusion reactors could generate electricity "[[too cheap to meter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Richard (1984) ''No Sacrifice Too Great: The Life of Lewis L. Strauss'' University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382 p. 187] {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherwood developed out of a number of ''ad hoc'' efforts dating back to about 1951. Primary among these was the [[stellarator]] program at [[Princeton University]], itself code-named [[Project Matterhorn]]. Since then the weapons labs had clamoured to join the club, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] with its [[z-pinch]] efforts, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]]'s [[magnetic mirror]] program, and later, [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge's]] fuel injector efforts. By 1953 the combined budgets were increasing into the million dollar range, demanding some sort of oversight at the AEC level.

The name "Sherwood" was suggested by Paul McDaniel, Deputy Director of the AEC. He noted that funding for the wartime Hood Building was being dropped and moved to the new program, so they "robbing Hood to pay Friar Tuck", a reference to the British physicist and fusion researcher [[James L. Tuck]]. The connection to [[Robin Hood]] and Friar Tuck gave the project its name.&lt;ref&gt;Bromberg, Joan Lisa (1982) ''Fusion: Science, Politics, and the Invention of a New Energy Source'' MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC&amp;pg=PA97 p. 44], {{ISBN|0-262-02180-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss strongly supported keeping the program secret until pressure from the [[United Kingdom]] led to a declassification effort at the 2nd [[Atoms for Peace]] meeting in the fall of 1958. After this time a number of purely civilian organizations also formed to organize meetings on the topic, with the [[American Physical Society]] organizing meetings under their Division of Plasma Physics. These meetings have been carried on to this day and were renamed International Sherwood Fusion Theory Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherwoodtheory.org/history.php# |title= Project Sherwood and the origin of the annual Sherwood Fusion Theory Conference |website=Sherwood Fusion History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Project Sherwood became simply the '''Controlled Thermonuclear Research''' program within the AEC and it's follow-on organizations.

==Designs and concepts==
Research centered on three plasma confinement designs; the [[stellarator]] headed by [[Lyman Spitzer]] at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], the toroidal pinch or [[Perhapsatron]] led by [[James L. Tuck|James Tuck]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the [[magnetic mirror]] devices at the [[Livermore National Laboratory]] led by [[Richard F. Post]]. By June, 1954 a preliminary study had been completed for a full scale "Model D" stellarator that would be over {{convert|500|ft}} long and produce 5,000 MW of electricity at a capital cost of $209 per kilowatt.&lt;ref&gt;Bromberg, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, each concept encountered unanticipated problems, in the form of plasma instabilities that prevented the requisite temperatures and pressures from being achieved, and it eventually became clear that sustained hydrogen fusion would not be developed quickly. Strauss left AEC in 1958 and his successor did not share Strauss' enthusiasm for fusion research. Consequently, Project Sherwood was relegated from a crash program to one that concentrated on basic research.

==Budget==
The funding for Project Sherwood began with the closure of another program named [[Project Lincoln]] at the Hood Laboratory.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clery|first1=Daniel|title=A Piece of the Sun: The Quest for Fusion Energy|date=2014|publisher=The Overlook Press|isbn=978-1468308891|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGcjCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of people working on the projects grew, so did the budget. Under Strauss the program was reorganized, and its funding and staffing increased dramatically. From early 1954 to 1955, the number of people working on Project Sherwood grew from 45 to 110.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; By the next year, that number had doubled. The original budget from the shut down of Project Lincoln was $1 million.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The breakdown of the year budget from 1951 to 1957 can be seen in the table below. At its peak, Project Sherwood had a budget of $23 million per year and retained more than 500 scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declassification of Project Sherwood==
The declassification of the program was a large topic of discussion between scientists at all of the laboratories involved with the project and at the [[Sherwood conferences]]. The reasoning for an initial high classification status was that if the research into [[controlled fusion]] were to be successful then it would be a significant advantage in regards to military aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9781258905354|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it came to the point that the research needed to be industrialized. Some of this work could be conducted without access to the classified information; however, there were some instances where the classified information of the program was a necessity for those people working on projects such as the large-scale [[stellarator]], the ultra-high vacua, and the problem of energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9781258905354|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, there was a contract with the Commission that the information that was being used would only be shared with the personnel that was directly working on the project. It soon became apparent that industrial companies were expected to become highly invested in the area of fission and because of this it began clear that these companies should have full access to the research information obtained by Project Sherwood. In June 1956, permits for the research information from Project Sherwood became available through the Commission for companies that were qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9781258905354|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, between 1955 and 1958, information became more and more available to the public with its gradual declassification beginning with the sharing of information with the [[United Kingdom]]. Huge supporters of declassification of the program included the director of the Division of Research, Thomas Johnson, and a member of his staff, [[Amasa Bishop]]. Some of their reasoning for wanting declassification was that the secrecy of the project could negatively impact their ability to enlist and employ experienced personnel to the program.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bromberg|first1=Joan Lisa|title=Fusion: Science, Politics, and the Invention of a New Energy Source|date=1985|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262521062|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The also argued that it would change the way their conferences could be held. The scientists working on the project would be able to freely discuss their findings with others in the scientific community rather than only the scientists working on the same project.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; By May 1958, basic information about the various projects within Project Sherwood including the [[stellarator]], [[magnetic mirrors]], and [[molecular ion beams]] had been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9781258905354|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of other programs in controlled fusion==
===Oak Ridge National Laboratory===

In the early 1950s, [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] was composed of a small group of scientists that were mostly experienced with research in [[ion-source technology]]. However, research from Project Sherwood was a growing area of interest, and the researchers at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] wanted to participate in the discovery of controlled fusion. They studied areas of controlled fusion such as the rate of plasma diffusion in a magnetic field and the charge-exchange process. However, their work with ion-source was still a large part of their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780201005752|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of California===

Although there was already a main project ([[magnetic mirror]]) at the University of California, a scientist named [[W. R. Baker]] began his research into the pinch effect at UCRL, Berkeley in 1952. Two years later, S. Colgate began research on [[shock-heating]] at UCRL, Livermore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780201005752|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tufts College, Medford===

There was another small group of scientists at [[Tufts College]] in Medford, Massachusetts that had become involved in the research of the pinch effect. Although their work was not an official part of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], some of their personnel did attended the [[Sherwood conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780201005752|pages=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York University===

In 1954, there was a program started at [[New York University]] called the Division of Research. It was a small program that included personnel from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Amasa|title=Project Sherwood; the U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion|date=1958|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780201005752|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6195">'''Schuler tuning''' is a design principle for [[inertial navigation system]]s that accounts for the curvature of the Earth.  An inertial navigation system, used in submarines, ships, aircraft, and other vehicles to keep track of position, determines directions with respect to three [[Coordinate axis|axes]] pointing "north", "east", and "down".  To detect the vehicle's orientation, the system contains an "[[inertial platform]]" mounted on [[gimbal]]s, with [[gyroscope]]s that detect motion connected to a [[servo system]] to keep it pointing in a fixed orientation in space.  However, the directions "north", "east" and "down" change as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.  Schuler tuning describes the conditions necessary for an inertial navigation system to keep the inertial platform always pointing "north", "east" and "down", so it gives correct directions on the near-spherical Earth. It is widely used in electronic control systems.

==Principle==
As first explained by German engineer [[Maximilian Schuler]] in a 1923 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[pendulum]] whose period exactly equals the [[orbit]]al period of a hypothetical [[satellite]] orbiting just above the surface of the [[Earth]] (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the Earth when its support is suddenly displaced.  Such a pendulum would have a length equal to the radius of the Earth.  Consider a [[simple gravity pendulum]], whose length equals the [[radius]] of the Earth, suspended in a uniform gravitational field of the same strength as that experienced at the Earth's surface.  If suspended from the surface of the Earth, the bob of the pendulum would be at the center of the Earth.  If it is hanging motionless and its support is moved sideways, the bob tends to remain motionless, so the pendulum always points at the center of the Earth.  If such a pendulum were attached to the inertial platform of an inertial navigation system, the platform would remain level, facing "north", "east" and "down", as it was moved about on the surface of the Earth.

A rigid pendulum may also be made to have the required period, with a pivot near its [[center of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://accessscience.com/content/Schuler-pendulum/606900 Schuler Pendulum] by Robert H. Cannon, Accessscience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schuler period''' can be derived from the classic formula for the period of a [[pendulum]]:
:&lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{L}{g} \approx 2\pi \sqrt\frac{6378100}{9.81} \approx 5066 \ \text{seconds} \approx 84.4 \ \text{minutes}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''L''''' is the radius of the earth in meters and '''''g''''' is the local [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] in [[metres per second per second]].

==Application==
A pendulum the length of the Earth's radius is impractical, so Schuler tuning doesn't use physical pendulums. Instead, the electronic control system of the [[inertial navigation system]] is modified to make the platform behave as if it were attached to a pendulum.   The inertial platform is mounted on [[gimbal]]s, and an [[Electronics|electronic]] [[control system]] keeps it pointed in a constant direction with respect to the three axes.  As the vehicle moves, the gyroscopes detect changes in orientation, and a [[feedback loop]] applies signals to torquers to rotate the platform on its gimbals to keep it pointed along the axes.  

To implement Schuler tuning, the feedback loop is modified to tilt the platform as the vehicle moves in the north-south and east-west directions, to keep the platform facing "down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = v/R&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = a/R&lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration ''a'' is a combination of the actual vehicle acceleration and the acceleration due to gravity acting on the tilting inertial platform. It can be measured by an accelerometer mounted fixed on the platform, in either the north-south or east west direction, horizontally.  So this equation can be seen as a version of the equation for a simple gravity [[pendulum]] with a length equal to the radius of the Earth.  The inertial platform acts as if it were attached to such a pendulum.

Schuler's time constant has other applications. Suppose a tunnel is dug from one end of the Earth to the other end straight through its center.  A stone dropped in such a tunnel oscillates harmonically with Schuler's time constant. It can also be proved that the time is the same constant for a tunnel that is not through the center of Earth. Such a tunnel has to be an Earth-centered ellipse, the same shape as the path of the stone. These thought experiments (or rather the results of the corresponding calculations) rely on an assumption of uniform density throughout the Earth. Since the density is not actually uniform, the "true" periods would deviate from Schuler's time constant.

[[Image:Automatic Soap Dispenser.JPG|thumb|right|Automatic soap dispenser]]
[[Image:Benutzung eines Seifenspenders.gif|thumb|Using a soap dispenser]]
A '''soap dispenser''' is a device that, when manipulated or triggered appropriately, dispenses [[soap]] (usually in small, single-use quantities). It can be manually operated by means of a [[handle (grip)|handle]], or can be automatic. Soap dispensers are often found in [[public toilet]]s.

==Design==

===Manual soap dispensers===
The design of a manual soap dispenser is generally determined by whether the soap comes in liquid, powder, or foam form.

When soap is dispensed in liquid form, it is generally in a [[squeeze bottle]] or [[pump]]. The most popular soap dispensers of this type are plastic pump bottles, many of which are disposable.

William Shepphard patented [[liquid soap]] on August 22, 1865. Minnetonka Corporation introduced the first modern liquid soap and cornered the market by buying up the entire supply of the plastic pumps needed for the liquid soap dispensers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsoap.htm|title=The History of Soap and Detergent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensers of powder soaps, such as [[borax]], often take the form of a metal box with a weighted lever; when the lever is pressed, a handful of soap is released.

Manual dispensers of foam soap often consist of a large [[Push-button|button]] which squeezes the foam out of a tube. Many liquid soap dispensers operate in this way as well. A few dispensers operate with a lever that pulls forward and squeezes the soap out.

The majority of manual foam soap dispensers have the soap in a bladder in the dispenser in liquid form, as the pump is pressed the liquid soap is pushed through a small foaming nozzle which foams the soap.

===Automatic soap dispensers===
{{main|Automatic soap dispenser}}

An automatic soap dispenser is specifically a hands-free dispenser of [[soap]] (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally can be used for other liquids such as [[hand sanitizer]]s, [[shampoo]]s, or hand lotions. Automatic dispensers are often [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor [[motion detector|detects motion]] under the nozzle. The electronic components of an automatic soap dispenser allow for a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not.

Hands-free dispensers for water and soap/hand sanitizer have particular virtues for operating theatres and treatment rooms.

===Foam soap dispensers===
Foam soap dispensers have dual pumps that when used move both air and soap, injecting both together through small openings to create a lather. They can be found in both manual and automatic varieties.

'''Sondor''' is a manufacturer of [[Audio-visual | Audio]] [[Video]] equipment located in [[Zollikon]], [[Switzerland]] until 2017. 
Sondor was founded in 1952 by Willy Hungerbuehler. Sondor started as a manufacturer of [[16 mm film]] and [[35 mm film]] [[Movie_projector#Sound| magnetic]] film equipment. They are noted as inventing the standard for bi-phase interlocking pulse signals to [[Sync_sound | sync]] [[Sound_recording_and_reproduction#Magnetic_tape | sound]] to film. Sondor added a film transport [[telecine]] to it line of film [[sound]] equipment. Sondor products are found in many in [[post-production]] studios for [[Recording_head | record]] and playback and in [[movie theater]] for sound playback. [[History_of_sound_recording#Magnetic_recording | playback]].

Sondor film transport telecines uses a spinning [[prism]] telecine, like the model NOVA and ALTRA. 

Some [[Soundtrack | Sound]] Film followers player-recorder are the: OMA E and BASIC.
SOUNDHOUSE is a product to add sound pick up to other telecines, like the [[Spirit DataCine]].

The other major maker of sound followers is Magna Tech.
[[DAT recorder]]s and [[Direct to disk recording]] have replaced much of the work done on separate film sound followers.

On December 9, 2016 [[Digital Film Technology]] (dft), completed the acquisition of Sondor. DFT is the maker of the [[Scanity]] film scanner. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft-film.com/news-releases/dft-acquires-sondor-technology.html#sthash.Amy29IbO.dpuf Digital Film Technology, Press release, December 9, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spin disk''' is an [[socket wrench]] accessory used to quickly turn [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]s after they have been loosened with the wrench.

Spin disks are usually a flat round disk, commonly of plastic, with a square hole in the middle to fit over the socket wrench's male adapter plug. The edges are grooved for a solid grip.

Using the spin disk will be much quicker than using the socket wrench's handle, especially if its range of motion is limited. If the nut is very loose, just using ones fingers may be the best option.

[[Category:Tools]]

Since this accessory can easily be lost or fall off during use, many manufacturers forgo the spinner accessory in favor of grooving placed directly on the sockets themselves to aid finger operation.

A '''steam car''' is a [[automobile|car (automobile)]] powered by a [[steam engine]].{{efn|A [[car]] is defined as a wheeled, self-powered [[motor vehicle]] used for [[transportation]] and a product of the [[automotive industry]]. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with [[tyre (wheel)|tyres]], and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pocket Oxford Dictionary |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0198611134 |editor-last=Fowler |editor-first=H.W. |editor-last2=Fowler |editor-first2=F.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A [[steam engine]] is an [[external combustion engine]] (ECE) where the fuel is combusted away from the engine, as opposed to an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) where the fuel is combusted within the engine. ECEs have a lower thermal efficiency, but it is easier to regulate carbon monoxide production.

The first steam powered vehicle was supposedly built in 1672 by [[Ferdinand Verbiest]], a Flemish Jesuit in China. The vehicle was a toy for the Chinese Emperor. While not intended to carry passengers, and therefore not exactly a "car", Verbiest's device is likely to be the first ever engine-powered vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web |url=http://curiousexpeditions.org/?p=52 |title=Short Biography |accessdate=2018-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403101111/http://curiousexpeditions.org/?p=52 |archivedate=2008-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first real experimental steam powered cars were built in the late 18th and 19th centuries, but it was not until after [[Richard Trevithick]] had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. By the 1850s it was viable to produce them commercially: steam road vehicles were used for many applications.

Development was hampered by adverse legislation from the 1830s and then the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology in the 1900s, leading to their commercial demise. Relatively few steam powered vehicles remained in use after the [[Second World War]]. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation.

The search for renewable energy sources has led to an occasional resurgence of interest in using steam power for road vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:1924Stanley740-boiler.jpg|thumb|Boiler in a 1924 Stanley Steamer Serie 740. To the right is the condenser]]
A [[steam engine]] is an [[external combustion engine]] (ECE:&amp;nbsp;the fuel is combusted away from the engine), as opposed to an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE:&amp;nbsp;the fuel is combusted within the engine). While gasoline-powered ICE cars have an operational [[thermal efficiency]] of 15% to 30%, early automotive steam units were capable of only about half this efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} A significant benefit of the ECE is that the fuel burner can be configured for very low emissions of [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and unburned [[carbon]] in the exhaust, thus avoiding pollution.

The greatest technical challenges to the steam car have focused on its [[steam boiler|boiler]]. This represents much of the total mass of the vehicle, making the car heavy (an internal combustion-engined car requires no boiler), and requires careful attention from the driver, although even the cars of 1900 had considerable automation to manage this. The single largest restriction is the need to supply feedwater to the boiler. This must either be carried and frequently replenished, or the car must also be fitted with a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], a further weight and inconvenience.

Steam-powered and [[electric cars]] outsold gasoline-powered ones in many US states prior to the invention of the [[electric starter]], since internal combustion cars relied on a hand crank to start the engine, which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator. Electric cars were popular to some extent, but had a short range, and could not be charged on the road if the [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] ran low.

Early steam cars, once working pressure was attained, could be instantly driven off with high acceleration; but they typically take several minutes to start from cold, plus time to get the burner to [[operating temperature]]. To overcome this, development has been directed toward [[flash boiler]]s, which heat a much smaller quantity of water to get the vehicle started, and, in the case of Doble cars, spark ignition diesel burners.

The steam car does have advantages over internal combustion-powered cars, although most of these are now less important than in the early 20th century. The engine (excluding the boiler) is smaller and lighter than an internal combustion engine. It is also better suited to the speed and torque characteristics of the axle, thus avoiding the need for the heavy and complex transmission required for an internal combustion engine. The car is also quieter, even without a [[muffler|silencer]].

A [[French people|French]] [[inventor]], [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]], built the first working self-propelled land-based mechanical vehicle. There is an unsubstantiated story that a pair of Yorkshiremen, engineer Robert Fourness and his cousin, physician James Ashworth had a steam carriage running in 1788, after being granted a British Patent, No.1674 of December 1788. An illustration of it even appeared in [[Hergé]]'s book ''Tintin raconte l'Histoire de l'Automobile'' (Casterman, 1953). The first substantiated steam carriage for personal use was that of [[Josef Božek]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntm.cz/ntext/ak-42-b.htm |title=Short Biography |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124040052/http://www.ntm.cz/ntext/ak-42-b.htm |archivedate=2005-11-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]] of Massachusetts in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.forgeofinnovation.org/Springfield_Armory_1812-1865/Chronology/nonFlash.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over thirty years passed before there was a flurry of steam cars from 1859 onwards with [[Dudgeon (steam automobile company)|Dugeon]], [[Sylvester H. Roper|Roper]] and [[Christopher Miner Spencer|Spenser]] from the United States, [[Rickett (car)|Thomes Rickett]], Austin, Catley and Ayres from England, and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] from Italy being the earliest. Others followed with the first Canadian, [[Henry Seth Taylor steam buggy|Henry Taylor]] in 1867, [[Amédée Bollée]] and Louis Lejeune of France in 1878, and Rene Thury of Switzerland in 1879.

The 1880s saw the rise of the first larger scale manufacturers, particularly in France, the first being Bollée (1878) followed by [[De Dion-Bouton]] (1883), Whitney of East Boston (1885), [[Ransom E. Olds]] (1886), [[Serpollet]] (1887), and [[Peugeot]] (1889).

This early period also saw the first repossession of an automobile in 1867 and the first getaway car the same year - both by Francis Curtis of Newburyport, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=EarlyAmerican&gt;http://www.earlyamericanautomobiles.com/americanautomobiles2.htm retrieved 3 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890s commercial manufacture ===
The 1890s were dominated by the formation of numerous car manufacturing companies. The internal combustion engine was in its infancy, whereas steam power was well established. Electric powered cars were becoming available but suffered from their inability to travel longer distances.

The majority of steam powered car manufacturers from this period were from the United States. The more notable of these were Clark from 1895 to 1909, [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]] from 1899 to 1903 when it switched to gaosoline engines, and [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley]] from 1897 to 1924. As well as England and France, other countries also made attempts to manufacture steam cars: Cederholm of Sweden (1892), Malevez of Belgium (1898-1905), Schöche of Germany (1895), and Herbert Thomson of Australia (1896-1901)
   
Of all the new manufacturers from the 1890s, only four continued to make steam cars after 1910. They were Stanley (to 1924) and Waverley (to 1916) of the United States, Buard of France (to 1914), and Miesse of Belgium (to 1926).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===  Volume production 1900 to 1913 ===
{{details|List of steam car makers}}
There were a large number of new companies formed in the period from 1898 to 1905. Steam cars outnumbered other forms of propulsion among very early cars. In the U.S. in 1902, 485 of 909 new car registrations were steamers.&lt;ref name=Georgano/&gt; From 1899, [[Mobile Company of America|Mobile]] had ten branches and 58 dealers across the U.S. The center of U.S. steamer production was [[New England]], where 38 of the 84 manufacturers were located. Examples include [[White Motor Company|White]] ([[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]), [[Eclipse Automobile Company|Eclipse]] ([[Easton, Massachusetts]]), [[Cotta (steam car)|Cotta]] ([[Lanark, Illinois]]), [[Crouch (automobile)|Crouch]] ([[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]]), [[Hood Steamer|Hood]] ([[Danvers, Massachusetts]]; lasted just one month), [[Kidder (steam car)|Kidder]] ([[New Haven, Connecticut]]), [[Century Motor Vehicle Company|Century]] ([[Syracuse, New York]]), and [[J. W. Skene Cycle and Automobile Company|Skene]] ([[Lewiston, Maine]]; the company built everything but the tires). By 1903, 43 of them were gone and by the end of 1910 of those companies that were started in the decade those left were [[White Motor Company|White]] which lasted to 1911, Conrad which lasted to 1924, Turner-Miesse of England which lasted to 1913, Morriss to 1912, Doble to 1930, Rutherford to 1912, and Pearson-Cox to 1916. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Assembly-line mass production by [[Henry Ford]] dramatically reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car's demise as the [[Model T]] was both cheap and reliable. Additionally, during the 'heyday' of steam cars, the internal combustion engine made steady gains in efficiency, matching and then surpassing the efficiency of a steam engine when the weight of a boiler is factored in.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Decline 1914 to 1939 ===
With the introduction of the [[electric starter]], the internal combustion engine became more popular than steam, but the internal combustion engine was not necessarily superior in performance, range, fuel economy and emissions. Some steam enthusiasts feel steam has not received its share of attention in the field of automobile efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apart from Brooks of Canada, all the steam car manufacturers that commenced between 1916 and 1926 were in the United States. Endurance (1924-1925) were the last steam car manufacturer to commence operations. American/Derr continued retrofitting production cars of various makes with steam engines, and Doble was the last steam car manufacturer. They ceased business in 1930.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Resurgence - enthusiasts, air pollution, and fuel crises ==
{{See also|Paxton Phoenix}}
From the 1940s onward, various steam cars were constructed, usually by enthusiasts. Among those mentioned were Charles Keen, Cal Williams' 1950 Ford Conversion, Forrest R Detrick's 1957 Detrick S-101 prototype, and Harry Peterson's Stanley powered Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamautomobile.com/ForuM/report.php?1,8548 Steam Lore], Stanley W Ellis, The Bulb Horn, Vol. 18 No. 4, October 1957, Veteran Motor Car Club of America. Retrieved June 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Detrick was constructed by Detrick, William H Mehrling, and Lee Gaeke who designed the engine based on a Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All steamed up to save gas |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/605434/|newspaper=The Austin Daily Herald|date=January 31, 1958|page=22|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 23, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanleyregister.net/tours/1957Kent.html|title=Stanley Register Online - 1957 Kent Meet|author=|date=|website=www.stanleyregister.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Keen began constructing a steam car in 1940 with the intention of restarting steam car manufacturing. Keen's family had a long history of involvement with steam propulsion going back to his great-great-grandfather in the 1830s, who helped build early steam locomotives. His first car, a [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth Coupe]], used a [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley]] engine. In 1948 and 1949, Keen employed [[Abner Doble]] to create a more powerful steam engine, a v4. He used this in [[La Dawri]] Victress S4 bodied sports car. Both these cars are still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Keen and his steamliners, The Steam Automobile, Vol 7 No 2, Summer 1965, p20&lt;/ref&gt; Keen died in 1969 before completing a further car. His papers and patterns were destroyed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steamautomobile.com/ForuM/read.php?1,15914&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the only manufacturer to investigate steam cars was Paxton. Abner Doble developed the [[Doble Steam Car|Doble Ultimax]] engine for the [[Paxton Phoenix]] steam car, built by the Paxton Engineering Division of [[McCulloch (company)|McCulloch Motors Corporation]], Los Angeles. The engine's sustained maximum power was {{convert|120|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A Ford Coupe was used as a test-bed for the engine.&lt;ref&gt;A Modern Automotive Steam Power Plant Part IV—James L. Dooley, Vice President, McCulloch Corp, The Steam Automobile, Vol 5 No 3, 1963, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The project was eventually dropped in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1957, Williams Engine Company Incorporated of Ambler began offering steam engine conversions for existing production cars. When air pollution became a significant issue for California in the mid-1960s the state encouraged investigation into the use of steam-powered cars. The fuel crises of the early 1970s prompted further work. None of this resulted in renewed steam car manufacturing.

Steam cars remain the domain of enthusiasts, occasional experimentation by manufacturers, and those wishing to establish steam-powered land speed records.

=== Impact of Californian legislation ===
In 1967, California established the [[California Air Resources Board]] and began to implement legislation to dramatically reduce exhaust emissions. This prompted renewed interest in alternative fuels for motor vehicles and a resurgence of interest in steam-powered cars in the state.

The idea for having patrol cars fitted with steam engines stemmed from an informal meeting in March 1968 of members of the California Assembly Transportation Committee. In the discussion, Karsten Vieg, a lawyer attached to the Committee, suggested that six cars be fitted with steam engines for testing by California District Police Chiefs. A bill was passed by the legislature to fund the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Birth of the Steam Bus, S S Mine, The Steam Automobile, Vol 13 No 4, 1971, Chicargo, Illinous, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the [[California Highway Patrol]] initiated the project under Inspector David S Luethje to investigate the feasibility of using steam engined cars. Initially General Motors had agreed to pay a selected vendor $20,000 toward the cost of developing an [[Rankine cycle]] engine, and up to $100,000 for outfitting six [[Oldsmobile 88#1965–1970|Oldsmobile Delmont 88]]s as operational patrol vehicles. This deal fell through because the Rankine engine manufacturers rejected the General Motors offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1441_03.sgml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723090327/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1441_03.sgml |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was revised and two 1969 [[Dodge Polara]]s were to be retrofitted with steam engines for testing. One car was to be modified by Don Johnson of Thermodynamic Systems Inc. and the other by industrialist [[Bill Lear|William P Lear]]'s Lear Motors Incorporated. At the time, the [[California State Legislature]] was introducing strict pollution control regulations for automobiles and the Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee, [[John Francis Foran]], was supportive of the idea. The Committee also was proposing to test four steam-powered buses in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area that year.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Don C Woodward, The Deseret News, 17 September 1969, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of a Polara, Thermodynamic Systems (later called General Steam Corp), was given a late-model Oldsmobile Delmont 88. Lear was given a Polara but it does not appear to have been built. Both firms were given 6 months to complete their projects with Lear's being due for completion on 1 August 1969. Neither car had been completed by the due date and in November 1969, Lear was reported as saying the car would be ready in 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;Article, The Tuscaloosa News, 19 November 1969, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lear's only known retrofit was a [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] unrelated to the project. As for the project, it seems to have never been completed, with Lear pulling out by December.&lt;ref&gt;Steam Powered Car Tesing to Begin, St Petersburg Times, 28 July 1969, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article, Reading Eagle, 27 February 1969, page 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2011/06/07/gettin-steamed-on-the-bus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steam car fizzles |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/65818371/|newspaper=Wilmington News Journal|date=December 19, 1969|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the [[National Air Pollution Control Administration]] announced a competition for a contract to design a practical passenger-car steam engine. Five firms entered. They were the consortium of Planning Research Corporation and STP Corporation; [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], Columbus, Ohio; [[Continental Motors Corporation]], Detroit; Vought Aeronautical Division of [[Ling-Temco-Vought]], Dallas; and [[Thermo Electron]] Corporation, [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Anti-pollution efforts revive interest in steamers, The Sunday News and Tribune, 24 August 1969, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors introduced two experimental steam-powered cars in 1969. One was the SE 124 based on a converted [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] and the other was designated SE 101 based on the [[Pontiac Grand Prix#Second generation (1969–1972)|Pontiac Grand Prix]].  The '''SE 124''' had its standard gasoline engine replaced with a 50&amp;nbsp;hp power [[Doble steam car#Besler Brothers|Besler steam engine]] V4, using the 1920 Doble patents; the '''SE 101''' was fitted with a 160&amp;nbsp;hp steam engine developed by GM Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "GM Takes Its Wraps Off Its Steam Cars."] ''Popular Science'', July 1969, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Power was transferred via a Toric automatic gearbox. The results was disappointing. The steam engine was heavy and weighted 300 kg more than a standard V8 and gave about half the power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Carlsson |first=Mårten |date=2018-05-29 |title=Fullt tryck i Grand Prix 1969 |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/reportage/fullt-tryck-i-grand-prix-1969 |magazine=Klassiker |access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]] put out a challenge for a race August 1970 from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to [[Pasadena, California]] for any college that wanted to participate in. The race was open for electric, steam, turbine power, and internal combustion engines: liquid-fueled, gaseous-fueled engines, and hybrids.&lt;ref name=Hemmings&gt;http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/tag/steam/#sthash.PlXh9JwT.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Two steam-powered cars entered the race. [[University of California, San Diego]]'s modified [[AMC Javelin]] and [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]'s converted 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] called the ''tea kettle''.&lt;ref name=Hemmings /&gt; Both dropped out on the second day of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steam cars drop out of "clean" race |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/69981140/|newspaper=Bevidere Daily Republican|date=August 25, 1970|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Assembly passed legislation in 1972 to contract two companies to develop steam-powered cars. They were [[Aerojet|Aerojet Liquid Rocket Company]] of [[Sacramento]] and [[Steam Power Systems]] of San Diego. Aerojet installed a steam turbine into a [[Chevrolet Vega]], while Steam Power Systems built the Dutcher, a car named after the company's founder, Cornelius Dutcher. Both cars were tested by 1974 but neither car went into production.  The Dutcher is on display at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jimsgarage.wordpress.com/2007/06/26/on-the-road-peterson-museum/ On the Road – Peterson Museum], June 26, 2007, retrieved 25 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indy Cars ====
Both Johnson and Lear had contemplated constructing steam-powered cars for the [[Indy 500]], Johnson first in the early 1960s when with Controlled Steam Dynamics and in 1968 with Thermodynamic Systems and Lear in 1969. A third steam racing car was contemplated by a consortium of Planning Research Corporation and [[Andy Granatelli]] of [[STP (motor oil company)|STP Corporation]]. Lear proceeded with the idea and constructed a car, but ran out of funds while trying to develop the engine. The car is thought to be at the [[National Automobile and Truck Museum of the United States]] in [[Auburn, Indiana]]. Johnson was also noted as working on a steam-powered helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;Article, Arizona Republic, 9 March 1969, Page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

William D Thompson, 69-year-old retired San Diego automotive engineer, also announced he planned to enter a steam-powered race car. Thompson was working on a $35,000 steam-powered luxury car and he intended to use the car's engine in the race car. He had claimed that he had almost 250 orders for his cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wayne Panter - Steam, electric auto era looms, sometime |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/19980669/|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|date=January 23, 1969|page=67|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]]s cost about $17,000 at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate seeks answers to auto repair riddles |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/58206838//|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph|date=January 1, 1969|page=52|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saab steam car and Ranotor====
As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]] started a project in 1974 [http://www.saabhistory.com/2008/04/04/the-nine-cylinder-saab-steam-engine/] codenamed ULF (short for utan luftföroreningar, Swedish for Without Air Pollution))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamautomobile.com/archivepdf/SAv18n1.CV01.pdf The Steam Automobile: Is The Steam Engine the Prime Mover of the Future?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509004122/http://www.steamautomobile.com/archivepdf/SAv18n1.CV01.pdf |date=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Dr. Ove Platell&lt;ref name=teknikensvarld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikensvarld.se/2008/01/31/3755/anghybridmotorn-kan-snart-vara-har/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418142858/http://www.teknikensvarld.se/2008/01/31/3755/anghybridmotorn-kan-snart-vara-har/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-18|title=Teknikens Värld: Ånghybridmotorn kan snart vara här|author=|date=|website=teknikensvarld.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made a prototype steam-powered car.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The engine used an electronically controlled 28-pound multi-parallel-circuit steam generator with 1-millimeter-bore tubing and 16&amp;nbsp;gallons per hour firing rate which was intended to produce {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of continuous power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=N93SwXbzXC4C&amp;pg=62|title=Popular Science Archive|author=|date=|website=popsci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was about the same size as a standard car battery. Lengthy start-up times were avoided by using air compressed and stored when the car was running to power the car upon starting until adequate steam pressure was built up. The engine used a conical rotary valve made from pure [[boron nitride]]. To conserve water, a hermetically sealed water system was used.

The project was cancelled and the project engineer, Ove Platell, started a company, Ranotor, with his son Peter Platell to continue its development. Ranotor is developing a steam hybrid that uses the exhaust heat from an ordinary petrol engine to power a small steam engine, with the aim of reducing fuel consumption by 20%.&lt;ref name=teknikensvarld/&gt; In 2008, truck manufacturers [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Volvo]] were said to be interested in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicgreen.net/startups/article/ranotor-develop-steam-engine-powered-hybrid-trucks-together-scania-and-volv|title=Maintenance Mode|author=|date=|website=www.nordicgreen.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pelland Steamer====
{{Main article|Pellandini Cars}}
In 1974, the British designer [[Peter Pellandine]] produced the first [[Pellandini Cars|Pelland Steamer]] for a contract with the South Australian Government. It had a fibreglass monocoque chassis (based on the internal combustion-engined Pelland Sports) and used a twin-cylinder double-acting compound engine. It has been preserved at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood, South Australia.

In 1977, the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built, this time by [[Pelland Engineering]] in the UK. It had a three-cylinder double-acting engine in a 'broad-arrow' configuration, mounted in a tubular steel chassis with a [[Kevlar]] body, giving a gross weight of just {{convert|1050|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance. It had huge torque ({{convert|1100|ft·lbf|N.m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) at zero engine revs, and could accelerate from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 8 seconds{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

Pellandine made several attempts to break the land speed record for steam power, but was thwarted by technical issues.{{specify|date=November 2011}} Pellandine moved back to Australia in the 1990s where he continued to develop the Steamer. The latest version is the Mark IV.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

====Enginion Steamcell====
From 1996, a R&amp;D subsidiary of the Volkswagen group called Enginion AG was developing a system called ZEE (Zero Emissions Engine). It produced steam almost instantly without an open flame, and took 30 seconds to reach maximum power from a cold start. Their third prototype, EZEE03, was a three-cylinder unit meant to fit in a [[Škoda Fabia]] automobile. The EZEE03 was described as having a "two-stroke" (i.e. single-acting) engine of {{convert|1000|cc|cuin|abbr=on|lk=on}} displacement, producing up to {{convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|500|N·m|ft·lbf|0|abbr=on|disp=or|lk=on}}).{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhaust emissions were said to be far below the [[SULEV]] standard. It had an oilless engine with ceramic cylinder linings using steam instead of oil as a lubricant. However, Enginion found that the market was not ready for steam cars, so they opted instead to develop the [[Advanced steam technology#Small-scale stationary plant|Steamcell]] power generator/heating system based on similar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Notable manufacturers==

=== Cederholm brothers ===
In 1892, painter Jöns Cederholm and his brother, André, a blacksmith, designed their first steam car, a two-seater, introducing a [[steam locomotive condensing apparatus|condenser]] in 1894. They planned to use it for transportation between their home in [[Ystad]] and their summer house outside town. Unfortunately the automobile was destroyed in Sweden's first [[automobile accident]] but the Cederholm brothers soon built a second, improved version of their steam car reusing many parts from the first one.&lt;ref name="Georgano" &gt;{{cite book

=== Locomobile Runabout ===
[[File:Steam car "engine".jpg|thumb|250px|right|The engine of a modern [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]] steam car]]
{{Main article|Locomobile Company of America}}
What is considered by many to be the first marketable popular steam car appeared in 1899 from the [[Locomobile Company of America]], located in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], and from 1900 in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Locomobile manufactured several thousand of its ''Runabout'' model in the period 1899-1903, designed around a motor design leased from the [[Stanley Steamer Company]]. The company ceased producing steam cars in 1903 and changed to limited-production, internal combustion powered luxury automobiles. In 1922, it was acquired by [[Durant Motors]] and discontinued with the failure of the parent company in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Kimes |editor-first=Beverly Rae |editor-link=Beverly Rae Kimes |last=Clark |first=Henry Austin, Jr. |title=The Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1805-1942 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Krause Publications]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-87341-111-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stanley Steamer ===
{{Main article|Stanley Steamer}}
[[File:Cars-stanleysteamcar-amoswolfe.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stanley steam car, (1923)]]
Perhaps the best-known and best-selling steam car was the Stanley Steamer, produced from 1896 to 1924. Between 1899 and 1905, Stanley outsold all gasoline-powered cars, and was second only to the electric cars of the [[Columbia Automobile Company]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Georgano" /&gt; It used a compact [[fire-tube boiler]] to power a simple double-acting two-cylinder engine. Because of the phenomenal [[torque]] available at all engine speeds, the steam car's engine was typically geared directly to the rear axle, with no [[clutch]] or variable speed transmission required. Until 1914, Stanley steam cars vented their exhaust steam directly to the atmosphere, necessitating frequent refilling of the water tank; after 1914, all Stanleys were fitted with a [[Steam locomotive condensing apparatus|condenser]], which considerably reduced their water consumption.

In 1906, the [[Land Speed Record]] was broken by a Stanley steam car, piloted by [[Fred Marriott]], which achieved {{convert|127|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at [[Ormond Beach, Florida]]. This annual week-long "Speed Week" was the forerunner of today's [[Daytona 500]]. This record was not exceeded by any car until 1910.

=== Doble Steam Car ===
{{Main article|Doble steam car}}
[[File:1924 Doble Model E at Henry Ford Museum.jpg|250px|right|thumb|1924 Doble Model E]]
Attempts were made to bring more advanced steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the [[Doble Steam Car]]&lt;ref name="Walton, LSP, Doble" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient monotube steam generator to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923, [[Abner Doble|Doble's]] steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40&amp;nbsp;seconds or less. When the boiler had achieved maximum working pressure, the burner would cut out until pressure had fallen to a minimum level, whereupon it would re-ignite; by this means the car could achieve around 15&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon (18.8&amp;nbsp;litres/100&amp;nbsp;km) of kerosene despite its weight in excess of {{convert|5000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Ultimately, despite their undoubted qualities, Doble cars failed due to poor company organisation and high initial cost.

=== Toledo Steam Carriage ===
[[File:Toledo 1902 Steam Dos-à-Dos on London to Brighton VCR 2008 (2996646839).jpg|thumb|right|1902 Toledo steam car]]
In 1900, the [[American Bicycle Co.]] of [[Toledo, Ohio]], created a 6.25&amp;nbsp;hp Toledo Steam Carriage (a description from the ''Horseless Age'', December 1900). The American Bicycle Co was one of the enterprises within Col. Albert Pope's large conglomerate of bicycle and motor vehicles manufacturers. The Toledo Steam Carriage was a very well-made, high-quality machine where every component, bar the tires, bell, instruments and lights were made within the dedicated 245,000 sq ft factory in Toledo, Ohio. The Toledo is considered to be one of the best steam cars produced at the time. The engine was particularly robust and the 2, 3" diameter x 4" stoke pistons employed piston style valves instead of 'D' valves thus insuring better balance and reduced leakage of steam. In September 1901 two Toledo steamers, one model B (a model A machine {{convert|1000|to|2000|lb|kg|0|disp=or}} but with the foul-weather gear designating it as a model B) and one class E (public delivery vehicle), were entered by the American Bicycle Co. into the ''New York to Buffalo Endurance Contest'' of mid-September 1901. There were 36 cars in class B and three in class E; the class B Toledo won the Grosse Point race. On 4 January 1902, a specially built Toledo steam carriage was the first automobile to forge a trail from Flagstaff, Arizona to the South Rim of The Grand Canyon, a distance of 67 miles. As a publicity exercise the trip was to assess the potential of starting a steam bus service but the anticipated afternoon journey took three days due to problems with supplies of the wrong fuel. Though the Toledo towed a trailer filled with additional water and fuel supplies, the four participants omitted to take any food; one, the journalist Winfield Hoggaboon, wrote up an amusing article in the Los Angeles Herald two weeks later.  In December 1901, the company changed from the American Bicycle Company to the newly formed International Motor Car Company to concentrate on steam- and gasoline-driven models, with electric vehicles being made by the separate Waverly Electric Co.  Both steam and gasoline models were manufactured, but, as the public favoured the gasoline models and steam carriage sales were slow, steam carriage production ceased in July 1902 and gasoline-driven models were then made under the name Pope-Toledo.  Total production of the steamers was between 285 and 325 units, as confirmed by a letter from the International Motor Car Co bookkeeper to the firms' accountant in June 1902.

=== White Steamer ===
[[File:1905WhiteAuto.JPG|thumb|Advertisement for the White Sewing Machine Company's 1905 model]]
{{Main article|White Motor Company}}
The White Steamer was manufactured in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], from 1900 until 1910 by the [[White Motor Company]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Endurance steam car ===
The Endurance Steam Car was a steam car manufactured in the United States from 1922 until 1924. The company had its origins in the [[Coats Steam Car]] and began production on the East Coast before shifting operations to Los Angeles in 1924. There, one single [[touring car]] was made using a 1923 [[Elcar]] 6-60 body before the factory moved again, this time to [[Dayton, Ohio]], where one more car was built, a [[sedan (car)|sedan]], before the company folded.&lt;ref name="DBW" &gt;{{cite book

==Land speed record attempts==
The land speed record for Steam powered cars stood from 1906 when a Stanley steam car, driven by Fred Marriott, which achieved {{convert|127|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at [[Ormond Beach, Florida]]. Despite several attempts to break the record it stood until 25 August 2009 when Team Inspiration of the [[British Steam Car Challenge]] set a new speed record of {{convert|139.843|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A second attempt by Don Wales on 26 August achieved an average speed of {{convert|238.679|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The Stanley steam car held the land speed record for all vehicles for four years before it was broken by an internal combustion engine powered land vehicle. The 2009 record was set by a [[steam turbine]] powered vehicle vs the reciprocating piston-engine design used by F.E. and F.O. Stanley in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanley Steamer; America's Legendary Steam Car, Kit Foster, 2004, {{ISBN|1-886727-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Autocoast Vaporizer ===
Ernest Kanzler, the owner of Autocoast approached Ross (Skip) Hedrick began work in the fall of 1968 with the idea of installing a steam engine in Hedrick's 1964 Indy car for an attempt at the 1906 steam car record. Hedrick and Richard J Smith joined Autocoast to design the engine. The car was readied for the 1969 Bonneville speed week, but was unable to run because an unexpected rain-storm made the salt flats too soggy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beach car builder, driver steamed up - ready to go |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/30700183/|newspaper=Independent Press-Telegram|date=November 30, 1969|page=26|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barber-Nichols ===
In 1985, Barber-Nichols Engineering of [[Denver]] used a steam turbine they had designed for Lear and the Los Angeles city bus program to attempt to gain the steam-powered land speed record. The car was run at Speed Week on the [[Bonneville Speedway|Bonneville Salt Flats]] over a period of several years, eventually reaching a measured speed of 145.607&amp;nbsp;mph one pass. A fire prevented the return run, and the speed was not recognized by the [[FIA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamcar.net/lsr.html Rules - The Steam Car Club of Great Britain], retrieved 24 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; FIA land speed records are based on an average of two runs (called 'passes') in opposite directions, taken within an hour of each other.

=== British Steam Car Challenge ===
{{Main article|Inspiration (car)}}
On 25 August 2009, Team Inspiration of the [[British Steam Car Challenge]] broke the long-standing record for a steam vehicle set by a [[Stanley Steamer]] in 1906, setting a new speed record of {{convert|139.843|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It had been held for over 100 years. The car was driven by [[Charles Burnett III]] and reached a maximum speed of {{convert|136.103|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on the first run and {{convert|151.085|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on the second.

On 26 August 2009, the same car, driven this time by [[Don Wales]], the grandson of [[Sir Malcolm Campbell]], broke a second record by achieving an average speed of {{convert|238.679|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} over two consecutive runs over a measured kilometre. This was also recorded and has since been ratified by the FIA.

=== Steam Speed America ===
On 6 September 2014, Chuk Williams of Steam Speed America attempted to break the current world record in their steam-powered [[streamliner]].  The car reached 147&amp;nbsp;mph on its first run, but flipped and crashed when its [[Parachute|braking chutes]] failed to open; Williams was injured in the accident, and the car severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Chuk Williams Steam Speed America at Bonneville, Ken Helmick, Steam Automobile Bulletin, Vol 28 No 6, November–December 2014, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thames Valley Park''' is a high-tech [[business park]] adjacent to the [[River Thames]] on the eastern outskirts of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]].

==Location and companies==
The park partially lies within the [[civil parish]] of [[Sonning]]. Close by are the [[Ali's Pond Local Nature Reserve]], with paths and large ponds, and [[Sonning Hill]].

Companies based at the park include [[BBC Radio Berkshire]], [[Steria]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Regus]], [[BG Group]], [[Websense]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Microsoft]], [[OpenText]] and [[ING Direct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies|url=http://www.thamesvalleypark.co.uk/index.php#bggroup|publisher=Thames Valley Business Park|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport links==
The park is at the northern terminus of the A3290 (formerly part of the [[A329(M) motorway|A329(M)]]) giving good connections to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]]. Originally the A329(M) was supposed to follow the river west from the park towards a junction with Vastern Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/current/a329m/maps/a329m-extension.shtml|title=AA map showing A329(M) extension|accessdate=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Zero-fare public transport|free bus service]] between Thames the park and [[Reading railway station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gogoldline.co.uk/thamesvalleybusinesspark.php4|title=Reading Station and Town Centre to Thames Valley Park|accessdate=2007-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040208185051/http://www.gogoldline.co.uk/thamesvalleybusinesspark.php4|archivedate=8 February 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with good connections for [[London]] and [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]].

A railway station to serve the park was proposed in the 1998 [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading Borough]] Local Plan,&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.reading.gov.uk/documents/servingyou/planning/borough_plan/bp_appendix8.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of the [[coal]] [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] of the closed [[Earley]] [[power station]]. As at April 2013, the station had not been built.


==The Development==
The project was commenced by Speyhawk who went into receivership in 1993. Argent Group acquired the site and went on to complete the development in phases. It is built on well over a million cubic metres of pulverised fuel ash, from the power station, to bury the ash, gravels were extracted, and used for the construction of the A329(M) extension, this funded a large part of both the Reading Cross Town Route (A329(M) ) (Thames valley Park Drive)  and TVP development. The works were under two separate contracts, completed by Fairclough Civil Engineering - Egham Office. There is a deep pumping station for the development in the centre of the TVP roundabout installed by Trant Contractors. Access is through a tunnel under the Paddington to Exeter railway line from Sutton Seeds Roundabout, dig using the driven shoe method, then precast tunnel sections were installed as linings.

The green park is not a natural feature, it was built at the end of the developments, ensuring the flood plain was reinstated and biodiversity improved.

Evidence of the old power station is now restricted to a V shaped ditch, running into the Thames near the TVP roundabout to the north west, this was shortened to the point where the outfall of TVP stormwater drainage, and A329(m) drainage meet.

Access west into the Reading town, was designed into the roundabout adjacent to the railway line, its levels and layout reflect this, which in some way make its current configuration notable.

The road was one of the first designed using ground probing radar, which identified some soft ground features prior to commencement of works. The dual carriageway is constructed on a geotextile, because of the soft nature of the floodplain, and raised above it to avoid disruption during flooding, the roadways is then built upon a layer of chalk to sub-base level.

'''''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''''' is a 1962 book by [[Marshall McLuhan]], in which the author analyzes the effects of [[mass media]], especially the [[printing press]], on European [[culture]] and human consciousness. It popularized the term ''[[global village (term)|global village]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.31: "But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the simultaneous "field" in all human affairs so that the human family now exists under conditions of a "global village.""&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the idea that [[mass communication]] allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and ''Gutenberg Galaxy'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that Marshall McLuhan himself states quite clearly that "although the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a configuration of events, which lies far ahead of alphabet and of scribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have been no Gutenberg. McLuhan 1962, p.40"&lt;/ref&gt; which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially [[books]].

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of [[consciousness]] wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, "[[The medium is the message]]," McLuhan argues that [[technology|technologies]] are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of [[movable type]] was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the [[printing press]] led to the creation of [[nationalism]], [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], domination of [[rationalism]], automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and [[Social alienation|alienation]] of [[individual]]s.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival art]] and the exigencies of the single "point of view". He writes:

:''the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.''&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==The format of the book—a ''mosaic''==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which "develops a [[mosaic]] or field approach to its problems".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, first line of the unnamed preface on "page 0")&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal "causal operations in history".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, p.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of five parts:

* '''Prologue''',&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1"&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Gutenberg Galaxy''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.11-263&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Galaxy Reconfigured''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.265-79. The full title of this "epilogue" is "THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bibliographic Index''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.281-89&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Index of Chapter Glosses'''.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the book, part 2, "The Gutenberg Galaxy", consists of 107 short "chapters",
many of which are just three, two, or even one page(s) in length.
Such a large collection of small chapters does fit the picture of a mosaic.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. ''Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book."&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.&lt;ref&gt;"To show by exactly what historical process ["modern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence"] was done is the theme of The Gutenberg Galaxy." McLuhan 1962, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be "complementary to ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' by Albert B. Lord."&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of [[Milman Parry]] who turned to "the study of the Yugoslave epics"&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing four epochs of history:

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral tribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript culture&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan himself proposes to demonstrate that "manuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and that means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to manuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval." 1962, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gutenberg galaxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the ''hand-writing'' terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel morisse and Uwe lehmann, Marshall McLuhan Project, Philosophy, The Gutenberg Galaxy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given the clue of "hand-writing" that terminates the "oral phase" one expects "printing" to terminate the manuscript phase and the "electrifying" to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of "electrifying" is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The last section of the book, "The Galaxy Reconfigured," deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.0&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral tribe culture===
The [[oral tradition]] is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, [[nursery rhyme]]s or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of [[All the world's a stage|the ages of man]] (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&lt;ref name="Joyce-1964"&gt;"The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all Christian minstrelsy." Joyce 1964, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;"

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the [[Art of memory]].

====The village====
In commenting on the then [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;We have gone from the Soviet Union of McLuhan's day to the Russian Federation today.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan puts "the advertising and PR community" on a par with them in so far that both "are concerned about access to the media and about results."&lt;ref name="gloss 18"&gt;'''gloss 18''': "The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world." McLuhan 1962, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; More remarkably he asserts that "Soviet concern with media ''results'' is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village."&lt;ref name="gloss 18" /&gt;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as [[Print culture|scribal culture]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associated with this epoch is the [[Art of memory]] (in Latin Ars Memoriae).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (like Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'') is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book in order to weave together the various strands of his argument.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout ''Finnegans Wake'' Joyce specifies the [[Tower of Babel]] as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] calls the reign of the Idols.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Movable type====
His episodic and often rambling history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic age===

====The global village====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] would replace [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[Global Village (term)|global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm | publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) | title=The source of the term 'global village' | author=Eric McLuhan | year=1996 | accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book." If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies."

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' was published, McLuhan may have coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 | author=Paul Levinson | title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | ISBN=0-415-19251-X}} Book has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Croatian, Romanian, and Korean.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Bill Stewart (internet historian)|Bill Stewart]]'s 2007 "Living Internet" website describes how McLuhan's "insights made the concept of a global village, interconnected by an electronic nervous system, part of our popular culture well before it actually happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stewart | first = Bill | title = Marshall McLuhan Foresees The Global Village | work = Living Internet | date = 2000-01-07 | url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_mcluhan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermometer''' is a device that [[temperature measurement|measures temperature]] or a [[temperature gradient]]. A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb of a [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] or the digital sensor in an [[infrared thermometer]]) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature, and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model). Thermometers are widely used in industries

to monitor processes, in [[meteorology]], in medicine, and in scientific research.

Some of the principles of the thermometer were known to Greek philosophers of two thousand years ago. The modern thermometer gradually evolved from the [[thermoscope]] with the addition of a scale in the early 17th century and standardisation through the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ganino.com/games/Science/science%20magazine%201966-1967/root/data/Science%201966-1967/pdf/1967_v156_n3776/1722010.pdf |title=Concerning an Important Invention |first=Arnold |last=Court |date=12 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/jgrice/psyc4333/Thermoscopes_Measurement2011.pdf |title=Thermoscopes, thermometers, and the foundations of measurement |first=David |last=Sherry |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |volume=42 |year=2011 |pages=509–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=qfmS7g4JzjwC&amp;pg=PA4 |title=Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement |pages=2–9 |first=Thomas Donald |last=McGee |year=1988 |isbn=9780471627678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature==
{{Main|Temperature|Temperature measurement}}
[[File:1024 Pyrometer-8445.jpg|200px|thumbnail|An infrared thermometer is a kind of [[pyrometer]] ([[bolometer]]).]]
While an individual thermometer is able to measure degrees of hotness, the readings on two thermometers cannot be compared unless they conform to an agreed scale. Today there is an absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale. Internationally agreed temperature scales are designed to approximate this closely, based on fixed points and interpolating thermometers. The most recent official temperature scale is the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]]. It extends from {{convert|0.65|K|C F|lk=in|1}} to approximately {{convert|1358|K|C F}}.

[[File:Raumthermometer Fahrenheit+Celsius.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thermometer with [[Fahrenheit]] (symbol °F) and [[Celsius]] (symbol °C) units. [[Daniel Fahrenheit]]'s [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] was the first practical, accurate thermometer in history.]]

===Early developments===
{{See also|Thermometry|Temperature scale|Thermoscope|Alcohol thermometer|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology}}
[[File:Termometri cinquantigradi inv 85 IF 46774.jpg|thumb|Fifty-degree thermometers from the mid-17th century on exhibit at the [[Museo Galileo]] with black dots representing single degrees and white represented 10-degree increments; used to measure atmospheric temperatures]]
Various authors have credited the invention of the thermometer to [[Hero of Alexandria]]. The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]].
[[Hero of Alexandria]] (10–70 AD) knew of the principle that certain substances, notably air, expand and contract and described a demonstration in which a closed tube partially filled with air had its end in a container of water.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion and contraction of the air caused the position of the water/air interface to move along the tube.

Such a mechanism was later used to show the hotness and coldness of the air with a tube in which the water level is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the gas. These devices were developed by several European scientists in the 16th and 17th centuries, notably Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref name=Doak&gt;R.S. Doak (2005) Galileo: astronomer and physicist {{ISBN|0-7565-0813-4}} p36&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, devices were shown to produce this effect reliably, and the term ''thermoscope'' was adopted because it reflected the changes in [[sensible heat]] (the concept of temperature was yet to arise).&lt;ref name=Doak/&gt; The difference between a [[thermoscope]] and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' page 3, {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, what he produced were thermoscopes.

The first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by [[Giuseppe Biancani]] (1566 – 1624): the first showing a scale and thus constituting a thermometer was by [[Robert Fludd]] in 1638. This was a vertical tube, closed by a bulb of air at the top, with the lower end opening into a vessel of water. The water level in the tube is controlled by the expansion and contraction of the air, so it is what we would now call an air thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'', pages 2–4 {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to put a scale on a thermoscope is variously said {{By whom|date=March 2018}} to be [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Francesco Sagredo]] (1571–1620) or Santorio Santorio in about 1611 to 1613.

The word thermometer (in its French form) first appeared in 1624 in ''La Récréation Mathématique'' by J. Leurechon, who describes one with a scale of 8 degrees.&lt;ref name=page4&gt;R.P. Benedict (1984) Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements, 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words [[wikt:θερμός|θερμός]], ''thermos'', meaning "hot" and μέτρον, ''metron'', meaning "measure".

The above instruments suffered from the disadvantage that they were also [[barometer]]s, i.e. sensitive to air pressure. In 1629, [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], a student of Galileo, published what is apparently the first description and illustration of a sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer.  It is described as having a bulb at the bottom of a sealed tube partially filled with brandy.  The tube has a numbered scale. Delmedigo does not claim to have invented this instrument, nor does he name anyone else as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Adler, "J. S. Delmedigo and the Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer," ''Annals of Science'' 54 (1997): 293-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1654 [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] (1610–1670), actually produced such an instrument, the first modern-style thermometer, dependent on the expansion of a liquid, and independent of air pressure.&lt;ref name=page4/&gt; Many other scientists experimented with various liquids and designs of thermometer.

However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique—there was [[Conversion of units of temperature|no standard scale]]. In 1665 [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) suggested using the [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s of water as standards, and in 1694 Carlo Renaldini (1615–1698) proposed using them as fixed points on a universal scale. In 1701, [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1726/27) proposed a scale of 12 degrees between the melting point of ice and [[Normal human body temperature|body temperature]].

In 1714 Dutch scientist and inventor [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] invented the first reliable thermometer, [[mercury thermometer|using mercury]] instead of [[alcohol thermometer|alcohol and water mixtures]]. In 1724 he proposed a [[temperature scale]] which now (slightly adjusted) [[Fahrenheit|bears his name]]. He could do this because he manufactured thermometers, using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (which has a high [[Thermal expansion|coefficient of expansion]]) for the first time and the quality of his production could provide a finer scale and greater reproducibility, leading to its general adoption. &lt;!--This is correct. The original scale was the "wrong" way round"--&gt;In 1742, [[Anders Celsius]] (1701–1744) proposed a scale with zero at the boiling point and 100 degrees at the freezing point of water,&lt;!--This is correct, originally 0 at boiling point, 100 at melting point, please do not switch these--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.P.

==Registering==
Old thermometers were all non-registering thermometers. That is, the thermometer did not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of hot liquid required the user to leave the thermometer in the hot liquid until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer was removed from the hot liquid, then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded, until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.

Thermometers increasingly use electronic means to provide a digital display or input to a computer.

==Physical principles of thermometry==
[[File:Oldthermometers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Various thermometers from the 19th century.]]
[[File:Thermometer CF.svg|thumb|upright|Comparison of the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales]]

Thermometers may be described as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and with each other in the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979). ''Principles of Thermodynamics'', Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-41806-7}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; For any two empirical thermometers, this does not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be [[Monotonic function|strictly monotonic]].&lt;ref name="Thomsen 1962"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomsen | first1 = J.S. | year = 1962 | title = A restatement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics | url = | journal = Am.

As it is customarily stated in textbooks, taken alone, the so-called "[[zeroth law of thermodynamics]]" fails to deliver this information, but the statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics by [[James Serrin]] in 1977, though rather mathematically abstract, is more informative for thermometry: "Zeroth Law – There exists a topological line &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which serves as a coordinate manifold of material behaviour. The points &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are called 'hotness levels', and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called the 'universal hotness manifold'."&lt;ref&gt;Serrin, J. (1978). The concepts of thermodynamics, in ''Contemporary Developments in Continuum Mechanics and Partial Differential Equations.

Medeiros, North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-85166-6}}, pages 411-451.&lt;/ref&gt; To this information there needs to be added a sense of greater hotness; this sense can be had, independently of [[calorimetry]], of [[thermodynamics]], and of properties of particular materials, from [[Wien's displacement law#Frequency-dependent formulation|Wien's displacement law]] of [[thermal radiation]]: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its [[Frequency spectrum#Light|frequency spectrum]]; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that [[Third law of thermodynamics|tend to zero]]. Another way of identifying hotter as opposed to colder conditions is supplied by Planck's principle, that when a process of isochoric adiabatic work is the sole means of change of internal energy of a closed system, the final state of the system is never colder than the initial state; except for phase changes with latent heat, it is hotter than the initial state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1926).

There are several principles on which empirical thermometers are built, as listed in the section of this article entitled "Primary and secondary thermometers". Several such principles are essentially based on the constitutive relation between the state of a suitably selected particular material and its temperature. Only some materials are suitable for this purpose, and they may be considered as "thermometric materials". Radiometric thermometry, in contrast, can be only slightly dependent on the constitutive relations of materials. In a sense then, radiometric thermometry might be thought of as "universal". This is because it rests mainly on a universality character of thermodynamic equilibrium, that it has the universal property of producing [[blackbody]] radiation.

===Thermometric materials===
[[File:Thermometers in pitcher.jpg|thumb|Bi-metallic stem thermometers used to measure the temperature of steamed milk]]
[[File:Backofenthermometer.jpg|thumb|upright|Bi-metallic thermometer for cooking and baking in an oven]]
There are various kinds of empirical thermometer based on material properties.

Many empirical thermometers rely on the constitutive relation between pressure, volume and temperature of their thermometric material. For example, mercury expands when heated.

If it is used for its relation between pressure and volume and temperature, a thermometric material must have three properties:

(1) Its heating and cooling must be rapid. That is to say, when a quantity of heat enters or leaves a body of the material, the material must expand or contract to its final volume or reach its final pressure and must reach its final temperature with practically no delay; some of the heat that enters can be considered to change the volume of the body at constant temperature, and is called the [[Calorimetry|latent heat of expansion at constant temperature]]; and the rest of it can be considered to change the temperature of the body at constant volume, and is called the [[Calorimetry|specific heat at constant volume]]. Some materials do not have this property, and take some time to distribute the heat between temperature and volume change.&lt;ref name="Truesdell Bharatha 1977 20"&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977). ''The Concepts and Logic of Classical Thermodynamics as a Theory of Heat Engines. Rigorously Constructed upon the Foundation Laid by S. Carnot and F. Reech'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|0-387-07971-8}}, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) Its heating and cooling must be reversible. That is to say, the material must be able to be heated and cooled indefinitely often by the same increment and decrement of heat, and still return to its original pressure, volume and temperature every time. Some plastics do not have this property;&lt;ref name="Ziegler 1983"&gt;Ziegler, H., (1983). ''An Introduction to Thermomechanics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-86503-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) Its heating and cooling must be monotonic.&lt;ref name="Thomsen 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1961). ''Thermodynamics with Quantum Statistical Illustrations'', Interscience Publishers, New York, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, throughout the range of temperatures for which it is intended to work,

:(a) at a given fixed pressure,

::either (α) the volume increases when the temperature increases, or else (β) the volume decreases when the temperature increases;

::but not (α) for some temperatures and (β) for others; or

:(b) at a given fixed volume,

::either (α) the pressure increases when the temperature increases, or else (β) the pressure decreases when the temperature increases;

::but not (α) for some temperatures and (β) for others.

At temperatures around about 4&amp;nbsp;°C, water does not have the property (3), and is said to behave anomalously in this respect; thus water cannot be used as a material for this kind of thermometry for temperature ranges near 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Truesdell 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.

Reech'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|0-387-07971-8}}, pages 9-10, 15-18, 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gases, on the other hand, all have the properties (1), (2), and (3)(a)(α) and (3)(b)(α). Consequently, they are suitable thermometric materials, and that is why they were important in the development of thermometry.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903). ''[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich Treatise on Thermodynamics]'', translated by A. Ogg, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constant volume thermometry===
According to Preston (1894/1904), [[Henri Victor Regnault|Regnault]] found constant pressure air thermometers unsatisfactory, because they needed troublesome corrections. He therefore built a constant volume air thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, T. (1894/1904). ''The Theory of Heat'', second edition, revised by J.R. Cotter, Macmillan, London, Section 92.0&lt;/ref&gt; Constant volume thermometers do not provide a way to avoid the problem of anomalous behaviour like that of water at approximately 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Truesdell Bharatha 1977"/&gt;

===Radiometric thermometry===
[[Planck's law]] very accurately quantitatively describes the power spectral density of electromagnetic radiation, inside a rigid walled cavity in a body made of material that is completely opaque and poorly reflective, when it has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, as a function of absolute thermodynamic temperature alone. A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the [[spectral radiance]] can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. This provides a well-reproducible absolute thermometer over a very wide range of temperatures, able to measure the absolute temperature of a body inside the cavity.

==Primary and secondary thermometers==
A thermometer is called primary or secondary based on how the raw physical quantity it measures is mapped to a temperature. As summarized by Kauppinen et al., "For '''primary thermometers''' the measured property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Examples of these are thermometers based on the equation of state of a gas, on the [[velocity]] of sound in a gas, on the [[Johnson–Nyquist noise|thermal noise]] [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] of an electrical resistor, and on the angular [[anisotropy]] of [[gamma ray]] emission of certain [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a [[magnetic field]]."&lt;ref name="kauppinen1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Loberg | first2 = K. T. | last3 = Manninen | first3 = A. J. | last4 = Pekola | first4 = J. P. | doi = 10.1063/1.1149265 | title = Coulomb blockade thermometer: Tests and instrumentation | journal = Rev. Sci. Instrum. | volume = 69 | pages = 4166 | year = 1998 |bibcode = 1998RScI...69.4166K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, "'''Secondary thermometers''' are most widely used because of their convenience. Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property is not sufficient to allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, [[triple point]]s and [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] transitions, occur reproducibly at the same temperature."&lt;ref name="kauppinen1998"/&gt;

==Calibration==
[[File:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|[[Mercury-in-glass thermometer]]]]
Thermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale. The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water. (Note that the boiling point of water varies with pressure, so this must be controlled.)

The traditional way of putting a scale on a liquid-in-glass or liquid-in-metal thermometer was in three stages:
#Immerse the sensing portion in a stirred mixture of pure ice and water at atmospheric pressure and mark the point indicated when it had come to thermal equilibrium.
#Immerse the sensing portion in a steam bath at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Standard atmospheric pressure]] and again mark the point indicated.
#Divide the distance between these marks into equal portions according to the temperature scale being used.

Other fixed points used in the past are the body temperature (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point ({{convert|96|F}} to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of {{convert|0|F}}.&lt;ref name=Benedict5&gt;R.P. Benedict (1984) ''Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements'', 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; (This is an example of a [[Frigorific mixture]]). As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at {{convert|212|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lord (1994) ''Sizes'' {{ISBN|0-06-273228-5}} page 293&lt;/ref&gt;

These have now been replaced by the defining points in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]], though in practice the melting point of water is more commonly used than its triple point, the latter being more difficult to manage and thus restricted to critical standard measurement. Nowadays manufacturers will often use a [[thermostat]] bath or solid block where the temperature is held constant relative to a calibrated thermometer. Other thermometers to be calibrated are put into the same bath or block and allowed to come to equilibrium, then the scale marked, or any deviation from the instrument scale recorded.&lt;ref name=Benedict11&gt;R.P. Benedict (1984) ''Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements'', 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}}, chapter 11 "Calibration of Temperature Sensors"&lt;/ref&gt; For many modern devices calibration will be stating some value to be used in processing an electronic signal to convert it to a temperature.

==Precision, accuracy, and reproducibility==
[[File:1913 Car-Nation Tourer RadiatorBoyce MotoMeter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The "''Boyce MotoMeter''" radiator cap on a 1913 [[Car-Nation]] automobile, used to measure temperature of vapor in 1910s and 1920s cars.]]
The '''precision''' or '''resolution''' of a thermometer is simply to what fraction of a degree it is possible to make a reading. For high temperature work it may only be possible to measure to the nearest 10&amp;nbsp;°C or more. Clinical thermometers and many electronic thermometers are usually readable to 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C. Special instruments can give readings to one thousandth of a degree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, this precision does not mean the reading is true or accurate, it only means that very small changes can be observed.

A thermometer calibrated to a known fixed point is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. Most thermometers are originally calibrated to a constant-volume [[gas thermometer]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In between fixed calibration points, [[interpolation]] is used, usually linear.&lt;ref name=Benedict11/&gt; This may give significant differences between different types of thermometer at points far away from the fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a [[platinum]] resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;T. Duncan (1973) Advanced Physics: Materials and Mechanics (John Murray, London) {{ISBN|0-7195-2844-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] varies in diameter.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

For many purposes reproducibility is important. That is, does the same thermometer give the same reading for the same temperature (or do replacement or multiple thermometers give the same reading)? Reproducible [[temperature measurement]] means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent. Thus if the same type of thermometer is calibrated in the same way its readings will be valid even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the absolute scale.

An example of a reference thermometer used to check others to industrial standards would be a platinum [[resistance thermometer]] with a digital display to 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C (its precision) which has been calibrated at 5 points against national standards (−18, 0, 40, 70, 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and which is certified to an accuracy of ±0.2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Peak&gt;[http://www.peaksensors.co.uk/acatalog/Reference_Thermometer.html Peak Sensors] Reference Thermometer&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[British Standards]], correctly calibrated, used and maintained liquid-in-glass thermometers can achieve a measurement uncertainty of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;°C in the range 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;°C, and a larger uncertainty outside this range: ±0.05&amp;nbsp;°C up to 200 or down to −40&amp;nbsp;°C, ±0.2&amp;nbsp;°C up to 450 or down to −80&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=BS1041&gt;BS1041-2.1:1985 Temperature Measurement- Part 2: Expansion thermometers.

== Applications ==
{{see also|List of temperature sensors}}
Thermometers utilize a range of physical effects to measure temperature. Temperature sensors are used in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications, especially measurement systems. Temperature systems are primarily either electrical or mechanical, occasionally inseparable from the system which they control (as in the case of a mercury-in-glass thermometer). Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist. Indoors, [[thermistor]]s are used in climate control systems such as [[air conditioner]]s, freezers, [[heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, and [[Water heating|water heater]]s.&lt;ref name="thermouse"/&gt; Galileo thermometers are used to measure indoor air temperature, due to their limited measurement range.

Such [[liquid crystal thermometer]]s (which use [[thermochromic]] liquid crystals) are also used in [[mood ring]]s and used to measure the temperature of water in fish tanks.

[[Fiber Bragg grating]] temperature sensors are used in [[nuclear power]] facilities to monitor reactor core temperatures and avoid the possibility of [[nuclear meltdown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fernandez | first1 = Alberto Fernandez | authorlink1 = Alberto Fernandez Fernandez| last2 = Gusarov | first2 = Andrei I.| last3 = Brichard | first3 = Benoît| last4 = Bodart | first4 = Serge| last5 = Lammens | first5 = Koen| last6 = Berghmans | first6 = Francis| last7 = Decréton | first7 = Marc| last8 = Mégret | first8 = Patrice| last9 = Blondel | first9 = Michel| last10 = Delchambre | first10 = Alain| doi = 10.1117/1.1475739 | title = Temperature monitoring of nuclear reactor cores with multiplexed fiber Bragg grating sensors | journal = [[Optical Engineering (journal)|Optical Engineering]]| volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 1246–1254| year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx=10.1.1.59.1761| bibcode = 2002OptEn..41.1246F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanothermometry ===
[[Nanothermometry]] is an emergent research field dealing with the knowledge of temperature in the sub-micrometric scale. Conventional thermometers cannot measure the temperature of an object which is smaller than a [[micrometre]], and new methods and materials have to be used. Nanothermometry is used in such cases. Nanothermometers are classified as [[luminescent]] thermometers (if they use light to measure temperature) and non-luminescent thermometers (systems where thermometric properties are not directly related to luminescence).&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/NR/C2NR30663H&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryometer ===

Thermometers used specifically for low temperatures.

=== Medical ===
{{main|Medical thermometer}}
*[[Medical thermometer#Ear|Ear thermometers]] tend to be an [[infrared thermometer]].
*[[Medical thermometer#Forehead|Forehead thermometer]] is an example of a [[liquid crystal thermometer]].
*[[rectal thermometer|Rectal]] and [[oral thermometer|oral]] thermometers have typically been mercury but have since largely been supersceded by [[NTC thermistor]]s with a digital readout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6854882 |status=Active |title=Rapid response electronic clinical thermometer  |pubdate=2005-02-15 |gdate= |fdate=2002-12-04 |pridate= |inventor=Ming-Yun Chen |invent1= |invent2= |assign1=Actherm Inc. |assign2= |class= |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6854882B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various thermometric techniques have been used throughout history such as the [[Galileo thermometer]] to thermal imaging.&lt;ref name=Ring2007/&gt;
[[Medical thermometer]]s such as mercury-in-glass thermometers, infrared thermometers, [[pill thermometer]]s, and [[liquid crystal thermometer]]s are used in [[health care]] settings to determine if individuals have a [[fever]] or are [[hypothermia|hypothermic]].

=== Food and food safety ===
Thermometers are important in [[food safety]], where food at temperatures within {{Convert|41|and|135|F|C}} can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours which could lead to [[foodborne illness]]. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.&lt;ref name="thermouse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsafetysite.com/resources/pdfs/EnglishServSafe/ENGSection5.pdf |title=Food Safety: Thermometers |author=Angela M. Fraser, Ph.D. |publisher=[[North Carolina State University]] |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2010-02-26 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cooking thermometers are important for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular [[meat thermometer]]s are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.
[[Candy thermometer]]s are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.

=== Environmental ===
*[[Indoor-outdoor thermometer]]
*[[Heat meter]] uses a thermometer to measure [[rate of heat flow]].
*[[Thermostats]] have used bimetallic strips but digital thermistors have since become popular.
[[Alcohol thermometer]]s, [[infrared thermometer]]s, mercury-in-glass thermometers, [[recording thermometer]]s, [[thermistor]]s, and Six's thermometers are used in [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]] in various levels of the [[atmosphere]] and oceans. [[Aircraft]] use thermometers and [[hygrometer]]s to determine if [[atmospheric icing]] conditions exist along their [[Airway (aviation)|flight path]]. These measurements are used to initialize [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast models]]. Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.

'''Transparent heating film''', also called '''transparent heating plastic''' or '''heating transparent polymer film''' is a thin and flexible [[polymer]] film with a [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] [[optical coating]]. Transparent heating films may be rated at 2.5{{nbsp}}kW/m{{sup|2}}&lt;!-- see talk page --&gt; at voltages below 48 [[volt]]s [[direct current]] (V{{nbsp}}DC). This allows [[heating]] with secure [[transformer]]s delivering voltages which will not hurt the human body. Transparent conductive polymer films may be used for heating transparent glasses. A combination with [[LEDFilm|transparent SMD electronic]] for multipurpose applications, is also possible. It is also a variant of carbon [[heating film]].

[[Image:Harmony670.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Logitech Harmony Remote|Harmony]] 670, a universal remote.]]
A '''universal remote''' is a [[remote control]] that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of [[consumer electronics]] devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote. Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allows the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with. For example, a [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] remote may be programmed to operate various brands of [[television]]s.

== History ==
On May 30, 1985, [[Philips]] introduced the first universal remote (U.S. Pat. #4774511) under the [[Magnavox]] brand name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|4774511}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1985, Robin Rumbolt, William "Russ" McIntyre, and Larry Goodson with North American Philips Consumer Electronics (Magnavox, Sylvania, and Philco) developed the first universal remote control. Shortly after development was completed{{When|date=September 2009}} and patent applications filed,{{Which|date=September 2009}}{{When|date=September 2009}} Magnavox initiated the "Smart, Very Smart" campaign, coining the "smart" axiom. McIntyre has claimed that the primary design challenge was fitting the well-crafted, tight code into an extremely limited memory space.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} At least two subsequent patents followed: US Pat. 4703359, on November 20, 1988 and US Pat. 4951131, in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1987, the first programmable universal remote control was released. It was called the "CORE" and was created by [[CL 9]], a startup founded by [[Steve Wozniak]], the inventor of the [[Apple I]] and [[Apple II]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|4918439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1987, [[Steve Ciarcia]] published an article in [[Byte Magazine]] entitled "Build a Trainable Infrared Master Controller", describing a universal remote with the ability to upload the settings to a computer.&lt;ref name="ciarcia"&gt;Ciarcia, Steve (1987-03). Build a Trainable Infrared Master Controller. Byte Magazine, Volume 12, Issue 3 (March 1987), pp. 113-123. Retrieved citation from http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=25992.&lt;/ref&gt; This device had macro capabilities.&lt;ref name="ciarcia" /&gt;

==Layout and features==
Most universal remotes share a number of basic design elements:

*A power button, as well as a switch or series of buttons to select which device the remote is controlling at the moment. A typical selection includes [[television receiver|TV]], [[videocassette recorder|VCR]], [[DVD]], and [[Cable box (electronics)|CBL]]/[[satellite television|SAT]], along with other devices that sometimes include [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, audio equipment or home automation devices.
*Channel and volume up/down selectors (sometimes marked with + and - signs).
*A [[numeric keypad]] for entering channel numbers and some other purposes such as time and date entry.
*A set button (sometimes recessed to avoid accidental pressing) to allow selection of a particular set of codes (usually entered on the keypad). Most remotes also allow the user to cycle through the list of available codes to find one that matches the device to be controlled.
*Most but not all universal remotes include one or more [[D-pad]]s for navigating menus on DVD players and cable/satellite boxes.

Certain highly reduced designs such as the [[TV-B-Gone]] or keychain-sized remotes include only a few buttons, such as power and channel/volume selectors.

Higher-end remotes have numerous other features:

* [[Macro (computer science)|Macro]] programming, allowing the user to program command sequences to be sent with one button press&lt;ref name="macro"&gt;{{cite patent|US|6587067}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liquid Crystal Display|LCD]] to display status information.
* Programmable soft keys, allowing user-defined functions and macros&lt;ref name="macro" /&gt;
* Aliases or "punchthroughs", which allow multiple devices to be accessed without changing device modes (for example, using the TV's volume control while the remote is still in DVD-player mode.)
* [[Infrared|IR]] code learning, allowing the remote to be programmed to control new devices not already in its code list
* PC configuration, allowing the remote to be connected to a computer for easy setup
* Some universal remotes have the ability to also make phone calls replacing your home phone in that room.
* [[Repeater]]s are available that can extend the range of a remote control; some remotes are designed to communicate with a dedicated repeater over RF, removing the line-of-sight requirement of IR repeaters, while others accept infrared signals from any remote and transmit them to the device being controlled. (The latter are sometimes built as hobby projects and are widely available in kit form.)
*Some devices, such as some computers and game consoles, use [[Bluetooth]] or a similar [[Radio frequency|RF]] protocol rather than infrared as the main transmission form; universal remotes compatible with those designs are available.{{Specify|date=September 2009}}

=== Upgradable and learning remotes ===
Some universal remotes allow the code lists programmed into the remote to be updated to support new brands or models of devices not currently supported by the remote. Some higher end universal learning remotes require a computer to be connected. The connection is typically done via USB from the computer to mini-USB on the remote or the remotes base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4959810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a group of enthusiasts discovered that universal remotes made by UEI and sold under the One For All, [[RadioShack]], and other brands can be reprogrammed by means of an interface called [[JP1 remote|JP1]].

IR learning remotes can learn the code for any button on many other IR remote controls. This functionality allows the remote to learn functions not supported by default for a particular device, making it sometimes possible to control devices that the remote was not originally designed to control. A drawback of this approach is that the learning remote needs a functioning teaching remote. Also, some entertainment equipment manufacturers use pulse frequencies that are higher than what the learning remote can detect and store in its memory.

=== Touch-screen remotes ===


These remotes feature an LCD screen that can be either monochrome or full color.  The "buttons" are actually images on the screen, which, when touched, will send IR signals to controlled devices.  Some models have multiple screens that are accessed through virtual buttons on the touch-screen and other models have a combination of the touch-screen and physical buttons.

Some models of the touch-screen remotes are programmed using a graphical interface program on a PC, which allows the user to customize the screens, backgrounds, buttons and even the "actions" the buttons perform. The "project" that is created is then downloaded into the remote through a USB cable or, in the most recent models, wirelessly by [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]].

The newest touch-screen remotes, such as the Logitech 900 and 1100, include an RF transmitter to allow signals to reach locations much farther than the usual range of IR (approximately 6 meters).  RF also does not require line of sight.

Some touch-screen remote controls, such as the [[Ray Super Remote]], now have content recommendations built directly in to the universal remote control. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/ending-remote-control-clutter-the-hunt-for-the-perfect-universal-remote-1453833118 Ending Remote Control Clutter: The Hunt for the Perfect Universal Remote],  By Joanna Stern, Jan. 26, 2016, WSJ&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartphone and tablet universal remotes ===

[[Smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] such as those running [[Nokia|Nokia's]] [[N900|Maemo (N900)]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system can also be used as universal remote controls.

A number of devices from vendors such as [[Samsung]], [[LG]] and [[Nokia]] include a built-in IR port that can be used as a remote, while others require a physical attachment, or 'dongle', be connected on to the phone when used as a remote. The dongle is required to convert the electrical control signals from the phone into infra red signals that are required by most home audio visual components for remote control.  However it is also possible to implement a system that does not require a dongle. Such systems use a stand-alone piece of hardware called a 'gateway', which receives the electrical control signals from the smartphone in Bluetooth or wi-fi form and forward them on in infra red form to the components to be controlled.
