'''Agricultural extension''' is the application of scientific research and new knowledge to [[agricultural]] practices through [[farmer]] [[education]]. The field of 'extension' now encompasses a wider range of communication and learning activities organized for [[Rural area|rural]] people by educators from different disciplines, including [[agriculture]], [[agricultural marketing]], [[health]], and [[business studies]].

Extension practitioners can be found throughout the world, usually working for government agencies. They are represented by several professional organizations, networks and extension journals.

Agricultural extension agencies in [[developing countries]] receive large amounts of support from [[international development]] organizations such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations.

== Extension terminology ==
Modern [[Continuing education|extension]] began in Dublin, Ireland in 1847 with Lord Clarendon's itinerant instructors during the great famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w5830e/w5830e03.htm|title=Chapter 1 - The history, development, and future of agricultural extension|work=Improving agricultural extension. A reference manual

|isbn=92-5-104007-9   |first1=Gwyn E. |last1=Jones |first2=Chris |last2=Garforth| publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded in Germany in the 1850s, through the itinerant agricultural teachers ''Wanderlehrer'' and later in the USA via the cooperative extension system authorized by the Smith-Lever Act in 1914. The term was later adopted in the United States of America, while in Britain it was replaced with "advisory service" in the 20th century. A number of other terms are used in different parts of the world to describe the same or similar concept:

* Arabic: ''Al-Ershad'' (“guidance”)
* Dutch: 	 ''Voorlichting'' (“lighting the path”)
* German:   ''Beratung'' (“advisory work”)
* French:   ''Vulgarisation'' (“popularization”)
* Spanish:   ''Capacitación'' (“training” "capacity building")
* Thai, Lao:   ''Song-Suem'' (“to promote”)
* Persian:   ''Tarvij'' &amp; ''Gostaresh'' (“to promote and to extend”) - ترویج و گسترش

In the US, an extension agent is a university employee who develops and delivers educational programs to assist people in [[economic development|economic]] and [[community development]], leadership, family issues, agriculture and environment. Another program area provided by extension agents is [[4-H]] and youth activities. Many extension agents work for [[cooperative extension service]] programs at [[land-grant university|land-grant universities]]. They are sometimes referred to as [[County (United States)|county]] agents, or extension educators. Often confused with Extension agents, Extension specialists are subject matter experts usually employed as scientists and university professors in various departments in the land-grant university system. Subjects range from agriculture, life sciences, economics, engineering, food safety, pest management, veterinary medicine, and various other allied disciplines. These subject matter specialists work with agents (usually in a statewide or regional team environment) to support programs within the cooperative extension system.

==Definitions of extension==
There is no widely accepted definition of agricultural extension. The examples given below are taken from a number of books on extension published over a period of more than 50 years:

* 1949: The central task of extension is to help rural families help themselves by applying science, whether physical or social, to the daily routines of farming, homemaking, and family and community living.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, E. and Hsin Pao Yang, E. (1949) Rural America and the Extension Service, Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: Agricultural extension has been described as a system of out-of-school education for rural people.&lt;ref&gt;Saville, A. H. (1965) Extension in Rural Communities: A Manual for Agricultural and Home Extension technician Workers. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: Extension personnel have the task of bringing scientific knowledge to farm families in the farms and homes. The object of the task is to improve the efficiency of agriculture.
* 1973: Extension is a service or system which assists farm people, through educational procedures, in improving farming methods and techniques, increasing production efficiency and income, bettering their standard of living and lifting social and educational standards.
* 1974: Extension involves the conscious use of communication of information to help people form sound opinions and make good decisions.
* 1982: Agricultural Extension: Assistance to farmers to help them identify and analyze their production problems and become aware of the opportunities for improvement.
* 1988: Extension is a professional communication intervention deployed by an institution to induce change in voluntary behaviors with a presumed public or collective utility.
* 1997: Extension is the organized exchange of information and the deliberate transfer of skills.
* 1999: The essence of agricultural extension is to facilitate interplay and nurture synergies within a total information system involving agricultural research, agricultural education and a vast complex of information-providing businesses.
* 2004: Extension is a series of embedded communicative interventions that are meant, among other goals, to develop and/or induce innovations which help to resolve (usually multi-actor) problematic situations.
* 2006: Extension is the process of enabling change in individuals, communities and industries involved in the primary industry sector and in natural resource management.&lt;ref&gt;State Extension Leaders Network (SELN) 2006 'Enabling Change in Rural and Regional Australia: The role of extension in achieving sustainable and productive futures', online resource: www.seln.org.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Bystämma Åberg.JPG|thumb|right|Agricultural extension meeting in [[Sweden]] village in 1800s]]

===Origins of agricultural extension===
It is not known where or when the first extension activities took place. It is known, however, that Chinese officials were creating agricultural policies, documenting practical knowledge, and disseminating advice to farmers at least 2,000 years ago. For example, in approximately 800 BC, the minister responsible for agriculture under one of the [[Zhou dynasty]] emperors organized the teaching of [[crop rotation]] and drainage to farmers. The minister also leased equipment to farmers, built grain stores and supplied free food during times of famine.&lt;ref&gt;Trager, J. (1996) ''The Food Chronology'', Aurum Press, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of the modern extension service has been attributed to events that took place in Ireland in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G.E. and Garforth, C. (1997) ''The history, development, and future of agricultural extension'' in Swanson, B. “Improving Agricultural Extension: A Reference Manual (3rd Edition)” FAO&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1845–51 the Irish potato crop was destroyed by fungal diseases and a severe famine occurred (see [[Great Irish Famine]]). The British Government arranged for "practical instructors" to travel to rural areas and teach small farmers how to cultivate alternative crops. This scheme attracted the attention of government officials in Germany, who organized their own system of traveling instructors. By the end of the 19th century, the idea had spread to Denmark, Netherlands, Italy, and France.

The term "university extension" was first used by the Universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1867 to describe teaching activities that extended the work of the institution beyond the campus. Most of these early activities were not, however, related to agriculture. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, when colleges in the United States started conducting demonstrations at agricultural shows and giving lectures to farmer’s clubs, that the term "extension service" was applied to the type of work that we now recognize by that name.

In the United States, the [[Hatch Act of 1887]] established a system of [[agricultural experiment station]]s in conjunction with each state's [[land-grant university]], and the [[Smith-Lever Act of 1914]] created a system of [[cooperative extension]] to be operated by those universities  in order to inform people about current developments in agriculture, home economics, and related subjects.

===Four generations of extension in Asia===
[[Image:Bartlett - Extension Meeting - Nepal 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Agricultural extension meeting in [[Nepal]], 2002]]
[[Image:Bartlett - Extension Meeting - Laos(2006).jpg|thumb|right|Agricultural extension meeting in [[Laos]], 2006]]

The development of extension services in modern Asia has differed from country to country.  Despite the variations, it is possible to identify a general sequence of four periods or "generations":&lt;ref name=NAFES05&gt;NAFES (2005) ''Consolidating Extension in the Lao PDR'', National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service, Vientiane&lt;/ref&gt;

* Colonial agriculture: Experimental stations were established in many Asian countries by the [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers. The focus of attention was usually on export crops such as [[rubber]], tea, cotton, and sugar. Technical advice was provided to [[plantation]] managers and large landowners. Assistance to small farmers who grew [[subsistence crop]]s was rare, except in times of crisis.
* Diverse top-down extension: After independence, commodity-based extension services emerged from the remnants of the colonial system, with production targets established as part of five-year development plans. In addition, various schemes were initiated to meet the needs of small farmers, with support from foreign donors.
* Unified top-down extension: During the 1970s and 1980s, the Training and Visit system (T&amp;V) was introduced by the [[World Bank]]. Existing organizations were merged into a single national service. Regular messages were delivered to groups of farmers, promoting the adoption of "[[Green Revolution]]" technologies.
* Diverse bottom-up extension:  When World Bank funding came to an end, the T&amp;V system collapsed in many countries, leaving behind a patchwork of programs and projects funded from various other sources. The decline of central planning, combined with a growing concern for [[sustainability]] and equity, has resulted in participatory methods gradually replacing top-down approaches.

The fourth generation is well established in some countries, while it has only just begun in other places. While it seems likely that participatory approaches will continue to spread in the next few years, it is impossible to predict the long-term future of extension. Compared to 20 years ago{{Clarify timeframe|date=March 2017}}, agricultural extension now receives considerably less support from donor agencies. Among academics working in this field, some have recently argued that agricultural extension needs to be reinvented as a professional practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leeuwis, C.  and van den Ban, A. ''Communication for Rural Innovation: Rethinking Agricultural Extension'' (3rd Edition), Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have abandoned the idea of extension as a distinct concept and prefer to think in terms of "knowledge systems" in which farmers are seen as experts rather than adopters.&lt;ref&gt;Roling, N. and Wagemakers, A. Editors.(1998), ''Facilitating Sustainable Agriculture: Participatory learning and [[adaptive management]] in times of environmental uncertainty'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of future extension education:

*Evolution of extension system and [[operationalisation]] of approaches 
*Future extension education initiatives
*Collegiate participation of farmers 
*Web enabled technology dissemination 
*Developing cases as tools for technology dissemination
*Agriculture as a profitable venture 
*Scaling up of group mobilization 
*[[Micro-enterprise]]s promotion

Several of the institutional innovations that have come up in response to the weaknesses in public research and extension system have given enough indications of the emergence of an agricultural innovation system in India. This has resulted in the blurring of the clearly demarcated institutional boundaries between research, extension, farmers, farmers' groups, NGOs and private enterprises. Extension should play the role of facilitating the access to and transfer of knowledge among the different entities involved in the innovation system and create competent institutional modes to improve the overall performance of the innovation system. Inability to play this important role would further marginalize extension efforts.

== Communication processes  ==
The term "extension" has been used to cover widely differing [[communication]] systems. Two particular issues help to define the type of extension: how communication takes place, and why it takes place.&lt;ref name=NAFES05/&gt;

The related but separate field of [[agricultural communication]] has emerged to contribute to in-depth examinations of the communication processes among various actors within and external to the agricultural system. This field refers to the participatory extension model as a form of public relations-rooted two-way symmetric communication based on mutual respect, understanding, and influence between an organization and its stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newarrivals.nlb.gov.sg/itemdetail.aspx?bid=12303638 Encyclopedia of public relations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416210130/http://newarrivals.nlb.gov.sg/itemdetail.aspx?bid=12303638 |date=April 16, 2009 }}, by Robert L. Heath, 2005. Retrieved October 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural communication can take three modes—face-to-face training, training "products" such as manuals and videos, or information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as radio and short message system (SMS). The most effective systems facilitate two-way communication and often combine different modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Finance Corporation]] (2013). Working with Smallholders: A Handbook for Firms Building Sustainable Supply Chains.  {{cite web|url=https://www.farms2firms.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020932/http://www.farms2firms.org/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four paradigms of agricultural extension  ==
Any particular extension system can be described in terms of both how communication takes place and why it takes place. It is not the case that paternalistic systems are always persuasive, nor is it the case that participatory projects are necessarily educational. Instead there are four possible combinations, each of which represents a different extension paradigm, as follows:&lt;ref name=NAFES05/&gt;

* Technology transfer (persuasive + paternalistic): This paradigm was prevalent in colonial times and reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s when the "Training and Visit" system was established across Asia. Technology transfer involves a top-down approach that delivers specific recommendations to farmers about the practices they should adopt.
* Advisory work (persuasive + participatory): This paradigm can be seen today where government organizations or private consulting companies respond to farmers' inquiries with technical prescriptions. It also takes the form of projects managed by donor agencies and NGOs that use participatory approaches to promote predetermined packages of technology.
* Human resource development (educational + paternalistic): This paradigm dominated the earliest days of extension in Europe and North America, when universities gave training to rural people who were too poor to attend full-time courses. It continues today in the outreach activities of colleges around the world. Top-down teaching methods are employed, but students are expected to make their own decisions about how to use the knowledge they acquire.
* Facilitation for [[empowerment]] (educational + participatory):  This paradigm involves methods such as [[experiential learning]] and farmer-to-farmer exchanges. Knowledge is gained through interactive processes and the participants are encouraged to make their own decisions. The best known examples in Asia are projects that use [[Farmer Field Schools]] (FFS) or [[participatory technology development]] (PTD).

There is some disagreement about whether or not the concept and name of 'extension' really encompasses all four paradigms. Some experts believe that the term should be restricted to persuasive approaches, while others believe it should only be used for educational activities. [[Paulo Freire]] has argued that the terms ‘extension’ and ‘participation’ are contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1969) ''Extension y Comunicacion'', translated by Louise Bigwood &amp; Margaret Marshall and re-printed in 'Education: The Practice of Freedom' (1976),  Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative&lt;/ref&gt; There are philosophical reasons behind these disagreements. From a practical point of view, however, communication processes that conform to each of these four paradigms are currently being organized under the name of extension in one part of the world or another. Pragmatically, if not ideologically, all of these activities are considered to be represented in agricultural extension.

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
The '''Alliance for the Future of Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Aleanca për Ardhmërinë e Kosovës}}, AAK) is a [[List of political parties in Kosovo|political party]] in [[Kosovo]].  It was formed on 29 April 2001.

==Leadership==
The current president of the party is [[Ramush Haradinaj]]. In December 2004 the parliament elected him as [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] and he formed a [[coalition government]] with the largest party, the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] (LDK).  He resigned as Prime Minister in March 2005 after learning that he had been indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], for 37 counts of [[war crime]]s.  He received a full acquittal from the Tribunal on 3 April 2008.  He returned to Kosovo and immediately resumed his duties as president of the party.

The AAK currently has three deputy presidents: Blerim Shala, [[Naim Maloku]] and Ahmet Isufi.

The current Secretary General is Burim Ramadani and the Secretary of Organisation is Ibrahim Selmanaj.

==In Parliament==
At the last [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|legislative elections]] held on 17 November 2007, the alliance won 9.6% of the popular vote and 10 out of 120 seats in the [[Assembly of Kosovo]], which made it the fifth largest political force. This was a gain on the previous two legislative elections in [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2001|2001]] and [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2004|2004]] in which the AAK won 7.8% and 8.4% of the popular vote, respectively.

The AAK's eleven current members of parliament are: Ardian Gjini, who is the leader of the parliamentary caucus, Ahmet Isufi, Daut Haradinaj, Kimete Bajraktari, Burim Ramadani, Bali Muharremaj, Donika Kadaj, Blerim Shala, Teuta Haxhiu, Ramiz Kelmendi and Time Kadrijaj
also serves as the AAK's member of the Assembly Presidency.

==Local elections==
At the [[Kosovan local elections, 2007|municipal elections]] held on 17 November 2007, the AAK gained control of 3 municipalities in western Kosovo: [[Peć]], [[Đakovica]] and [[Deçan]].

At the [[Kosovan local elections, 2007|municipal elections]] held on 15 November 2007, the party gained 8 of 37 municipalities of Kosovo.

==Political position==
AAK is located slightly to the right on the political spectrum.

==Party name and symbols==
The party flag is red, black and white. White represents peace; red and black are the [[national colours]] of the 96% [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian]] majority of Kosovo.

The choice of the party's name, Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) is explained in Ramush Haradinaj's second book. Whereas previous Kosovo party acronyms began with consonants, a vowel was chosen for AAK because it seems less harsh and more open. The word "future" was chosen to mark a break with the old communist tendency to reflect backwards upon one's history.  Finally, "alliance" was chosen because of its association with the [[NATO]] alliance which is much revered in Kosovo for its intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, and also because of it evokes the idea of working together to achieve one's aims.

The alliance was originally formed by several smaller parties:
*[[People's Movement of Kosovo]] (''Lëvizja Popullore e Kosovës - LPK'')
*[[Parliamentary Party of Kosovo]] (''Partia Parlamentare e Kosovës'')
*[[Civic Alliance of Kosovo]] (''Aleanca Qytetare e Kosovës'')
*[[National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo]] (''Lëvizja Kombëtare për Çlirimin e Kosovës'')
*[[Party of Albanian National Union]] (''Partia e Unitetit Kombëtar Shqiptar'')
*[[Albanian Union of Christian Democrats]] (''Unioni Shqiptar Demokristian'')

'''Azodicarbonamide''', or '''azo(''bis'')formamide''', is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/cicads/cicads/cicad16.htm#PartNumber:2|title=Azodicarbonamide (CICADS)|publisher=[[International Programme on Chemical Safety]]|work=Inchem|accessdate=2010-08-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100824055553/http://www.inchem.org/documents/cicads/cicads/cicad16.htm| archivedate= 24 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Also published by [[World Health Organization]], Geneva, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a yellow to orange-red, odorless, crystalline powder. 
==Synthesis==
It is prepared in two steps via treatment of [[urea]] with [[hydrazine]] to form hydroazodicarbonamide, as described in this idealized equation:
:2 OC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)-N(H)-N(H)-C(O)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Oxidation of the resulting hydrazine derivative with [[chlorine]] or [[chromic acid]] yields the azodicarbonamide:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)-N(H)-N(H)-C(O)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(O)-N=N-C(O)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

== Applications ==
===Blowing agent===
The principal use of azodicarbonamide is in the production of foamed plastics as a [[blowing agent]]. The thermal decomposition of azodicarbonamide results in the evolution of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and ammonia gases, which are trapped in the polymer as bubbles to form a foamed article&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|authors= Heinz Weber, Isidoor De Grave, Eckhard Röhrl, Volker Altstädt|year=2016|title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|pages= 1|doi=10.1002/14356007.a11_435.pub2|publisher=Wiley-VCH|chapter=Foamed Plastics|isbn= 9783527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azodicarbonamide is used in plastics, synthetic leather, and other industries and can be pure or modified. Modification affects the reaction temperatures. Pure azodicarbonamide generally reacts around 200 °C. In the plastic, leather, and other industries, modified azodicarbonamide (average decomposition temperature 170 °C) contains additives that accelerate the reaction or react at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

An example of the use of azodicarbonamide as a blowing agent is found in the manufacture of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl (PVC)]] and [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|EVA-PE foams]], where it forms bubbles upon breaking down into gas at high temperature. Vinyl foam is springy and does not slip on smooth surfaces. It is useful for [[Underlay|carpet underlay]] and [[floor mat]]s. Commercial [[yoga mat]]s made of vinyl foam have been available since the 1980s; the first mats were cut from carpet underlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Friend | authorlink=John Friend (yogi) | year=2009 | title=History of Yoga Mat - Looking back with Friends }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food additive===
As a [[food additive]], azodicarbonamide is used as a [[flour bleaching agent]] and a [[dough conditioner]].&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;FDA [http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm387497.htm Frequently Asked Questions on Azodicarbonamide (ADA)] Page Last Updated: 20 June, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  It reacts with moist flour as an oxidizing agent.&lt;ref name="WHOFAO"&gt;WHO FAO 1965.  Toxicological Evaluation of Some Antimicrobials, Antioxidants, Emulsifiers, Stabilizers, Flour-Treatment Agents, Acids and Bases: [http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/40abcj28.htm Azodicarbonamide] FAO Nutrition Meetings Report Series No. 40A,B,C. WHO/Food Add./67.29&lt;/ref&gt; The main reaction product is [[biurea]], a derivative of [[urea]], which is stable during baking.&lt;ref name="WHOFAO" /&gt; Secondary reaction products include [[semicarbazide]] and [[ethyl carbamate]].&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt; It is known by the [[E number]] '''E927'''. Many restaurants in the US fast food industry removed the additive in response to negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-08/the-yoga-mat-chemical-s-quiet-fast-food-exit|title= The Yoga-Mat Chemical’s Quiet Fast-Food Exit|accessdate=2016-08-08|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and regulation==
In a 1999 report, the [[World Health Organization]] has linked exposure to azodicarbonamide at workplaces where it is manufactured or handled in raw form to "respiratory issues, allergies and asthma". The available data are restricted to these occupational environments. Exposure of the general public to azodicarbonamide could not be evaluated because of the lack of available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad16.pdf|title=Concise International Chemical Assessment Document 16: Azodicarbonamide|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO concluded, "The level of risk is uncertain; hence, exposure levels should be reduced as much as possible".

In some jurisdictions, the use of azodicarbonamide as a flour bleaching agent has been phased out. For example, it is no longer authorized for use in Australia and the [[European Union]] as a food additive.&lt;ref name="FADB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Food additives data book|last=Smith|first=Jim|last2=Hong-Shum|first2=Lily|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1405195430|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|page=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union: Authorisation of Additives|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/|author=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=2014-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231123803/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/|archive-date=2014-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azodicarbonamide as a blowing agent in plastics has been banned in the European Union since August 2005 for the manufacture of plastic articles that are intended to come into direct contact with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:007:0045:0046:EN:PDF|title=COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2004/1/EC of 6 January 2004 amending Directive 2002/72/EC as regards the suspension of the use of azodicarbonamide as blowing agent|date=2004-01-13|accessdate=2011-03-10|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]] has identified azodicarbonamide as a respiratory sensitizer (a possible cause of [[asthma]]) in workplace settings and determined that containers of it should be labeled with "May cause sensitisation by inhalation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsrep.org.au/index.cfm?section=10&amp;Category=69&amp;viewmode=content&amp;contentid=62 |title=Substances causing/worsening asthma |work=UK Occupational Health and Safety |publisher=[[WorkSafe Victoria]] |accessdate=2010-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531062959/http://www.ohsrep.org.au/index.cfm?section=10&amp;Category=69&amp;viewmode=content&amp;contentid=62 |archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the United States, azodicarbonamide has a [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) status and is allowed to be added to flour at levels up to 45 [[parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1, 2012|title=21CFR172.806|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.806|work=[[Code of Federal Regulations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FADB" /&gt; However, use in products intended for human consumption is in decline under pressure of the public opinion.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 2014, amid public discomfort with the dual uses of azodicarbonamide, the sandwich franchise [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and hamburger franchise [[Wendy's]] announced that they would no longer use it as a dough conditioner.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/06/health/subway-bread-chemical/|title=Subway to remove 'dough conditioner' chemical from bread|date=February 17, 2014|agency=CNN|last1=Landau|first1=Elizabeth|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] stated azodicarbonamide "has been poorly tested" and advocates for reducing the amount of azodicarbonamide that is allowed to be used in food.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Azodicarbonamide was added to the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH Regulation]] candidate [[Substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] list in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table?p_p_id=disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_pos=2&amp;p_p_col_count=3&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_keywords=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_orderByCol=dte_inclusion&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_advancedSearch=false&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_casNumber=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_deltaParamValue=50&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_andOperator=true&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_haz_detailed_concern=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_name=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_orderByType=desc&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_ecNumber=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_dte_inclusionFrom=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_dte_inclusionTo=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_doSearch=&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_resetCur=false&amp;_disslists_WAR_disslistsportlet_delta=200|title=Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6363">A '''chief strategy officer''' ('''CSO'''), or '''chief strategist''', is an [[executive (management)|executive]] responsible for assisting the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) with developing, communicating, executing, and sustaining corporate strategic initiatives.  Some companies give the title [[Chief Business Officer]] to its senior executives who are holding the top strategy role.

Today, many CEOs have less time to devote to executing strategy, while at the same time uncertain environments increase the need for professional strategy development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2007/10/the-chief-strategy-officer/ar/1 The Chief Strategy Officer, ''Harvard Business Review'', Oct. 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=1392 The Chief Strategy Officer in the European Firm: Professionalising Strategy in Times of Uncertainty, ''The European Business Review'', May-Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Chairmen, Presidents, and CEOs in [[academic institution|academic]], [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and [[corporate]] organizations are appointing CSOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/us-en/outlook/Pages/outlook-journal-2008-chief-strategy-officer.aspx Rise of the Chief Strategy Officer, ''Outlook Journal'', Jan. 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philanthropy.com/article/More-Charities-Hiring-Chief/142083/ Charities Turn to Chief Strategy Officers To Help Plan Their Future, ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'', Oct. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the CSO position increased in popularity, which is reflected by the high number of US companies (nearly 50% of [[S&amp;P 500]] firms) who created CSO positions in their top management teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/smj.2104 | volume=35 | title=Chief strategy officers: Contingency analysis of their presence in top management teams | year=2013 | journal=Strategic Management Journal | pages=461–471 | last1 = Menz | first1 = Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSO is a consultative role; part leader and part doer, with the responsibility of ensuring that execution of the strategy supports the strategy elements. This unique background takes a multitude of different operating experiences, and must include being both a creative thinker and influential collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ephorgroup.com/chiefstrategyofficer.asp The Role of the Chief Strategy Officer, ''Ephor Group'']&lt;/ref&gt; CSOs are often executives who have worn many hats at a variety of companies or agencies before taking on the responsibilities and tasks that come with the job title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2007/10/the-chief-strategy-officer/ar/1 The Chief Strategy Officer, ''Harvard Business Review'', Oct. 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/us-en/outlook/Pages/outlook-journal-2008-chief-strategy-officer.aspx Rise of the Chief Strategy Officer, ''Outlook Journal'', Jan. 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical CSO responsibilities include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/strategic_planning_business_unit_strategy_understanding_role_chief_strategy_officer/?chapter=2 Understanding the Role of the Chief Strategy Officer, ''BCG Perspectives'', December 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Communicating and implementing a company's strategy internally and externally so that all employees, partners, suppliers, and contractors understand the company-wide strategic plan and how it carries out the company's overall goals.
*Driving decision-making that creates medium- and long-term improvement.
*Establishing and reviewing key strategic priorities and translating them into a comprehensive strategic plan.
*Monitoring the execution of the strategic plan.
*Facilitating and driving key strategic initiatives through inception phase.
*Ensuring departmental/unit strategic planning projects reflect organizational strategic priorities.
*Partnering with institutional leadership, special committees, and consultants to support execution of key initiatives.
*Developing inclusive planning processes.
*Translating strategies into actionable and quantitative plans.
*Mobilizing and managing teams of individuals charged with executing strategies.
*Acting as a resource across an organization to increase broad cohesion for strategic plans.

In terms of the CSO’s role, which varies significantly from organization to organization and evolves over time, the two basic roles ''strategy developer'' and ''strategy implementer'' are observable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rolandberger.com/publications/publication_pdf/roland_berger_tab_the_strategists_change_1.pdf The Strategist’s Change, ''Think Act'', Nov. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy can be further divided into four CSO archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-role-of-the-chief-strategy-officer/ The Role of the Chief Strategy Officer, ''MIT Sloan Management Review'', Fall 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Internal Consultant: focused almost exclusively on strategy formulation.
*Specialist: have specialized skills that are not otherwise present within an organization.
*Coach: work to provide information to strategy creators and facilitate communication between teams, team members and stakeholders.
*Change Agents: facilitate and enable.

== Chief Global Strategist ==
A Chief Global Strategist (CGS) is one of the highest-ranking corporate officers, administrators, corporate administrators, executives, or executive officers, in charge of the [[global strategy]] and the domestic and international expansion of a [[corporation]], [[company]], [[non-profit organization|organization]], or [[government agency|agency]].

The position is relatively new in the private sector, and a reflection of the influence of [[globalization]] upon companies and other organizations that seek to expand their influence, whether as a matter of necessity to survive, or the exploration of an opportunity.

A prominent example of a CGS is [[Howard Schultz]] of [[Starbucks|Starbucks Corporation]] who was [[Chairman]] and [[CEO]]; however, in 2000 he left the position of CEO to become the Chief Global Strategist. Schultz returned to his previous role as CEO on January 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Starbucks Corporation Timeline |url=http://www.starbucks.com/about-us/company-information/starbucks-company-timeline\ |accessdate=26 September 2016 |publisher=Starbucks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Child and family services''' is a [[government]] and/or [[non-profit organisation]] designed to better the well being of individuals who come from unfortunate situations, ''environmental'' or ''biological''. People who seek or are sought after to participate in these homes have no other resource to turn to. Children might come from [[child abuse|abusive]] or [[neglect]]ful homes, or live in very poor and dangerous communities. There are also agencies that cater to people who have [[genetic disease|biological deficiencies]]. Families that are trying to live in stable lives come to non-profit organisations for hope of a better future. Child and family services cater to many different types of people who are all in different situations. These services might be mandated through the courts via a governmental [[child protection|child protection agency]] or they might be voluntary. Child and family services may be mandated if:
#There is domestic violence in the home
#There is abuse or neglect in the home
#Constant negativity amongst family members which could lead to violent behavior
##[[Physical abuse]]
##[[Emotional abuse]]
##[[Sexual abuse]]

==Historical overview==
The history of the United States' response to child abuse and neglect has been marked by a tension between two missions:
#an emphasis on rescuing children from abusive or neglectful families on the one hand
#and efforts to support and preserve their families on the other.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
The legal basis for efforts to protect needy children in colonial times rested on the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|English Poor Law of 1601]]. This placed the public responsibility for the poor in the hands of local townspeople. Parents were not held accountable for their children, which lead parent’s to tend to neglect their children and their duties as a parent. The attention of community leaders, [[philanthropists]], and social reformers who were concerned about child abuse and neglect focused primarily on the children of the poorest families and on those who were [[orphaned]], abandoned, or unsupervised.

=== 20th century ===
During most of the 19th century, destitute children were sent to institutions operated by private charitable organizations. Many poor or abandoned children were sent to live in [[almshouses]]—facilities established in the 19th century in many large cities to house the very poor of all ages. Almshouses provided minimal standard of care to orphaned or needy children and to [[impoverished]], [[insane]], or [[disease]]d adults. The almshouses caused the children greater hardships because they were subject to disease and chaos.

The second half of the 20th century saw increasing criticism of the impacts the unsanitary, chaotic almshouses had on children, especially the very young, who suffered high [[mortality rates]] there. Due to this, private charities and religious groups began to establish [[orphanages]] or children's asylums to separate needy children from adults and protect them from disease, maltreatment, and such. Many parents were losing custody of their children because the private organizations were able to prove they would be able to take care of the children in need better than their parents could. Children began to feel disconnected from their parents because they had been placed to grow up with other families.

===Development===
Child and family services have significantly developed over the last few centuries. Many different forms of help for children and families in need were offered throughout the community. Today we have many different agencies to help with the [[Quality of life|welfare]] and survival of many children and their families. However, years ago, many people relied on their community and religion to get them through tougher times. The community's investment in the well-being of its children is reflected in the [[cultural mores]] and [[social norms]], and in legal frameworks that permit intervention in individual families when children are abused or neglected.

The formal system through which society responds to [[child abuse]] and [[neglect]] is now largely a governmental one. Today, primary responsibility for [[child protection]] is vested in public [[child protective services (CPS) agencies]], which receive, investigate, and respond to reports of child abuse and neglect. These agencies are usually linked to [[child welfare departments]] with broader responsibilities which include [[foster care]] and [[adoption]]. Usually at this point, the parents lose their right to take care of their children because they are seen to be unfit parents.  Today, it is against the law to not report child abuse if evident. Many parents do not realize that they are candidates for the potential loss of their children to government agencies because of their issues, such as poverty, mental illness, or neglect that lead to child abuse.

==Two-generation family strategies==
Census data shows that in the United States almost half of all children live in low-income families.&lt;ref name="Aspen Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-Generation Playbook|website=Ascend: The Aspen Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests a critical connection between parent well-being and the child’s emotional, physical, and economic well-being; as well as, a connection to the child’s educational and workforce success.&lt;ref name="MC Article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ensuring Children Thrive While Parents Move Ahead|website=Michigan's Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the crucial connection between parent and child well-being, many services designed to help low-income families target either the parent or the child, leaving someone behind. Two-generation family programs coordinate services that aid low-income parents and children simultaneously, putting the whole family on a path to success.&lt;ref name= "Promoting Two-Gen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Christopher T.|last2=Coffey|first2=Rheagan|last3=Smith|first3=Tara C.|title=Promoting Two Generation Strategies: A Getting-Started Guide for State and Local Policy Makers|website=Foundation for Child Development|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two generation family services aim to end the inter-generational cycle of poverty by moving families to economic stability and security through education, workforce training, and related support services.&lt;ref name="Promoting Two-Gen" /&gt; Though each two generation program approach is different they all have three intentionally linked components: education and/or job training for parents that leads to family-supporting employment, high quality early childhood education, and family support services.&lt;ref name="MC Article" /&gt;

===Parent education and job training===
Two generation family programs aim to get parents to a place of economic stability and security where they can secure employment that enables them to support their family and improve child outcomes.&lt;ref name="MC Article" /&gt; Programs aid parents in getting to economic security through education and job training opportunities. Two generation program educational opportunities typically involve general educational development (GED) courses, and connections to post-secondary education supports, such as, financial aid or access to full-day childcare.&lt;ref name="Aspen Institute" /&gt; In addition to education services, two generation family programs often utilize sector-based workforce development. This type of workforce development targets job training for specific industries that will meet regional workforce needs, increasing the chances that graduates of the program will be able to find work.&lt;ref name="Promoting Two-Gen" /&gt;

===High-quality early childhood education===
Two generation family programs include high quality early childhood education that nurtures children's learning and development.&lt;ref name="MC Article" /&gt; Investing in high quality early childhood education that extends from pre-K through third grade improves educational achievement throughout schooling and success in the workforce.&lt;ref name="Promoting Two-Gen" /&gt; Programs can utilize existing early childhood development programs (i.e. Early Start or Head Start) and add two-generation elements such as offering full-day/full-year services to support working parents.&lt;ref name="Promoting Two-Gen" /&gt;

===Family support services===
Two-generation family programs offer comprehensive wraparound services to support families.&lt;ref name="MC Article" /&gt; Examples of these support services include access to physical and mental health services for children, career coaches, case managers, family planning, and food assistance.&lt;ref name="Aspen Institute" /&gt; These services aim to help expand family resources and support networks.&lt;ref name="Aspen Institute" /&gt;

==Child care in the United States==
[[File:Center-Based Child Care Costs and Other Major Household Expenses.png|thumb|Average Annual Expenditures for a Family of Four in the United States (two adults, two children)]]

Research suggests that child care is a critical component of livable communities for many families in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and that local planning policies can play an important role in ensuring adequate child care. The majority of parents who work depend upon formal, organized out-of-home care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Planning Association|title=The Important of Enduring Adequate Child Care in Planning Practice.|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that families are paying a significant part of their earnings for child care. Between 2011 and 2012, the cost of child care increased at up to eight times the rate of increases in family income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Child Care Aware of America|title=Parents and the High Cost of Child Care: 2012 Report|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a four-year-old child, center-based care ranges from about $4,300 in Mississippi to $12,350 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Child Care Aware of America|title=Parents and the High Cost of Child Care: 2013 Report|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower income families have been disproportionately affected by these increases in child care costs. Working families at or near the poverty line did not receive any or enough child care assistance to be able to stay employed and off welfare, and only 12% to 15% of eligible families were served by a Child Care Development Fund subsidy in 1998–1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=A|title=The Impact of Child Care Subsidies on Single Mothers' Work Effort|journal=Review of Policy Research|date=2006|volume=23|pages=699–711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Options for accessibility===
Child care subsidies is an option used in many states to help parents pay for child care. These subsidies aid low-income families with children under age 13 in paying for child care so that parents can work or participate in training or education activities. Parents typically receive subsidies in the form of vouchers that they can use with a provider (e.g. relative, neighbor, child care center, or after-school program.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Administration for Children and Family Services|title=Characteristics of Families Served by Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Based on Preliminary FY 2013 Data|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional government programs aim to make child care more affordable. Medium and low income families receive earned income tax credits to compensate for money they allocated to child care arrangements. Individuals may claim up to $3,000 of expenses paid in a year for one qualifying individual (a dependent child age 12 or younger) or $6,000 for two or more qualifying individuals on their tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Internal Revenue Service|title=Ten Things to Know About the Child and Dependent Care Credit|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits from the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) concentrate on low-income families. In contrast, the dependent exemption and the virtually nonrefundable Child Tax Credit (CTC) benefited higher income families with benefits gradually increasing as a person’s tax liability increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maag|first1=E|title=Simplicity: Considerations in Designing a Unified Tax Credit|journal=National Tax Journal|date=2010|volume=63|issue=4|pages=765–780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal child care is another way to make child care more widely accessible. For example, in Sweden, public childcare is guaranteed to all parents and it operates on a whole-day basis. Parental fees are directly proportional to parents' income and inversely proportional to the number of children in a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=European Union|title=Sweden: Successful Reconciliation of Work and Family Life. European Platform for Investing in Children.|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, another viable option is to increase tax credits for low and medium income families. Currently, President [[Barack Obama]] has outlined a plan to triple the child tax care credit to $3,000 per young child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The White House|title=Fact Sheet: Helping All Working Families with Young Children Afford Child Care.|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression==
The demands that [[urbanization]], [[industrialization]], and [[immigration]] placed on poor and working-class families in the late 19th century left many children unattended. Rural states relied on family placements to care for their own homeless or dependent children. This was a precursor for today's foster care system.

As a general progressive agenda of [[social reform]] was adapted in the early years if the 20th century, the approach of assisting parents to care for their children was more widely endorsed. A new policy was issued, stating, "No child should be removed from the home unless it is impossible to construct family conditions or to build and supplement family resources as to make the home safe for the child..."
There is still evidence from the 19th century of abandoned children. A 137-year-old foundation for children called [[New York Foundling Asylum]] has recently discovered letters from the parents who had abandoned their children in front of the agency because they were unable to care for them. New York Foundling Asylum was a family service agency that cared for thousands of children who had no homes and needed help, otherwise they would have been left on the cold street. This foundation saved thousands of lives and set a tone for other private organizations to contribute as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/nyregion/03foundling.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">'''The Citizens Centre for Freedom and Democracy''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] non-profit organization based in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], promoting responsible [[government]] and advocating provincial rights, Senate reform, and judicial restraint.

== History ==
The Citizens Centre for Freedom and Democracy was established in 2003, by [[Link Byfield]], a journalist and businessman best known as a writer, editor, and publisher of the ''[[Alberta Report]]'' magazine, and one of Alberta's [[senators-in-waiting]].  Byfield was the centre's founding [[chairman]].  Its operations manager is [[Craig Docksteader]], formerly of the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]].

In October 2006, the Centre hosted the [[Calgary Congress]], which explored [[Canada|Canadian]] [[federalism]].  Attendees included [[Preston Manning]], [[Ralph Klein]], [[Jason Kenney]], and separatist [[Leon Craig]].  The congress concluded by advocating a rebalancing of confederation in conformation, making provinces fully responsible for their own internal social and economic affairs, the advocacy of an elected Senate to represent and protect the provinces, and the creation of counterbalances against centralizing tendencies and against expanding influence of Canada's [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

== Principles ==
The Citizens Centre for Freedom and Democracy promotes government that act with the following characteristics.

*Honest government - Honest government is [[Industry self-regulation|self-policing]], transparent, open, respectful and impartial.
*Accountable government - Accountable government is [[democracy|democratic]]. All public policies set by courts and cabinets are subjected to approval, scrutiny and amendment by the elected representatives of the people, or by [[referendum]].
*Constitutional government - Constitutional government is self-restrained, confining its activities and taxation to the responsibilities laid down by the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Acts]].

==Entry into politics==
In June 2007, the Citizens Centre decided to abandon its earlier decision to remain a non-partisan lobby group, and instead to enter the political arena by forming the [[Wildrose Alliance Party]].

'''Collective Impact''' (CI) is the commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem, using a structured form of collaboration. The concept of collective impact was first articulated in the 2011 [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]] article ''Collective Impact'',&lt;ref name="ssireview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/collective_impact |title=Collective Impact &amp;#124; Stanford Social Innovation Review |publisher=Ssireview.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by John Kania, Managing Director at FSG, and Mark Kramer, [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School]] at Harvard and Co-founder FSG.  Collective impact was chosen as the #2 [[philanthropy]] buzzword for 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropy-Buzzwords-of-2011/130151/ |title=Philanthropy Buzzwords of 2011 - The Chronicle of Philanthropy |publisher=Philanthropy.com |date=2011-12-27 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been recognized by the [[White House Council for Community Solutions]] as an important framework for progress on [[social issues]].&lt;ref name="bridgespan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgespan.org/Publications-and-Tools/Revitalizing-Communities/Community-Collaboratives/Needle-Moving-Collective-Impact-Three-Guides-to-Cr.aspx#.Ufkh8I21HIt |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707233741/http://www.bridgespan.org/Publications-and-Tools/Revitalizing-Communities/Community-Collaboratives/Needle-Moving-Collective-Impact-Three-Guides-to-Cr.aspx |archivedate=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of collective impact hinges on the idea that in order for organizations to create lasting solutions to social problems on a large-scale, they need to coordinate their efforts and work together around a clearly defined goal.&lt;ref name="ssireview1"/&gt;  The approach of collective impact is placed in contrast to “isolated impact,” where organizations primarily work alone to solve social problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-schmitz/collective-impact_b_1920466.html |title=The Real Challenge for Collective Impact &amp;#124; Paul Schmitz |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws on earlier works on [[collaborative leadership]], focused on collective goals, strategic partnerships, collective and independent action aligned with those goals, shared accountability, and a backbone "institutional worrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools.|last=Rubin|first=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective impact is based on organizations  forming cross-sector [[coalition]]s  to make meaningful and sustainable progress on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130802023905/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/the-power-of-partnerships/?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
Hank Rubin (author of ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools'', Corwin press, 2009) and Leonard Brock (director of the Rochester NY Anti-Poverty Initiative) offer a  practical description of collective impact by contrasting it with collaboration: “Collective impact really is much more than collaboration! Collaboration happens when we meet together; collective impact is what we do when we’re alone … Collaboration happens when we choose to sit in the same room and work together on the same project because we share an interest in accomplishing a shared goal … On the other hand, collective impact focuses on change inside each partner organization. It begins when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes … and then, individually, go back into our home organizations, work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we – individually and organizationally – can best do to achieve those shared goals and then choose to make changes to accomplish this. When each of our organizations chooses to shift and align our own work and priorities in this way, we set changes in motion in all portions of our community. And these changes will last a long time.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/]{{Citation|last=|first=|title=More than collaboration|date=2017-03-05|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|work=Wikipedia|volume=|pages=|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five conditions==
Initiatives must meet five criteria in order to be considered collective impact:&lt;ref name="ssireview1"/&gt;
*'''''Common agenda:''''' All participating organizations ([[government agency|government agencies]], [[Nonprofit organization|non-profits]], [[community development|community members]], etc.) have a shared vision for social change that includes a common understanding of the problem and a joint approach to solving the problem through agreed upon actions.
*'''''Shared measurement system:''''' Agreement on the ways success will be measured and reported with key indicators by all participating organizations.
*'''''Mutually reinforcing activities:''''' Engagement of a diverse set of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], typically in multiple sectors, coordinating a set of differentiated activities through a mutually reinforcing plan of action.
*'''''Continuous communication:''''' Frequent communications over a long period of time among key players within and between organizations, to build trust and encourage ongoing learning and adaptation.
*'''''Backbone organization:''''' Ongoing support provided by an independent staff.

The [[White House Council for Community Solutions]] has recognized the potential of collective impact to play a major role in transforming the ways in which communities approach their social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serve.gov/sites/default/files/ctools/CommunityCollaborativesWhitepaper_0.pdf |format=PDF |title=The white House Council for Community Solutions : Community Collaboratives Whitepaper |publisher=Serve.gov |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 report for the Council found that, among 12 “needle-moving community collaboratives” that had achieved at least 10 percent progress in a community wide metric, all 12 met the conditions of collective impact.&lt;ref name="bridgespan1"/&gt;

The White House Council's work in collective impact is being continued today by the [[Aspen Institute|Aspen]] Forum for Community Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/community-solutions |title=Forum for Community Solutions |publisher=The Aspen Institute |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014  iit launched the Collective Impact Forum (n partnership with FSG,), an online community to  support those practicing collective impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectiveimpactforum.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Collective Impact Forum |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Breastfeeding Committee (USBC) is the “backbone organization” for a nationwide coalition of 50 healthcare organizations that support healthy breastfeeding initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/strategic-framework.|title=USBC Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goal #3 of the 2014 [http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/strategic-framework USBC Strategic Framework] is “engage stakeholders in a collective impact model”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017, the USBC updated its strategy to emphasize its [[organizational commitment]] to breastfeeding [[health equity]]. This  reflects current demands from critics who want a general frame of equity added to the collective impact model framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collectiveimpactforum.org/blogs/51306/advancing-practice-collective-impact|title=Collective Impact Forum {{!}} Blog|website=collectiveimpactforum.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques of Collective impact  ==

Corporate CEOs, small business leaders, non-profit and social-sector executives, government officials and community service practitioners have  made contributions to the evolving concept in the form of insights, feedback and critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collectiveimpactforum.org/blogs/1301/collective-impact-principles-practice-putting-collective-impact-action|title=Collective Impact Forum {{!}} Blog|website=collectiveimpactforum.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;Community psychologist Tom Wolff argues that John Kania and Mark Kramer’s concept of collective impact “fails to adequately acknowledge, understand, and address” the framework in the context of community organizing. He lists the following ''Ten Places Where Collective Impact Gets It Wrong'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gjcpp.org/en/resource.php?issue=21&amp;resource=200|title=Ten Places Where Collective Impact Gets It Wrong  by  Tom Wolff  in GJCPP Volume 7 Issue 1 2016|website=www.gjcpp.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Collective Impact does not address the essential requirement for meaningfully engaging those in the community most affected by the issues.
# A corollary of the above is that Collective Impact emerges from top-down business consulting experience and is thus not a true community development model.
# Collective Impact does not include policy change and systems change as essential and intentional outcomes of the partnership’s work.
# Collective Impact as described in Kania and Kramer’s initial article is not based on professional and practitioner literature or the experience of the thousands of coalitions that preceded their 2011 article.
# Collective Impact misses the social justice core that exists in many coalitions.
# Collective Impact mislabels their study of a few case examples as “research.”
# Collective Impact assumes that most coalitions are capable of finding the funds to have a well- funded backbone organization.
#  Collective Impact also misses a key role of the Backbone Organization – building leadership.
#  Community wide, multi-sectoral collaboratives cannot be simplified into Collective Impact’s five required conditions.
# The early available research on Collective Impact is calling into question the contribution that Collective Impact is making to coalition effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Wolff’s claim that collective impact is a “failed model” has caught the attention of community service practitioners who are also skeptics of the model’s “five conditions”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/01/09/collaborating-equity-justice-moving-beyond-collective-impact/|title=Collaborating for Equity and Justice: Moving Beyond Collective Impact - Non Profit News {{!}} Nonprofit Quarterly|website=nonprofitquarterly.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling it a top-down model for excluding community members as key stakeholders and partners of collaboration, Wolff has attracted input from many other non-profit and social-sector critics who also want the model to add elements of diversity and inclusion, civic participation, [[social justice]] and equity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Social sector leaders echo these critiques in publications like [[The Philanthropist|''The Philanthropist'']], calling the five-pillared framework too simple for its intended purpose of tackling complex problems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Weaver, L. (2014). The promise and peril of collective impact.'' The Philanthropist, 26'', 11-19.[https://thephilanthropist.ca/original-pdfs/Philanthropist-26-1-15.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing similarities between CI and other previously-popular but failed models of collaboration, community activists struggle to believe that CI has what it takes to build long-term, sustainable, conflict-free solutions to [[social justice]] issues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Pointing out several well-known [[Case study|case studies]] that underscore a real need for increased grassroots advocacy efforts, many critics believe Kania &amp; Kramer conducted inadequate research before designing their model.&lt;ref&gt;Christens, B. D., &amp; Inzeo, P. T. (2015). Widening the view: Situating collective impact among frameworks for community-led change.'' Community Development, 46''(4), 420-435.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, PolicyLink published a report called ''Equity: the soul of collective impact'', which identified racial and economic equity as the most vital missing pieces of Kania &amp; Kramer’s concept.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With no mention of equity in the CI framework, PolicyLink executives argue that CI initiatives fail to address tense power dynamics that continue to polarize American communities and therefore impede progress on [[social change]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future of Collective impact ==
With high demand for adding a new equity frame to the original framework, Living Cities has partnered with The Collective Impact Forum to work exclusively on reforming the model for this purpose.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Raderstrong, J., &amp; Boyea-Robinson, T. (2016). The why and how of working with communities through collective impact.'' Community Development, 47''(2), 181-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Founders Kania &amp; Kramer, as well as organizations like PolicyLink, Aspen Forum for Community Solutions and Urban Strategies Council have also joined this effort, signaling that opinions from the field have been taken seriously, helping the concept adapt and grow with transparency and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kania, J., &amp; Kramer, M. (2015). The equity imperative in collective impact.'' Stanford Social Innovation Review, ''36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing discussions and updates are viewable at the Collective Impact Forum website where public input and participation is encouraged as CI continues to evolve with increased attention to community needs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Founding authors Kania and Kramer have responded to critics expressing appreciation for their interest and perspective on the topic, encouraging their continued input throughout the process to refine the model.

“As this movement continues to evolve, we look forward to additional contributions such as Wolff’s published editorial (and the myriad of contributions we list here, as well as many others) that can deepen understanding of how best to practice collective impact in a manner that leads to a more just and equitable world”.&lt;ref&gt;Kania, J., &amp; Kramer, M. (2016). Advancing the practice of collective impact. ''Blog: Collective Impact Forum.''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wolff however, believes the model is flawed beyond repair and needs full replacement rather than reform.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Suggesting six principles in the [[Nonprofit Quarterly|NonProfit Quarterly]]’s 2017 ''Collaborating for Equity and Social Justice Toolkit'', Wolff empowers social innovators and thought leaders to design collaboration models for the future that will “leave the power in the hands of community residents”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Commander's Emergency Response Program''' or CERP is money for military commanders to use for conducting rebuilding and reconstruction during the [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] Wars. It was initially money seized during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], but later was also U.S. Federally [[Appropriation bill|appropriated]] funds.
The military must use the money for the benefit of the Iraqi or Afghan people, such as public roads, schools and medical clinics or [[humanitarian aid]]. The funds for CERP come from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The use of funds in the field can be authorized by military commanders at the brigade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopp|first=Harry|title=Career Diplomacy, Second Ed.|year=2011|publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58901-740-5|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules governing the use of such funds will be based on any Congressional restrictions in the legislation, and will be tailored to the needs of the particular operation.

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Common Agricultural Policy''' ('''CAP''') is the agricultural policy of the [[European Union]]. It implements a system of [[agricultural subsidies]] and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has undergone several changes since then to reduce the cost (from 71% of the EU budget in 1984 to 39% in 2013) and to also consider rural development in its aims. It has been criticised on the grounds of its cost, and its environmental and humanitarian impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capreform.eu/the-draft-2015-cap-budget/ |title=The draft 2015 CAP budget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenny |first=Misha |date=2008 |title=McMafia: A Journey Through The Global Criminal Underworld |publisher=Knopf |page=10 |isbn=1400095123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The circumstance that led to the development of the CAP occurred in the late 1950s to late 1960s. At the time, there was no example of a successful agricultural integration in Europe. However, two main factors contributed to the creation of this policy. This includes the promise EEC made to France bargaining the integrated agriculture policy in favor of France's part in ratifying the Treaty of Rome and due to a lack of substantial policy in agriculture beyond a few pre-existing legal stipulations that some considered, “weak, vague and highly underdeveloped.” Thus, leading to the creation of article 39 in a set of five social and economic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, N. Piers. "The Making of the CAP: Towards a Historical Analysis of the EU's First Major Policy." Contemporary European History 14.03 (2005): 349-50. &lt;/ref&gt; As part of building a common market, tariffs on agricultural products would have to be removed. However, the political clout of farmers and the sensitivity of the issue made it take many years before the CAP was fully implemented.

===Beginnings===
The [[Spaak Report]] of 1956 stated that a European common market that excluded agriculture was unthinkable.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Fennell, ''The Common Agricultural Policy: Continuity and Change'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that security of food supply was paramount and raised a series of questions about agriculture that needed to be answered by policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Rome]], signed in March 1957, established the [[European Economic Community]] and it was mainly due to the French pressure that the Treaty included agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to disagreements within the [[Inner Six|Six]] over agricultural policy, the articles on agriculture were vague and policy making was left until after the Treaty had been signed.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 39.1 of the Treaty set out the objectives of the CAP: to increase productivity through technical progress and the best use of the factors of production (such as labour); to ensure a fair standard of living for communities employed in agriculture; to stabilise markets; to secure the availability of supplies; and to enforce fair prices.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 39.2 stated that policy makers must take into account three factors: the circumstances of each agricultural activity due to the social structure of agricultural communities and the inequalities between richer and poorer regions; the need to act gradually to allow agriculture sufficient time to adjust; and to remember that agriculture was heavily integrated in the wider economy.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 40 provided for the common organisation of markets and common prices, along with a fund to pay for it.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 41 allowed for the introduction of additional measures to implement Article 39, such as the co-ordination of vocational education and research, the "dissemination of agricultural knowledge" and the encouragement of consumption of certain goods.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 42 allowed the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the Community]] to decide how far the regulations on competition could apply to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This Article also allowed them to grant aid.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 3&amp;ndash;12 July 1958 in [[Stresa]], the Community held an agricultural conference attended by agricultural ministers from member states and the [[President of the European Commission|President]] of the [[European Commission]], [[Walter Hallstein]], along with observers representing agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Three working parties at the conference investigated: the current state of agriculture and the agricultural policies of member states; the short-term effects of the implementation of the Rome Treaty; and the long-term aims of the CAP.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the conference, Hallstein complained of urbanisation that was leading to rural depopulation and he lamented the "clash of cultures" in which rural life and rural values were considered inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallstein also reflected on the [[Cold War]] threat from [[communism]]:
[[Image:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004665-0003, Walter Hallstein.jpg|thumb|Walter Hallstein, President of the European Commission during the CAP's formative years.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the core of Europe's achievements which is under threat: a whole civilization which rests on the inalienable freedom and dignity of the individual...this tragedy of liberty is also a tragedy of the rural class. Let us look around us, and, alas, we have not far to look; the rural class is its first victim. It is for this reason that we are convinced that the European rural class will count among the most trustworthy pillars of our unified European market. Because its fate is also at stake, and is one of the first threatened. In this room there is no one whose family tree doesn't reach back, sooner or later, to farming roots. We know what the rural class means to Europe, not only through its economic values, but also by its moral and social values.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference's Final Resolution argued for the vital importance of agriculture in economic and social life and expressed their unanimous wish to preserve the character of European farming, which was predominately based on small-size, family holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed that it was necessary to help these farms increase their economic capacity and competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They also advocated structural changes to rationalise and cheapen production, which was intended to improve productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Resolution also included a commitment to a price policy.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, during 1958&amp;ndash;1959, the Commission drafted the CAP and the [[European Parliament|Assembly]] commissioned reports into agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission submitted draft proposals in November 1959 (which were debated in the Assembly and by the [[European Economic and Social Committee|Economic and Social Committee]]) and its final report in June 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In December the Council agreed to a system of import levies (for grain, sugar, pork, eggs and poultry) and to commodity regimes for agricultural produce.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; They also introduced the principle of Community Preference in the implementation of the levies and for the negotiation of commercial treaties with outside countries; this ensured that any trade concession granted to an outside country could not weaken the European producer in the Community market.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund was founded to provide money for the CAP's market regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the Fund was split into two bodies, the Guarantee side implemented market and price support and the Guidance part supplied structural aid.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; A Community regulation of 1964 provided detailed arrangements for the working of the Fund, including for estimating export refunds, the Community's main tool for controlling the market.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, pp. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Market regimes had been implemented for most agricultural produce by the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement in 1966 facilitated the completion of the single market for agriculture (which came into effect a year later), a single price support system and uniform protection against imports from outside countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallstein hailed this agreement as the single most important stage in forging European unity because it helped to complete the CAP.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels.jpg|thumb|Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels]]
The six member states individually strongly intervened in their agricultural sectors, in particular with regard to what was produced, maintaining prices for goods and how farming was organised. The intervention posed an obstacle to free trade in goods while the rules continued to differ from state to state since freedom of trade would contradict the intervention policies. Some members, particularly France, and all farming professional organisations wanted to maintain strong state intervention in agriculture. That could not be achieved unless policies were harmonised and transferred to the European Community level.

By 1962, three major principles had been established to guide the CAP: market unity, community preference and financial solidarity. Since then, the CAP has been a central element in the European institutional system.

The CAP is often explained as the result of a political compromise between France and Germany: German industry would have access to the French market; in exchange, Germany would help pay for France's farmers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economics of Europe'' – Dennis Swann (p. 232)&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAP has always been a difficult area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change for the first time in 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the farming lobby's power has been a factor determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In recent times change has been more forthcoming because of external trade demands and intrusion in agricultural affairs by other parts of the EU policy framework, such as consumer advocate [[working group]]s and the environmental departments of the Union. In addition, [[Euroscepticism]] in states such as the UK and Denmark is fed in part by the CAP, which Eurosceptics consider detrimental to their economies.

Proponents claim that the CAP is an exceptional economic sector as it protects the "rural way of life" although it is recognised that it affects world poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/06/130&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Rapid – Press Releases – EUROPA |publisher=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early attempts at reform===

====Mansholt Plan====
On 21 December 1962, [[Sicco Mansholt]], the [[European Commissioner for Agriculture]], sent a memorandum to the Council of Ministers concerning agricultural reform in the European Community.&lt;ref&gt;Wyn Grant, ''The Common Agricultural Policy'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This long-term plan, also known as the '1980 Agricultural Programme' or the 'Report of the Gaichel Group', named after the village in Luxembourg in which it had been prepared, laid the foundations for a new social and structural policy for European agriculture.

The Mansholt Plan noted the limits to a policy of price and market support. It predicted the imbalance that would occur in certain markets unless the Community undertook to reduce its land under cultivation by at least five million hectares. Mansholt also noted that the standard of living of farmers had not improved since the implementation of the CAP despite an increase in production and permanent increases in Community expenditure. He, therefore, suggested that production methods should be reformed and modernized and that small farms, which were bound to disappear sooner or later, according to Community experts, should be increased in size. The aim of the Plan was to encourage nearly five million farmers to give up farming. That would make it possible to redistribute their land and increase the size of the remaining family farms. Farms were considered viable if they could guarantee for their owners an average annual income comparable to that of all the other workers in the region. In addition to vocational training measures, Mansholt also provided for welfare programmes to cover retraining and early retirement. Finally, he called on the Member States to limit direct aid to unprofitable farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/cap-history/crisis-years-1970s/com68-1000_en.pdf |title=Memorandum on the Reform of Agriculture in the European Economic Community And Annexes |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the increasingly angry reaction of the agricultural community, Mansholt was soon forced to reduce the scope of some of his proposals. Ultimately, the Mansholt Plan was reduced to just three European directives, which, in 1972, concerned the modernization of agricultural holdings, the cessation of certain agricultural activity and the training of farmers.

====Between Mansholt and MacSharry====
Hurt by the failure of Mansholt, would-be reformers were mostly absent throughout the 1970s, and reform proposals were few and far between. A system called "[[Agrimoney]]" was introduced as part of the fledgling EMU project but was deemed a failure and did not stimulate further reforms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The 1980s was the decade that saw the first true reforms of the CAP, foreshadowing further development from 1992 onwards. The influence of the farming bloc declined, and with it, reformers were emboldened. Environmentalists garnered great support in reforming the CAP, but it was financial matters that ultimately tipped the balance: due to huge [[overproduction]] the CAP was becoming expensive and wasteful.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} There was the introduction of a quota on dairy production in 1984 and, in 1988, a ceiling on EU expenditure to farmers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the basis of the CAP remained in place and it was not until 1992 that CAP reformers began to work in earnest.

===1992===
In 1992, the MacSharry reforms (named after the European Commissioner for Agriculture, [[Ray MacSharry]]) were created to limit rising production, while at the same time adjusting to the trend toward a more free agricultural market. The reforms reduced levels of support by 29% for cereals and 16% for beef. They also created '[[set-aside]]' payments to withdraw land from production, payments to limit stocking levels, and introduced measures to encourage retirement and [[afforestation]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Since the MacSharry reforms, cereal prices have been closer to the equilibrium level, there is greater transparency in costs of agricultural support and the 'decoupling' of income support from production support has begun. However, the administrative complexity involved invites fraud, and the associated problems of the CAP are far from being corrected.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

One of the factors behind the 1992 reforms was the need to reach agreement with the EU's external trade partners at the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) talks with regards to agricultural subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=Lee Ann|title=Agricultural Policy Reform in the European Community: A Three-Level Game Analysis|journal=International Organization|date=Winter 1997|volume=51|issue=1|pages=135–165|jstor=2703954|doi=10.1162/002081897550320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern reforms===
The current reform issues in EU agriculture are: lowering prices, ensuring food safety and quality, and guaranteeing stability of farmers' incomes. Other issues are environmental pollution, animal welfare and finding alternative income opportunities for farmers. Some of these issues are the responsibility of the member states.

====1999====
The 'Agenda 2000'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/enlargement/2004_and_2007_enlargement/l60001_en.htm |title=Agenda 2000: for a stronger and wider Union |publisher=Europa.eu |date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reforms divided the CAP into two 'Pillars': production support and rural development. Several rural development measures were introduced including [[Agricultural diversification|diversification]], setting up producer groups and support for young farmers. Agri-environment schemes became compulsory for every Member State (Dinan 2005: 367). The market support prices for cereals, milk and milk products and beef and veal were step-wise reduced while direct coupled payments to farmers were increased. Payments for major arable crops as cereals and oilseeds were harmonised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=EU-Commission, Directorate-General for Agriculture |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/publi/review99/08_09_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Agenda 2000 – A CAP for the future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the euro in 1999 also ended the use of green exchange rates such as the [[green pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998R2799:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex - 31998R2799 - EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Commission Report (2003)====
A 2003 report, commissioned by the European Commission, by a group of experts led by Belgian economist [[André Sapir]] stated that the budget structure was a "historical relic".&lt;ref name=sapir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swisscore.org/Policy%20docs/general_research/sapir_report_en.pdf |title=Sapir Report on budget reforms |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928112500/http://www.swisscore.org/Policy%20docs/general_research/sapir_report_en.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report suggested a reconsideration of EU policy, redirecting expenditure towards measures intended to increase wealth creation and cohesion of the EU. As a significant proportion of the budget is currently spent on agriculture and there is little prospect of the budget being increased, that would require reducing CAP expenditure. The report largely concerned itself to discussing alternative measures more useful to the EU, rather than discussing the CAP, but it also suggested that farm aid would be administered more effectively by member countries on an individual basis.

The report's findings were largely ignored. Instead, CAP spending was kept within the remit of the EU, and France led an effort to agree a fixed arrangement for CAP spending that would not be changed until 2012. It was made possible by advance agreement with Germany. It is that agreement that the UK currently wishes to see reopened, both in its efforts to defend the UK position on the [[UK rebate]] and also given that the UK is in favour of lowering barriers to entry for Third World agricultural exporters.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news |title=The battle of the budget |url=http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3722828 | work=The Economist | date=3 March 2005 |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decoupling (2003)====
On 26 June 2003, EU farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the CAP, based on "decoupling" subsidies from particular crops. (Member states may choose to maintain a limited amount of specific subsidy.) The new "single farm payments" are subject to "cross-compliance" conditions relating to environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. Many of them were already either good practice recommendations or separate legal requirements regulating farm activities. The aim is to make more money available for environmental quality or animal welfare programmes. The political scientist [[Peter Nedergaard]] has analysed the 2003 reform on the basis of [[rational choice theory]] and states that, "In order to arrive at an adequate explanation, an account of the policy entrepreneurship on the part of Commissioner [[Franz Fischler]] must be given."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nedergaard | first = Peter | title = The 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy: against all odds or rational explanations? | journal = [[Journal of European Integration]] | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–223 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/07036330600785749 | date = July 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07036330600785749 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}

Details of the UK scheme were still being decided at its introductory date of May 2005. Details of the scheme in each member country may be varied subject to outlines issued by the EU. In England, the [[Single Payment Scheme]] provides a single flat rate payment of around £230 per hectare for maintaining land in cultivatable condition. In Scotland, payments are based on a historical basis and can vary widely. The new scheme allows for much wider non-production use of land that may still receive the environmental element of the support. Additional payments are available if land is managed in a prescribed environmental manner.

The overall EU and national budgets for subsidy have been capped. That prevents a situation in such the EU is required to spend more on the CAP than its limited budget has.

The reforms enter into force in 2004–2005. (Member states may apply for a transitional period delaying the reform in their country to 2007 and phasing in reforms until 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm |title=2003 subsidy reforms| publisher=EU|accessdate=1 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sugar regime reform (2005–2006)===
One of the crops subsidised by the CAP is sugar produced from [[sugar beet]]; the EU is by far the largest sugar beet producer in the world, with annual production at 17&amp;nbsp;million [[metric ton]]s. That compares to levels produced by [[Brazil]] and [[India]], the two largest producers of sugar from [[sugar cane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/eval/reports/sugar/summ_en.pdf |title=Evaluation CMO sugar |publisher=Europa.eu.int |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209193030/http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/eval/reports/sugar/summ_en.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar was not included in the 1992 MacSherry reform or in the 1999 [[Agenda 2000]] decisions; sugar was also subject to a phase in (to 2009) under the [[Everything But Arms]] trade deal giving market access to [[least developed countries]]. As of 21 February 2006, the EU has decided to reduce the guaranteed price of sugar by 36% over four years, starting in 2006. European production was projected to fall sharply. According to the EU, this is the first serious reform of sugar under the CAP for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/194&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title= EU sugar reforms announcement | publisher=EU press release|accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/sugar/index_en.htm |title=Agriculture and Rural Development – CAP reform: Sugar |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Sugar Protocol to the [[Lome Convention]], nineteen [[ACP countries]] export sugar to the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpsugar.org |title=African, Caribbean and Pacific Sugar Group |work=ACPsugar.org |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704205503/http://www.acpsugar.org/ |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be affected by price reductions on the EU market.

These proposals followed the WTO [[Appellate Body]], largely upholding on 28 April 2005 the initial decision against the EU sugar regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agritrade.cta.int/news0506.htm#sugar |title=Sugar reform |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312183704/http://agritrade.cta.int/news0506.htm#sugar |archivedate=12 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed direct subsidy limits (2007)===
In the autumn of 2007 the European Commission was reported to be considering a proposal to limit subsidies to individual landowners and [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] to around £300,000. Some factory farms and large estates would be affected in the UK, as there are over 20 farms/estates receiving £500,000 or more from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=4180 |title=top 20 cap payments |work=Farmers Guardian |accessdate=10 November 2007 |date=1 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724154213/http://www.farmersguardian.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1 |archive-date=24 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/vContentByTaxonomy/A4B88A09234F1D1380257046003846BE?OpenDocument |title=Rural Payment Agency "Farm Payments by value 2003–2004 |publisher=Rpa.gov.uk |date=17 August 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225212259/http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/vContentByTaxonomy/A4B88A09234F1D1380257046003846BE?OpenDocument |archivedate=25 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar attempts have been unsuccessful in the past and were opposed in the UK by two strong lobbying organisations the [[Country Land and Business Association]] and the [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]]. Germany, which has large [[collective farming|collective farm]]s still in operation in what was East Germany, also vigorously opposed changes marketed as "reforms". The proposal was reportedly submitted for consultation with EU member states on 20 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article3143253.ece |title=Off with their subsidies!

==The CAP today==
[[File:Common Agricultural Policy 2014-2020 meeting of Chairpersons of Agriculture Committees of the EU member states in the Polish Senate.jpg|thumb|Participants of the "Common Agricultural Policy 2014-2020" meeting of Chairpersons of Agriculture Committees of the [[EU member states]] in the [[Senate of Poland|Polish Senate]]]]

The policy has evolved significantly since it was created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy. The 2003 reform has introduced the [[Single Payment Scheme]] (SPS) or as it is known as well the Single Farm Payment (SFP). The most recent reform was made in 2013 by Commissioner Dacian Ciolos and applies for the period 2014 to 2020.

Each country can choose if the payment will be established at the farm level or at the regional level. Farmers receiving the SFP have the flexibility to produce any commodity on their land except fruit, vegetables and table potatoes. In addition, they are obliged to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition (cross-compliance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iatp.org/iatp/publications.cfm?refid=100145 |title=Document Library &amp;#124; Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy |publisher=Iatp.org |accessdate=28 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823103612/http://www.iatp.org/iatp/publications.cfm?refid=100145 |archive-date=23 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers have to respect environmental, food safety, phytosanitary and animal welfare standards. This is a penalty measure, if farmers do not respect these standards, their payment will be reduced.

The direct aids and market related expenditure made up 31% of the total EU budget in 2010. Together with 11% for Rural Development, the total CAP budget took 42% of the total EU budget&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/eu-budget-2010-pbKV3009138/downloads/KV-30-09-138-EN-C/KV3009138ENC_002.pdf?FileName=KV3009138ENC_002.pdf&amp;SKU=KV3009138ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=KV-30-09-138-EN-C|title=EU Budget 2010 PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAP budget has shrunk relatively from 71% in 1984 to an expected 39% of the total EU budget in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/faq/cost/index_en.htm |title=The cost of the CAP |publisher=European Commission |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intervention mechanisms have diminished significantly, for instance the Commission only intervenes on: common wheat, butter, and skimmed milk powder. The Health Check of the CAP agreed in November 2008 has added on a number of measures to help the farmers to respond better to signals from the markets and to face new challenges. Among a range of measures, the agreement abolishes arable set-aside, increases milk quotas gradually leading up to their abolition in 2015, and converts market intervention into a genuine safety net. Ministers also agreed to increase modulation, whereby direct payments to farmers are reduced and the money transferred to the Rural Development Fund.

Milk quotas expired in April 2015. To prepare the dairy farmers for this transition, a 'soft landing' has been ensured by increasing quotas by one percent every year between 2009–10 and 2013–14. For Italy, the 5 percent increase will be introduced immediately in 2009–10. In 2009–10 and 2010–11, farmers who exceed their milk quotas by more than 6 percent will have to pay a levy 50 percent higher than the normal penalty.

Since 2000, the [[EU Rural Development Policy]] has been in effect, also known as the "second pillar" of the CAP. This policy aims to promote the economic, social and environmental development of the countryside. Its budget, 11% of the total EU budget, is today allocated along three axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |title=The current year: 2010 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815112106/http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |archive-date=15 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first axis focuses on improving the competitiveness of the farm and forestry sector through support for restructuring, development and innovation. The second one concerns the improvement of the environment and the countryside through support for land management as well as helping to fight climate change. Such projects could for example concern preserving water quality, sustainable land management, planting trees to prevent erosion and floods. The third axis concerns improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity. The policy also provides support to the [[Leader rural development methodology]], under which Local Action Groups design and carry out local development strategies for their area. Member States distribute "second pillar" funds through [[Rural Development Programme]] actions.

The European Commission discussed the next reform of the CAP, which will coincide with the next financial perspectives package, as from 2014. The Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development Dacian Cioloş, has outlined seven major challenges that the future CAP needs to address: food production, globalisation, the environment, economic issues, a territorial approach, diversity and simplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/10/400&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title='The CAP after 2013' Brussels |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=20 July 2010|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 26th of June 2013 agreement was reached between the European Commission, the Council and the EU Parliament on the new CAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/policy-perspectives/policy-briefs/05_en.pdf |title='Overview of CAP Reform 2014-2020.

==Objectives==

'''Sectors covered by the CAP'''&lt;br /&gt;
The common agricultural policy price intervention covers only certain agricultural products:
* [[cereal]], [[rice]], [[potatoes]]
* [[oil]]
* dried [[fodder]]
* [[milk]] and [[dairy products|milk products]], wine, [[honey]]
* [[beef]] and [[veal]], [[poultry meat]] and [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[pork|pig meat]], [[Lamb (food)|sheep]] / [[Lamb and mutton|lamb meat]] and goat meat
* [[sugar]]
* [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]]
* [[cotton]]
* [[pea]]s, field [[beans]]
* [[Lupinus angustifolius|sweet lupins]]
* [[olives]]
* [[flax|Flax seeds]]
* [[Flax#Flax fibers|Flax fibres]]
* [[silkworm]]s
* [[hemp]]
* [[tobacco]]
* [[hops]]
* [[seeds]]
* [[flowers]] and [[plants|live plants]]
* animal [[Fodder|feed stuffs]]

The coverage of products in the external trade regime is more extensive than the coverage of the CAP regime. This is to limit competition between EU products and alternative external goods (for example, lychee juice could potentially compete with orange juice).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The objectives, set out in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, are as follows:
# to increase productivity, by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labour;
# to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community;
# to stabilise markets;
# to secure availability of supplies;
# to provide consumers with food at reasonable prices.

The CAP recognised the need to take account of the social structure of agriculture and of the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions and to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees.

CAP is an integrated system of measures that works by maintaining commodity price levels within the EU and by subsidising production. There are a number of mechanisms:
*Import levies are applied to specified goods imported into the EU. These are set at a level to raise the World market price up to the EU target price. The target price is chosen as the maximum desirable price for those goods within the EU.
*Import quotas are used as a means of restricting the amount of food being imported into the EU. Some non-member countries have negotiated quotas allowing them to sell particular goods within the EU without tariffs. This notably applies to countries that had a traditional trade link with a member country.
*An internal [[Intervention storage|intervention price]] is set. If the internal market price falls below the intervention level then the EU will buy up goods to raise the price to the intervention level. The intervention price is set lower than the target price. The internal market price can only vary in the range between the intervention price and target price.
*Direct subsidies are paid to farmers. This was originally intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, rather than on the total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.
*[[Production quota]]s and '[[set-aside]]' payments were introduced in an effort to prevent overproduction of some foods (for example, milk, grain, wine) that attracted subsidies well in excess of market prices. The need to store and dispose of excess produce was wasteful of resources and brought the CAP into disrepute. A secondary market evolved, especially in the sale of [[milk quota]]s, while some farmers made imaginative use of 'set-aside', for example, setting aside land that was difficult to farm. Currently set-aside has been suspended, subject to further decision about its future, following rising prices for some commodities and increasing interest in growing biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1564327/Set-aside-subsidy-halted-to-cut-grain-prices.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Set-aside subsidy halted to cut grain prices | first=Bruno | last=Waterfield | date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in subsidies is intended to be completed by 2011, but individual governments have some freedom to decide how the new scheme will be introduced. The UK government has decided to run a dual system of subsidies in England, each year transferring a larger proportion of the total payment to the new scheme. Payments under the old scheme were frozen at their levels averaged over 2002–2003 and reduce each subsequent year. This allows farmers in England a period where their income is maintained, but which they can use to change farm practices to accord with the new regime. Other governments have chosen to wait, and change the system in one go at the latest possible time. Governments also have limited discretion to continue to direct a small proportion of the total subsidy to support specific crops. Alterations to the qualifying rules meant that many small landowners became eligible to apply for grants and the [[Rural Payments Agency]] in England received double the previous number of applications (110,000).

The CAP also aims to promote legislative harmonisation within the Community. Differing laws in member countries can create problems for anyone seeking to trade between countries. Examples are regulations on permitted [[preservative]]s or [[food colouring]], labelling regulations, use of [[hormone]]s or other drugs in livestock intended for human consumption and disease control, animal welfare regulations. The process of removing all hidden legislative barriers to trade is still incomplete.

The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) of the EU, which used to fund the CAP has been replaced in 2007 with the [[European Agricultural Guarantee Fund]] (EAGF) and the [[European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development]] (EAFRD). CAP reform has steadily lowered its share of the EU budget but it still accounts for nearly half of the EU expenditure. France is the biggest beneficiary of the policy by around 20%, followed by Germany and Spain (~13% each), Italy (~11%) and the UK (~9%).

==The CAP reform legislative proposals==
The reformed common agricultural policy came into force in 2014. The Commission launched the CAP reform process with an extensive public debate on the future of the Cap between April and June 2010, followed by a public conference in July 2010, with around 600 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/debate/report/summary-report_en.pdf |title=CAP debate outline for Summary Report |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the debate was to have different sectors of society taking part. "The Common Agricultural Policy is not just a matter for experts. It's a policy for all Europeans", said Commissioner Cioloş.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/10/150&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=The launch of the debate |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the wide-ranging public debate, on 18 November 2010, the Commission presented a Communication on "The CAP towards 2020"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The CAP towards 2020: Meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future |publisher=European Commission |date=18 November 2010 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0672:FIN:en:PDF |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communication Paper outlined three options for the future CAP and launched a consultation with other institutions and stakeholders. Over 500 contributions were received, 44% of which came from the farming and processing sector. These contributions form an integral part of the Impact Assessment of the legal proposals. The impact assessment evaluates alternative scenarios for the evolution of the policy on the basis of extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acceptance.ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/perspec/cap-2020/index_en.htm#ia{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2011 the Commission presented a set of legal proposals to reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/index_en.htm |title=Legal proposals for the CAP after 2013 – Agriculture and rural development |publisher=European Commission |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated aim is to guarantee European citizens healthy and quality food production, while preserving the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1181&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA – Press Releases – The European Commission proposes a new partnership between Europe and the farmers |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the proposal, the three broad objectives of the future CAP are: "Viable food production", "Sustainable management of natural resources" and "Balanced territorial development", which respond directly to the economic, environmental and territorial balance challenges identified in the Communication and which guide the proposed changes to the CAP instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/communication/index_en.htm |title=Commission Communication on the CAP towards 2020 – Agriculture and rural development |publisher=European Commission |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New design of direct payments===
Direct payments contribute to keeping farming in place throughout the EU territory by supporting and stabilising farmers' income, thereby ensuring the longer term economic viability of farms and making them less vulnerable to fluctuations in prices. They also provide basic public goods through their link with cross compliance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy |publisher=European Commission |date=19 October 2011 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/com625/625_en.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal proposals aim to move away from the different systems of the Single Payments Scheme in the EU-15 (which allows for historical references, or a payment per hectare, or a "hybrid" combination of the two) and the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) in most of the EU-12, a new "Basic Payment Scheme" will apply after 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/markets/sfp/pdf/ms_en.pdf |title=Direct support – Agriculture and rural development |publisher=European Commission |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be subject to "cross compliance" (respecting certain environmental, animal welfare &amp; other rules), as at present, although there are various simplifications to the current requirement. It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the national envelopes for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the EU-27 average is reduced by one-third.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==="Greening"===
The legal proposals propose new concepts. Among them is the "greening" of direct payment. To strengthen the environmental sustainability of agriculture and enhance the efforts of farmers, the Commission is proposing to spend 30% of direct payments specifically for the improved use of natural resources. Farmers would be obliged to fulfil certain criteria such as crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pasture, the preservation of environmental reservoirs and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/ 2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers |publisher=European Commission |date=12 October 2011 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/com631/631_en.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young farmers===
To attract young people (under 40 years) into the farming business, the Commission is proposing that the Basic Payment to new entrant Young Farmers should be topped up by an additional 25% for the first 5 years of installation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) |publisher=European Commission |date=19 October 2011 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/com627/627_en.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small farmers===
Any farmer wishing to participate in the Small Farmers Scheme will receive an annual payment fixed by the Member State of between €500 and €1,000, regardless of the farm's size. (The figure will either be linked to the average payment per beneficiary, or the national average payment per hectare for 3 ha.). Participants will face less stringent cross-compliance requirements, and be exempt from greening.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Active farmers===
This new definition is aimed to exclude payments to applicants who exercise no real or tangible agricultural activity on their land. The Commission is proposing that payments would not be granted to applicants whose CAP direct payments are less than 5% of total receipts from all non-agricultural activities This doesn't apply to farmers who receive less than 5 000 Euros in direct payments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==="Capping"===
The amount of support that any individual farm can receive will be limited to €300,000 per year. However, to take employment into account, the holding can deduct the costs of salaries in the previous year (including taxes &amp; social security contributions) before these reductions are applied. The funds "saved" will be transferred to the Rural Development envelope in the given country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products |publisher=European Commission |date=12 October 2011 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/com629/629_en.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross compliance===
All payments will continue to be linked to the respect of a number of baseline requirements relating to environment, animal welfare and plant &amp; animal health standards. However, cross compliance will be greatly simplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy |publisher=European Commission |date=19 October 2014 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/legal-proposals/com628/628_en.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Why a CAP reform?===
* There is a need to respond to the economic, environmental and territorial challenges faced by agricultural and rural areas today and in the future, and in doing so to better align the CAP to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
* There is a need to make the policy more efficient and effective, as well as to further simplify it while maintaining sound financial management and controllability
* CAP support could be made more equitable and balanced between Member States and farmers and better targeted at active farmers.

===The next steps===

The Commission put forward its legislative proposals on 12 October 2011. The European Parliament and the Council, debated the text. The approval of the different regulations and implementing acts was received by mid-2013. The CAP reform came into force as from 1 January 2014.

For the first time both institutions (European Parliament and the Council) decided on an equal footing on the new agriculture legislative package.

The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on 1 December 2009, has extended the legislative powers of the EP. On agricultural matters, now the European Parliament decides together with the Council in a procedure known as the [[co-decision]] procedure.

==Criticism==
The CAP has been roundly criticised by many diverse interests since its inception. Criticism has been wide-ranging, and even the European Commission has long been persuaded {{Citation needed|date = January 2015}} of the numerous defects of the policy. In May 2007, Sweden became the first EU country to take the position that all EU farm subsidies should be abolished, except those related to [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/7443/20070529/ |title=Sweden proposes abolition of farm subsidy |accessdate=1 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829024106/http://www.thelocal.se/7443/20070529/ |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-development===
Many developing countries are highly dependent on agriculture. The [[FAO]] finds that agriculture provides for the livelihood of 70% of the world's poorest people. As such, the subsidies in the CAP are charged with preventing [[developing countries]] from exporting agricultural produce to the EU on a level playing field. The [[WTO]] [[Doha Development Round]], which intended to increase global development, has stalled due to the developed countries' refusal to remove agricultural subsidies.

A review of post-2013 proposal by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines the lack of ambition in tackling the issue. "This CAP reform was not intended to address the trade barriers used to keep some [[EU market]] prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various [[trade agreement]]s, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing countries will be disappointed that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of direct payments was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets."&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictsd.org/themes/agriculture/research/post-2013-eu-common-agricultural-policy-trade-and-development-a-review |title=Post-2013 EU Common Agricultural Policy, Trade and Development. A Review of Legislative Proposals |first=Alan |last=Matthews, Professor Emeritus of European Agricultural Policy, Trinity College Dublin | publisher= [[ICTSD]] |date= October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although much depends on the size of the payments and how they are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ictsd.org/i/publications/97803/ |title=How Might the EU's Common Agricultural Policy Affect Trade and Development After 2013? |first= Alan |last=Matthews |publisher= [[ICTSD]] |date= December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, however, the EU remains the world's biggest importer of farm products from developing countries. On average, over the period 2006–2008, the EU has imported €53&amp;nbsp;billion worth of goods. This is more than the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/external/dev/publi/overview/text_en.pdf |title=The EU is the world's biggest importer of farm products |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further encouraged by a preferential [[market access]] agreement for products from developing countries. Today, around 71% of the EU's agricultural imports originate from developing countries. The '[[Everything but Arms]]' programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/wider-agenda/development/generalised-system-of-preferences/everything-but-arms/ |title=Generalised System of Preferences: Everything But Arms |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the world's 49 least-developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market. Under the Economic Partnership Agreements, countries from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group enjoy full duty-free and quota free access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/wider-agenda/development/economic-partnerships/ |title=Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oversupply and its redistribution===
To perpetuate the viability of European agriculture in its current state, the CAP-mandated demand for certain farm produce is set at a high level compared with demand in the free market (see {{format link|#CAP as a form of state intervention}}). This leads to the European Union purchasing millions of tonnes of surplus output every year at the stated guaranteed market price, and storing this produce in large quantities (leading to what critics have called '[[butter mountain]]s' and 'milk lakes'), before selling the produce wholesale to developing nations.&lt;ref name="openeurope.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/summary.aspx?id=256 |title=independent think tank calling for radical reform of the EU |publisher=Open Europe |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006182925/http://openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/summary.aspx?id=256 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 in response to a parliamentary written question the UK government revealed that over the preceding year the EU Public Stock had amassed "13,476,812 tonnes of cereal, rice, sugar and milk products and 3,529,002 hectolitres of alcohol/wine", although the EU has claimed this level of [[oversupply]] is unlikely to be repeated. This point was actually proven in January 2009, where the EU had a store of 717,810 tonnes of cereals, 41,422 tonnes of sugar and a 2.3&amp;nbsp;million hectolitre '[[wine lake]]', showing that the stocks had diminished dramatically.&lt;ref name="openeurope.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caphealthcheck.eu/return-of-the-butter-mountain/ |title=Return of the butter mountain &amp;#124; capreform.eu |publisher=Caphealthcheck.eu |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211212518/http://caphealthcheck.eu/return-of-the-butter-mountain/ |archivedate=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2007–08 world food price crisis|food crisis in 2008]], which saw the stocks empty out and the prices skyrocket, even introduced a popular demand for the introduction of emergency stocks of agricultural produce in the EU, which would help stabilise prices both on the very volatile markets. In 2010, the European Commission announced its intention to sell out of its cereal stocks to stabilise the situation after a [[Russian grain export ban]] had stung world markets, sending wheat prices to two-year highs and sparked worries of a crisis in global food supplies that could spark widespread strains and protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/farm-food.6ao |title=EU to put cereal stocks on market by year-end |publisher=Eubusiness.com |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the EU decided to use existing intervention stocks (cereals, milk powder and limited quantities of butter) for its "Food Aid for the Needy" scheme for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/1284&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Europe approves €500&amp;nbsp;million of Food Aid for the Needy for 2011 |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 13&amp;nbsp;million poor Europeans benefit from this scheme.

Parts of the EU stocks are exported with the use of export subsidies. It is argued that many African and Asian dairy, [[tomato]]&lt;ref name="Journalism Grants 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Dark Side of the Italian Tomato | website=Journalism Grants | date=2014-06-26 | url=https://innovation.journalismgrants.org/projects/the-dark-side-of-italian-tomatoes | access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nigeria's tomato farmers squeezed by low prices | website=Al Jazeera | date=2015-05-17 | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/nigeria-tomato-farmers-squeezed-prices-150517175156759.html | access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, grain and  poultry farmers cannot keep up with cheap competition from Europe, thus their incomes can no longer provide for their families.&lt;ref name="Frith 2006"&gt;{{cite web | last=Frith | first=Maxine | title=EU subsidies deny Africa's farmers of their livelihood | website=The Independent | date=2006-05-16 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/eu-subsidies-deny-africas-farmers-of-their-livelihood-478419.html | access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many urbanised families in the developing world benefit from the relatively cheaper products stemming from Europe.

For dairy products, export subsidies rose in 2009 after having been stopped in 2008. In 2009, the main recipients of dairy products that benefitted from export subsidies were: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Nigeria.

According to the 2003 Human Development Report the average dairy cow in the year 2000 under the European Union received $913 in subsidies annually, while an average of $8 per human being was sent in aid to Sub-Saharan Africa.

The 2005 Human Development Report states "The basic problem to be addressed in the WTO negotiations on agriculture can be summarised in three words: rich country subsidies. In the last round of world trade negotiations rich countries promised to cut agricultural subsidies. Since then, they have increased them". Several reports from the latest negotiations in the WTO, however, contradict the theory of the 2005 HDR report. On 29 July 2008, the WTO negotiations in the [[Doha Development Round|Doha round]] finally collapsed because of differences between the US, India and China over agricultural trade.

===Artificially high food prices===
CAP price intervention has been criticised for creating artificially high [[food prices]] throughout the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/thunderer/article4567118.ece&lt;/ref&gt; High import tariffs (estimated at 18–28%) have the effect of keeping prices high by restricting competition by non-EU producers. It is estimated that public support for farmers in OECD countries costs a family of four on average nearly 1,000 USD per year in higher prices and taxes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/45/0,2340,fr_2649_201185_35738477_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=The Doha Development Round of trade negotiations: understanding the issues |publisher=Oecd.org |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612183045/http://www.oecd.org/document/45/0%2C2340%2Cfr_2649_201185_35738477_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has responded that the average EU household today spends 15% of its budget on food, compared to 30% in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/faq/prices/index_en.htm |title=The price of food |publisher=European Commission |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent moves away from intervention buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. After two decades of significant CAP reforms, farmers can now respond to market signals and increase production to react to the higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses would not be able to survive. With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been making less than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.

===Public health at the peril of agricultural policies===
[[Public health]] professionals have also levelled criticism at the CAP and its support regimes, arguing that agricultural policy often disregards health. It is evident that supply outputs are generating widespread public health issues of [[obesity]] and [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]-related [[non-communicable disease]]s (NCDs), such as [[cardio-vascular disease]] (CVD), [[cancer]] and [[type II diabetes]]. Diet is one of the major modifiable determinants in promoting or preventing chronic disease, and agricultural products have a major influence on the disease risk factors.

Initial criticism emerged in the early 2000s regarding the production orientation of the CAP and the need for decoupling due to the disjointed nature of agricultural production policy in relation to consumption (and thus [[nutrition]]). The arguments were re-enforced at the 2001 [[European Health Forum Gastein]] on the CAP, which made explicit – to policy makers – the link between nutrient quality of diets and agricultural policy. The Forum also identified opportunities to align the CAP to health objectives, more specifically by encouraging changes to dietary behaviour through adjusting CAP support.

Since 2008, under the leadership of the European Public Health and Agriculture Consortium (EPHAC)&lt;ref name="EPHA 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=EPHA | website=EPHA | date=2017-09-20 | url=https://epha.org/ | access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citizensforeurope.eu/organisation/epha&lt;/ref&gt;, the public health nutrition narrative has gained traction in policy circles. Although agricultural policy-makers are beginning to realise the arguments for upstream health intervention, practical measures remain politically unpalatable. EPHAC maintains that agricultural policies can be used to internalise the health externalities of diet-related ill-health and improve population, society-wide public health nutrition.

Health groups have become increasingly vocal in their call for agricultural policies to contribute towards resolving the consumption problems of food; such as, excessive intake of [[saturated fatty acid]]s (FSA), [[sugar]] and salt, or under-consumption of vitamins (leading to [[hypovitaminosis]]) and minerals. More attention should be paid, it is argued, on intervention policies upstream, at the [[primary food production]] and [[food processing|processing]] stages, to influence nutritional quality and the structural determinants of food choice, including; availability, accessibility and price.

===Hurting smaller farms===
Although most policy makers in Europe agree that they want to promote "family farms" and smaller scale production, the CAP in fact rewards larger producers {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Because the CAP has traditionally rewarded farmers who produce more, larger farms have benefited much more from subsidies than smaller farms. For example, a farm with 1000 hectares, earning an additional €100 per hectare will make an additional €100,000, while a 10 hectare farm will only make an extra €1000, disregarding [[economies of scale]]. As a result, most CAP subsidies have made their way to large scale farmers.

Since the 2003 reforms subsidies have been linked to the size of farms, so farmers get the same for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms tend to get the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health Check of the CAP, a first step was taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.

The European Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development Dacian Cioloş in his Public Hearing upon his nomination has showed his concern in small farms: "small holdings represent an important share, not only in the new Member States but also in South Europe". He has emphasised that a structural policy is needed "to modernise" small farms and to "develop existing opportunities in local markets", where there is "high demand for local products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20100113IPR67224&amp;language=EN |title=Cioloş' view on small farms |publisher=European Parliament |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental problems===
A common view is that the CAP has traditionally promoted a large expansion in agricultural production. At the same time it has allowed farmers to employ unecological ways of increasing production, such as the indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides, with serious environmental consequences. However, a total re-focusing of the payment scheme in 2004 now puts the environment at the centre of farming policy. By linking the payments to farmers to a number of strict environmental standards (among others) in the so-called cross compliance scheme, farmers will have to face cuts in their subsidy levels if they don't meet the strict environmental requirements.

In 2010, the EU announced that 31% of the €5&amp;nbsp;billion that was earmarked the new (mainly environmental) challenges in agriculture would be spent on protecting and promoting biodiversity in the European countryside. This money is part of the EU rural development policy, which is supporting agri-environmental projects throughout the Member States.

The CAP has furthermore been criticised due to its effect on farmland bird populations. Between 1980 and 2009, the farmland bird population has decreased from 600 million to 300 million, implying a loss of 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EUtopia |url=http://eutopia-blog.blogspot.de/2012/07/more-diversity-on-my-plate-critique-of.html |title=EUtopia |publisher=Eutopia-blog.blogspot.de |date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the species that have been hit hardest are the starling and the tree sparrow, which have both declines by 53%. The removal of hedgerows and ploughing over meadows are two significant factors that may have contributed to more efficient farming, but that also caused a decrease in farmland birds' habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin McKie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/26/eu-farming-policies-bird-population |title=How EU farming policies led to a collapse in Europe's bird population |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, farmers have been lauded by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] because the five most threatened bumblebees have made a comeback to the English nature due to the agri-environmental schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/media/releases/261841-countrys-rarest-bumblebees-make-a-comeback |title=Country's rarest bumblebees make a comeback |publisher=Rspb.org.uk |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, support for [[extensive farming]] and biotope management helps maintain habitat for rare species such as orchids and butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrd.ec.europa.eu/app_templates/filedownload.cfm?id=3E3F4C22-0331-99A3-AD5F-C25FF369EF68 |title=The Magazine from the European Network for Rural Development |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, a special scheme was launched to protect the [[great bustard]], maybe the world's heaviest flying bird, which needs areas with minimal disturbance and an abundant supply of insects to breed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belanski.com/drupal/great_bustard  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617203927/http://www.belanski.com/drupal/great_bustard |date=17 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cyprus, agri-environment schemes support the maintenance of traditional trees and bushes that are a natural habitat for the island's and likely to be of benefit to farmland birds in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/eu/pdfs/Agrienvironment_schemes_lesson_learnt.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – Agri-environment schemes and biodiversity in the EU – less |format=PDF |accessdate=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103543/http://www.birdlife.org/eu/pdfs/Agrienvironment_schemes_lesson_learnt.pdf |archive-date=15 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules instituted in 2015 barring or reducing payments for farmed land above threshold densities of trees or canopy cover have been attacked as having perverse consequences for mature trees, biodiversity, soil erosion and downstream flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/warning-chainsaw-massacre-over-welsh-8827604|title=Warning of chainsaw massacre over Welsh farmland's ‘ineligible features’|last=Forgrave|first=Andrew|date=2015-03-12|newspaper=northwales|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2015/02/25/slip-sliding-away/|title=Slip Sliding Away {{!}} George Monbiot|website=www.monbiot.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity among member states===
[[File:CAP2004beneficiaries.png|upright=1.15|thumb|CAP 2004 beneficiaries]]
Some countries in the EU have larger agricultural sectors than others, notably France and Spain, and consequently receive more money under the CAP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecipe.org/publications/ecipe-working-papers/public-money-for-public-goods-winners-and-losers-from-cap-reform/PDF Public Money for Public Goods: Winners and Losers from CAP Reform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227102801/http://www.ecipe.org/publications/ecipe-working-papers/public-money-for-public-goods-winners-and-losers-from-cap-reform/PDF |date=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have particularly urbanised populations and rely very little on agriculture as part of their economy (in the United Kingdom agriculture employs 1.6% of the total workforce and in the Netherlands 2.0%).  The UK therefore receives less than half what France gets, despite a similar sized economy and population.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11216061|title=Q&amp;A: Reform of EU farm policy|date=1 July 2013|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries receive more benefit from different areas of the EU budget. Overall, certain countries make net contributions, notably Germany (the largest contribution overall) and the Netherlands (the biggest contribution per person), but also the UK and France. The largest per capita beneficiaries are Greece and Ireland.

Another aspect is difference between older Western European and newer Central and Eastern member states, due to transitional arrangements the latter received smaller payments. In 2013 payments per hectare were 527 euros in Greece and only 89 euros in Latvia. In compensation the newer members were allowed to provide national farm aid.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; In March 2018 EU agriculture ministers failed to achieve consensus on a declaration about future of CAP, with ministers of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], and [[Slovakia]] demanding fully equal subsidies across the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://euobserver.com/economic/141381 |last=Teffer |first=Peter |title=Five east European states prevent new CAP consensus |publisher= [[EUobserver]] |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cotton subsidies===
In spite of these declarations, the EU Commission proposed the continuation of [[cotton]] subsidies, coupled to production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/communication/com2010-672_en.pdf |title=EN |format=PDF |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coupling of the subsidy means that they will continue to have significant trade-distorting effect, most notably on West African farmers who are unable to compete with subsidised cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2010/f/2_ft_cotton_policy_report_2010_loresv2.pdf|title=The great cotton stitch-up|last=Fairtrade Foundation|first=|date=November 2010|website=|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225062712/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2010/f/2_ft_cotton_policy_report_2010_loresv2.pdf|archivedate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Communication on the future of the CAP does not mention the cotton sector. Nevertheless, the most trade-distorting subsidies to [[cotton production]] have already been eliminated in the 2004 reform. The current EU cotton production corresponds to 1% of global cotton production and its effect on the evolution of world market prices is therefore negligible. On the other hand, the EU is by far the largest provider of development assistance to cotton. In the framework of the EU-Africa Partnership on Cotton&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coton-acp.org/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826215920/http://coton-acp.org/en |archive-date=26 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU has made available more than €320&amp;nbsp;million. The EU market for cotton is already [[duty-free]] and [[quota-free]] and there are no export subsidies for cotton.

===UK rebate and the CAP===
The UK would have been contributing more money to the EU than any other EU member state, except that the UK government negotiated a special annual [[UK rebate]] in 1984. Due to the way the rebate is funded, France pays the largest share of the rebate (31%), followed by Italy (24%) and Spain (14%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancontent.net/forums/about4211.html |title=Arrogant and hypocritical Chirac savaged by British press |publisher=Canadiancontent.net |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/06/11/weu11.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/06/11/ixnewstop.html |title=News - Latest breaking UK news |publisher=Telegraph |date=17 July 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/23/wchir23.xml |title=News - Latest breaking UK news |publisher=Telegraph |date=17 July 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discrepancy in CAP funding is a cause of some consternation in the UK. {{As of|2004}}, France received more than double the CAP funds received by the UK (see diagram). This is a net benefit to France of €6.37&amp;nbsp;billion, compared to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4407792.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Common Agricultural Policy | date=20 November 2008 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely a reflection of the fact that France has more than double the land area of the UK. In comparison, the UK budget rebate for 2005 is scheduled to be approx €5.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4721307.stm#howbig |publisher=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: The UK budget rebate | date=23 December 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular view in the UK (as, for example, set forth in the tabloid [[news|press]]) is that if the UK rebate were reduced with no change to the CAP, then the UK would be paying money to keep the French farming sector in business – to many people in the UK, this would be seen as unfair.
[[File:FarmlandinEU2.gif|upright=1.35|thumb|Percentage of EU farmland by country in 2004]]
If the rebate were removed without changes to the CAP then the UK would pay a net contribution of 14 times that of the French (In 2005 EU budget terms). The UK would make a net contribution of €8.25&amp;nbsp;billion compared to the current contribution of €2.75&amp;nbsp;billion, versus a current French net contribution of €0.59&amp;nbsp;billion.

In December 2005 the UK agreed to give up approximately 20% of the rebate for the period 2007–2013, on condition that the funds did not contribute to CAP payments, were matched by other countries' contributions and were only for the new member states. Spending on the CAP remained fixed, as had previously been agreed. Overall, this reduced the proportion of the budget spent on the CAP. It was agreed that the European Commission should conduct a full review of all EU spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4537912.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Key points of the EU budget deal | date=17 December 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf|title=Financial Perspective 2007-2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060126234044/http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf|archivedate=26 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic sustainability===
Experts such as Prof. Alan Matthews believed '[[greening]]' measures in the EU's proposed €418-billion post-2013 farm policy could lower the bloc's agricultural production potential by raising farm input costs by €5 billion, or around 2 percent.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;

===How many people benefit?===
Only 5.4% of EU's population works on farms, and the farming sector is responsible for 1.6% of the GDP of the EU (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkey in Europe: Breaking the Vicious Circle |year= 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |url=http://www.independentcommissiononturkey.org/pdfs/2009_english.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Independentcommissiononturkey.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of European farmers is decreasing every year by 2%. Additionally, most Europeans live in cities, towns, and suburbs, not rural areas. 

The [[2007-2008 world food price crisis]] renewed calls for farm subsidies to be removed in light of evidence that farm subsidies contribute to rocketing food prices, which has a particularly detrimental effect on [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/food-crisis-set-weigh-cap-reform/article-172484 |title=Food crisis set to weigh on CAP reform &amp;#124; EU – European Information on Sustainable Dev |publisher=EurActiv.com |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609192138/http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/food-crisis-set-weigh-cap-reform/article-172484 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8916">'''Context Books''' was an independent publishing house founded by [[Beau Friedlander]] that featured often controversial and critically acclaimed titles from authors such as [[Derrick Jensen]], [[Daniel Quinn]], [[David Means]], and [[William Rivers Pitt]] which operated from 1998 to 2004.

==Founding==
Context Books originated as Context Media, through which Friedlander provided publishing and packaging services for a variety of clients with the idea in mind of raising enough capital to begin publishing titles that would have had difficulty finding interest from mainstream publishers.

"I hated big publishing's complete and utter disregard for authors," Friedlander said of the impetus. "...I want to publish the revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis Loy|title=Beau Regardless of the Others|url=http://www.mobylives.com/Beau_Friedlander.html|website=MobyLives.com|publisher=Moby Lives|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truth Vs. Lies and the United States Vs. Theodore John Kaczynski==
Context Books first gained national notice with the decision to attempt to publish the memoirs of [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who had written them from imprisonment in a Colorado Penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glaberson|first1=William|title=In Book, Unabomber Pleads His Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/01/us/in-book-unabomber-pleads-his-case.html|website=NY Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir, entitled 'Truth Vs. Lies' did not acknowledge the anti-technological bombing campaign for which he was convicted, but rather to address the testimony from family and acquaintances that he was mentally ill.

While developing this manuscript and preparing it for publication, Context released a companion book written by Vermont Law Professor Michael Mello called "The United States of America Versus Theodore John Kaczynski: Ethics, Power, and the Invention of the Unabomber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mello|first1=Michael|title=The United States of America Versus Theodore John Kaczynski: Ethics, Power and the Invention of the Unabomber|date=5/1/1999|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=1893956016|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than an analysis of the Kaczynski's crimes, Mello criticized the legal processes surrounding his prosecution, where he was denied the ability to represent himself and was instead representing as being severely mentally ill. Mello, who had also acted as an adviser to Kaczynski's pretrial defense team drew parallels to the non-trial with John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry.

Despite the heavy media attention brought both to the case as well as to the fledgling Context Books, Truth Vs. Lies was scrapped pre-publication due to copyright issues and ongoing disagreements between Friedlander and Kaczynski. "Kaczynski was uncooperative and expressed himself in ways that made it impossible for the book to be published by Context, or by anyone else," said Friedlander in a statement to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McShane|first1=Larry|title=Publisher yanks Unabomber book deal at last minute|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1999/Publisher-Yanks-Unabomber-Book-Deal/id-39b019a4a7fadb79d4c082b91aaab0a8|accessdate=1 October 2014|agency=AP|publisher=AP News Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2000s==

The national attention and controversy surrounding ''Truth Vs. Lies'' gave Context Books enough of a spotlight to acquire new authors, starting with environmentalist [[Derrick Jensen]]'s long-form essay [[A Language Older Than Words]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Derrick|title=A Language Older Than Words|date=4/16/00|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=9781931498555|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to be one of the company's most popular titles. The themes of questioning industrial civilization, environmentalism, and humankind's role and responsibilities continued with the publication of author [[Daniel Quinn]]'s books [[The Man Who Grew Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Daniel|title=Context Books|date=8/15/01|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=1893956172}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[After Dachau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Daniel|title=After Dachau|date=2/1/01|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=189395613X|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001, and [[The Holy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Daniel|title=The Holy|date=10/1/02|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=189395630X|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002.

Context Books also began to seek out literary works for publication, including [[David Means]]'s Assorted Fire Events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Means|first1=David|title=Assorted Fire Events|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-893956-05-6|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a set of short stories which won the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]],&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 Los Angeles Times Book Prize Winners|url=http://events.latimes.com/bookprizes/previous-winners/year-2000/|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a finalist for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]],&lt;ref name=NBCC&gt;{{cite web|title=All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists - Page 2|url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2|work=National Book Critics Circle|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Mind the Doors'' by Russian author Zinovy Zinik,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zinik|first1=Zinovy|title=Mind the Doors|date=3/31/01|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=1893956040|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goblin Fruit: Stories''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=David Marshall|title=Goblin Fruit: Stories|date=1/1/03|publisher=Context Books|location=New York|isbn=1893956326|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by David Marshall Chan, which was a Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist and a NYPL Young Lions finalist.&lt;ref name=Chan-LA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lange|first1=Mike|title=Los Angeles Times Book Prize Finalists Announced|url=http://extras.latimes.com/extras/festivalofbooks/newsreleases/print_2004_02.html|website=latimes.com|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Fiction Hotlists 2003|url=http://www.overbooked.com/hotlists/fiction/03.html|website=Overbooked.com|publisher=Overbooked|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War opposition==

Context Books once again found national notoriety with the short book / political pamphlet [[War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know]] in 2002 by [[William Rivers Pitt]] and former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, arguing that the claims of Iraq's stockpiles of "weapons of mass destruction" were highly suspect. The title was regarded as a stand-out during the widespread debate, argument, and protest surrounding the pending U.S. invasion of Iraq, and was referred to as "the most comprehensive independent analysis of the state of knowledge about Iraq's weapons programmes until the new team of inspectors went back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Steele| first = Jonathan| author-link =  Jonathan Steele| title = A mess of our making| newspaper = [[The Guardian]]| pages = 11| date = 25 January 2003 | url =  https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/25/iraq.politics | accessdate = 2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title shipped over 100,000 copies, and made many best-seller lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = St. John| first = Warren| title = Enlisting the Stars to Tilt at the Right| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = 8 June 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/style/enlisting-the-stars-to-tilt-at-the-right.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | accessdate = 2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''War on Iraq'', Context Books followed up with two further books: ''Target Iraq'' written by [[Norman Solomon]], [[Reese Erlich]], and a foreword by [[Sean Penn]], and ''Frontier Justice'' by [[Scott Ritter]].

==Bankruptcy and eventual closure==

The 9/11 attacks and Context Books' office location in lower Manhattan created a massive financial setback for the company, which lost phone access for three months and found two of its titles released in September 2001 to languish. The company never fully recovered from the setback and declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2002, and then shifted to involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2003.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Calvin|title=Liquidation Likely for Context Books|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20031208/21089-liquidation-likely-for-context-books.html|website=PublishersWeekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">The '''Court of Audit''' ({{lang-ro|Curtea de Conturi}}) is the [[Romania]]n state authority charged with conducting financial audit over the way the state and public resources are managed and used.

==History==

The court was established by a law of 1864, signed by [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. In December 1948, under the nascent [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], it was disbanded. Revived in 1973 as the Higher Court of Financial Control (''Curtea Superioară de Control Financiar''), this too was abolished in early 1990, following the [[Romanian Revolution]]. The Court of Audit was re-established by a law of 1992, and began functioning the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.curteadeconturi.ro/Istoric.aspx Istoricul Curții de Conturi] at the Court of Audit site&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">[[File:NL-Alert voorbeeld.jpg|thumb|EU-Alert/[[NL-Alert]] [[Cell Broadcast]] message in the area of [[Venlo]], The [[Netherlands]] on 7 August 2018 as a result of a large toxic fire &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nltimes.nl/2018/08/07/toxins-released-fire-venlo-business|title=Toxins released in fire at Venlo Business Park|work=NL Times|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''EU-Alert''' is the generic term for the European Public Warning Service.
EU-Alert is compatible with [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] (WEA) formerly known as the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) standard as used in the [[United States]]. All mobile phones OS (Android, IOS and Windows) since 2012 by default support EU-Alert/WEA/CMAS via [[Cell Broadcast]] for public warning messages.

The EU-Alert standard (TS 102 900 V1.2.1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102900_102999/102900/01.02.01_60/ts_102900v010201p.pdf|title=Technical specification ETSI TS 102 900 V1.2.1|work=ETSI EMTEL |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as defined by [[ETSI]] is the European Public Warning Service using the [[Cell Broadcast]] Service as a means of delivering public warning messages to the general public.

Specific countries using the EU-Alert service are identified by replacing the letters EU with the Country Identification letters in [[ISO 3166-1]] :

* [[NL-Alert]]: The national variant of EU-Alert for the Netherlands.
* LT-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Lithuania.
* RO-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Romania.

Dependent on the country legislation there are 5 types of Public Warning Service (PWS) messages one can receive on the mobile device. They're grouped into [[Cell Broadcast]] headings and channels, and include:
* Extreme threats: Classified as threats to your life and property, like an impending catastrophic weather event like a hurricane or a terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eena.org/press-releases/eu-reaches-agreement-public-warning#.WzU8T9IzZEY|title=EU reaches agreement on European public warning solution|work=European Emergency Number Association|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Severe threats: Less serious than the extreme threats, these could be the same types of situations, but on a smaller scale — stay safe, but no need to pack up the car and head for the hills.
* EU-Amber, AMBER alerts: These are specific alerts aimed at locating a missing child. 
* EU-Info, Public Safety Messages to convey essential, recommended actions that can save lives or property (e.g. emergency shelter locations or a boil water order).
* EU-Exercise, Test messages for national/regional/local purposes.

In countries that have selected [[Cell Broadcast]] as the technology to submit public warning messages up to 70%- 80% of the population older than 12 year receive the public warning verification message within seconds after the government authorities have submitted the message see as an example [[NL-Alert]]. [[Cell Broadcast]] is since 2012 supported by the default messaging app in [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[IOS]] and [[Windows 10]].


== Alternative solutions ==

=== Downloadable Mobile Applications ===

There are several downloadable mobile applications on the market that often warn on natural catastrophes; however, these are often not of official, but part of private initiatives that replicate information from state agencies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-08/alert-sa-app-scrapped-after-failing-during-serious-bushfire/9310520|title=Alert SA scrapped by State Government after failure during catastrophic fire conditions|work=ABC News|accessdate=8 January 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;.

All Downloadable Mobile applications have the issue that they are highly affected by traffic load as they required mobile data usage; therefore,  especially in case of a disaster when load spikes of Data ([[Social media]], Voice and [[Mobile app]]), tend to significantly slowdown mobile networks, as multiple events showed e.g. [[2016 Brussels bombings]], [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], [[2017 London Bridge attack]], [[Manchester Arena bombing]], [[2017 Stockholm attack]] and [[2016 Munich shooting]].

Moreover downloadable Mobile Apps needs to be downloaded by subscribers and the experience over the years in many countries is that only a fraction of the population will take the effort to download and use an Emergency Mobile app that is only activated a few times in a year. Examples are in [[Germany]] with 1.500.000 downloads of the Katwarn and NINA mobile application &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/technik-motor/digital/apps-katwarn-und-nina-warnung-sie-werden-nicht-gewarnt-14920409.html|title=Warning: you will not be warned|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Digital|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a maximum of 2.5M people in Germany (&lt;3% of the German population) and France only 500.000 downloads of the SAIP mobile application (&lt;1% of the French population) despite large investments in application development and marketing. In France because of the limited success of the downloadable Mobile App SAIP (Système d’Alerte et d’Information des Populations) the service has been stopped as of June 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2018/05/29/le-gouvernement-abandonne-l-application-d-alerte-attentat-saip_5306488_4408996.html|title=French Government abandons SAIP alert app|work=Le Monde|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudebaguette.com/2018/06/01/saip-the-french-alert-app-shuts-down|title=SAIP the french alert app shuts down|work= Rude Baguette|accessdate=1 June 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Location based SMS ===
The use of Location Based SMS as an emergency notification service instead of Cell Broadcast is not advised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/33684.php?source=rss|title=Report Says that SMS is not ideal for Emergency Communications|work=cellular-news|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by industry experts.
Location based SMS message delivery is not guaranteed, and the implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered in a timely manner especially when network congestion occurs at the time of an emergency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/be-alert-in-tessenderlo-ging-door-softwareprobleem-de-mist-in~ae219122/|title=Belgian Location Based SMS Public Warning System fails again|work= Het Laatste Nieuws|accessdate=5 October 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;.
Based upon last years experience the [[Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency]] concluded in a recent report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/28495.pdf |title=Report Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency on how SMS in Public Warning has been handled in current events|work=Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in case of serious events it's extremely unlikely that Public Warning Messages via SMS will work. 

Additional disadvantages to use location based [[SMS]] in national public warning systems are:

* Delivery time of Location Based SMS warning messages to groups of people in the Geo-target area is long (up to several hours e.g. in the Sweden case)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/companies/664024/late-text-warnings-amid-heavy-rain-telcos-explain-why/story/ |title=Telco's explain why SMS warning messages are delayed |work=GMA news online|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Complex, expensive and non-standardized/proprietary integrations are required to obtain network based location feeds for every mobile operator for every subscriber (MSISDN) in the geo target area.
* Severe constrains by privacy legislation as for location based SMS the government need location and MSISDN of each subscriber and is therefore not compliant with the latest EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
* No unique and intrusive sound is available for warning SMS, resulting that warning SMS message from the government is received with the same sound as any regular SMS.
* SMS alerts are single shot messages, SMS alert messages are not repeated in the disaster area for a period of time.
* No functionality is available when SMS is used to submit different guidance to safety message to subscribers moving from one geo-target area to the other geo-target area. 
* Only 1 severity level is available resulting that Amber alerts and test messages are received with the same severity level as for example fire or Tsunami warnings.
* No control or configuration is available for a subscriber on their Android and IOS handsets for national public warning alert messages using SMS.
* SMS alerts regarding public safety emergencies can be sent by everybody (no exclusivity) and forwarded by everybody (no control).

[[File:2017 Nissan LEAF (ZE0 MY17) hatchback (2018-11-02) 01.jpg|thumb|The 2011 [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first [[electric car]] equipped with [[Nissan]]'s Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians.]]
'''Electric vehicle warning sounds''' are sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of [[electric drive vehicle]]s such as [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s (HEVs), [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs), and [[all-electric vehicle]]s (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in [[all-electric mode]] produce less noise than traditional [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] vehicles and can make it more difficult for pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.

Japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in January 2010 and the U.S. approved legislation in December 2010.&lt;ref name=TMC0810/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACB/&gt; The [[U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] issued its final ruling in February 2018, and requires the device to emit warning sounds at speeds less than {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} with compliance by September 2020, but 50% of "quiet" vehicles must have the warning sounds by September 2019.&lt;ref name=US2018rule/&gt; The [[European Parliament]] approved legislation that requires the mandatory use of "Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems" for all new electric and hybrid electric vehicles within five years after publication of the final approval of the April 2014 proposal to comply with the regulation.&lt;ref name=AVAS2014/&gt;

Several automakers have developed electric warning sound devices, and since December 2011 [[advanced-technology vehicle|advanced technology cars]] available in the market with manually activated electric warning sounds include the [[Nissan Leaf]],  [[Chevrolet Volt]], [[Honda FCX Clarity]], [[Infiniti M#Hybrid version (2011–)|Nissan Fuga Hybrid/Infiniti M35]], [[Hyundai Sonata Hybrid]], and the [[Toyota Prius]] (Japan only).&lt;ref name=USAToday12/&gt; Models equipped with automatically activated systems include the 2014 [[BMW i3]] (option not available in the US), 2012 [[model year]] [[Toyota Camry (XV50)#Camry Hybrid|Toyota Camry Hybrid]], 2012 [[Lexus CT200h]], all EV versions of the Honda Fit, and all [[Prius family]] cars recently introduced in the United States, including the standard [[Toyota Prius (XW30)#2011 facelift|2012 model year Prius]], the [[Toyota Prius v]], [[Prius c]] and the [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]].&lt;ref name=Prii/&gt; The 2013 [[Smart electric drive]] comes with automatically activated sounds in the U.S. and Japan and manually activated in Europe.&lt;ref name=Daimler122013/&gt; [[Tesla Motors]] and [[Volkswagen]] do not currently include warning sounds in their electric drive vehicles, as both of them decided to add artificial sounds only when required by regulation.&lt;ref name=Daimler122013/&gt;

==Background==
As a result of increased sales of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s in several countries, some members of the blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in [[all-electric mode]], as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Ben Nuckols |date=2007-10-03|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.&lt;ref name=NHTSA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811204.PDF|title=Incidence of Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crashes by Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles|author= |publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=September 2009|accessdate=2009-10-05}} Technical Report DOT HS 811 204&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is not exclusive to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the [[Technical University Munich]] showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary background noise.

Research conducted at the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in [[all-electric mode|electric mode]] (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have only one or two seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the [[National Federation of the Blind]].&lt;ref name=SciAm0808/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCRNews&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;id=1803|title=Hybrid Cars Are Harder to Hear|publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment consisted of making audio recordings of a [[Toyota Prius]] and [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] [[Honda Accord]] approaching from two directions at {{convert|5|mph|km/h}} to assure that the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate the hum of the [[internal combustion engine]] car at {{convert|36|ft|m}} away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within {{convert|11|ft|m}}, leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about {{convert|28|ft|m}} feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian would not be able to correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.&lt;ref name=SciAm0808/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCRNews/&gt;

A separate 2008 study from [[Western Michigan University]] found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling more than about {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and it was found that under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All [[Toyota Prius|Prius]] models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.&lt;ref name=UCRNews/&gt;

A 2009 study conducted by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s than [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two times more likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus [[internal combustion engine|ICE]] vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.&lt;ref name="NHTSA"/&gt;

After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.&lt;ref name=Emobility/&gt;&lt;ref name=PluginCars/&gt;

==Regulations==
Since 2009 the Japanese government, the [[U.S. Congress]] and the [[European Commission]] are exploring legislation to establish a minimum level of sound for [[plug-in electric vehicle|plug-in electric]] and hybrid electric vehicles when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching. Tests have shown that vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|32|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=TMC0810/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist0509&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=The Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldenergymedia.com/News11345_Hybrid-cars-not-noisy-enough-group-says.htm |title=Hybrid cars not noisy enough, group says |author=Mike King |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2011 the [[European Commission]] drafted a guideline for Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems (AVAS). The goal is to present recommendations to manufacturers for a system to be installed in vehicles to provide an audible signal to pedestrians and vulnerable road users. This interim guideline is intended to provide guidance until the completion of on-going research activities and the development of globally harmonized device performance specifications. The guidelines are intended for hybrid electric and pure electric highway-capable vehicles. The guideline recommends that the  AVAS shall automatically generate a continuous sound in the minimum range of vehicle speed from start up to approximately {{convert|20|km/h|abbr=on}} and during reversing, if applicable for that vehicle category, and list the types of sounds that are not acceptable. It also states that the AVAS may have a pause switch to stop its operation temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2011/wp29/WP29-153-12e.pdf|title=Annex VIII - Proposal for guidelines on measures ensuring the audibility of hybrid and electric vehicles|author=Working Party on Noise (GRB)- Quiet Road Transport Vehicle Working Group|publisher=[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]|date=2011-03-11|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2013, the [[European Parliament]] approved a draft law to tighten noise limits for cars to protect public health, and also to add alerting sounds to ensure the audibility of hybrid and electric vehicles to improve the safety of vulnerable road users in urban areas, such as blind, visually and auditorily challenged pedestrians, cyclists and children. The draft legislation states a number of tests, standards and measures that must first be developed for an Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems (AVAS) to be compulsory in the future. Now an agreement has to be negotiated with [[European Union]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130201IPR05572/html/Parliament-backs-law-to-tone-down-harmful-traffic-noise|title=European Parliament backs law to tone down harmful traffic noise |author=[[European Parliament]] |publisher=European Parliament News|date=2013-02-06|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPnoise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2013-41|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 6 February 2013 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the sound level of motor vehicles (COM(2011)0856 – C7-0487/2011 – 2011/0409(COD))|author=[[European Parliament]] |publisher=European Parliament|date=2013-02-06|accessdate=2013-03-17}} See Amendments 16, 20, 58 and 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The approved amendment establishes that "the sound to be generated by the AVAS should be a continuous sound that provides information to the pedestrians and vulnerable road users of a vehicle in operation. The sound should be easily indicative of vehicle behaviour and should sound similar to the sound of a vehicle of the same category equipped with an internal combustion engine."&lt;ref name=EPnoise/&gt; In April 2014 the European Parliament approved the legislation (Regulation (EU) No 540/2014) that requires the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems, which is mandatory for all new electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The new rule established a transitional period of 5 years after publication of the final approval of the April 2014 proposal to comply with the regulation.&lt;ref name=AVAS2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2595451/Silent-deadly-EU-rules-electric-cars-make-artificial-engine-noise-fears-kill-unsuspecting-pedestrians.html|title=Silent but deadly: EU rules all electric cars must make artificial engine noise|author=Ray Massey|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Beginning in July 2009 the Japanese government began assessing possible countermeasures through the Committee for the Consideration of Countermeasures Regarding Quiet Hybrid and Other Vehicles, and in January 2010 the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] issued guidelines for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles.&lt;ref name=TMC0810/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) commissioned research to gather statistics on accidents involving electric vehicles with pedestrians who are blind or vision impaired to determine whether the perceived accident risk is real and whether electric and hybrid  cars are more difficult to detect audibly than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The DfT goal was to use the findings to establish what sort of sound should be fitted to electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.ie/news/public-policy-and-campaigns/electric-vehicles |title=The impact of electric vehicles on pedestrians who are blind or vision impaired |author=[[National Council for the Blind of Ireland]] (NCBI) |publisher=NCBI |date=February 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820083526/http://www.ncbi.ie/news/public-policy-and-campaigns/electric-vehicles |archivedate=2014-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRL2011/&gt;

The research was conducted by the [[Transport Research Laboratory]], and the findings were published in 2011. The study found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level for the majority of vehicles. In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}} or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not find an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts, which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required. The study also noted that some modern conventional cars are as quiet as their electric counterparts, even at low speeds.&lt;ref name=TRL2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/4484/CPR1131-analysis-of-stats-19-data.pdf|title=Analysis of STATS19 data to examine the relationship between the rate of vehicle accidents involving pedestrians and type approval noise levels|author=M Muirhead and L K Walter|publisher=[[Transport Research Laboratory]]|date=2013-03-01|accessdate=2013-03-17}} ''Client Project Report CPR1131''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 was approved by the [[U.S. Senate]] by unanimous consent on December 9, 2010 and passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by 379 to 30 on December 16, 2010.&lt;ref name=ACB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/critical-pedestrian-safety-legislation-moves-to-white-house-for-presidents-signature-112016879.html|title=Critical Pedestrian Safety Legislation Moves to White House for President's Signature|publisher=PR Newswire|author=[[American Council of the Blind]] Press Release|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S841&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/111/2/s841 |title=S. 841 Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 |publisher=Legislative Digest |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222013237/http://www.gop.gov/bill/111/2/s841 |archivedate=2010-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/smart-takes/hybrid-electric-vehicles-to-become-louder-for-pedestrian-safety/13077/ |title=Hybrid, electric vehicles to become louder for pedestrian safety |publisher=SmartPlanet.com |author=Larry Dignan |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219073150/http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/smart-takes/hybrid-electric-vehicles-to-become-louder-for-pedestrian-safety/13077/ |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby [[electric car|electric]] or [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid vehicle]], and the ruling must be finalized within eighteen months.&lt;ref name=ACB/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2010/12/senate-vote-adds-noise-to-silent-electric-cars-hybrids/1|title=Senate vote adds noise to silent electric cars, hybrids|author=Colin Bird|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2010-12-15|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00841:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;|title=S.841, Bill Summary and Status|publisher=The Library of Congress (THOMAS)|accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed rule was published for comment by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling at less than {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=flip|1}} to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises. The agency selected 30&amp;nbsp;km/h as the limit because according to NHTSA measurements, this is the speed at which the sound levels of the hybrid and electric vehicles  approximated the sound levels produced by similar internal combustion vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Quiet_Vehicles_NPRM.pdf|title=Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles - Notice of proposed rulemaking|author=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) |publisher=NHTSA |date=January 2013|accessdate=2013-03-22}} ''Download the file "[http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Quiet_Vehicles_NPRM.pdf Notice of Proposed Rulemaking]''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT031813/&gt; According to the NHTSA proposal, carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. The NHTSA estimates that the new warning noises would prevent 2,800 pedestrian and cyclist injuries during the life of each model year electric and hybrid vehicle.&lt;ref name=DT031813&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130318/AUTO01/303180438/1148/rss25 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130410175523/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130318/AUTO01/303180438/1148/rss25 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-10 |title=Automakers concerned NHTSA's 'quiet cars' rule too loud |author=David Shepardson |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2013-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT01713&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposal for Noisier Electric Cars at Low Speed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/business/make-electric-vehicles-noisier-at-low-speeds-for-safety-us-says.html|accessdate=2013-01-08|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-01-07|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Association of Global Automakers]] and the [[Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers]], which submitted a joint comment to the NHTSA, announced their support to the rule, but asked the NHTSA to find a noise level that effectively alerts pedestrians without being excessively loud to others inside and outside of the vehicle. They also commented that the rule is too complicated, unnecessarily prescriptive, and it will cost more than necessary. Some automakers also said there is no need for electric-drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion, "since it is not clear that it helps pedestrians to hear cars that are stopped in traffic or parked." In addition, the carmakers requested the NHTSA to make the new sound system required by 2018 instead of 2014.&lt;ref name=DT031813/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/carmakers-fight-back-over-pedestrian-warning-noises-126733.html|title=Carmakers Fight Back Over Pedestrian Warning Noises |author= Zach McDonald |publisher=PluginCars.com|date=2013-03-20|accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutoNews0313/&gt;

In January 2015, the NHTSA rescheduled the date for a final ruling to the end of 2015. Since the regulation comes into force three years after being rendered as a final rule, compliance was delayed to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/31/noise-rules-for-evs-to-help-blind-pedestrians-pushed-back-to-201/|title=Noise rules for EVs to help blind pedestrians pushed back to 2018|author=Jonathon Ramsey |work=Autoblog.com |date=2015-01-31|accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the NHTSA rescheduled one more time because additional coordination is necessary.

==Specific systems==

===Enhanced Vehicle Acoustics===
Enhanced Vehicle Acoustics (EVA), a company based in [[Silicon Valley, California]] and founded by two Stanford students with the help of seed money from the [[National Federation of the Blind]], developed an [[After-market (general)|after market]] technology called "Vehicular Operations Sound Emitting Systems" (VOSES). The device makes [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s sound more like conventional [[internal combustion engine]] cars when the vehicle goes into the silent [[all-electric mode|electric mode]] (EV mode), but at a fraction of the sound level of most vehicles. At speeds higher than between {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} to {{convert|25|mph|km/h}} the sound system shuts off. The system also shuts off when the hybrid combustion engine kicks in.&lt;ref name=NPR0608/&gt;&lt;ref name=EVA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evacoust.startlogic.com/product.html |title=Enhanced Vehicle Acoustics (EVA) Product Solution |publisher=Enhanced Vehicle Acoustics Inc |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132014/http://evacoust.startlogic.com/product.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOSES uses miniature, all-weather audio speakers that are placed on the hybrid's [[wheel well]]s and emit specific sounds based on the direction the car is moving in order to minimize [[noise pollution]] and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians. If the car is moving forward, the sounds are only projected in the forward direction; and if the car is turning left or right, the sound changes on the left or right appropriately.&lt;ref name=NPR0608&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91751319|title=Amplifying Safety in Hybrid Cars|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2008-06-21|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company argues that "chirps, beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful", and that the best sounds for alerting pedestrians are carlike, such as "the soft purr of an engine or the slow roll of tires across pavement."&lt;ref name=SciAm0808 &gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-hybrid-cars-too-quiet/|title=Are Hybrid Cars Too Quiet to Be Safe for Pedestrians? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=August 2009|author=Sarah Simpson|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the EVA's external sound systems was designed specifically for the [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref name=EVA/&gt;

===ECTunes===
ECTunes is developing a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when and where it is needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. [[Insero Horsens]], a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Loveday|date=2010-09-07|title=Video: ECTunes solves silent electric vehicle "problem" with directional noise system|publisher=AutoblogGreen |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/09/07/video-ectunes-solves-silent-ev-problem-with-directional-noise/.|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECTunes system, and most others so far disclosed, use a control box, with software, digital amplifiers and weather-friendly external speakers. ECTunes' system connects to the car, and reads speed and acceleration, shutting down when the car reaches Cross-over speed as set by existing regulation as well as regulation under development such as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTV), at which point the tires and wind are making noise of their own. The company is currently selling products to OEM's, mainly small series production, and to the after market, and has also a new mass production unit in prototype stage &lt;ref name=TDGECTunes&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Motavalli|date=2010-09-07|accessdate=2010-10-21|title=ECTunes Pioneers Pedestrian-Safety Sounds for Electric Cars|publisher=TheDailyGreen.com|url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/living-green/blogs/cars-transportation/ectunes-electric-car-noise-460910. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the company released their first version of an Electric Vehicle Electronic Engine Sound System, based on the same technology.

SoundRacer EVS use only real engine sound recordings as the base for the sounds, following the legislation guidelines that the sound "should sound similar to the sound of a vehicle of the same category equipped with an internal combustion engine". As a result, the sounds will also be less likely to be disturbing compared to adding new types of synthetic sounds into the traffic environment.

The sound modules are developed to give a realistic ICE sound impression indicating if the vehicle is idling, accelerating, decelerating or cruising. The different sound characters and sound volume is determined from information about the actual speed of the vehicle and rate of speed change.

The company targets two different applications with the products: 1. EV warning sounds, to make electric vehicles meet the upcoming legislations, and 2. Increased driving experience to make electric vehicles more popular among customer groups that appreciate real engine sounds.

Many manufacturers of electric vehicles like cars, motorcycles and scooters are now in the process of evaluating sound systems for their products. To assist them in the prototyping process the SoundRacer EVS modules have functions that will give EV manufacturers the tools to test different sounds and settings. Several files with sounds and parameter settings, such as the speed for muting the sound, sound levels and simulated gear changing, can be created with a computer program and stored on a MicroSD card. Changing sounds and settings during test drives is then performed with a touch of a button. 
 
SoundRacer AB delivers complete systems with recorded engine sounds from cars and motorcycles, including V8, V12 and V-Twin, CAN bus, analog and digital speed/rpm input and weather protected, IP68, speakers.

[[File:DCA 06 2012 Chevy Volt 4035.JPG|thumb|The 2011 [[Chevrolet Volt]] includes a manually activated warning sound.]]
[[Fisker Automotive]] developed a sound-generator that was incorporated in its [[Fisker Karma]] luxury [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]], released in 2011.&lt;ref name=Economist0509/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/05/27/fisker-karma-full-production-delayed-to-february-2011/|title=Fisker Karma full production delayed to February 2011|publisher=AutoblogGreen |author=Reuters|date=2010-05-27|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the carmaker, the sound is designed to both alert pedestrians and enhance the driver experience, and the warning noise will be emitted automatically. The Fisker Karma emits a sound through a pair of external speakers embedded in the bumper. According to a company spokesman the sound is a mix between a "Formula One car and a starship".&lt;ref name=Economist0509/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT101309&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/automobiles/14hybrid.html?_r=2|title=Hybrid Cars May Include Fake Vroom for Safety|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jim Motavalli|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2010-04/price-karma|title=The Price of Karma|author=Bill Gifford|publisher=[[Popular Science]]|date=2010-04-11|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developing process took between nine months to a year, and three sound companies sent in synthesized [[WAV]] file samples that were evaluated by Fisker employees and executives. The prospective sounds were studied in an audio chamber to allow engineers to evaluate the sounds without other noise interfering. After testing the candidate sounds in different locations relative to the vehicle, Fisker fine-tuned the final sound with its own equipment.&lt;ref name=NYT101309/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT101509&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/could-electric-cars-sound-like-blade-runner/|title=Could Electric Cars Sound Like ‘Blade Runner?’|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2009-10-15|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=FiskerSpeed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/08/autos/la-fi-hy-autos-dot-noise-rules-hybrid-electric-vehicles-20130108 |title=Noise requirements proposed for hybrid and electric vehicles |author=David Undercoffler|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2013-01-08|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford===
The 2012 [[Ford Focus Electric]] was planned to include warning sounds for pedestrians. [[Ford Motor Company]] developed four alternative sounds, and in June 2011 involved the electric car fans by asking them to pick their favorite from the four potential warning sounds through the Focus Electric [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/124432/how-should-the-ford-focus-electric-sound/|title=How should the Ford Focus Electric sound?|author=Tim Beissmann|publisher=Car Advice|date=2011-06-24|accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ultimately Ford decided to hold off including warning sounds unless federal legislation required it, and no such system was implemented on the production vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon-Bloomfield|first=Nikki|title=2012 Ford Focus Electric Won’t Have a Pedestrian Alert Noisemaker|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1067341_2012-ford-focus-electric-wont-have-a-pedestrian-alert-noisemaker|publisher=GreenCarReports|accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Motors===
[[General Motors]]' first commercially available [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]], the [[Chevrolet Volt]], introduced in December 2010, includes warning sounds for pedestrians.&lt;ref name=GMVolt09&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2009/11/gm-says-volt-crew-working-to-resolve-silent-ev-sound-safety-issue.html |title=GM Says Volt Crew Working to Resolve 'Silent EV' Sound Safety Issue |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129144841/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2009/11/gm-says-volt-crew-working-to-resolve-silent-ev-sound-safety-issue.html |archivedate=2009-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/green_machines/2011_chevrolet_volt_first_drive_car_news|title=2011 Chevrolet Volt First Drive - Car News|author=Tony Quiroga |publisher=Car and Driver |date=April 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/112_0904_2011_chevrolet_volt_mule_drive/index.html|title=First Drive: 2011 Chevrolet Volt Mule |author=Frank Markus |publisher=Motor Trend |date= 2009-04-28|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM's system is called '''Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System''' and it is manually activated by the driver, but future generations probably will include an active system.&lt;ref name=NYTRingT/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABVideo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1039019_2011-chevrolet-volt-pedestrian-alert-system-will-be-driver-controlled|title=2011 Chevrolet Volt Pedestrian Alert System Will Be Driver Controlled |publisher=GreenCarReports.com |author= John Voelcker|date=2009-11-25|accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The automaker conducted a test with a group of the visually challenged at [[Milford Proving Grounds]] in order to evaluate the audible warning systems on the Volt when a pedestrian is in the car's proximity. The system uses the car's horn to emit a series of warning chirps, like a low tone of a horn, enough to provide an alert but not to startle. According to GM engineers, the biggest challenge is "developing an active system that can distinguish a pedestrian from another vehicle"; otherwise, the sound will go off frequently, producing [[noise pollution]] instead.&lt;ref name=NYTRingT/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABVideo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/11/25/video-chevrolet-volt-tests-driver-controlled-audio-warning-syst/|title=VIDEO: Chevrolet Volt tests driver-controlled audio warning system with the blind|publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|author=Sam Abuelsamid |date=2009-11-29|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyundai===
[[Hyundai]] developed a warning noise for called the '''Virtual Engine Sound System''' ('''VESS'''). The system, which was introduced in September 2010 on its test fleet of [[Hyundai BlueOn|BlueOn]] electric hatchbacks, provides synthetic audio feedback mimicking the sound of an idling [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/09/09/hyundai-blueon-electric-vehicle-unveiled-in-south-korea/#continued|title=Hyundai Unveils its First Electric Car 'BlueOn'|author=[[Hyundai]] Press Release|publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/09/blueon-hyundais-electric-_n_711268.html|title=Hyundai's BlueOn: Automaker Unveils Its First Electric Car|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 [[Hyundai Sonata Hybrid]] is the first [[mass production]] car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker decided to have a button on the Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after the enactment of the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device to be turned off, Hyundai decided not to install the button, and the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.&lt;ref name=SonataHybrid&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110304/CARNEWS/110309940|title=Hyundai delays Sonata Hybrid deliveries for change in sound device|work=Autoweek.com|author=Ryan Beene|date=2011-03-04|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotus Engineering===
Lotus Engineering, a consultancy group of British sports carmaker [[Lotus Cars]], partnered in 2009 with [[Harman International Industries#Automotive systems|Harman Becker]], a producer of audio systems, to develop and commercialize a synthetic automotive audio systems. Lotus has worked on a number of [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] and [[all-electric vehicle|electric vehicle]]s and its engineers thought they would be safer if these vehicles made a noise while moving around the factory.&lt;ref name=Economist0509/&gt; Originally developed to [[Active noise control|cancel out intrusive noises]] inside a car, the noise canceling system was adapted so that it could also simulate engine sounds that change with speed and use of the throttle, providing audible "feedback" to drivers of vehicles with a silent engine. At the same time, and through the addition of external speakers, the sound system allows pedestrians to hear the noise too, but optionally there can be a different sound within the car from the one that is emitted for the outside.&lt;ref name=Economist0509/&gt; Lotus used a [[Toyota Prius]] to demonstrate the device but did not reveal if it intended to bring this technology to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/safetu/lotus-fake-noise-hybrids-08072.html|title=Lotus Device Makes Fake Noise for Hybrids|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2008-08-07|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813115435/http://www.hybridcars.com/safetu/lotus-fake-noise-hybrids-08072.html|archivedate=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6460607/Electric-cars-the-silent-danger.html|title=Electric cars: the silent danger|author= Stuart Birch |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2009-11-03|accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotus' synthetic sound system was incorporated in the [[Lotus Evora]] 414E Hybrid, a [[concept car|concept]] [[plug-in hybrid]] unveiled at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. The system, called '''HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis''', is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and [[Harman International Industries|Harman International]]. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at the front and rear to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.&lt;ref name= LotusSound&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2010/06/22/483602.html|title=Lotus Evora 414E Showcases Hybrid Technology |publisher=The Auto Channel |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nissan===
[[File:Nissan Leaf warning sound switch.jpg|thumb|upright|2011 [[Nissan Leaf]] equipped with warning sound pause switch.]]
'''Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians''' or '''VSP''' is a [[Nissan]]-developed warning sound system in [[battery electric vehicle|electric vehicles]]. The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the [[electric car]] includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside to be aware of the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the [[National Federation of the Blind]], the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] and a [[Hollywood]] sound design studio.&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=NissanNoise&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/100611-01-e.html|title=Nissan demonstrates the affordable, 100% electric, zero-emission Nissan LEAF|publisher=[[Nissan]]|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2010-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614103425/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/100611-01-e.html|archivedate=2010-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutoBlogNoise&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/06/14/nissan-leaf-will-break-the-ev-silence-with-a-digital-whistle-w/#continued|title=Nissan Leaf will break the EV silence with a digital whistle [w/video]|publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|date=2010-06-14|accessdate=2010-06-15}} ''The article has a video with the Leaf warning sounds.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissan's Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians is a sine-wave sound system that sweeps from 2.5 [[kHz]] at the high end to a low of 600 [[Hertz|Hz]], a range that is easily audible across age groups. Depending on the speed and whether the Leaf is accelerating or decelerating, the sound system will make sweeping, high-low sounds. For example, when the Leaf is started the sound will be louder, and when the car is in reverse, the system will generate an intermittent sound. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches {{convert|30|km/h|1|abbr=on}} and engages again as the car slows to under {{convert|25|km/h|0}}. For the 2011 Leaf, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to "On" at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the dash panel, and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver's side [[wheel well]].&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt;&lt;ref name=NissanNoise/&gt;&lt;ref name=JustAutoLeaf&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.just-auto.com/news/nissan-makes-leaf-noisier-at-low-speed_id104731.aspx?lk=dm|title=JAPAN: Nissan makes Leaf noisier at low speed|publisher=Just Auto|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nissan said that there were six or seven finalist sounds, and that sound testing included driving cars emitting various sounds past testers standing on street corners, who indicated when they first heard the approaching car.&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt; Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]].&lt;ref name=LeafDisable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insideevs.com/all-evs-operating-under-18-mph-to-have-audible-warning/|title= All EVs Operating Under 18 MPH To Have Audible Warning |author=Jay Cole|publisher=InsideEvs.com|date=2013-01-07|accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leaf's electric warning sound had to be removed for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/8880765.Nissan_Leaf_facing_delay/|title=Nissan Leaf facing delay|work=The Northern Echo|author=Andy Richardson|date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Toyota===
[[File:プリウス.jpg|thumb|Since August 2010, a warning device for retrofitting the [[Toyota Prius]] is available for Japanese consumers.]]
[[Toyota Motor Company]] teamed up with [[Fujitsu Ten]] to develop an automatic warning system for hybrids and electric vehicles to alert pedestrians when the car is propelled by its electric motor. The companies also studied the development of a system that would change the alarm's tune and volume with the assistance of an obstacle-detection radar.&lt;ref name=TMC09&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20090914-167859.html |title=Pedestrian warning system sought for quiet hybrid, electric vehicles |author=Yomiuri Shimbun |publisher=AsiaOne Motoring |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007160426/http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20090914-167859.html |archivedate=2012-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APress0710&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/jul/04/silent-hybrids-may-pose-danger/|title=Silent hybrids may pose danger |author=Ken Thomas ([[Associated Press]])|publisher=KnoxNews|date=2010-07-04|accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2010 Toyota began sales of an onboard device designed to automatically emit a synthesized sound of an electric motor when the [[Toyota Prius|Prius]] is operating as an [[all-electric mode|electric vehicle]] at speeds up to approximately {{Convert|25|km/h}}. The device will be available in Japan through authorized Toyota dealers and Toyota genuine parts &amp; accessories distributors for retrofitting on the third-generation Prius at a price of  {{yen|12,600}} (~{{USD|150}}) including the consumption tax. The alert sound rises and falls in pitch according to the vehicle's speed, thus helping indicate the vehicle's proximity and movement to nearby pedestrians. Toyota is planning to use other versions of the device for use in [[hybrid electric vehicle|gasoline-electric hybrids]], [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s as well as [[fuel-cell]] hybrid vehicles planned for [[mass production]]. The device meets the 2010 government regulations issued for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles.&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toyota's Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS) was introduced in the United States in all 2012 [[model year]] Prius family vehicles, including the [[Prius v]], [[Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] and the standard Prius. The system is being introduced to comply with the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010.&lt;ref name=Prii&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1066487_2012-toyota-prius-prius-v-prius-plug-in-hybrid-now-with-spaceship-sound|title=2012 Toyota Prius, Prius V, Prius Plug-in Hybrid: Now With Spaceship Sound|author=Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield|publisher=Electric Car Reports|date=2011-09-23|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20110209-48/prius-artificial-engine-noise-demonstrated-explained/|title=Prius' artificial engine noise demonstrated, explained|author=Antuan Goodwin|publisher=CNET Cartech|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volkswagen===
[[Volkswagen]] offers a so-called e-Sound module on its electric and hybrid vehicles such as the e-Up, e-Golf and the GTE hybrid range. It provides a pedestrian warning sound up to 30 km/h.

===Other carmakers===
[[Tesla Motors]] and [[Think Global]], both manufactures of [[electric car]]s already in the market, are assessing this safety issue.&lt;ref name=NYTRingT/&gt; [[Ford Motor Company]] is developing a system for emitting external sounds to future hybrids and electrics, including its [[Ford Focus BEV|Focus BEV]], scheduled for 2011, and a next-generation hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle planned for 2012. Nancy Gioia, Ford's Director for Global Electrification commented that "car companies should consider standardizing tones from future hybrids and electrics to avoid a cacophony of confusion on the streets."&lt;ref name=APress0710/&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
After Nissan's new sounds were publicized, the U.S. [[National Federation of the Blind]] issued a statement saying that "while it was pleased that the alert existed, it was unhappy that the driver was able to turn it off."&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt; The NFB approves the Nissan Leaf's forward motion sound, but it said the forward noise should also be used for reversing because the "intermittent sound is not as effective as a continuous sound" and that the car should emit warning sounds when it is idling, not only when it's moving slowly. Nevertheless, their main complaint is that they don’t think the driver should be able to switch the sound off.&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt;

Several anti-noise and [[electric car]] advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as they argue that the proposed system will only increase [[noise pollution]]. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.&lt;ref name=NYT062110&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/anti-noise-activists-oppose-sounds-for-electric-cars/?scp=9&amp;sq=warning%20sound%20electric%20car&amp;st=cse|title=Anti-Noise Activists Oppose Sounds for Electric Cars|author=Jim Motavalli|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-06-21|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert S. Wall Emerson of [[Western Michigan University]] has argued that several high-end gasoline-powered [[luxury car]]s are already quieter than hybrids, and according to his most recent studies, [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[SUV]]s were noisier than many internal-combustion vehicles. He concludes that pedestrian safety is not a hybrid issue but rather "a quiet car issue''.''"&lt;ref name=UCRNews/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Embassy of Heaven''' is a Christian-based [[new religious movement]] based in [[Stayton, Oregon]], that seeks to separate from secular government. Its members profess to be literal citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven and reject any ties to what they refer to as "worldly governments". The organization issues its own identity documents (including passports and driver's licenses), business licenses, motor vehicle title certificates and license plates. The group's leader is Craig Douglas Fleshman, a former Oregon state computer systems analyst who goes by the name "Pastor [[Paul Revere]]". Another individual who has been associated with the organization in the past is Glen Stoll, an individual who "falsely hold[s] himself out to be a 'lawyer' and claims to have spent considerable time studying the tax laws" but who "is not a member of or licensed with any state or federal bar."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Stoll'', case no. C05-0262RSM, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle Div.) (June 27, 2005), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14721707028186875952&amp;q=tax+%22Glen+Stoll%22&amp;as_sdt=3,44].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has identified the Embassy of Heaven group as being part of the [[sovereign citizen movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sovereign Citizen Movement," Anti-Defamation League, at [http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/SCM.asp?xpicked=4&amp;item=sov].&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities have asserted that the organization is set up to [[Tax protester (United States)|avoid paying taxes]]. Though its leaders refer to themselves as lawyers, none has any education in law nor have they passed the [[bar exam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/212422_corpsole17.html| title=Two Snohomish County men accused of anti-tax scheme |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=2005-02-17  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-02-04 | first1=Candace | last1=Heckman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has run afoul of tax codes because it does not recognize the authority of the United States. In 1997, sheriff's deputies raided the group's property and seized it for non-payment of taxes. Pastor Revere insisted the taxes were not owed because the property was "a separate nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iahushua.com/WOI/embassy.htm Embassy of Heaven evicted in tax case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several members have been arrested for driving cars with "Kingdom of Heaven" license plates and showing similar driver's licenses to law enforcement officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassyofheaven.com/catalog/licensby.htm Licensed By Heaven&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://goingtojail.embassyofheaven.com/gotojail087b.htm |title=Going to Jail - First Police Encounter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905090347/http://goingtojail.embassyofheaven.com/gotojail087b.htm |archive-date=2007-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassyofheaven.com/current/orland.htm Orland, Calif.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Minnesota state insurance regulators ordered the Embassy of Heaven Church to stop making what the regulators called misrepresentations, using the name "Mutual Assurance", in connection with the sale of insurance in Minnesota. The regulators asserted that a type of auto insurance promoted by the group is bogus, and that the group had no license to sell insurance in Minnesota. Embassy of Heaven spokesman Paul Revere responded, asserting that the group does not sell insurance. Revere was also quoted as saying, "We don't operate in Minnesota. ... We operate in the Kingdom of Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Bjorhus, "State: Embassy of Heaven 'insurance' is far from divine," Oct. 10, 2012, Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis, Minn.), at [http://www.startribune.com/business/173514331.html?refer=y].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Coal power plant Datteln 2 Crop1.png|thumb|200px|A coal power plant in Germany. Due to emissions trading, [[coal]] may become a less competitive fuel than other options.]]
[[Pollution]] is the prime example of a market externality. An [[externality]] is an effect of some activity on an entity (such as a person) that is not party to a market transaction related to that activity. Emissions trading is a market-based approach to address pollution. The overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of meeting a set emissions target.&lt;ref name="cap101"&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/01/capandtrade101.html Cap and Trade 101], [[Center for American Progress]], January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an emissions trading system, the government sets an overall limit on emissions, and defines permits (also called allowances), or limited authorizations to emit, up to the level of the overall limit. The government may sell the permits, but in many existing schemes, it gives permits to participants (regulated polluters) equal to each participant's baseline emissions. The baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions. To demonstrate compliance, a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period. If every participant complies, the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits.&lt;ref name=boswall&gt;Boswall, J. and Lee, R. (2002). Economics, ethics and the environment. London: Cavendish. pp.62–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Because permits can be bought and sold, a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly (by reducing its own emissions); or to emit less than its permits, and perhaps sell the excess permits; or to emit more than its permits, and buy permits from other participants. In effect, the buyer pays a charge for polluting, while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions.

In many schemes, organizations which do not pollute (and therefore have no obligations) may also trade permits and financial derivatives of permits. In some schemes, participants can bank allowances to use in future periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cap and Trade 101|url=http://www.epa.gov/captrade/captrade-101.html|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some schemes, a proportion of all traded permits must be retired periodically, causing a net reduction in emissions over time. Thus, [[environmental group]]s may buy and retire permits, driving up the price of the remaining permits according to the [[law of demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)|O'Sullivan, Arthur]], and [[Steven M. Sheffrin]]. ''Economics: Principles in Action''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2003. {{ISBN|0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most schemes, permit owners can donate permits to a nonprofit entity and receive a tax deduction. Usually, the government lowers the overall limit over time, with an aim towards a national emissions reduction target.&lt;ref name="cap101" /&gt;

According to the Environmental Defense Fund, cap-and-trade is the most environmentally and economically sensible approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming, because it sets a limit on emissions, and the trading encourages companies to innovate in order to emit less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How cap and trade works|url=http://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"International trade can offer a range of positive and negative incentives to promote international cooperation on climate change (robust evidence, medium agreement). Three issues are key to developing constructive relationships between international trade and climate agreements: how existing trade policies and rules can be modified to be more climate friendly; whether border adjustment measures (BAMs) or other trade measures can be effective in meeting the goals of international climate agreements; whether the UNFCCC, World Trade Organization (WTO), hybrid of the two, or a new institution is the best forum for a trade-and-climate architecture."&lt;ref name="report.mitigation2014.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_chapter13.pdf |title=International Cooperation: Agreements and Instruments |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929140547/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_chapter13.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an emissions limit has been set by a government political process, individual companies are free to choose how or whether to reduce their emissions. Failure to report emissions and surrender emission permits is often punishable by a further government regulatory mechanism, such as a fine that increases costs of production. Firms will choose the least-cost way to comply with the pollution regulation, which will lead to reductions where the least expensive solutions exist, while allowing emissions that are more expensive to reduce.

Under an emissions trading system, each regulated polluter has flexibility to use the most cost-effective combination of buying or selling emission permits, reducing its emissions by installing cleaner technology, or reducing its emissions by reducing production. The most cost-effective strategy depends on the polluter's marginal abatement cost and the market price of permits. In theory, a polluter's decisions should lead to an economically efficient allocation of reductions among polluters, and lower compliance costs for individual firms and for the economy overall, compared to command-and-control mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, JV and Walton, AL, "A case study in pollution markets: dismal science US. Dismal reality" (1996) XIV Contemporary Economic Policy 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boswall/&gt;

=== Emission markets ===
For emissions trading where greenhouse gases are regulated, one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one [[metric ton]] of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions. Other names for emissions permits are [[carbon credits]], Kyoto units, [[assigned amount units]], and [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CER). These permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price. These trade and [[Settlement (finance)|settle]] internationally, and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries. Each international transfer is validated by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). Each transfer of ownership within the [[European Union]] is additionally validated by the [[European Commission]].

Emissions trading programmes such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) complement the country-to-country trading stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol by allowing private trading of permits. Under such programmes – which are generally co-ordinated with the national emissions targets provided within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol – a national or international authority allocates permits to individual companies based on established criteria, with a view to meeting national and/or regional Kyoto targets at the lowest overall economic cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Treaty Issues Related to Emissions Permits/Credits|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/report-emissions-permits.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading exchanges have been established to provide a [[spot market]] in permits, as well as [[Futures market|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] [[Futures exchange|market]] to help discover a market price and maintain [[market liquidity|liquidity]]. Carbon prices are normally quoted in [[euro]]s per tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e). Other greenhouse gases can also be traded, but are quoted as standard multiples of carbon dioxide with respect to their [[global warming potential]]. These features reduce the quota's financial impact on business, while ensuring that the quotas are met at a national and international level.

Currently, there are six exchanges trading in UNFCCC related [[carbon credits]]: the [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] (until 2010&lt;ref name=ng2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/news/energy/2010/11/101103-chicago-climate-exchange-cap-and-trade-election/ |title=A U.S. Cap-And-Trade Experiment to End |newspaper=National Geographic |date=November 3, 2010 |last= Lavelle |first=Marianne  |accessdate=November 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[European Climate Exchange]], [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]], [[Powernext|PowerNext]], [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]] and the [[European Energy Exchange]]. NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe listed a contract to trade offsets generated by a CDM [[carbon project]] called Certified Emission Reductions. Many companies now engage in emissions abatement, offsetting, and sequestration programs to generate credits that can be sold on one of the exchanges. At least one [[private electronic market]] has been established in 2008: CantorCO2e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-184638199.html |title=CantorCO2e Launches First Internet CER Auction  |publisher=CantorCO2e |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon credits at Commodity Exchange Bratislava are traded at special platform called Carbon place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonplace.eu|title=Carbon Place .

Trading in emission permits is one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services in the [[City of London]] with a market estimated to be worth about €30 billion in 2007. Louis Redshaw, head of environmental markets at [[Barclays Capital]], predicts that "carbon will be the world's biggest commodity market, and it could become the world's biggest market overall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanter |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-money.4.6234700.html?_r=1 |title=Carbon trading: Where greed is green |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution markets ===
An emission license directly confers a right to emit pollutants up to a certain rate.
In contrast, a '''pollution license''' for a given location confers the right to emit pollutants at a rate which will cause no more than a specified increase at the pollution-level. For concreteness, consider the following model.&lt;ref name="Montgomery1972"/&gt;
* There are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; agents each of which emits &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; pollutants.
* There are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; locations each of which suffers pollution &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;.
* The pollution is a linear combination of the emissions. The relation between &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is given by a ''diffusion matrix'' &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, such that: &lt;math&gt;q = H\cdot e&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, consider three countries along a river (as in the [[fair river sharing]] setting).
* Pollution in the upstream country is determined only by the emission of the upstream country: &lt;math&gt;q_1 = e_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Pollution in the middle country is determined by its own emission and by the emission of country 1: &lt;math&gt;q_2 = e_1 + e_2&lt;/math&gt;.
* Pollution in the downstream country is the sum of all emissions: &lt;math&gt;q_3 = e_1 + e_2 + e_3&lt;/math&gt;.
So the matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this case is a triangular matrix of ones.

Each pollution-license for location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; permits its holder to emit pollutants that will cause at most this level of pollution at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a polluter that affects water quality at a number of points has to hold a portfolio of licenses covering all relevant monitoring-points. In the above example, if country 2 wants to emit a unit of pollutant, it should purchase two permits: one for location 2 and one for location 3.

Montgomery shows that, while both markets lead to efficient license allocation, the market in pollution-licenses is more widely applicable than the market in emission-licenses.&lt;ref name="Montgomery1972"/&gt;

==History==
The international community began the long process towards building effective international and domestic measures to tackle GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydroflurocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride) in response to the increasing assertions that global warming is happening due to man-made emissions and the uncertainty over its likely consequences. That process began in Rio in 1992, when 160 countries agreed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC is, as its title suggests, simply a framework; the necessary detail was left to be settled by the Conference of Parties (CoP) to the UNFCCC.&lt;ref name=boswall/&gt;

The efficiency of what later was to be called the "cap-and-trade" approach to [[air pollution]] abatement was first demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer simulation studies between 1967 and 1970 for the National Air Pollution Control Administration (predecessor to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Office of Air and Radiation) by Ellison Burton and William Sanjour. These studies used mathematical models of several cities and their emission sources in order to compare the cost and effectiveness of various control strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ellison, and William Sanjour (1967) ''An Economic Analysis of the Control of Sulphur Oxides Air Pollution'' DHEW Program Analysis Report No. 1967-69 Washington, D.C.: Ernst and Ernst.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ellison, and William Sanjour.

DHEW Contract No. CPA 22-69-17. Washington, D.C.: Ernst and Ernst.&lt;/ref&gt; Each abatement strategy was compared with the "least-cost solution" produced by a computer optimization program to identify the least-costly combination of source reductions in order to achieve a given abatement goal. In each case it was found that the least-cost solution was dramatically less costly than the same amount of pollution reduction produced by any conventional abatement strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burton | first1 = E.

Pechan continued improving &lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ellison S., Edward H. Pechan III, and William Sanjour. (1973). ''A Survey of Air Pollution Control Models''. Rolf A. Deininger, ed.

The agency introduced the concept of computer modeling with least-cost abatement strategies (i.e., emissions trading) in its 1972 annual report to Congress on the cost of clean air.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (1972). ''The Economics of Clean Air'', Annual Report of the Environmental Protection Agency to the Congress of the United States. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the concept of "cap and trade" as a means of achieving the "least-cost solution" for a given level of abatement.

The development of emissions trading over the course of its history can be divided into four phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Voss | first1 = Jan-Peter | year = 2007 | title = Innovation processes in governance: the development of ''emissions trading'' as a new policy instrument | url = | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 329–343 | doi=10.3152/030234207x228584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Prototype: Launching of a first "cap-and-trade" system as part of the US [[Acid Rain Program]] in Title IV of the [[1990 Clean Air Act]], officially announced as a paradigm shift in environmental policy, as prepared by "Project 88", a network-building effort to bring together environmental and industrial interests in the US.
# Regime formation: branching out from the [[The Center for Clean Air Policy|US clean air policy]] to [[Climate change policy of the United States|global climate policy]], and from there to the European Union, along with the expectation of an emerging global [[carbon]] market and the formation of the "carbon industry".

In the United States, the "[[acid rain]]"-related emission trading system was principally conceived by [[Boyden Gray|C. Boyden Gray]], a [[George H. W. Bush|G.H.W. Bush]] administration attorney. Gray worked with the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF), who worked with the EPA to write the bill that became law as part of the Clean Air Act of 1990. The new emissions cap on NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and {{SO2|link=yes}} gases took effect in 1995, and according to ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine, those acid rain emissions dropped 3 million tons that year.&lt;ref&gt;Coniff, Richard (Aug. 2009). [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Presence-of-Mind-Blue-Sky-Thinking.html?c=y&amp;page=3 "The Political History of Cap and Trade"]. ''Smithsonian Magazine.'' Retrieved 1-13-2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the CoP agreed, in what has been described as a watershed in international environmental treaty making, the Kyoto Protocol where 38 developed countries (Annex 1 countries) committed themselves to targets and timetables for the reduction of GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;Grimeaud, D, ‘An overview of the policy and legal aspects of the international climate change regime’ (2001) 9(2) Environmental Liability 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These targets for developed countries are often referred to as Assigned Amounts.

One important economic reality recognised by many of the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol is that, if countries have to solely rely on their own domestic measures, the resulting inflexible limitations on GHG growth could entail very large costs, perhaps running into many trillions of dollars globally.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R, "Economic incentives for environmental protection: opportunities and obstacles", in Revesz, R; Sands, P; Stewart, R (eds.), ''Environment Law, the Economy and Sustainable Development'', 2000, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, international mechanisms which would allow developed countries flexibility to meet their targets were included in the Kyoto Protocol. The purpose of these mechanisms is to allow the parties to find the most economical ways to achieve their targets. These international mechanisms are outlined under Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name=boswall/&gt;

On April 17, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally announced that it had found that greenhouse gas (GHG) poses a threat to public health and the environment (EPA 2009a). This announcement was significant because it gives the executive branch the authority to impose carbon regulations on carbon-emitting entities.&lt;ref name=Roos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|first1=Joseph A.|last2=Barber|first2=Valerie|last3=Brackley|first3=Allen M.|title=Cap and Trade: Offsets and Implications for Alaska|date=March 2011|url=http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol1/C/713310520.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
&lt;!--This is separated into two paragraphs unless opinions from other countries are presented, in which case US opinion will be a single paragraph--&gt;

In the United States, most polling shows large support for emissions trading (often referred to as cap-and-trade). This majority support can be seen in polls conducted by [[Washington Post]]/[[ABC News]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/24/AR2009062403648.html Majority of Poll Respondents Say U.S. Should Limit Greenhouse Gases]", ''Washington Post''. 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zogby International]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2009/08/11/poll-position-new-zogby-poll-shows-71-support-for-waxman-markey/ Poll Position: New Zogby Poll Shows 71% Support for Waxman-Markey]", ''Wall Street Journal''. 11 Aug. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://climate.yale.edu/news/poll-americans-support-strong-climate-energy-policies Poll: Americans Support Strong Climate, Energy Policies]",Yale Climate &amp; Energy Institute  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128201527/http://climate.yale.edu/news/poll-americans-support-strong-climate-energy-policies |date=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Washington Post-ABC poll reveals that majorities of the American people believe in climate change, are concerned about it, are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it, and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases. They are, however, ambivalent on cap-and-trade.&lt;ref name="grist.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=David|title=What can we learn from polls on cap-and-trade?|journal=grist|date=26 Jun 2009|url=http://grist.org/article/2009-06-25-polls-cap-and-trade/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than three-quarters of respondents, 77.0%, reported they “strongly support” (51.0%) or “somewhat support” (26.0%) the EPA's decision to regulate carbon emissions. While 68.6% of respondents reported being “very willing” (23.0%) or “somewhat willing” (45.6%), another 26.8% reported being “somewhat unwilling” (8.8%) or “not at all willing” (18.0%) to pay higher prices for “Green” energy sources to support funding for programs that reduce the effect of global warming.&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

According to [[PolitiFact]], it is a misconception that emissions trading is unpopular in the United States because of earlier polls from [[IBOPE Zogby International|Zogby International]] and [[Rasmussen]] which misleadingly include "new taxes" in the questions (taxes aren't part of emissions trading) or high energy cost estimates.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/ibdeditorialscom/ibd-editorial-board-claims-cap-and-trade-unpopular/ IBD editorial board claims that cap-and-trade is unpopular in America]", PolitiFact&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other methods of emission reduction==
Cap and trade is the textbook emissions trading program. Other market-based approaches include baseline-and-credit, and pollution tax. They all put a price on pollution (for example, see [[carbon price]]), and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities. By contrast, in a command-and-control approach, a central authority designates pollution levels each facility is allowed to emit.  Cap and trade essentially functions as a tax where the tax rate is variable based on the relative cost of abatement per unit, and the tax base is variable based on the amount of abatement needed.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

=== Baseline and credit ===
In a baseline and credit program, polluters can create permits, called credits or offsets, by reducing their emissions below a baseline level, which is often the historical emissions level from a designated past year.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions |title=Cap and Trade: Key Terms Glossary |work=Climate Change 101 |date=January 2011 |url=http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/climate101-captrade.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005153958/http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/climate101-captrade.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-05 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such credits can be bought by polluters that have a regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomitz |first=Kenneth M. |year=1999 |title=Evaluating Carbon Offsets from Forestry and Energy Projects: How Do They Compare? |ssrn=630729 |publisher=World Bank |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series |volume=2357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution tax===

Emissions fees or environmental tax is a surcharge on the pollution created while producing goods and services.&lt;ref name="rosengayer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosen |last2=Gayer |first1=Harvey S. |first2=Ted |title=Public Finance |year=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-351128-3 |pages=90–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a carbon tax is a tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels that aims to discourage their use and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; The two approaches are overlapping sets of policy designs. Both can have a range of scopes, points of regulation, and price schedules. They can be fair or unfair, depending on how the revenue is used. Both have the effect of increasing the price of goods (such as fossil fuels) to consumers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Carbon Tax and Cap-and-trade Tools : Market-based Approaches for Controlling Greenhouse Gases|last = Burney|first = Nelson E.|publisher = [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|year = 2010|isbn = 9781608761371|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comprehensive, upstream, auctioned cap-and-trade system is very similar to a comprehensive, upstream carbon tax. Yet, many commentators sharply contrast the two approaches.

The main difference is what is defined and what derived. A tax is a price control, while cap-and-trade method acts is a quantity control instrument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is, a tax is a unit price for pollution that is set by authorities, and the market determines the quantity emitted; in cap and trade, authorities determine the amount of pollution, and the market determines the price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durning|first1=Alan|title=carBon tax vS. cap and trade|journal=Cap and Trade 101 A Federal Climate Policy Primer|date=July 2009|page=28|url=http://www.sightline.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/02/Cap-Trade_online.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707153526/http://www.sightline.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/02/Cap-Trade_online.pdf|archivedate=7 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference affects a number of criteria.&lt;ref name="rosengayer"/&gt;

'''Responsiveness to inflation:''' Cap-and-trade has the advantage that it adjusts to [[inflation]] (changes to overall prices) automatically, while emissions fees must be changed by regulators.

'''Responsiveness to cost changes:''' It is not clear which approach is better. It is possible to combine the two into a safety valve price: a price set by regulators, at which polluters can buy additional permits beyond the cap.

'''Responsiveness to recessions:''' This point is closely related to responsiveness to cost changes, because recessions cause a drop in demand. Under cap and trade, the emissions cost automatically decreases, so a cap-and-trade scheme adds another [[automatic stabilizer]] to the economy - in effect, an automatic fiscal stimulus. However, a lower pollution price also results in reduced efforts to reduce pollution. If the government is able to stimulate the economy regardless of the cap-and-trade scheme, an excessively low price causes a missed opportunity to cut emissions faster than planned. Instead, it might be better to have a price floor (a tax). This is especially true when cutting pollution is urgent, as with greenhouse gas emissions. A price floor also provides certainty and stability for investment in emissions reductions: recent experience from the UK shows that nuclear power operators are reluctant to invest on "un-subsidised" terms unless there is a guaranteed price floor for carbon (which the EU emissions trading scheme does not presently provide).

'''Responsiveness to uncertainty:''' As with cost changes, in a world of uncertainty, it is not clear whether emissions fees or cap-and-trade systems are more efficient—it depends on how fast the marginal social benefits of reducing pollution fall with the amount of cleanup (e.g., whether inelastic or elastic marginal social benefit schedule).

'''Other:''' The magnitude of the tax will depend on how sensitive the supply of emissions is to the price. The permit price of cap-and-trade will depend on the pollutant market. A tax generates government revenue, but full-auctioned emissions permits can do the same. A similar upstream cap-and-trade system could be implemented. An upstream carbon tax might be the simplest to administer. Setting up a complex cap-and-trade arrangement that is comprehensive has high institutional needs.&lt;ref&gt;Calel, Raphael, [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue9/researchnotes/S_H_Calel.pdf "The Language of Climate Change Policy"], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command-and-control regulation===

Command and control is a system of regulation that prescribes emission limits and compliance methods for each facility or source. It is the traditional approach to reducing air pollution.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt;

Command-and-control regulations are more rigid than incentive-based approaches such as pollution fees and cap and trade. An example of this is a performance standard which sets an emissions goal for each polluter that is fixed and, therefore, the burden of reducing pollution cannot be shifted to the firms that can achieve it more cheaply. As a result, performance standards are likely to be more costly overall.&lt;ref name="rosengayer" /&gt; The additional costs would be passed to end consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|author1=Yujie Lu |author2=Xinyuan Zhu |author3=Qingbin Cui |title=Effectiveness and equity implications of carbon policies in the United States construction industry|journal=Building and Environment|volume=49|pages=259–269|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of international emissions trading==
{{trade bloc}}
It is possible for a country to reduce emissions using a [[Command and Control (government)|Command-Control]] approach, such as regulation, [[direct tax|direct]] and [[indirect tax]]es. The cost of that approach differs between countries because the [[Marginal Abatement Cost Curve]] (MAC)&amp;nbsp;— the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution&amp;nbsp;— differs by country. It might cost China $2 to eliminate a ton of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], but it would probably cost Norway or the U.S. much more. International emissions-trading markets were created precisely to exploit differing MACs.

===Example===
Emissions trading through [[Gains from trade|''Gains from Trade'']] can be more beneficial for both the buyer and the seller than a simple emissions capping scheme.

Consider two European countries, such as Germany and Sweden. Each can either reduce all the required amount of emissions by itself or it can choose to buy or sell in the market.

[[File:Emissions.Trading.jpeg|thumb|400px|left|Example MACs for two different countries]]
Suppose Germany can abate its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at a much cheaper cost than Sweden, i.e. MAC&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; MAC&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; where the MAC curve of Sweden is steeper (higher slope) than that of Germany, and R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; is the total amount of emissions that need to be reduced by a country.

On the left side of the graph is the MAC curve for Germany. R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of required reductions for Germany, but at R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; the MAC&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; curve has not intersected the market emissions permit price of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (market permit price = P = λ). Thus, given the market price of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowances, Germany has potential to profit if it abates more emissions than required.

On the right side is the MAC curve for Sweden. R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of required reductions for Sweden, but the MAC&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; curve already intersects the market price of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permits before R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; has been reached. Thus, given the market price of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permits, Sweden has potential to make a cost saving if it abates fewer emissions than required internally, and instead abates them elsewhere.

In this example, Sweden would abate emissions until its MAC&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; intersects with P (at R*), but this would only reduce a fraction of Sweden's total required abatement.

After that it could buy emissions credits from Germany for the price ''P'' (per unit). The internal cost of Sweden's own abatement, combined with the permits it buys in the market from Germany, adds up to the total required reductions (R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt;) for Sweden. Thus Sweden can make a saving from buying permits in the market (Δ d-e-f). This represents the "Gains from Trade", the amount of additional expense that Sweden would otherwise have to spend if it abated all of its required emissions by itself without trading.

Germany made a profit on its additional emissions abatement, above what was required: it met the regulations by abating all of the emissions that was required of it (R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt;). Additionally, Germany sold its surplus permits to Sweden, and was paid ''P'' for every unit it abated, while spending less than ''P''. Its total revenue is the area of the graph (R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; 1 2 R*), its total abatement cost is area (R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt; 3 2 R*), and so its net benefit from selling emission permits is the area (Δ 1-2-3) i.e. Gains from Trade

The two R* (on both graphs) represent the efficient allocations that arise from trading.
* Germany: sold (R* - R&lt;sub&gt;Req&lt;/sub&gt;) emission permits to Sweden at a unit price ''P''.
* Sweden bought emission permits from Germany at a unit price ''P''.

If the total cost for reducing a particular amount of emissions in the ''Command Control'' scenario is called ''X'', then to reduce the same amount of combined pollution in Sweden and Germany, the total abatement cost would be less in the ''Emissions Trading'' scenario i.e. (X&amp;nbsp;— Δ 123 - Δ def).

The example above applies not just at the national level, but also between two companies in different countries, or between two subsidiaries within the same company.

===Applying the economic theory===
The nature of the pollutant plays a very important role when policy-makers decide which framework should be used to control pollution. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts globally, thus its impact on the environment is generally similar wherever in the globe it is released. So the location of the originator of the emissions does not matter from an environmental standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Estimating Offset Supply in a Cap-and-Trade Program|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL34705.pdf|date=April 16, 2010|first=Jonathan L.|last=Ramseur|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|page=1|mode=cs2|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy framework should be different for regional pollutants&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4083331.stm Map: Pollution hotspots], BBC map of areas that suffer from intense local pollution, BBC News, 2004-12-13. Retrieved 2009-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]], and also [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) because the impact of these pollutants may differ by location. The same amount of a regional pollutant can exert a very high impact in some locations and a low impact in other locations, so it matters where the pollutant is released. This is known as the ''Hot Spot'' problem.

A [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Lagrange framework]] is commonly used to determine the least cost of achieving an objective, in this case the total reduction in emissions required in a year. In some cases, it is possible to use the Lagrange optimization framework to determine the required reductions for each country (based on their MAC) so that the total cost of reduction is minimized. In such a scenario, the [[Lagrange multiplier]] represents the market allowance price (P) of a pollutant, such as the current market  price of emission permits in Europe and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/ |title=Chicago Climate Exchange prices |publisher=Chicagoclimatex.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105001705/http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/ |archivedate=2009-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries face the permit market price that exists in the market that day, so they are able to make individual decisions that would minimize their costs while at the same time achieving regulatory compliance. This is also another version of the [[Ordinal utility|Equi-Marginal Principle]], commonly used in economics to choose the most economically efficient decision.

=== Prices versus quantities, and the safety valve ===
There has been longstanding debate on the relative merits of ''price'' versus ''quantity'' instruments to achieve emission reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2296698 |last=Weitzman |first=M. L. |title=Prices vs. Quantities |journal=Review of Economic Studies | volume =41 |issue= 4 |date=October 1974 |pages=477–491 |jstor=2296698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emission cap and permit trading system is a ''quantity'' instrument because it fixes the overall emission level (quantity) and allows the price to vary. Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions (market volatility) coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits, and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions. The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency, which is generally more efficient. However, under volatile market conditions, the ability of the controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick "winners and losers" and thus presents an opportunity for corruption.

In contrast, an [[Carbon tax|emission tax]] is a ''price'' instrument because it fixes the price while the emission level is allowed to vary according to economic activity. A major drawback of an emission tax is that the environmental outcome (e.g. a limit on the amount of emissions) is not guaranteed. On one hand, a tax will remove capital from the industry, suppressing possibly useful economic activity, but conversely, the polluter will not need to hedge as much against future uncertainty since the amount of tax will track with profits. The burden of a volatile market will be borne by the controlling (taxing) agency rather than the industry itself, which is generally less efficient. An advantage is that, given a uniform tax rate and a volatile market, the taxing entity will not be in a position to pick "winners and losers" and the opportunity for corruption will be less.

Assuming no corruption and assuming that the controlling agency and the industry are equally efficient at adapting to volatile market conditions, the best choice depends on the sensitivity of the costs of emission reduction, compared to the sensitivity of the benefits (i.e., climate damage avoided by a reduction) when the level of emission control is varied.

Because there is high uncertainty in the compliance costs of firms, some argue that the optimum choice is the price mechanism. However, the burden of uncertainty cannot be eliminated, and in this case it is shifted to the taxing agency itself.

The overwhelming majority of climate scientists have repeatedly warned of a threshold in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond which a run-away [[Global warming|warming]] effect could take place, with a large possibility of causing irreversible damage. With such a risk, a quantity instrument may be a better choice because the quantity of emissions may be capped with more certainty. However, this may not be true if this risk exists but cannot be attached to a known level of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration or a known emission pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A third option, known as a ''safety valve'', is a hybrid of the price and quantity instruments. The system is essentially an emission cap and permit trading system but the maximum (or minimum) permit price is capped. Emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price (which could be adjusted over time). The system is sometimes recommended as a way of overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light. It can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough, or the number of permits low enough, the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Jacoby |first=D.H. |last2=Ellerman |first2=A.D. |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/3561 | title =The safety valve and climate policy |journal=Energy Policy | volume =32 |issue=4 |pages=481–49 |publisher=|date=March 2004 |accessdate=2009-11-03 | doi = 10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00150-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three methods are being used as policy instruments to control greenhouse gas emissions: the EU-ETS is a ''quantity'' system using the cap and trading system to meet targets set by [[National Allocation Plan]]s; Denmark has a price system using a [[carbon tax]] (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;218),&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; while China uses the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; market price for funding of its [[Clean Development Mechanism]] projects, but imposes a ''safety valve'' of a minimum price per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Carbon leakage===

[[Carbon leakage]] is the effect that regulation of emissions in one country/sector has on the emissions in other countries/sectors that are not subject to the same regulation.&lt;ref name=barker&gt;{{cite book

In the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I countries are subject to caps on emissions, but non-Annex I countries are not. Barker ''et al.'' (2007) assessed the literature on leakage. The leakage rate is defined as the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action, divided by the reduction in emissions of countries taking domestic mitigation action. Accordingly, a leakage rate greater than 100% means that actions to reduce emissions within countries had the effect of increasing emissions in other countries to a greater extent, i.e., domestic mitigation action had actually led to an increase in global emissions.

Estimates of leakage rates for action under the Kyoto Protocol ranged from 5% to 20% as a result of a loss in price competitiveness, but these leakage rates were considered very uncertain.&lt;ref name=barker/&gt; For energy-intensive industries, the beneficial effects of Annex I actions through technological development were considered possibly substantial. However, this beneficial effect had not been reliably quantified. On the empirical evidence they assessed, Barker ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that the competitive losses of then-current mitigation actions, e.g., the EU ETS, were not significant.

Under the EU ETS rules [http://www.emissions-euets.com/carbon-leakage-exposure-factor-clef Carbon Leakage Exposure Factor] is used to determine the volumes of free allocation of emission permits to industrial installations.

===Trade===
To understand carbon trading, it is important to understand the products that are being traded. The primary product in carbon markets is the trading of GHG emission permits. Under a cap-and-trade system, permits are issued to various entities for the right to emit GHG emissions that meet emission reduction requirement caps.&lt;ref name=Roos /&gt;

One of the controversies about carbon mitigation policy is how to "level the playing field" with border adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Houser | first = Trevor | authorlink = |author2=Rob Bradley |author3=Britt Childs Staley |author4=Jake Werksman |author5=Robert Heilmayr  | title = Leveling The Carbon Playing Field: International Competition and U.S. Climate Policy Design | publisher = Peterson Institute for International Economics | year = 2008 | location = | pages = | url = http://www.wri.org/publication/leveling-the-carbon-playing-field | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one component of the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (a 2009 bill that did not pass), along with several other energy bills put before US Congress, calls for carbon surcharges on goods imported from countries without cap-and-trade programs. Besides issues of compliance with the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], such border adjustments presume that the producing countries bear responsibility for the carbon emissions.

A general perception among developing countries is that discussion of climate change in trade negotiations could lead to "green [[protectionism]]" by high-income countries (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;251).&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite web

World Bank (2010) commented that introducing border tariffs could lead to a proliferation of trade measures where the competitive playing field is viewed as being uneven. Tariffs could also be a burden on low-income countries that have contributed very little to the problem of climate change.

===Kyoto Protocol===
In 1990, the first [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) report highlighted the imminent threat of climate change and greenhouse gas emission, and diplomatic efforts began to find an international framework within which such emissions could be regulated. In 1997 the Kyoto Protocol was adopted.
The [[Kyoto Protocol]] is a 1997 international treaty that came into force in 2005. In the treaty, most developed nations agreed to legally binding targets for their emissions of the six major [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php
|title=Kyoto Protocol
|publisher=UNFCCC
|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission quotas (known as "Assigned amounts") were agreed by each participating 'Annex I' country, with the intention of reducing the overall emissions by 5.2% from their 1990 levels by the end of 2012. Between 1990 and 2012 the original Kyoto Protocol parties reduced their CO2 emissions by 12.5%, which is well beyond the 2012 target of 4.7%. The United States is the only industrialized nation under [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I]] that has not ratified the treaty, and is therefore not bound by it. The IPCC has projected that the financial effect of compliance through trading within the Kyoto commitment period will be limited at between 0.1-1.1% of [[GDP]] among trading countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The agreement was intended to result in industrialized countries' emissions declining in aggregate by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by the year of 2012. Despite the failure of the United States and Australia to ratify the protocol, the agreement became effective in 2005, once the requirement that 55 Annex I (predominantly industrialized) countries, jointly accounting for 55 percent of 1990 Annex I emissions, ratify the agreement was met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robert W.|first1=Hahn|title=The effect of Allowance Allocations on Cap-and-Trade System Performance|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date=November 2011|volume=54|issue=4|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rstavins/Papers/Hahn%20&amp;%20Stavins%20in%20Journal%20of%20Law%20&amp;%20Economics.pdf|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol defines several mechanisms ("[[flexible mechanisms]]") that are designed to allow Annex I countries to meet their emission reduction commitments (caps) with reduced economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I Parties may use GHG removals, from afforestation and reforestation (forest sinks) and deforestation (sources) since 1990, to meet their emission reduction commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/methods_and_science/lulucf/items/4129.php |title=LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate=2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annex I Parties may also use International Emissions Trading (IET). Under the treaty, for the 5-year compliance period from 2008 until 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for Annex I countries to sponsor [[carbon project]]s that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries. These projects generate tradable [[carbon credits]] that can be used by Annex I countries in meeting their caps. The project-based Kyoto Mechanisms are the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) and [[Joint Implementation]] (JI). There are four such international flexible mechanisms, or Kyoto Mechanism,&lt;ref&gt;Yamin, F, Burniaux, J-M ad Nentjes, A, "Kyoto Mechanisms: key issues for policymakers for CoP-6; international environmental agreements" (2001) 1 Politics, Law and Economics 187–218.&lt;/ref&gt; written in the Kyoto Protocol.

Article 17 if the Protocol authorizes Annex 1 countries that have agreed to the emissions limitations to take part in emissions trading with other Annex 1 Countries.

Article 4 authorizes such parties to implement their limitations jointly, as the member states of the EU have chosen to do.

Article 6 provides that such Annex 1 countries may take part in joint initiatives (JIs) in return for emissions reduction units (ERUs) to be used against their Assigned Amounts.

Art 12 provides for a mechanism known as the clean development mechanism (CDM),&lt;ref&gt;Haites, E and Yamin, F, "The clean development mechanism:proposals for its operation and governance" (2000) 10 Global Environmental Change 27–45.&lt;/ref&gt; under which Annex 1 countries may invest in emissions limitation projects in developing countries and use certified emissions reductions (CERs) generated against their own Assigned Amounts.&lt;ref name=boswall/&gt;

The CDM covers projects taking place in non-Annex I countries, while JI covers projects taking place in Annex I countries. CDM projects are supposed to contribute to [[sustainable development]] in developing countries, and also generate "real" and "additional" emission savings, i.e., savings that only occur thanks to the CDM project in question (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2003 the New South Wales (NSW) state government unilaterally established the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenhousegas.nsw.gov.au/ |title=The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme |publisher=Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme Administrator |location=NSW |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2010-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce emissions by requiring electricity generators and large consumers to purchase NSW Greenhouse Abatement Certificates (NGACs). This has prompted the rollout of free energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficiency measures, funded by the credits. This scheme has been criticised by the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM) of the [[UNSW]] because of its lack of effectiveness in reducing emissions, its lack of transparency and its lack of verification of the additionality of emission reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Both the incumbent [[John Howard|Howard]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government and the [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. Labor won the election, with the new government proceeding to implement an ETS. The government introduced the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]], which the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] supported with [[Malcolm Turnbull]] as leader. [[Tony Abbott]] questioned an ETS, saying the best way to reduce emissions is with a "simple tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-07/abbott-defends-carbon-tax-interview/2749496|title=Abbott defends carbon tax interview|work=ABC News|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the carbon vote, Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership challenge, and from there on the Liberals opposed the ETS. This left the government unable to secure passage of the bill and it was subsequently withdrawn.

[[Julia Gillard]] defeated Rudd in a leadership challenge and promised not to introduce a carbon tax, but would look to legislate a price on carbon &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983?nk=e21f67eabda601256acf18353808020c "Julia Gillard's carbon price promise"], ''The Australian'', 20 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; when taking the government to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]]. In the first [[hung parliament]] result in 70 years, the government required the support of crossbenchers including the [[Australian Greens|Greens]]. One requirement for Greens support was a carbon price, which Gillard proceeded with in forming a minority government. A fixed carbon price would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plan. The fixed price lent itself to characterisation as a carbon tax and when the government proposed the [[Clean Energy Bill 2011|Clean Energy Bill]] in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/24/3147523.htm |last=Leslie |first=Tim

The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] emission units. However, as of June 2015, the scheme will effectively transition into a domestic scheme, with restricted access to international Kyoto units (CERs, ERUs and RMUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A number of design flaws have limited the effectiveness of the scheme.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; In the initial 2005-07 period, emission caps were not tight enough to drive a significant reduction in emissions.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; The total allocation of allowances turned out to exceed actual emissions. This drove the carbon price down to zero in 2007. This oversupply was caused because the allocation of allowances by the EU was based on emissions data from the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen, which uses a horizontal activity-based emissions definition similar to the United Nations, the EU ETS Transaction log in Brussels, but a vertical installation-based emissions measurement system. This caused an oversupply of 200 million tonnes (10% of market) in the EU ETS in the first phase and collapsing prices.&lt;ref&gt;Kanen, J.L.M. "Carbon Trading &amp; Prcing". Fulton Publishing (December 2006), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase II saw some tightening, but the use of JI and CDM offsets was allowed, with the result that no reductions in the EU will be required to meet the Phase II cap.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; For Phase II, the cap is expected to result in an emissions reduction in 2010 of about 2.4% compared to expected emissions without the cap (business-as-usual emissions).&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; For Phase III (2013–20), the [[European Commission]] proposed a number of changes, including:
* Setting an overall EU cap, with allowances then allocated t
* Tighter limits on the use of offsets;
* Unlimited banking of allowances between Phases II and III;
* A move from allowances to auctioning.

Emitters must cut their emissions by 6% or 8% depending on the type of organization; from 2011, those who exceed their limits must buy matching allowances or invest in renewable-energy certificates or offset credits issued by smaller businesses or branch offices.&lt;ref name="tokyo1"&gt;{{cite news

====Sulfur dioxide====
{{main|Acid Rain Program}}
An early example of an emission trading system has been the [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) trading system under the framework of the [[Acid Rain Program]] of the 1990 [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act]] in the U.S. Under the program, which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were reduced by 50% from 1980 levels by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under the CSAPR, the national SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trading program was replaced by four separate trading groups for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from Acid Rain Program sources have fallen from 17.3 million tons in 1980 to about 7.6 million tons in 2008, a decrease in emissions of 56 percent.  A 2014 EPA analysis estimated that implementation of the Acid Rain Program avoided between 20,000 and 50,000 incidences of premature mortality annually due to reductions of ambient PM2.5 concentrations, and between 430 and 2,000 incidences annually due to reductions of ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}

====Nitrogen oxides====

In 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to administer the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) under the NOx State Implementation Plan (also known as the "NOx SIP Call"). The NOx Budget Trading Program was a market-based cap and trade program created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) from power plants and other large combustion sources in the eastern United States. NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is a prime ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone ([[smog]]), a pervasive air pollution problem in many areas of the eastern United States. The NBP was designed to reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the warm summer months, referred to as the ozone season, when ground-level ozone concentrations are highest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/nox-budget-trading-program "NOx Budget Trading Program"], Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 25 April 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, EPA again strengthened the 8-hour ozone standard to 0.075 parts per million (ppm) from its previous 0.08 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/ozone_fact_sheet.pdf "Ozone Fact Sheet"], Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 25 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone season NOx emissions decreased by 43 percent between 2003 and 2008, even while energy demand remained essentially flat during the same period. CAIR will result in $85 billion to $100 billion in health benefits and nearly $2 billion in visibility benefits per year by 2015 and will substantially reduce premature mortality in the eastern United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
NOx reductions due to the NOx Budget Trading Program have led to improvements in ozone and PM2.5, saving an estimated 580 to 1,800 lives in 2008.&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;

A 2017 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the NOx Budget Trading Program decreased NOx emissions and ambient ozone concentrations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Olivier|last=Deschênes|first2=Michael|last2=Greenstone|last3=Shapiro|first3= Joseph|date=2017|title=Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/atypon.php?return_path=/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20131002&amp;etoc=1|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=107|issue=10|pages=|doi=10.1257/aer.20131002|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program reduced expenditures on medicine by about 1.5% ($800 million annually) and reduced the mortality rate by up to 0.5% (2,200 fewer premature deaths, mainly among individuals 75 and older).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Volatile organic compounds====
[[File:Classification List of Organic Pollutants.png|thumb|276x276px|Classification of Organic Pollutants]]
In the United States the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) classifies [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds]] (VOCs) as gases emitted from certain solids and liquids that may have adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality|title=Volatile Organic Compounds' Impact on Indoor Air Quality {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These VOCs include a variety of chemicals that are emitted from a variety of different products.&lt;ref name="EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED"/&gt; These include products such as gasoline, perfumes, hair spray, fabric cleaners, PVC, and refrigerants; all of which can contain chemicals such as benzene, acetone, methylene chloride, freons, formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/voc.htm|title=Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Commonly Used Products|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOCs are also monitored by the [[United States Geological Survey]] for its presence in groundwater supply.&lt;ref name="Synthesis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/vocs/national_assessment/report/chapter1.html|title=Chapter 1 - Major Findings and Conclusions|last=Synthesis|first=NAWQA VOC National|website=water.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USGS concluded that many of the nations aquifers are at risk to low-level VOC contamination.&lt;ref name="Synthesis"/&gt; The common symptoms of short levels of exposure to VOCs include headaches, nausea, and eye irritation.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/voc/|title=Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Your Home - EH: Minnesota Department of Health|website=www.health.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed for an extended period of time the symptoms include cancer and damage to the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us"/&gt;

====Greenhouse gases====
{{See also|Climate change in the United States|}}

As of 2017, there is no national emissions trading scheme in the United States.  Failing to get Congressional approval for such a scheme, President Barack Obama instead acted through the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to attempt to adopt through rulemaking the [[Clean Power Plan]], which does not feature emissions trading.  (The plan was subsequently challenged and is under review by the administration of President Donald Trump.)

Concerned at the lack of federal action, several states on the east and west coasts have created sub-national cap-and-trade programs.

====State and regional programs====
In 2003, [[New York State]] proposed and attained commitments from nine [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] states to form a cap-and-trade [[carbon dioxide]] emissions program for power generators, called the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI). This program launched on January 1, 2009 with the aim to reduce the carbon "budget" of each state's electricity generation sector to 10% below their 2009 allowances by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rggi.org/docs/mou_12_20_05.pdf Memorandum of Understanding] - Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, U.S. corporations were able to trade CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission allowances on the [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] under a voluntary scheme. In August 2007, the Exchange announced a mechanism to create [[Carbon offset|emission offsets]] for projects within the United States that cleanly destroy [[ozone]]-depleting substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, the [[California Legislature]] passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act, [[AB-32]], which was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Thus far, flexible mechanisms in the form of project based offsets have been suggested for three main project types. The project types include: [[manure management]], forestry, and destruction of ozone-depleted substances. However, a ruling from Judge Ernest H. Goldsmith of San Francisco's Superior Court stated that the rules governing California's cap-and-trade system were adopted without a proper analysis of alternative methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|title=California Law to Curb Greenhouse Gases Faces a Legal Hurdle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/science/earth/05emit.html|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tentative ruling, issued on 24 January 2011, argued that the [[California Air Resources Board]] violated state environmental law by failing to consider such alternatives. If the decision is made final, the state would not be allowed to implement its proposed cap-and-trade system until the California Air Resources Board fully complies with the [[California Environmental Quality Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Wyatt|title=Calif. cap-trade plan dealt blow by S.F. judge|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-02-04/news/27100791_1_air-board-ab32-emissions-plan|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=4 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208141038/http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-02-04/news/27100791_1_air-board-ab32-emissions-plan|archivedate=8 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2017}} California's cap-and-trade program ranks only second to the ETS (European Trading System) carbon market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/calif-cap-trade-01-14.pdf California Cap and Trade], Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, under the auction, the reserve price, which is the price per ton of CO2 permit is $10.

In 2014, the [[Texas Legislature|Texas legislature]] approved a 10% reduction for the Highly Reactive Volatile Organic Compound (HRVOC) emission limit.&lt;ref name="tceq.texas.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/banking/hrvoc_ept_prog.html|title=Highly Reactive Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Cap and Trade Program|website=TCEQ|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a 5% reduction for each subsequent year until a total of 25% percent reduction was achieved in 2017.&lt;ref name="tceq.texas.gov"/&gt;

In February 2007, five U.S. states and four Canadian provinces joined together to create the [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI), a regional greenhouse gas emissions trading system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative].&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, a meeting took place to further outline the cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/28/local/la-me-climate-pact-20100728 "California, New Mexico and 3 Canadian provinces outline regional cap-and-trade program"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 28 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington withdrew from the WCI.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6695863 Six US states leave the Western Climate Initiative]" (18 November 2011).

In 1997, the State of [[Illinois]] adopted a trading program for [[volatile organic compound]]s in most of the Chicago area, called the Emissions Reduction Market System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.state.il.us/air/erms/|title=Emissions Reduction Market System What Is ERMS?|year=2007|publisher=Illinois EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2000, over 100 major sources of pollution in eight Illinois counties began trading pollution credits.

==== Failed federal effort ====

President Barack Obama in his proposed [[2010 United States federal budget]] wanted to support clean energy development with a 10-year investment of US$15 billion per year, generated from the sale of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions credits. Under the proposed cap-and-trade program, all GHG emissions credits would have been auctioned off, generating an estimated $78.7 billion in additional revenue in FY 2012, steadily increasing to $83 billion by FY 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/presidents-budget-draws-clean-energy-funds-from-climate-measure  | title = President's Budget Draws Clean Energy Funds from Climate Measure |publisher=Renewable Energy World |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal was never made law.

The [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (H.R. 2454), a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bill, was passed on 26 June 2009, in the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-212. The bill originated in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was introduced by Representatives Henry A. Waxman and Edward J. Markey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1633&amp;catid=155&amp;Itemid=55 |title=The American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454) |publisher=Energycommerce.house.gov |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political advocacy organizations [[FreedomWorks]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]], funded by [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|brothers David and Charles Koch]] of [[Koch Industries]], encouraged the [[Tea Party movement]] to focus on defeating the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dryzek |first1=John S. |authorlink1=John Dryzek |first2=Richard B. |last2=Norgaard |authorlink2=Richard Norgaard |first3=David |last3=Schlosberg |title=The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2011 |isbn=9780199683420 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/covert-operations |authorlink=Jane Mayer |first=Jane |last=Mayer |title=Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cap and trade also gained a significant foothold in the Senate via the efforts of Republican [[Lindsey Graham]], Independent and former Democrat [[Joe Lieberman]], and Democrat [[John Kerry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/11/101011fa_fact_lizza | title = As the World Burns: How the Senate and the White House missed their best chance to deal with climate change | journal=The New Yorker | date=11 October 2010 | first=Ryan | last=Lizza}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation died in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Turin, Dustin R. | title=The Challenges of Climate Change Policy: Explaining the Failure of Cap and Trade in the United States With a Multiple-Streams Framework | journal=Student Pulse | volume=4 | issue=6 | year=2012 |url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/656/3/the-challenges-of-climate-change-policy-explaining-the-failure-of-cap-and-trade-in-the-united-states-with-a-multiple-streams-framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
South Korea's national emissions trading scheme officially launched on 1 January 2015, covering 525 entities from 23 sectors. With a three-year cap of 1.8687 billion tCO2e, it now forms the second largest carbon market in the world following the EU ETS. This amounts to roughly two-thirds of the country's emissions. The Korean emissions trading scheme is part of the Republic of Korea's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to the business-as-usual scenario by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/images/StatusReport2015/ICAP_Report_2015_02_10_online_version.pdf|title= Emissions Trading Worldwide ICAP Status Report 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

==== Pollution Permit Trading ====
In an effort to reverse the adverse consequences of air pollution, in 2006, China started to consider a national pollution permit trading system in order to use market-based mechanisms to incentivize companies to cut pollution. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032801565.html|title=China Considers Tradable Pollution-Rights Permits|last=Bartson|first=Andrew|date=March 29, 2006|website=The Wall Street Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been based on a previous pilot project called the Industrial SO2 emission trading pilot scheme, which was launched in 2002. Four provinces, three municipalities and one business entity was involved in this pilot project (also known as the 4+3+1 project). They are Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Liuzhou and China Huaneng Group, a state-owned company in the power industry. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Can China’s Industrial SO2 Emissions Trading Pilot Scheme Reduce Pollution Abatement Costs?|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16cc/3e7697af62c650bc240e927f9cfe892836ae.pdf|journal=Sustainability|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pilot project did not turn into a bigger scale inter-provincial trading system, but it stimulated numerous local trading platforms. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

In 2014, when the Chinese government started considering a national level pollution permit trading system again, there were more than 20 local pollution permit trading platforms. The Yangtze River Delta region as a whole has also run test trading, but the scale was limited. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.under2coalition.org/what-we-do/news-and-blogs/china-considers-national-pollution-permit-trading|title=China considers national pollution permit trading|date=2014-01-14|work=Under2 Coalition|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Chinese government proposed establishing a carbon market, focused on CO2 reduction later in the decade, and it is a separate system from the pollution permit trading.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Carbon Market ====
China currently emits about 30% of global emission, and it became the largest emitter in the world. When the market launched, it will be the largest carbon market in the world. The initial design of the system targets a scope of 3.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions that come from 1700 installations. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/china-looks-towards-next-steps-for-implementing-national-carbon-market|title=China Looks Towards Next Steps For Implementing National Carbon Market|last=|first=|date=January 18, 2018|website=ICTSD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has made a voluntary pledge under the UNFCCC to lower CO2 per unit of GDP by 40 to 45% in 2020 when comparing to the 2005 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2014/09/01/china-could-launch-national-carbon-market-in-2016/|title=China could launch national carbon market in 2016|website=CLIMATE HOME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, China approved pilot tests of carbon trading in seven provinces and cities – Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin as well as Guangdong Province and Hubei Province, with different prices in each region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=790|title = China’s Energy Policymaking Processes and Their Consequences|last = Andrews-Speed|first = Philip|date = November 2014|journal = The National Bureau of Asian Research Energy Security Report|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot is intended to test the waters and provide valuable lessons for the design of a national system in the near future. Their successes or failures will, therefore, have far-reaching implications for carbon market development in China in terms of trust in a national carbon trading market. Some of the pilot regions can start trading as early as 2013/2014.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/11/us-carbon-schemes-idUSTRE76A2GJ20110711|title=Factbox: Carbon trading schemes around the world|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; National trading is expected to start in 2017, latest in 2020. 

The effort to start a national trading system has faced some problems that took longer than expected to solve, mainly in the complicated process of initial data collection to determine the base level of pollution emission. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cd549b9a-e088-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c|title=China moves towards launch of carbon trading scheme|last=Feng|first=Emily|date=December 19, 2017|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the initial design, there will be eight sectors that are first included in the trading system, chemicals, petrochemicals, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials, paper, power and aviation, but many of the companies involved lacked consistent data. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, by the end of 2017, the allocation of emission quotas have started but it has been limited to only the power sector and will gradually expand, although the operation of the market is yet to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/news/china-to-launch-world-s-largest-emissions-trading-system|title=China to Launch World’s Largest Emissions Trading System|last=|first=|date=December 19, 2017|website=UNFCCC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, Companies that are involved will be asked to meet target level of reduction and the level will contract gradually. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===India===
Trading is set to begin in 2014 after a three-year rollout period. It is a mandatory energy efficiency trading scheme covering eight sectors responsible for 54 per cent of India's industrial energy consumption. India has pledged a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2020. Under the scheme, annual efficiency targets will be allocated to firms. Tradable energy-saving permits will be issued depending on the amount of energy saved during a target year.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

====Renewable energy certificates====
{{Main article|Renewable Energy Certificates}}
[[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (occasionally referred to as or "green tags" [citation required]), are a largely unrelated form of market-based instruments that are used to achieve renewable energy targets, which may be environmentally motivated (like emissions reduction targets), but may also be motivated by other aims, such as energy security or industrial policy.

==Carbon market==
{{Main article|Carbon emission trading}}
Carbon emissions trading is emissions trading specifically for [[carbon dioxide]] (calculated in tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] or tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) and currently makes up the bulk of emissions trading. It is one of the ways countries can meet their obligations under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to reduce carbon emissions and thereby [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]].

===Market trend===

Trading can be done directly between buyers and sellers, through several organised exchanges or through the many intermediaries active in the carbon market. The price of allowances is determined by supply and demand. As many as 40 million allowances have been traded per day. In 2012, 7.9 billion allowances were traded with a total value of €56 billion.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; Carbon emissions trading declined in 2013, and is expected to decline in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtcc.org/2014/01/08/global-carbon-market-to-rise-15-in-value-in-2014-bloomberg-analysts/|title=Global carbon market to rise 15% in value in 2014|work=Climate Home|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]]'s Carbon Finance Unit, 374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) were exchanged through projects in 2005, a 240% increase relative to 2004 (110 mtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13409/37579.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market |year=2006 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was itself a 41% increase relative to 2003 (78 mtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13411/332360CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global carbon markets have shrunk in value by 60% since 2011, but are expected to rise again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2014/01/09/global-carbon-markets-have-shrunk-in-value-by-60-since-2011/|title=Global carbon markets have shrunk in value by 60% since 2011|work=REDD-Monitor|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of dollars, the World Bank has estimated that the size of the carbon market was US$11 billion in 2005, $30 billion in 2006,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and $64 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13405/44607.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market |year=2008 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marrakesh Accords of the Kyoto protocol defined the international trading mechanisms and registries needed to support trading between countries (''sources can buy or sell allowances on the open market. Because the total number of allowances is limited by the cap, emission reductions are assured.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allowance Trading Basic|url=http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/trading/basics.html|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=26 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowance trading now occurs between European countries and Asian countries. However, while the US as a nation did not ratify the protocol, many of its states are developing cap-and-trade systems and considering ways to link them together, nationally and internationally, to find the lowest costs and improve liquidity of the market.&lt;ref name="linkage"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stavins |first= Robert N.|first2= Judson |last2=Jaffe |year=2008 |title=Linkage of Tradable Permit Systems in International Climate Policy Architecture  |publisher=Harvard Project on International Climate Agreements |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18580/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these states also wish to preserve their individual integrity and unique features. For example, in contrast to other Kyoto-compliant systems, some states propose other types of greenhouse gas sources, different measurement methods, setting a maximum on the price of allowances, or restricting access to CDM projects. Creating instruments that are not [[fungibility|fungible]] (exchangeable) could introduce instability and make pricing difficult. Various proposals for linking these systems across markets are being investigated, and this is being coordinated by the [[International Carbon Action Partnership]] (ICAP).&lt;ref name="linkage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icapcarbonaction.com/ International Carbon Action Partnership].&lt;/ref&gt;

23 [[multinational corporation]]s came together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group included [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], [[BP]] and [[Unilever]]. On June 9, 2005 the Group published a statement stating the need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |title=Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable |publisher=World Economic Forum |date=9 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2007, this had grown to encompass 150 global businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/climateleaders/partners/ List of climate leaders] EPA December 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Business in the UK have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change, supported by NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39578.pdf |title=Meeting the Energy Challenge |date=May 2007 |chapter=UK Position on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme |publisher=UK Department of Trade and Industry |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39578.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all businesses favor a trading approach. On December 11, 2008, [[Rex Tillerson]], the CEO of [[Exxonmobil]], said a [[carbon tax]] is "a more direct, more transparent and more effective approach" than a cap-and-trade program, which he said, "inevitably introduces unnecessary cost and complexity". He also said that he hoped that the revenues from a carbon tax would be used to lower other taxes so as to be revenue neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=e8aecbbb-16c6-412d-8054-7e64e2b176ef |title=Exxon supports carbon tax |newspaper=Calgary Herald News |date=2009-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122051143/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=e8aecbbb-16c6-412d-8054-7e64e2b176ef |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Air Transport Association]], whose 230 member airlines comprise 93% of all international traffic, position is that trading should be based on "benchmarking", setting emissions levels based on industry averages, rather than "[[grandfathering]]", which would use individual companies’ previous emissions levels to set their future permit allowances. They argue grandfathering "would penalise airlines that took early action to modernise their fleets, while a benchmarking approach, if designed properly, would reward more efficient operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What You Need to Know About Emissions Trading |publisher= International Air Transport Association |accessdate=2009-09-26 |url= http://www.iata.org/NR/rdonlyres/95D34D98-7906-4A23-8884-1FA561709037/53257/EmissionsTrading.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303092647/http://www.iata.org/NR/rdonlyres/95D34D98-7906-4A23-8884-1FA561709037/53257/EmissionsTrading.pdf |archivedate = March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring, reporting, verification==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
Assuring compliance with an emissions trading scheme requires measuring, reporting and verification (MRV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MRV&amp;Enforcement|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/ets-topics/mvr-and-enforcement|publisher=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|accessdate=26 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements are needed at each operator or installation. These measurements are reported to a regulator. For greenhouse gases, all trading countries maintain an inventory of emissions at national and installation level; in addition, trading groups within North America maintain inventories at the state level through [[The Climate Registry]]. For trading between regions, these inventories must be consistent, with equivalent units and measurement techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tiwari|first=Gopal Nath|title=Building integrated photovoltaic thermal systems : for sustainable developments|year=2010|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=1-84973-090-3|author2=Agrawal, Basant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some industrial processes, emissions can be physically measured by inserting sensors and flowmeters in chimneys and stacks, but many types of activity rely on theoretical calculations instead of measurement. Depending on local legislation, measurements may require additional checks and verification by government or third party [[auditor]]s, prior or post submission to the local regulator.

==Enforcement==
In contrast to an ordinary market, in a pollution market the amount purchased is not necessarily the amount 'consumed' (= the amount of pollution emitted). A firm might buy a small amount of allowances but emit a much larger amount of pollution. This creates a troublesome [[moral hazard]] problem.

This problem may be solved by a centralized regulator. The regulator should perform Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of the actual pollution levels, and [[enforcement|enforce]] the allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iisd.ca/journal/ott.html |first=Hermann E. |last=Ott |title=Emissions Trading in the Kyoto Protocol, Finished and Unfinished Business |date=1998-10-26 |journal=Linkages Journal |volume=3 |series=4 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without effective MRV and enforcement, the value of allowances diminishes. Enforcement methods include [[fine (penalty)|fines]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] for polluters that have exceeded their allowances. Concerns include the cost of MRV and enforcement, and the risk that facilities may lie about actual emissions. The net effect of a corrupt reporting system or poorly managed or financed regulator may be a discount on emission costs, and a hidden increase in actual emissions.

According to Nordhaus, strict enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is likely to be observed in those countries and industries covered by the EU ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|author=Nordhaus, W.D.|title=To Tax of Not to Tax: Alternative Approaches to Slowing Global Warming|journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy|volume=1|issue=1|page=27|url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/reep/press_releases/freepdf/issue1.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ellerman and Buchner commented on the European Commission's (EC's) role in enforcing scarcity of permits within the EU ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|author1=Ellerman, A.D. |author2=B.K.

This was done by the EC's reviewing the total number of permits that member states proposed that their industries be allocated. Based on institutional and enforcement considerations, Kruger ''et al.'' suggested that emissions trading within developing countries might not be a realistic goal in the near-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|author=Kruger, J.|title=Decentralization in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and Lessons for Global Policy|journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy|volume=1|issue=1|pages=130–131|url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/reep/press_releases/freepdf/issue1.pdf

Burniaux ''et al.'' argued that due to the difficulty in enforcing international rules against sovereign states, development of the carbon market would require negotiation and consensus-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=6 June 2009|title=The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation: How to Build the Necessary Global Action in a Cost-Effective Manner|series=Economics Department Working Papers No. 701|author=Burniaux, J-M.|url=http://appli1.oecd.org/olis/2009doc.nsf/linkto/eco-wkp%282009%2942|publisher=OECD|accessdate=2010-04-24|display-authors=etal|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to centralized regulation is distributed regulation, in which the firms themselves are induced to inspect the other firms and report their misbehavior. It is possible to implement such systems in [[subgame perfect equilibrium]].

Emissions trading has been criticised for a variety of reasons.

For example, in the popular science magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'', Lohmann (2006) argued that trading pollution allowances should be avoided as a climate stabilization policy for several reasons. First, climate change requires more radical changes than previous pollution trading schemes such as the US SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; market. It requires reorganizing society and technology to "leave most remaining fossil fuels safely underground". Carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with 'windfall profits' when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production. Expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries, where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Research by Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg has shown that the flexibility, and thus complexity, inherent in cap and trade schemes has resulted in a great deal of [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12188/full policy uncertainty] surrounding these schemes. Such uncertainty has beset such schemes in Australia, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, New Zealand, and the US. As a result of this uncertainty, organizations have little incentive to innovate and comply, resulting in an ongoing battle of stakeholder contestation for the past two decades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Lohmann (2006b) supported conventional regulation, green taxes, and energy policies that are "justice-based" and "community-driven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Annie Leonard]]'s 2009 documentary ''The Story of Cap and Trade'' criticized carbon emissions trading for the free permits to major polluters giving them unjust advantages, cheating in connection with [[carbon offset]]s, and as a distraction from the search for other solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/capandtrade.php |title=The Story of Cap and Trade |author=Annie Leonard |year=2009 |publisher=The Story of Stuff Project |accessdate=2010-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103024644/http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/capandtrade.php |archivedate=2010-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offsets===
Forest campaigner Jutta Kill (2006) of European environmental group [[FERN]] argued that offsets for emission reductions were not substitute for actual cuts in emissions. Kill stated that "[carbon] in trees is temporary: Trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire, disease, climatic changes, natural decay and timber harvesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Permit supply level===
Regulatory agencies run the risk of issuing too many emission credits, which can result in a very low price on emission permits.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; This reduces the incentive that permit-liable firms have to cut back their emissions. On the other hand, issuing too few permits can result in an excessively high permit price.&lt;ref name=hepburn&gt;{{cite journal

This [[perverse incentive]] can be alleviated if permits are auctioned, i.e., sold to polluters, rather than giving them the permits for free.&lt;ref name="hepburn" /&gt; Auctioning is a method for distributing emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system whereby allowances are sold to the highest bidder.

On the other hand, allocating permits can be used as a measure to protect domestic firms who are internationally exposed to competition.&lt;ref name="hepburn" /&gt; This happens when domestic firms compete against other firms that are not subject to the same regulation. This argument in favor of allocation of permits has been used in the EU ETS, where industries that have been judged to be internationally exposed, e.g., cement and steel production, have been given permits for free).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Distributional effects===
The US [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO, 2009) examined the potential effects of the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] on US households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Bill was found to protect low-income consumers, but it was recommended that the Bill be made more efficient by reducing welfare provisions for corporations, and more resources be made available for consumer relief.

==Linking==
Distinct cap-and-trade systems can be linked together through the mutual or unilateral recognition of emissions allowances for compliance. Linking systems creates a larger carbon market, which can reduce overall compliance costs, increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icapcarbonaction.com/index.php?option=com_attach&amp;task=download&amp;id=241 "Linking Emissions Trading Systems: A Summary of Current Research"], ICAP 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burtraw, D., Palmer, K.

SSRN Electronic Journal. doi:10.2139/ssrn.2249955&lt;/ref&gt; Linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce GHG emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Flachsland, C., Marschinski, R., &amp; Edenhofer, O., 2009: To link or not to link: benefits and disadvantages of linking cap-and-trade systems.

In 2015, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba agreed to join the linked system between Quebec and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-ontario-manitoba-cap-and-trade-1.3354002 "Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba sign agreement to link cap-and-trade systems"], CBC News, 7 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2017, the [[Premier (Canada)|premiers]] of Quebec and Ontario, and the [[Governor of California]], signed the formal agreement establishing the linkage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California-Ontario-Québec Agreement on the Harmonization and Integration of their Cap-and-Trade Programs|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/linkage/2017_linkage_agreement_ca-qc-on.pdf|website=California Air Resources Board|publisher=[[Government of California]]|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Carbon Action Partnership]] brings together regional, national and sub-national governments and public authorities from around the world to discuss important issues in the design of emissions trading schemes (ETS) and the way forward to a global carbon market. 30 national and subnational jurisdictions have joined ICAP as members since its establishment in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Albania}}
The '''Environmentalist Agrarian Party''' ({{lang-sq|Partia Agrare Ambientaliste}}) is an [[Albania]]n [[political party]], founded in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paa-al.com/materialet/programi-eng.doc The Program of the Environmental Agrarian Party of Albania]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was founded by [[Lufter Xhuveli]]. Initially the party was known as the '''Agrarian Party of Albania''' (''Partia Agrare e Shqipërisë''), until a name change took place in 2003. It is a [[reformism|reformist]] party that supports a [[free market]] economic system.

In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1997|1997 elections]] the party won one of the single-member constituency seats, but none of the proportional seats. In total the party got 0.65%. In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2001|June 2001 elections]], it received 2.6% of the vote and three seats in [[Parliament of Albania|Parliament]], Lufter Xhuveli from Zone 125, Ndue Preka from Zone 126 and Refat Dervina from Zone 127.

In the [[Albanian local elections, 2003|2003 local elections]], the first contested under the new name PAA, the party contested in alliance with the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] (PSSH) in some areas. The PAA-PSSH combine won in three municipalities.

In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]] the party received 88,605 votes (6.5%) and 4 seats.

In 1998 Xhuveli became Minister of Agriculture. Under the Majko government he was made Minister for the Environment in February 2002. In 2003 he was replaced during the reforms of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.

On 2016 Xhuveli resigned and the current leader of the party is Agron Duka, a former member and MP of the [[Republican Party of Albania]].

Potential areas where this face-recognition technology could be used include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Automated searching of mug books using surveillance photos
* Controlling access to restricted facilities or equipment
* Checking the credentials of personnel for background and security clearances
* Monitoring airports, border crossings, and secure manufacturing facilities for particular individuals
* Finding and logging multiple appearances of individuals over time in surveillance videos
* Verifying identities at ATM machines
* Searching photo ID records for fraud detection

== History ==
The FERET program first began as a way to unify a large body of face-recognition technology research under a standard database. Before the program’s inception, most researchers created their own facial imagery database that was attuned to their own specific area of study. These personal databases were small and usually consisted of images from less than 50 individuals. The only notable exceptions were the following:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=P. Jonathon|last2=Rauss|first2=Patrick|last3=Der|first3=Sandor|date=October 1996|title=FERET (Face Recognition Technology) Recognition Algorithm Development and Test Results|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/15/feret3.pdf|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alex Pentland]]’s database of around 7500 facial images at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
* Joseph Wilder’s database of around 250 individuals at Rutgers University
* [[Christoph von der Malsburg]]’s database of around 100 facial images at the University of Southern California (USC)

The lack of a common database made it difficult to compare the results of face recognition studies in the scientific literature because each report involved different assumptions, scoring methods, and images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the papers that were published did not use images from a common database nor followed a standard testing protocol. As a result, researchers were unable to make informed comparisons between the performances of different face-recognition algorithms. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=P. Jonathon|last2=Moon|first2=Hyeonjoon|last3=Rauss|first3=Patrick|last4=Rizvi|first4=S.A.|date=June 1997|title=The FERET evaluation methodology for face-recognition algorithms|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/609311/|journal=Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=|isbn=0-8186-7822-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1993, the FERET program was spearheaded by Dr. Harry Wechsler and Dr. Jonathan Phillips under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Defense Counterdrug Technology Development Program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Phase I ===
The first facial images for the FERET database were collected from August 1993 to December 1994, a time period known as Phase I. The pictures were initially taken with a 35-mm camera at both GMU and ARL facilities, and the same physical setup was used in each photography session to keep the images consistent. For each individual, the pictures were taken in sets, including two frontal views, a right and left profile, a right and left quarter profile, a right and left half profile, and sometimes at five extra locations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, a set of images consisted of 5 to 11 images per person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the end of Phase I, the FERET database had collected 673 sets of images, resulting in over 5000 total images.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

At the end of Phase I, five organizations were given the opportunity to test their face-recognition algorithm on the newly-created FERET database in order to compare how they performed against each other. There five principal investigators were:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* MIT, led by Alex Pentland
* Rutgers University, led by Joseph Wilder
* The Analytic Science Company (TASC), led by Gale Gordon
* The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigne, led by Lewis Sadler and Thomas Huang
* USC, led by Christoph von der Malsburg

During this evaluation, three different automatic tests were given to the principal investigators without human intervention:

# The large gallery test, which served to baseline how algorithms performed against a database when it has not been properly tuned.
# The false-alarm test, which tested how well the algorithm monitored an airport for suspected terrorists.
# The rotation test, which measured how well the algorithm performed when the images of an individual in the gallery had different poses compared to those in the probe set.

For most of the test trials, the algorithms developed by USC and MIT managed to outperform the other three algorithms for the Phase I evaluation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Phase II ===
Phase II began after Phase I, and during this time, the FERET database acquired more sets of facial images. By the start of the Phase II evaluation in March 1995, the database contained 1109 sets of images for a total of 8525 images of 884 individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the second evaluation, the same algorithms from the Phase I evaluation were given a single test. However, the database now contained significantly more duplicate images (463, compared to the previous 60), making the test more challenging.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Phase III ===
Afterwards, the FERET program entered Phase III where another 456 sets of facial images were added to the database. The Phase III evaluation, which took place on September 1996, aimed to not only gauge the progress of the algorithms since the Phase I assessment but also identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and determine future objectives for research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By the end of 1996, the FERET database had accumulated a total of 14,126 facial images pertaining to 1199 different individuals as well as 365 duplicate sets of images.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As a result of the FERET program, researchers were able to establish a common baseline for comparing different face-recognition algorithms and create a large standard database of facial images that is open for research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2003, DARPA released a high-resolution, 24-bit color version of the images in the FERET database (existing reference).

}} The '''Movement for Defence of Voters' Rights "Golos"''', formerly '''GOLOS Association''' (Cyrillic: ГОЛОС, meaning "vote" or "voice")&lt;ref&gt;[http://golos.org/ The GOLOS Association's web site]{{ru icon}}, [http://golos.org/r69.html English articles].&lt;/ref&gt; is a Russian organisation established in 2000 to protect the electoral rights of citizens and to foster civil society. As of 2008, the organisation covers 40 Russian regions. It is the only [[Election monitoring|election watchdog]] active in [[Russia]] that is independent of the Russian government.&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8928805/Kremlin-accused-of-silencing-Russias-independent-election-watchdog.html ''Kremlin accused of silencing Russia's independent election watchdog''], Telegraph, retrieved 1/12/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
GOLOS was founded as an association of non-profit organizations in 2000 to support civil monitoring of elections.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.golosinfo.org/en/about-en|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=golosinfo.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since 2002 GOLOS has monitored elections and referendums of all levels. The [[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] describes GOLOS as being "one of the few organisations able to catalogue and publicise [the [[Kremlin]]'s] attempts at fraud and intimidation".&lt;ref name="Tel" /&gt;

The group publishes a newspaper called ''Grazhdansky Golos'' (Civil Voice).

=== 2008 presidential election ===
In the [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] and accompanying local elections, GOLOS representatives found many irregularities, including the following.&lt;ref&gt;[http://golos.org/a1335.html STATEMENT # 3 OF GOLOS ASSOCIATION ON THE RESULTS OF SHORT-TERM MONITORING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON MARCH 2, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705173605/http://www.golos.org/a1335.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}, The GOLOS Association, Moscow, March 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* incomplete combined protocols, as in 50% of polling stations in [[Ufa]], [[Kostroma]] and [[Kursk]];
* failure of electoral commissions to prevent voters from reusing their absentee ballots in [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Tomsk]], [[Kazan]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Ufa]];
* casting ballots by some voters on behalf of other people in [[Krasnodar]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Kostroma]];
* presence of government officials other than members of electoral commissions in [[Omsk]], [[Republic of Adygea|Adygea]], [[Barnaul]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Yoshkar-Ola]], [[Perm]], [[Pskov]].

=== 2011 legislative election ===
During the [[Russian legislative election, 2011|2011 Russian legislative election]], 2,000 monitors coordinated by GOLOS took part in election observation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/europe/russia-puts-pressure-on-elections-monitor-golos.html|title=Russia Puts Pressure on Election Monitor, Golos|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=2011-12-01|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOLOS set up an interactive map of violations to which users could submit reports, video evidence, audio recordings and photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kartanarusheniy.org/|title=Карта нарушений на выборах|last=|first=|date=|website=kartanarusheniy.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted over 4,500 reports alleging illegal campaign tactics, including stories of employers threatening workers with pay cuts and local officials ordering business leaders to pressure subordinates.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/europe/russian-court-fines-election-monitor-1000.html|title=Russian Election Monitor Golos Fined $1,000 by Judge|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=2011-12-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16032402|title='Hacking attacks' hit Russian political sites|date=2012-03-08|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the map, Russian prosecutors charged GOLOS with publishing election data during the five days before voting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also accused Golos of "dissemination of rumors under the guise of trustworthy reports, with the goal of defaming a party as well as its individual members.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Golos was subsequently fined for these alleged breaches.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the election, the website was subjected to [[Denial-of-service attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2011-12-09/vladimir-putins-cyber-warriors|title=Vladimir Putin's Cyber Warriors|last=Soldatov|first=Andrei|authorlink=Andrei Soldatov|date=2011-12-09|website=Foreign Affairs|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The state-owned channel [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] showed reports accusing GOLOS Association of disrupting the elections paid for by the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="lenta2ndDec"&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2011/12/02/guilty1/ Суд оштрафовал ассоциацию "Голос"] [[Lenta.ru]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 "foreign agent" registration and prosecution===
In early 2012, Russia introduced legislation which required NGOs receiving foreign donations to present themselves as "[[Russian foreign agent law|foreign agents]]" in outward communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_id=81252 |title=Russian Duma adopts NGO "foreign agents" bill |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |work=[[B92]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916085414/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_id=81252 |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/world/europe/for-nearly-5-hours-a-confident-putin-takes-questions.html ''For Nearly 5 Hours, a Showcase of Putin’s Fully Intact Confidence''] April 25, 2013 New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, GOLOS received the [[Andrei Sakharov Freedom Award]] of the [[Norwegian Helsinki Committee]]. While both Golos and the Helsinki Committee stated that Golos had not accepted the prize money, Russia's Justice Ministry in April 2013 used it as a reason to qualify Golos as the first "foreign agent" under the new legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nhc.no/no/nyheter/Legal+actions+against+Golos+violate+human+rights.b7C_wlfQ5e.ips|title=Legal actions against Golos violates human rights  -  Den norske Helsingforskomité|publisher=nhc.no|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After GOLOS refused to register as such, it was suspended in June 2013 for six months.&lt;ref name="bbc26june2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23070102|title=Russia NGO law: Election watchdog Golos suspended|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its suspension in 2013, GOLOS reorganized as civil movement "Golos" to continue its work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 7 July 2015, Russian police raided the offices and the homes of several Golos employees and confiscated equipment including computers. Police linked the raids to a tax investigation against the head of the group's branch in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].&lt;ref name="abc-raid-july2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-08/russia-raids-and-registers-local-election-monitor-foreign-agent/6602742|title=Russian police crack down on election monitors and watchdogs|date=8 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police raid was accompanied by a TV crew from state-controlled [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/russia-cracks-down-moscow-election-monitors-352039|title=Russia Cracks Down on Moscow Election Monitors|date=9 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the Justice Ministry asked Moscow's Basmanny District Court to ban GOLOS, citing a failure to present proper documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-justice-ministry-to-ban-election-monitor-golos/559275.html|title = Russian Justice Ministry to Ban Election Monitor Golos {{!}} News|website = The Moscow Times|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, a court ordered the liquidation of Golos within six months due to "serious irremediable breaches of law”. Golos is appealing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20160829/276741401.html|title=Ban on Golos NGO appealed in Moscow court|last=|first=|date=2016-08-29|website=RAPSI|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Golos is a member of the ''European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations'' (ENEMO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enemo.eu/member.htm|title=ENEMO {{!}} EUROPEAN NETWORK OF ELECTIONS MONITORING ORGANIZATIONS|last=|first=|date=|website=www.enemo.eu|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of the ''European Platform for Democratic Elections'' (epde) an association of election monitors in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epde.org/en/about-us.html|title=About us - European Platform for Democratic Elections|website=www.epde.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its suspension in 2013, Golos reorganized as a civil movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It consists of independent organizations such as Golos-Povolzhye (located in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]) and Golos-Ural (located in [[Chelyabinsk]]).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/07/29/russia-s-most-foreign-agent|title=Russia’s most foreign agent: How one human rights group became the country’s most harassed organization — Meduza|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an appeal by the Presidential Human Rights Council, regional organization of Golos received funds from Russia's presidential administration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In April 2013, the head of Golos Grigory Melkonyants announced that it suspended any foreign funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia: Golos Faces 'Foreign Agent' Case|trans-title=|periodical=Sky News|publisher=|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1075980/russia-golos-faces-foreign-agent-case|format=|accessdate=2016-04-12|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the presidential grants, projects of Golos in the past have received donations from the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/usaid-exit-to-hit-small-organizations-hard-17960|title=USAID Exit to Hit Small Organizations Hard|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[National Endowment for Democracy|NED]].&lt;ref&gt;Interregional Civic Foundation in Support of Civil Society Development "GOLOS" ($51,477) "''GOLOS will seek to motivate undecided or apathetic voters to participate in the elections and will monitor the electoral process.''" {{cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/publications/annual-reports/2011-annual-report/eurasia/russia |title=2011 Annual Report |accessdate=2016-09-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118073449/http://www.ned.org/publications/annual-reports/2011-annual-report/eurasia/russia |archivedate=January 18, 2013 |df= }}, ned.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from Memorial==
On November 30, 2011 the board of the  "[[Memorial (society)|Memorial International Society]]" supported GOLOS against attacks from pro-Kremlin media:&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}Правление Международного общества «Мемориал», [http://grani.ru/blogs/free/entries/193540.html В поддержку Ассоциации «Голос»], ''Grani.ru'', 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The article published by "Rossiyskaya Gazeta" about this respected organization is no different from the Soviet writings against [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]. (...) The main KGB-styled complaint is simple: the organization receives money from foreign organizations and thus leads subversion. The same claim against the non-governmental organizations was voiced in a very rude manner and in a speech at the congress of Putin's "United Russia". (...) We express our support and respect of the GOLOS Association and anyone who strives to make to reduce the number of possible fraud in the upcoming elections.}}

==Background==
Within the European Union, entry into the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Eurozone]] depends on the applicant nation meeting certain economic criteria.&lt;ref name="EurostatReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF|title=Report by Eurostat on the Revision of the Greek Government Deficit and Debt Figures|format=PDF|date=22 November 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205001847/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures such as [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]] and [[public debt]] levels are assessed, as well as the [[inflation]] situation and the stability of the national currency [[exchange rate]] of a [[European Union]] member state. Requirements include a budget deficit below 3% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and debt below 60% of GDP, or if above, declining.&lt;ref name="EurostatReport" /&gt;

Up until 1994, Greece recorded very high deficits, for some years above 10% of GDP.&lt;ref name="FTHarfordLookOut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GERRauch2011" /&gt; During the late nineties, according to the figures submitted by the Greek government to the European Union, Greece's high budget deficits were significantly lowered.&lt;ref name="FTHarfordLookOut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GERRauch2011" /&gt; In 2000, given a deficit below 3% of GDP in 1999, Greece was accepted as the 12th member of the European monetary union.

===Eurostat refusal to validate Greek figures===

In March 2002, [[Eurostat]] refused to validate data transmitted by the Greek government. In reaction, the NSSG ([[National Statistical Service of Greece]]) revised the debt level by several percentage points. In September 2002, Eurostat again refused to validate the data. The debt was revised upwards once again, and the government balance, which the Greek government had presented as a surplus, became a deficit.

In March 2004, Eurostat refused again to validate the Greek numbers. That was shortly before Greek elections, and a new government by [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] was inaugurated.

After the [[Greek legislative election, 2004|March 7 elections]], the new government said that it would start an objective [[financial audit]] of the government accounts. [[George Andreas Papandreou|George Papandreou]], of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), the main opposition at that time, and the other two smaller parties initially agreed with the need for an audit. The agreement lasted a very short time, and outside auditing firms and the central bank were not asked to carry out such an audit.

==New government audit==
Instead, the government produced new estimates while it investigated the years 1997 to 2003, and the resulting data was given to Eurostat, which then went on and published a report.&lt;ref name="EurostatReport" /&gt; The requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been below 3% of GDP was one of the key criteria for Eurozone entry. Its revision to 3.07%, according to Eurostat (AMECO), led to a controversy about Greece's admission.

In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wstn-8rGQZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2005 OECD report for Greece] (p.&amp;nbsp;47) it was clearly stated that "the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3% in 1999, the year of EMU membership qualification". The above has led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3% limit when it was calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece's application. Since the remaining criteria had also been met, was [http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2004/04-12-08.ana.html#09 properly] accepted into the Eurozone. ESA79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other Eurozone members at the time of their applications.

The original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with Eurostat recommendations, theoretically lowering even the ESA95-calculated 1999 Greek budget deficit to below 3% (an official Eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999).

An error frequently made in press reports is the confusion of the discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with US banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to hide their reported budget deficits. A [http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2011/07/goldman-bet-against-its-european.html currency swap] arranged with [[Goldman Sachs]] allowed Greece to 'hide' 2.8 billion euros of debt, but that affected deficit values after 2001 (when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone) and is not related to Greece's Eurozone entry.

===Implications===
Several arguments have been expressed about the implications of the audit. Some commentators talked about data falsification. Others held a completely different viewpoint. "Irregularities" (the word falsification never officially used) in deficit reporting were also revealed for other Eurozone members, most notably Italy and Portugal,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} with significant revisions imposed. Also, there were arguments about massive "[[creative accounting]]" employed by many states in order to meet the deficit criterion for entry into the Eurozone.

Even the practice of one-off measures by so many states has been criticised zince in several cases, their deficits rose back over 3% soon after the reference year, but big economies like Germany and France seem to defy the rules for years. Last but not least, changes in accounting method often seriously affected the deficit numbers (Spain and Portugal had, like Greece, marginally exceeded 3% in their reference year for entry,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} when their deficit was revised according to ESA95). It was argued that New Democracy government simply miscalculated the consequences of its actions, which brought a strong reaction by Eurostat, stronger than that for other violators.

== Public finance consequences ==

{{Main|Greek government debt crisis}}
As a result of the financial audit, Greece fell in the list of the loan creditability and paid more interest on its loans compared with other EU countries. EU Commission warned Greece about future problems if Greece, now with the new data, does not comply with the Eurozone requirements.

==Domestic political consequences==

New Democracy's government accused PASOK, and [[Costas Simitis]], the prime minister and president of PASOK at that time, of having falsified Greece's macroeconomic statistics, on the basis of which the European institutions accepted Greece to join the [[Eurozone]]. All the opposition parties accused New Democracy's government of making a false audit.

PASOK said that it never falsified any data, and that New Democracy's government just changed the way costs (mostly military expenses) were accounted for through the years and some other accounting techniques, and the way PASOK used to do it was known to the Eurostat, which never opposed it.

Costas Simitis wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that Greece's deficit revision damaged the EU: "The Commission must design an auditing system that is the same for all EU countries and guarantees objectivity and impartiality, while ruling out domestic political interference".&lt;ref name=FTSimitis2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simitis|first1=Costas|title=Greece's deficit revision damaged Europe|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e31661cc-53bd-11d9-b6e4-00000e2511c8.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3SBwQOqfj|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd.|date=22 Dec 2004|ref=FTSimitis2004|format=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later, the same newspaper published a [[Letter to the Editor]] by the Director General of Eurostat&lt;ref name=FTHanreichComment&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanreich|first1=Gunther|title=December 28, 2004 2:00 am Eurostat takes issue with former Greek PM on reasons for the revision of economic data|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/745b2b44-5874-11d9-9940-00000e2511c8.html#axzz3SBwQOqfj|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd.|date=28 Dec 2004|ref=FTHanreichComment|format=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged the need for monitoring and review of government accounts independent of political cycles, outlining the changes made but taking issue with the portrayal of the Greek account revisions.

In March 2006, Eurostat made changes to the system of defense expenditure calculation,&lt;ref name=ANAReport&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spinthourakis|first1=M.|title=Eurostat takes new decision on military expenditure|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2006/06-03-10.ana.html#16|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=Athens News Agency|agency=Athens News Agency|issue=Item 16|publisher=Hellenic Resource Network|date=10 Mar 2006|ref=ANAReport}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seemed to legitimize some of the practices of the previous [[Costas Simitis]] government of PASOK. This caused criticism of the Financial Audit of 2004 and the New Democracy government by PASOK and parts of the press. New Democracy responded that the defense expenditures covered by the 2006 changes constituted only a small part of much more substantial expenditures that were fraudulently concealed by the previous PASOK government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">{{About|the term used in law enforcement}}

'''Hot pursuit''' (also known as '''fresh''' or '''immediate pursuit''') refers to the urgent and direct pursuit of a criminal suspect by [[peace officer|law enforcement officers]], or by [[belligerent]]s under international [[rules of engagement]] for military forces. Such a situation grants the officers in command powers they otherwise would not have.

==English common law==
Hot pursuit has long formed a part of [[English law|English common law]]. The principle can be traced back to the doctrine of [[Distraint|distress]] [[damage feasant]], which allowed a property owner to detain animals trespassing on his land to ensure that he was compensated for the damage they had caused. In particular, a case in 1293 held that a property owner could also chase after trespassing animals leaving his land and catch them if he could. Later cases extended this idea to allow a property owner to distrain the goods of a tenant behind on his rent outside his property (in ''Kirkman v. Lelly'' in 1314) and peace officers to make arrests outside their jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="williams-1939" /&gt;{{rp|84–86}}

In 1939, [[Glanville Williams]] described hot pursuit as a [[legal fiction]] that treated an arrest as made at the moment when the chase began rather than when it ended, since a criminal should not be able to benefit from an attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="williams-1939"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/byrint20&amp;div=&amp;id=87&amp;page= | title=The juridical basis of hot pursuit | author=[[Glanville Williams|Glanville L. Williams]] | journal=British Year Book of International Law | year=1939 | volume=20 | pages=83–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}

Because of its pedigree in English law, the principle has been exported to many former colonies of the [[British Empire]], including the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

===United States law===
Under [[United States law]], hot pursuit is an [[Exigent circumstance in United States law|exigent circumstance]] that allows police to arrest a criminal suspect on private property [[Arrest without warrant|without a warrant]], which would generally be a violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition on unreasonable searches, seizures, and arrests. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] first articulated this principle in ''[[Warden v. Hayden]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Hot+Pursuit "Hot Pursuit"], ''West's Encyclopedia of American Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian law===
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held in [[R. v. Macooh]] in 1993 that the right of a police officer in hot pursuit to make an arrest on private property, which it described as "well settled at common law", extended to [[Summary offence#Canada|summary offences]] as well as indictable offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII | litigants=R. v. Macooh | link=R. v. Macooh | year=1993 | court=scc | num=107 | format= canlii | date=26 February 1993 | courtname=auto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
The [[international law]] principle of hot pursuit is analogous to the common law principle, but was probably conceived independently.&lt;ref name="williams-1939" /&gt;{{rp|92}} It began to coalesce into a general [[customary international law|custom of international relations]] during the early years of the 20th century, although the general principle had been advanced before in national legislation such as the British [[Hovering Acts]].  The participating states at the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930|League of Nations Codification Conference]] of 1930 broadly agreed on the validity of the right of hot pursuit, but the proposed convention on territorial waters in which it was included was never ratified. It was finally codified as Article 23 of the [[Geneva Convention on the High Seas]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="poulantzas-2002"&gt;{{Citation | author = Nicholas M. Poulantzas | title = The Right of Hot Pursuit in International Law | publisher = Brill–Martinus Nijhoff | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

The Geneva Convention on the High Seas was eventually folded into the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. Article 111 of the latter treaty grants a coastal state the right to pursue and arrest ships escaping to [[international waters]], as long as:&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{Citation
 | author = Craig H. Allen
 | title = Doctrine of hot pursuit: A functional interpretation adaptable to emerging maritime law enforcement technologies and practices
 | journal = Ocean Development and International Law
 | volume = 20
 | issue = 4
 | pages = 309–341
 | date = 1989
 
 | url = http://www.law.washington.edu/Directory/docs/Allen/Publications/Article_1989_DoctrineOfHotPursuitpp309-341.PDF
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The pursuers are [[competent authority|competent authorities]] of the state;
# They have good reason to believe that the pursued ship has violated the state's laws or regulations;
# The pursuit begins while the pursuing ship is in the State's [[internal waters]] or [[territorial waters]]; and
# The pursuit is continuous.

If the foreign ship is within a [[contiguous zone]], the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental Shelf, the Safety Zones in the EEZ or the Continental Shelf, then the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rules and regulations (customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal state) as applicable in the respective regimes (areas, zones).

The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of a foreign state.

Where a coastal state, stopping or arresting a foreign ship outside the territorial sea on the basis of its right of hot pursuit, fails to justify the exercise, it shall be liable to compensate the ship for any loss or damage caused to it due to the exercise of this right.

This right is particularly relevant to [[fisheries management]], [[maritime pollution]] laws, and the seaborne [[illegal drug trade]].&lt;ref name="allen" /&gt;

In addition, some have proposed translating the maritime right of hot pursuit into a comparable right to pursue criminals over land borders. Although it does not form a settled tenet of international law, the principle has been invoked by the United States regarding [[Taliban]] militants crossing into [[Pakistan]], by [[Turkey]] regarding its attacks on [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] bases in northern [[Iraq]], and by Colombia regarding its raid on a [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] camp in [[Ecuador]], which led to the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Other laws==
For borders between the countries of the [[Schengen Area]], hot pursuit over the borders is allowed. This is described by the [[Schengen Agreement]], although exact details on distance from the border etc. are described by bilateral agreements.

The '''Independent Democratic Serb Party''' ({{lang-hr|Samostalna demokratska srpska stranka}} or '''SDSS''', {{lang-sr-cyr|Самостална демократска српска странка, СДСС}}) is a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] political party of [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]].

==History==
It was formed in 1997 led by [[Vojislav Stanimirović (politician)|Vojislav Stanimirović]]. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003]], it beat its main rival, the [[Serb People's Party (Croatia)|Serb People's Party]] (SNS), taking all three seats reserved for Serb representatives in the Croatian parliament.

After the elections, the Independent Democratic Serb Party made an agreement with the winning [[Croatian Democratic Union]] led by [[Ivo Sanader]] in which they agreed on fulfilling several SDSS demands such as refugee return, strengthening of national equality, judicial reform and cooperation with neighbouring countries. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007]], they retained their three seats in the Parliament. In the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II]], their member [[Slobodan Uzelac]] received the position of vice-president of government. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]], they again won their three seats in the Parliament on the Serbian minority electoral list.

'''India Water Portal''' is an open, inclusive website that shares knowledge and resources on water in India. It aims to draw on the rich experience of water experts, packaging their knowledge and then disseminating it to a larger audience through the Internet. India Water Portal's vision is to make water a more visible issue in India by sharing knowledge freely and openly, in order to influence understanding on water issues and to empower action.

The Portal has grown to cover a wide range of themes and issues related to water, such as sanitation, agriculture, the environment and climate change, to name a few. India Water Portal is a Digital Commons initiative of [[Arghyam]], a grant making foundation set up by [[Rohini Nilekani]] to promote safe and sustainable water for all. Endorsed by the [[National Knowledge Commission]], India Water Portal was finally launched in February 2007 by the then [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] of India, Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]].

==Features==

India Water Portal focuses on the issues surrounding water in India, and strives to share practical solutions to these problems. The topics broadly covered in the portal include [[rainwater harvesting]], [[agriculture]], [[drinking water]], urban water management, [[sanitation]], [[wastewater]] management and [[water quality]].

For researchers working in the development sector, India Water Portal offers a wealth of information and data on water. The Portal has an analysis of 100 years worth of meteorological data in India. Users can download the data analyses based on the following parameters:
*[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]]
*Minimum [[temperature]]
*Average  [[temperature]]
*Maximum  [[temperature]]
*[[Cloud cover]]
*[[Vapour pressure]]
*Wet day frequency
*Diurnal temperature range
*Ground frost frequency

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24148">'''Infrastructure-based economic development''', also called '''infrastructure-driven development''', combines key policy characteristics inherited from the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]ian progressivist tradition and [[Neo-Keynesian economics]] in the [[United States]], France's [[Gaullist]] and Neo-[[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]ist centralized economic planning, [[Scandinavianism|Scandinavian]] [[social democracy]] as well as [[Singapore]]an and [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[state capitalism]] : it holds that a substantial proportion of a nation’s resources must be systematically directed towards [[long term]] assets such as  [[transportation]], [[energy]] and [[social infrastructure]] (schools, universities, hospitals…) in the name of [[long term]] economic [[efficiency]] (stimulating growth in economically lagging regions and fostering technological innovation) and [[social equity]] (providing free education and affordable healthcare).&lt;ref name="M.

The benefits of infrastructure investment are shown both for old-style economies (ports, highways, railroads) as well as for the new age (airports, telecommunications, internet...).

==Aschauer's model and other academic approaches==

According to a study by D.A. Aschauer,&lt;ref name="Aschauer"&gt;Aschauer, David Alan (1990). “Why is infrastructure important?” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Economic Review, January/February, pp. 21-48.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between investment in [[infrastructure]] and economic performance. Furthermore, the infrastructure investment not only increases the quality of life, but, based on the time series evidence for the post-World War II period in the United States, infrastructure also has positive impact on both labor and [[multifactor productivity]].  The multifactor productivity can be defined as the variable in the output function not directly caused by the inputs, private and public capital. Thus, the impact of infrastructure investment on multifactor productivity is important because the higher multifactor productivity implies higher economic output and hence higher growth.

In addition to Aschauer’s work, Munnell’s paper&lt;ref name="Munnell"&gt;Munnell, Alicia (1990). "Why has Productivity Growth Declined? Productivity and Public Investment.", Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Economic Review, January/February, pp. 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; supports the point that infrastructure investment improves productivity. Munell demonstrates that the decrease in multifactor productivity growth during the 1970s and 1980s relative to the 1950s and 1960s is due to the decrease of public capital stock rather than the decline in [[technological progress]]. By showing that public capital plays an important role in private sector production, Munnell helps Aschauer establish that infrastructure investment was a key factor to “the robust performance of the economy in the ‘golden age’ of the 1950s and 1960s.”&lt;ref name=" Aschauer" /&gt;

To prove his point, Aschauer builds a model, using the data for the time period from 1953 to 1988, to simulate the effect of higher public investment on the aggregate economy. His simulation shows that, on net, the increased investment in core infrastructure might have greatly improved the performance of the economy.

Aschauer uses the [[production function]] &lt;math&gt;Y= F(K,G,N,Z)=ZK^{\alpha}G^{\beta}N^{1-\alpha-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, where:
* ''Y'' = level of output
* ''K'' = private fixed capital
* ''G'' = level of government productive services 
* ''N'' = population or labor force
* ''Z'' = index of technological progress
* α and β are constants determined by available technology.

He estimates the production function relation using the average data from 1965 to 1983 for the 50 states. This enables Aschauer to conclude that the level of per capita output is positively and significantly related to core infrastructure investments, in other words an increase in the core infrastructure investments leads to an increase in the level of per capita output.&lt;ref name=" Aschauer" /&gt;

However, infrastructure has positive impact not just on the national level. By implementing the [[cross-sectional study]] of communities in one state, Janet Rives and Michael Heaney confirm “the links identified in national level studies between infrastructure and economic development”&lt;ref name="rives"&gt;Rives and Heaney (1995). "Infrastructure and Local Economic Development" Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 58-73.&lt;/ref&gt; are also present locally. Because infrastructure enters the production function and increases the value of urban land by attracting more firms and house construction, the core infrastructure also has a positive effect on economic development locally.

According to an overview of multiple studies by Louis Cain,&lt;ref name="Cain"&gt;Cain, Louis (1997). “Historical perspective on infrastructure and US economic development” Regional Science and Urban Economics, vol. 27, pp. 117-138.&lt;/ref&gt; the infrastructure investments have also been profitable. For example, Fogel estimated the private rate of return on the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at 11.6%, whereas the social rate that accounts for social benefits, such as improved firm efficiencies and government subsidies, was estimated at 29.9%.&lt;ref name="Cain" /&gt;  In another study, Heckelman and Wallis estimated that the first 500 miles of railroad in a given state led to major increases in property values between 1850 and 1910.&lt;ref name="Cain" /&gt; They calculated the revenue gain from the land appreciation to be $33,000-$200,000 per mile, while construction costs were $20,000-$40,000 per mile. Hence, on average the revenue from construction of a new railroad outweighed the costs. While initial construction returns were high, the profitability diminished after the first 500 miles.

Even though the revenue streams on infrastructure construction investment fall due to diminishing returns, [[Edward Gramlich]] indicates that the rate of return on new construction projects was estimated at 15%. Furthermore, the rate of return on maintenance of current highways was estimated at 35%. It means that even without further new construction, the investment in the maintenance of the core infrastructure is very profitable.&lt;ref name="Cain" /&gt;

Roller and Waverman,&lt;ref name="Roller"&gt;Röller and Waverman (2001). “Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Simultaneous Approach” The American Economic Review, vol. 91, no. 4, pp. 909-923.&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing data for 21 [[OECD]] countries, including US, over a 20-year period, from 1970 to 1990, examined the relationship between telecommunications infrastructure investments and economic performance. They used a supply-demand micro-model for telecommunications investments jointly with the macro production equation, accounting for country-specific fixed effects as well as [[simultaneity]]. They conclude that there is a causal relationship between telecommunications infrastructure investment and aggregate output.

[[Shane Greenstein]] and Pablo T. Spiller examined the effects of telecommunication infrastructure on economic performance in the United States. They conclude that infrastructure investment accounts for a significant fraction of the growth in [[Economic surplus#Consumer surplus|consumer surplus]] and business revenue in telecommunications services, both of which indicate the growth in economic performance.&lt;ref name="Roller" /&gt;

==The 'China way'==

===An alternative development path?===
Some European and Asian economists suggest that “[[infrastructure]]-savvy economies” &lt;ref name="M. Nicolas Firzli &amp; Vincent Bazi"/&gt;  such as [[Norway]], [[Singapore]] and [[China]] have partially rejected the underlying Neoclassical “financial orthodoxy” that used to characterize the ‘Washington Consensus’ and initiated instead a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] development path of their own&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{Citation|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/op-ed/2799/forecasting-the-future-the-brics-and-the-china-model.html |accessdate=2011-03-09 |title=see M.

Research conducted by the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] suggests that while [[China]] invested roughly 9% of its GDP in infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most Western and non-Asian emerging economies invested only 2% to 4% of their GDP in infrastructure assets. This considerable investment gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many [[South American]], South Asian and [[Africa]]n economies suffered from various development bottlenecks: poor transportation networks, aging power grids, mediocre schools....&lt;ref name="M. Nicolas Firzli &amp; Vincent Bazi"/&gt;

===Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and 'One Belt, One Road'===
The Beijing-based [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] (AIIB) established in July 2015 and corollary [[One Belt, One Road]] Chinese-led initiative demonstrate the PRC government’s capacity to garner the financial and political resources needed to "export" their economic development model, notably by persuading neighboring Asian nations to join AIIB as founding members : “''as Asia (excluding China) will need up to $900bn in infrastructure investments annually in the next 10 years (which means there’s a 50% shortfall in infra spending in the continent), many'' [Asian] ''heads of state'' […] ''gladly expressed their interest to join this new international financial institution focusing solely on ‘real assets’ and infrastructure-driven economic growth.''”&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= China’s Asian Infrastructure Bank and the ‘New Great Game’|url= https://www.academia.edu/19535167/China_s_AIIB_America_s_Pivot_to_Asia_and_the_Geopolitics_of_Infrastructure_Investments |accessdate=5 February 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments in North America and the EU==

In the West, the notion of [[pension fund investment in infrastructure]] has emerged primarily in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] in the 1990s notably in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] and has attracted the interest of policy makers in sophisticated jurisdictions such as [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]] and the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=WPC Conference Committee |title= Infrastructure As A New Asset Class for Pensions and SWFs|url= https://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/49720977.pdf| work= [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|2nd Annual World Pensions Forum]], Roundtable led by Arbejdsmarkedets TillægsPension (ATP), Denmark’s National Supplementary Pension |date= 9 February 2012  |accessdate= 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Great Recession]] that started after 2007, liberal and Neo-Keynesian economists in the [[United States]] have developed renewed arguments in favor of “[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]ian” economic policies removed from the ‘Neoclassical’ orthodoxy of the past 30 years- notably a degree of federal stimulus spending across [[public infrastructure]]s and social services that would “benefit the nation as a whole and put America back on the path to long term growth”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.worldpensions.org/special-report-on-the-us-economy.html |accessdate=26 Jan 2013 |author=Felicia Wong |date=January 2013 | title= Fighting the ‘Great Recession’: Why America Needs Rooseveltian Resolve|pages=18–19 |work=Revue Analyse Financière, RAF/WPC Special Report on US Economy |issue= N° 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar ideas have gained traction amongst [[IMF]], [[World Bank]] and [[European Commission]] policy makers in recent years notably in the last months of 2014/early 2015: Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (October 2014) and adoption of the €315 bn [[European Commission Investment Plan for Europe]] (December 2014).

==Kazakhstan's infrastructure development program==
The Nurly Zhol plan or 'New Economic Policy', announced on 11 November 2014 during Kazakhstan President’s State of the Nation Address, introduced a number of measures aimed at developing country's infrastructure in order to sustain economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Nurly Zhol" Program {{!}} Baiterek National Holding|url = http://www.baiterek.gov.kz/en/programs/nurly-zhol/|website = www.baiterek.gov.kz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nurly Zhol program applies to such sectors of infrastructure as transport and logistic, tourism, housing and communal services, education, support of export, agriculture, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Trump is depending on private investors to drive his infrastructure plan.&lt;ref name="theguardian_2017_infrastructure_Trump"/&gt; On June 20, 2017, at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in Washington, Treasury Secretary [[Steven Mnuchin]] said that financial help from foreign investors will probably be necessary in order for President Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan to "upgrade U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other public works", to succeed.&lt;ref name="thehill_Munchin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/338649-white-house-says-foreign-investment-key-to-infrastructure-plan |title=White House says foreign investment key to infrastructure plan |first=Melanie |last=Zanona |date=June 20, 2017 |access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's successful presidential bid]] was to a large extent based on an ‘unorthodox’ economic plank bringing together [[supply-side economics|supply-side]] policies and infrastructure-based development planning: “the deliberate neglect of America’s creaking infrastructure assets (notably public transportation and water sanitation) from the early 1980s on eventually fueled a widespread popular discontent that came back to haunt both Hillary Clinton and the Republican establishment. Donald Trump was quick to seize on the issue to make a broader slap against the laissez-faire complacency of the federal government: ‘when I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries for that matter, I know these problems can all be fixed’ (June 22, 2016 New York Speech: ‘We Will Build the Greatest Infrastructure on the Planet Earth’).”&lt;ref&gt;M.

This unconventional (by American standards) policy mix favoring renewed federal government involvement in infrastructure investment and co-investment across the board (at national, state, municipal and local level) is known as [[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]].

===Reliance on “infrastructure as an asset class” for private investors===

===Criticism===
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Trump's dependence on private investments for infrastructure funding, is "speculative infrastructure", a form of "speculative finance", similar to that which "led to the financial crisis". "What is needed is a vision for the economy that lines up financial market reform with innovation policy, and infrastructure plans."&lt;ref name="theguardian_2017_infrastructure_Trump"/&gt; At the same time that Trump is privatizing infrastructure, he has plans to cut for deep cuts to the budgets of "Darpa, a public agency inside the Department of Defense", the "engine behind the internet", and Arpa-E, a "source of innovation inside the Department of Energy". These agencies could "help steer progress in clean energy" but they may not survive the deep budgetary cuts.&lt;ref name="theguardian_2017_infrastructure_Trump"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16820">{{short description|An economic policy proposal for full employment}}
A '''job guarantee''' ('''JG''') is an economic policy proposal aimed at providing a sustainable solution to the dual problems of [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]]. Its aim is to create [[full employment]] and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an [[employer of last resort]] (ELR).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wray |first=L. Randall |authorlink=L. Randall Wray |date=23 August 2009 |title=Job Guarantee |website=New Economic Perspectives |url=http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2009/08/job-guarantee.html |access-date=31 July 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic policy stance currently dominant around the world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control [[inflation]]; when cost pressures rise, the standard [[monetary policy]] carried out by the monetary authority ([[central bank]]) tightens [[interest rate]]s, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] terms, the unemployed serve as a [[reserve army of labor]]. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of ''employed'' people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation ''without'' the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of [[full employment]] and [[price stability]].&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

== Conception ==
The job guarantee proposal is particularly associated with certain [[post-Keynesian economists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

JG draws from a [[social justice]] tradition of [[right to work]], such as the  [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the US [[Employment Act of 1946]], and an early form was proposed by [[Hyman Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Minsky|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wray|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JG proposal was conceived independently by [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]] (1998)&lt;ref&gt;W.F.

== Overview ==
The JG is based on a [[Buffer stock scheme|buffer stock]] principle whereby the [[public sector]] offers a fixed wage job to anyone willing and able to work thereby establishing and maintaining a buffer stock of employed workers. This buffer stock expands when private sector activity declines, and declines when private sector activity expands, much like today's unemployed buffer stocks.

The JG thus fulfills an absorption function to minimize the real costs associated with the flux of the private sector. When private sector [[employment]] declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So in a recession, the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate [[aggregate demand]] and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an [[automatic stabilizer]] controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national [[minimum wage]].

Under the JG, people of working age who are not in full-time education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and [[underemployment]] with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer the indignity and insecurity of underemployment, [[poverty]], and [[social exclusion]].

== Income support ==
A range of [[income support]] arrangements, including a generic work-tested benefit payment, would also be available to unemployed people, depending on their circumstances, as an initial subsistence income while arrangements are made to employ them. This would rarely be necessary once the system was well established, because in most circumstances JG jobs would be immediately available and offered instead of income support.

== Inflation control ==
The fixed JG wage provides an in-built inflation control mechanism. [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Mitchell]] (1998) called the ratio of JG employment to total employment the ''buffer employment ratio'' (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current ''non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment'' ([[NAIRU]]), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the ''non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio'' (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent on a range of factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.

=== No relative wage effects ===
The JG introduces no relative wage effects and the rising demand ''per se'' does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire of the private sector (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today’s demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase [[capacity utilisation]] to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the [[NAIRU]] (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any [[demand-pull inflation]] it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand will stimulate private sector employment growth while reducing JG employment and spending.  However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.

=== Wage bargaining ===
While the JG policy frees wage bargaining from the general threat of unemployment, several factors offset this:
* In professional occupational markets, while any wait unemployment will discipline wage demands, demand pressures may eventually exhaust this stock and wage-price pressures may develop. With a strong and responsive tertiary education sector, skill bottlenecks can be avoided more readily than with an unemployed buffer stock;
* Private firms would still be required to train new workers in job-specific skills in the same way they would in a non-JG economy. However, JG workers are far more likely to have retained higher levels of skill than those who are forced to succumb to lengthy spells of unemployment. This changes the bargaining environment rather significantly because firms now have reduced hiring costs. Previously, the same firms would have lowered their hiring standards and provided on-the-job training and vestibule training in tight labour markets. The JG policy thus reduces the "hysteretic inertia" embodied in the long-term unemployed and allows for a smoother private sector expansion;
* With high long-term unemployment, the excess supply of labour poses a very weak threat to wage bargaining, compared to a JG environment (Mitchell, 1998).

== Comparison with other policies ==

=== Keynesianism ===
A crucial point is that the JG does not rely on the government spending at market prices and then exploiting multipliers to achieve full employment which characterizes traditional [[Keynesian]] aggregate demand management. The JG program differs in that it "would be targeted directly to households. It is a genuine bottom-up approach to economic recovery. It is a program that stabilizes the incomes and purchasing power of individuals at the bottom of the income distribution that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity. Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations. A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flows and earnings. Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavlina R. Tcherneva|Tcherneva, Pavlina R.]] [http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_649.pdf]"Fiscal Policy Effectiveness: Lessons from the Great Recession", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}

=== Full employability ===
The JG seeks to reorient labour market policy away from the current [[OECD]] emphasis on [[full employability]] whereby governments engage in programs to prepare the unemployed for work without guaranteeing that work will be available towards a focus on creating enough work.  The full employability agenda has come under fire from a number of sources in recent years (see, for example ILO, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) (2004) "Macroeconomic policy for growth and employment" Committee on Employment and Social Policy, Governing Body, 291st Session. Geneva: International Labour Office&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workfare ===
{{Main|Workfare}}
Workfare is a scheme where participation in activities is a requirement for obtaining social benefits. Workfare schemes may not cover all of the unemployed, and may not offer the same income as a full-time minimum wage job.

== Implementation ==
There are now several countries which have implemented direct job creation schemes to counter the major problems associated with persistent unemployment. For example, the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government introduced the ''Jefes de Hogar'' (Heads of Households) program in 2001 to combat the social malaise that followed the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|financial crisis in that year]].

Similarly, the [[India]]n Government introduced in 2005 a five-year plan called the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] (NREGA) to bridge the vast rural-urban income disparities that have emerged as India’s information technology and service sector has boomed. The program has successfully empowered women and raised rural wages, but has also attracted the ire of landowners who have to pay farm laborers more due to a higher prevailing wage. The projects tend to be highly labor-intensive and low skill, like dam and road construction, and soil conservation, with modest but positive long-term benefits and mediocre management.

The [[South Africa]]n government has introduced the [[Expanded Public Works Program]] (EPWP) to overcome the extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country. EPWP projects employ workers on a temporary or ongoing basis with government, contractors, or other non-governmental organisations under the Ministerial Conditions of Employment for the EPWP or learnership employment conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.za/about-government/government-programmes/expanded-public-works-programme&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programs enacted but not implemented ===
In the [[United States]], the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act]] of 1978 allows the government to create a "reservoir of public employment" in case private enterprise does not provide sufficient jobs. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector. However, the act did not establish such a reservoir (it only ''authorized'' it), and no such program has been implemented in the United States, even though the unemployment rate has generally been above the rate (3%) targeted by the act.

== In popular culture ==
In the third season of the American [[political drama]] ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', a job guarantee program, called "America Works," is a key policy proposal of protagonist [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] (portrayed by [[Kevin Spacey]]) after he becomes [[President of the United States]]. Details of the program are sparse, but it is portrayed as involving both public sector employment (in the form of [[public works]] programs) and private sector employment (with [[subsidy|subsidies]] for employers who take on new workers), and is intended to be financed with cuts to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. America Works is not fully implemented, but a [[pilot experiment|pilot program]] centered in [[Washington, D.C.]] is portrayed as having employed tens of thousands of people before funds are rescinded.

== Advocacy ==
In 2011, the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]], a UK [[think tank]] associated with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], advocated a job creation program - with compulsory takeup, on pain of loss of benefits - for the long-term unemployed only. The Labour Party under [[Ed Miliband]] subsequently went into the [[2015 UK general election|2015 general election]] with a promise to implement an even more limited Job Guarantee (specifically, [[part time]] jobs with guaranteed training included for long-term unemployed youth) if elected;&lt;ref name='bbc-labour-manifesto'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26506522|title=Labour extends jobs guarantee for long-term unemployed|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they lost the election. This is still Labour Party policy - however, they are looking at [[universal basic income]] as a possible alternative policy.

In [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech politics]], '''Klausism''' refers to the political positions of [[Václav Klaus]], former prime minister and president of the Czech Republic. It was first used by [[Mirek Topolánek]], who designated Klausism as the ideology of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoulová|first1=Petra|title=MIrek Topolánek: Nezměníme ideologii, máme klausismus|url=http://ihned.cz/c1-12023170-mirek-topolanek-nezmenime-ideologii-mame-klausismus|website=Hospodářské noviny|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=cs-CZ|date=16 December 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312042459/http://ihned.cz/c1-12023170-mirek-topolanek-nezmenime-ideologii-mame-klausismus|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.aktualne.cz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jiří Pehe » Homosexualismus a klausismus|url=http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/jiri-pehe.php?itemid=13895|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=cs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312040456/http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/jiri-pehe.php?itemid=13895|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Europe Intelligence Wire"&gt;{{cite web|title=ODS does not need new ideology, it has its Klausism - Topolanek |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9967063_ITM |website=Access Library |publisher=Europe Intelligence Wire |accessdate=9 March 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529202628/www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9967063_ITM |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term was also used by former Prague mayor [[Jan Kasl]].&lt;ref name="Česká redakce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Česká redakce|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/interview/021216_klaus.shtml|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219235235/http://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/interview/021216_klaus.shtml|archivedate=19 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus himself does not take issue with the term.&lt;ref name="zpravy.idnes.cz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vyprázdněná politika je příležitost pro "havlismus", říká Václav Klaus|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vyprazdnena-politika-je-prilezitost-pro-havlismus-rika-vaclav-klaus-126-/domaci.aspx?c=A091115_200740_domaci_vel|website=iDNES.cz|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=16 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312043628/http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vyprazdnena-politika-je-prilezitost-pro-havlismus-rika-vaclav-klaus-126-/domaci.aspx?c=A091115_200740_domaci_vel|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current usage of the term "Klausism" has become distanced from Klaus himself, leading to the phrase "Klausism without Klaus."&lt;ref name="zpravy.idnes.cz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fischer in HN: Klaus's intellectual legacy to affect society {{!}} Prague… |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2011/01/14/fischer-hn-klauss-intellectual-legacy-affect-society |website=archive.is |accessdate=9 March 2017 |date=29 May 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529202629/praguemonitor.com/2011/01/14/fischer-hn-klauss-intellectual-legacy-affect-society |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Klausism primarily refers to the political ideology, it is also frequently used as a label for the [[neologism]]s invented by Klaus.

==Political positions==
Klaus is known for his [[Euroscepticism in the Czech Republic|Euroscepticism]], [[Climate change denial|global warming denial]], [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|opposition to homosexuality]] and [[anti-immigration|immigration]], and support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Prague - A decade with President Václav Klaus|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/a-decade-with-president-vaclav-klaus|website=Radio.cz|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609211701/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/a-decade-with-president-vaclav-klaus|archivedate=9 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karel Hvížďala » Nebojme se Klause, ale klausismu|url=http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/karel-hvizdala.php?itemid=13918|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=cs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034501/http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/karel-hvizdala.php?itemid=13918|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus's stances are often described as [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] combined with [[national liberalism]] and [[Czech nationalism]]. Jan Pauer described Klaus's political ideology as a combination of "[[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]ite [[monetarism]], [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]ite economic [[libertarianism]], Czech [[national conservatism]] and leadership pragmatism." Klaus described himself as [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[conservative]], and [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=John D.|last2=Mahr|first2=Alison|title=Democracy and democratization : post-communist Europe in comparative perspective|date=1999|publisher=Sage|location=London|isbn=0-7619-5679-4|page=188|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=RLRuXV9vjswC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=v%C3%A1clav+klaus+conservatism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8yjZxNTt09&amp;sig=eu9KigrBpU6ftFQaTrMapX7VbhY&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9yObx_8nSAhUC1hoKHYTwAhcQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=v%C3%A1clav%20klaus%20conservatism&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312041253/https://books.google.cz/books?id=RLRuXV9vjswC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=v%C3%A1clav+klaus+conservatism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8yjZxNTt09&amp;sig=eu9KigrBpU6ftFQaTrMapX7VbhY&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9yObx_8nSAhUC1hoKHYTwAhcQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=v%C3%A1clav%20klaus%20conservatism&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohumil Doležal believes that Klausism is about "fighting against isms," including environmentalism, [[pro-Europeanism]], [[Non-governmental organization|NGOism]] or "[[homosexuality|homosexualism]]" (a phrase itself coined by Klaus). It is opposition to perceived trends in Western politics. Klausism is, according to Doležal, a fight for "realistic policies that solve problems and do not serve dogmatic ideologies". Doležal stated that Klausism itself became one of these Isms.&lt;ref name="Čas falešných proroků"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doležal|first1=Bohumil|title=Čas falešných proroků|url=http://neviditelnypes.lidohttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Klausism&amp;action=edit#vky.cz/udalosti-cas-falesnych-proroku-d3i-/p_politika.aspx?c=A110815_231944_p_politika_wag|website=Lidovky.cz|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''Ekonom'' Magazine likened Klausism to [[Gaullism]], asserting that the two were very similar. Both ideologies support the strong position of the president, but in the case of Klaus it is informal and balancing at the edge of the Czech constitution.&lt;ref name="Klausismus podle vzoru gaullismus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Břešťan|first1=Robert|title=Klausismus podle vzoru gaullismus|url=http://ekonom.ihned.cz/c1-51698870-klausismus-podle-vzoru-gaullismus|website=Týdeník Ekonom|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=cs-CZ|date=28 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403015029/http://ekonom.ihned.cz/c1-51698870-klausismus-podle-vzoru-gaullismus|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klausism without Klaus==
Klausism without Klaus was a term coined by [[Mirek Topolánek]] following conflicts between Václav Klaus and ODS. Bohumil Doležal likened it to "[[Socialism with a human face]]".&lt;ref name="Čas falešných proroků"/&gt; It is often characterised as support for Klaus's ideas but not Klaus himself.&lt;ref name="Návrat Václava Klause se odkládá"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doležal|first1=Bohumil|title=Návrat Václava Klause se odkládá - Přítomnost.cz|url=http://www.pritomnost.cz/cz/archiv-od-roku-2012/424-navrat-vaclava-klause-se-odklada|website=www.pritomnost.cz|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=cs-cz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403110433/http://www.pritomnost.cz/cz/archiv-od-roku-2012/424-navrat-vaclava-klause-se-odklada|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topolánek wanted to retain the positive elements of Klaus' legacy and leave out the negatives. &lt;!-- This sentence doesn't make sense, please clarify!!! "Zbyněk Stanislav described the concept to formality of Czech right-wing politics which he considers to be closer to petty bourgeois-ism and snobbishness than to English Conservatism". --&gt; Klausism without Klaus was represented by [[Petr Nečas]], [[Miroslava Němcová]] and [[Tomáš Chalupa]]. Klausism without Klaus supports [[economic liberalism]], political responsibility, a small state, opposition to other ideologies and the rule of common sense.&lt;ref name="Děti roztomilého dinosaura"&gt;{{cite web|last1=televize|first1=Česká|title=Děti roztomilého dinosaura|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/nazory/1292076-deti-roztomileho-dinosaura|website=ČT24|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=cs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014050/http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/nazory/1292076-deti-roztomileho-dinosaura|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Mental scheme of ODS" was formulated into the Poděbrady Articles in 1998,&lt;ref name="Pětadvacet let ODS a této země"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pětadvacet let ODS a této země|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/politika/petadvacet-let-ods-a-teto-zeme_380904.html|website=Tyden.cz|accessdate=17 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818044927/http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/politika/petadvacet-let-ods-a-teto-zeme_380904.html|archivedate=18 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming the four principles that ODS supports, including protection of privacy, a small state, a future without debts, and solidarity of responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Čtyři poděbradské artikuly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Čtyři poděbradské artikuly|url=http://www.ods.cz/docs/programy/ctyri-podebradske-artikuly-1998.pdf|website=ODS.cz|accessdate=17 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818010831/http://www.ods.cz/docs/programy/ctyri-podebradske-artikuly-1998.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neologisms==
The term Klausism is also used for neologisms coined by Václav Klaus. Klaus is noted for his use of language and often invents new words to describe things he opposes. For example, Klaus invented the word "Havlism", which subsequently entered wider use. Klaus also expressed opposition to "homosexualism". Other widely used Klausisms are ''[[Opposition Agreement]]'' or ''Sarajevo atentate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nový klausismus - spokojování.

==Criticism==
Klausism has many critics. [[Jiří Pehe]] called Klausism deviant, and its own worst enemy, noting Klausism's opposition to modern isms, a category to which Pehe believes it belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jiří Pehe » Homosexualismus a klausismus|url=http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/jiri-pehe.php?itemid=13895|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=cs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312040456/http://blog.aktualne.cz/blogy/jiri-pehe.php?itemid=13895|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pehe believes that Klausism is not what Klaus says but what he did when he was in power. He considers Klaus to be very politically flexible and ignorant of other opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=a.s.|first1=Internet servis,|title=Neviditelný pes|url=http://archiv.neviditelnypes.lidovky.cz/clanky/2003/01/27444_12_0_0.html|website=archiv.neviditelnypes.lidovky.cz|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014441/http://archiv.neviditelnypes.lidovky.cz/clanky/2003/01/27444_12_0_0.html|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pehe suggested that Klausism would be doom for ODS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jiří Pehe: Smutné výročí Občanské demokratické strany|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/plus/nazory/_zprava/jiri-pehe-smutne-vyroci-obcanske-demokraticke-strany--1605549|website=Rozhlas.cz|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=cs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131201755/http://www.rozhlas.cz/plus/nazory/_zprava/jiri-pehe-smutne-vyroci-obcanske-demokraticke-strany--1605549|archivedate=31 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Czech Green Party]] [[Ondřej Liška]] described Klausism as dangerous for democracy. He called Klausism an "ideology of arbitrariness that threatens democracy", comparing it to [[communism]] due to its, in his opinion, lack of principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liška (SZ): Klausismus jako ohrožení demokracie|url=http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/politika/politici-volicum/Liska-SZ-Klausismus-jako-ohrozeni-demokracie-288964|website=Parlamentní Listy|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403015237/http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/politika/politici-volicum/Liska-SZ-Klausismus-jako-ohrozeni-demokracie-288964|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liška varuje před nebezpečím klausismu {{!}} EuroZprávy.cz|url=http://domaci.eurozpravy.cz/politika/79045-liska-varuje-pred-nebezpecim-klausismu/|website=Eurozprávy|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403110609/http://domaci.eurozpravy.cz/politika/79045-liska-varuje-pred-nebezpecim-klausismu/|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latma''' ({{lang-he|לאטמה}}, translation from Arabic "slap in the face") is a [[Conservatism|right-wing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's Channel 1 to broadcast right-wing satirical show|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.624840|website=Haaretz|publisher=Haaretz Daily Newspaper Ltd.|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli media criticism website that also produces a weekly satirical news show.

The website was created in 2008 by a group of journalists claiming that "the only way to improve the Public discourse is exposing the true face of the news and journalism in whole". According to the site, the majority of the Israeli media, and especially the satire that is presented in them, lean to the political left. The site contains criticism about media outlets, reporters and journalists. The criticism is mostly directed towards politically biased articles. The site's editor, [[Caroline Glick]], told the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' that the group was founded with the intention of using comedy to critique the "egregious leftist slant of news coverage in this country."&lt;ref name = "JPost" /&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Latma "is an initiative of the [[Center for Security Policy]], a Washington think tank."&lt;ref name="Mackey" /&gt; The Latma website editor, [[Caroline Glick]], serves as Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Center for Security Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Center for Security Policy Staff |url=https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/about-us/fellows/ |publisher=''[[Center for Security Policy]]'' |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's editor is Caroline Glick. The regular writers are Shuky Blass and Avishai Ivri. The site's CEO is Shlomo Blass.

==Latma TV==
LatmaTV is staffed by Tal Gil'ad (screenplay), Avishay Ivri, the editor, directors Aviv and Yoni Karsutzki, writers [[Noam Jacobson]] and Yehuda Safra, and the actors. Guest writers include Shlomi Cohen Tzemah ("Catz") and Itay Elitzur.

===The Tribal Update===
One of Latma's creations is "The Tribal Update", a mock news show, featuring anchors [[Ronit Shapira|Ronit Shapira (née Avrahamof)]] and [[Elchanan Even-Chen]]. [[CBS]] News characterizes the program  as "a parody TV show — kind of like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s Weekend Update." According to CBS, the anchor gravely explains, in Hebrew, that "this is the newscast that reaches conclusions long before the facts are known."&lt;ref name="Raviv" /&gt;

===Swedish antisemitism satire===
Following the 2009 [[Aftonbladet-Israel controversy]], in which a writer for [[Sweden|Swedish]] tabloid [[Aftonbladet]] alleged that the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] harvested organs of [[Palestinians]], LatmaTV produced a clip a parody on [[ABBA]]'s song "Gimme, Gimme, Gimme a Man After Midnight" entitled [http://www.wejew.com/media/6050/Abba_in_Latma_Studio/ ''Primi Primi Primitive and Phlegmatic''] in which the Swedish foreign minister sings about how primitive and cowardly he is. The clip became a hit after it was quickly picked up by the leading newspaper in Sweden, [[DN.se]], and by Swedish and Norwegian bloggers. Latma website director Shlomo Blass said, "We were surprised by how quickly the clip took-off, we must have hit a sensitive nerve".&lt;ref name="jpost-sweden" /&gt;

===''We Con the World''===
{{main|We Con the World}}
In 2010 Latma produced a [[viral video]] entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOGG_osOoVg ''We Con the World''] satirizing the political intentions of activists aboard the [[MV Mavi Marmara]], the Turkish-owned flagship that led the "blockade busting" [[Free Gaza]] flotilla.&lt;ref name="Barrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barillas" /&gt; The video is a parody of the 1985 song "[[We Are the World]]," by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]].&lt;ref name="BNONews" /&gt; Israeli Government Press Office officials accidentally sent it to a list of journalists, and three hours later sent an apology describing the emailed video as having been "inadvertently released."&lt;ref name="BNONews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Algameen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaStampa" /&gt; The clip received over 3 million hits on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="jpost-youtube" /&gt;

In July 2011, while the second flotilla to Gaza was planned, Latma released another parody about the flotilla: a parody of [[Beach Boys]]' song and video ''[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]'' called ''Guns, Guns, Guns'', where the flotilla sailors sing about their purpose: to bring weapons to Gaza. This video had less success than ''We Con the World''.

===''The Three Terrors''===

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmffgIqlAYA ''The Three Terrors''] was produced in June 2010 as a sequel to ''We Con the World.''  It features three tenors who represent Iran, Turkey and Syria and who resemble [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and [[Bashar Assad]] singing joyfully about using terrorism to conquer the world "from Tennessee to Teheran."&lt;ref&gt;CBN News: [http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/06/21/the-three-terrors.aspx The Three Terrors.]  June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other videos===
In August 2010, Latma release a parody of [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones's]] song and video "[[Sex Bomb (song)|Sex Bomb]]" called [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuEhhPbAAdA ''The Iranian Bomb''], where a fictional Iranian Minister of Destruction sings about his plans to acquire nuclear weapons. The goal of the video is to bring worldwide attention to the [[Iranian nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="thebomb" /&gt;

===Hakol Shafit===
In 2015, the show began to air on [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]] under the name ''Hakol Shafit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/187058#.VQWmFFdMKzQ |title=Right-Wing Satire Latma Finally Reaching a TV Screen Near You |last1=Har-Zahav |first1=Nir |last2=Yashar |first2=Ari |date=November 5, 2014 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |access-date=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
* Latma was awarded the Israel Media Watch 2011 prize, given to "organizations that made courageous, meaningful, and quality contributions to the criticism of the media in Israel". It was chosen by an online poll involving over 4,000 voters.&lt;ref name="jpost-award" /&gt; According to Israel Media Watch, Latma brings balance to the left-wing bias of mainstream Israeli satire.&lt;ref name="jpost-imw" /&gt;

{{See also|political party at European level|}}
In 2008, the [[Libertas Institute Limited]], a [[lobby group]] founded by Declan Ganley and others, advocated a "no" vote in Lisbon I, the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2008 (Ireland)|2008 referendum]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. Lisbon I failed. The [[referendum]] was held on 12 June 2008&lt;ref&gt;

Libertas held a post-referendum celebration in the Burlington Hotel in Dublin on the night of Friday, 13 June 2008.&lt;ref name="STarticle4139706"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article4139706.ece "Europe caught in our offside trap"], Sunday Times, 15 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Attending that celebration was Danish Eurosceptic&lt;ref name="CN354566"&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=354566 "Lisbon treaty to bring more power to officials-critics in Prague"], 13 January 2009, ČeskéNoviny.cz&lt;/ref&gt; and former President of the [[EUDemocrats]]&lt;ref name="EUD109"&gt;[http://eudemocrats.org/eud/news.php?uid=109 "Bonde calls for Referendum in 2009"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523080621/http://eudemocrats.org/eud/news.php?uid=109 |date=23 May 2009 }}, EUDemocrats press release, 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and recently retired&lt;ref name="EUD80"&gt;{{cite web |author=Inbituin |url=http://eudemocrats.org/eud/news.php?uid=80 |title=Bonde's last speech in the Parliament |publisher=Eudemocrats.org |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220081330/http://eudemocrats.org/eud/news.php?uid=80 |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEP [[Jens-Peter Bonde]],&lt;ref name="STarticle4139706"/&gt; who had been a "no" campaigner during the referendum.&lt;ref name="STarticle4139706"/&gt; Bonde was later cited as one of the main architects of the upgrading of Libertas to a [[political party at European level]].&lt;ref name="EurActivarticle-179099"&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/eu-elections/anti-lisbon-party-obtains-eu-recognition-funding/article-179099 "Anti-Lisbon party obtains EU recognition and funding"], EurActive.com, 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ie2209"&gt;[http://www.irishexaminer.com/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=sport-qqqm=sport-qqqa=sport-qqqid=83402-qqqx=1.asp "Libertas set to emerge as political party as candidates unveiled"], 2 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2008, RTÉ News on Two covered Ganley's comments at [[The Heritage Foundation]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he stated that Libertas intended running as a political party at European level. The next day Ganley confirmed that Libertas was fundraising in order to run candidates throughout Europe in the 2009 European Parliament elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0716/1216073118337.html "Libertas may contest European elections"] Irish Times, 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2008, the Irish Times reported&lt;ref name="IT1221835126848"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0920/1221835126848.html "Eurosceptics to help Ganley if he is MEP candidate"], Irish Times, 20 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that Bonde and Czech president [[Václav Klaus]] pledged to help Ganley to launch Libertas. The two were later amongst the guests at a dinner hosted by Ganley at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin on 11 November 2008.&lt;ref name="IT1226408581963"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/1113/1226408581963.html "Ganley's dinner party was a meeting of minds"] Irish Times, 13 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, Ganley registered a company based in Moyne Park, [[Tuam]], County Galway&lt;ref group=nb name="CRO463758"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKDE0463758"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC463758"/&gt; called the ''Libertas Party Limited''.&lt;ref name="IT1225321623322"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1101/1225321623322.html "Ganley registers Libertas as a European political party" from the Irish Times, 1 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb name="CRO463758"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKDE0463758"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC463758"/&gt; The Irish Times reported that the new party was intended to "carry on the business of a European political party".&lt;ref name="IT1225321623322"/&gt; The party was publicly announced in December 2008&lt;ref name="Timesarticle5338120"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article5338120.ece "Libertas to seek a Euro majority"], The Sunday Times, 13 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with ambitions to field up to 400&lt;ref name="Timesarticle5338120"/&gt; candidates and win seats in all 27&lt;ref name="Timesarticle5338120"/&gt; EU member states.

In early 2009 Libertas applied to be recognised by the European Parliament as a political party at European level. The application was briefly successful but then suspended indefinitely amidst controversy.

===Pan-European expansion===

Ganley then travelled around Europe to set up Libertas lists and parties for the [[European Parliament election, 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Bruce (2009).

====Austria====
In Austria, ''Libertas'' was rejected by both [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) and [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) as well as by the independent [[Hans-Peter Martin]]. Martin announced after talks and serious considerations, that he would rather remain independent,&lt;ref name="AT11605"&gt;[http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 "Martin stiffs Irish ´Libertas´"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090629/http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 |date= 6 July 2011 }}, 5 March 2009, from [[Austrian Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; which he successfully did. FPÖ harshly rebuffed Ganley's advances associating his activism with an alleged American conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://text.ots.at/meldung.php?k=OTS_20090219_OTS0178&amp;q=&amp;von=20090123&amp;bis=20090222 "Mölzer: In Österreich gibt es nur eine EU-kritische Partei, und das ist die FPÖ"]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initially noncommital BZÖ&lt;ref name="AT11605"/&gt; later also declined, preferring a loose cooperation in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1240549941581%26sap=2%26_pid=12769021 "BZÖ wünscht sich Kooperation mit Libertas"], [[Der Standard]], 27 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
An electoral list called "Libertas: Free Citizens" ({{lang-bg|Либертас: Свободните граждани}}) was formed by some 30 national and local [[Non-governmental organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulgaria-news.bg/bg/news/read/1237 "ЕВРОСКЕПТИЦИТЕ ОТ „ЛИБЕРТАС" ПУСНАХА КОРЕНИ В БЪЛГАРИЯ"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501134226/http://www.bulgaria-news.bg/bg/news/read/1237 |date= 1 May 2009 }}, 28 April 2009, from [http://www.bulgaria-news.bg http://www.bulgaria-news.bg] and [http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=197572 "Чернев отива на евровота с “Либертас""] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143827/http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=197572 |date= 6 July 2011 }}, 4 May 2009, from [http://www.monitor.bg http://www.monitor.bg]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pavel Chernev]]'s Freedom Party that had announced to join the list was repudiated by Libertas.
However, the submitted list was later rejected by the Bulgarian electoral commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.bg/news/article161161/opredeliha_nomerata_na_byuletinite_za_evroizborite "Определиха номерата на бюлетините за евроизборите"], 13 May 2009, from [http://www.econ.bg/ http://www.econ.bg/] and [http://parliament.europe.bg/en/index.php?category=5&amp;id=21487 "Ballot-paper Numbers are Now Clear"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142849/http://parliament.europe.bg/en/index.php?category=5&amp;id=21487 |date=6 July 2011 }} , 13 May 2009, from [http://parliament.europe.bg http://parliament.europe.bg]&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal filed by [[Nikolay Bliznakov]] was turned down by Bulgaria's [[Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria|Supreme Administrative Court]] on the grounds that the list had not proven the required deposit had not given the names of its constituent parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sac.government.bg/home.nsf/0/6F16D0D07F1E494C422575B70036572D "ВАС отхвърли жалбата на коалиция „Либертас: Свободните граждани" срещу решението на ЦИКЕП, с което е отказана регистрация на коалицията"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142953/http://www.sac.government.bg/home.nsf/0/6F16D0D07F1E494C422575B70036572D |date= 6 July 2011 }}, from [http://www.sac.government.bg/ http://www.sac.government.bg/], see also: [http://www.blitz.bg/news/article/48681 "ВАС потвърди отказа за регистрация на „Либертас: Свободните граждани"], 15 May 2009, from [http://www.blitz.bg/ http://www.blitz.bg/]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the meantime, Bulgarian businessman [[Hristo Atanassov]] founded a party under the name [[Libertas Bulgaria]] which has no connection to the pan-European Libertas network.

====Czech Republic====
Right after the preliminary rejection of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in [[Ireland]], [[Declan Ganley]], founder of the European ''Libertas.eu'', was guest of Czech President [[Václav Klaus]]&lt;ref name="PMOirish-receive-czech-prize-rejection-lisbon-treaty"&gt;"[http://praguemonitor.com/2008/11/07/irish-receive-czech-prize-rejection-lisbon-treaty Irish receive Czech prize for rejection of Lisbon treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130201011258/http://praguemonitor.com/2008/11/07/irish-receive-czech-prize-rejection-lisbon-treaty |date=1 February 2013 }}" 6 November 2008, Prague Monitor&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech eStat.cz civic group had ambitions to replicate Libertas's success&lt;ref name="PMOthink-tank-lisbon-treaty-brings-new-imperialism"&gt;"[http://praguemonitor.com/2008/11/07/think-tank-lisbon-treaty-brings-new-imperialism Think-tank: Lisbon Treaty brings new imperialism]" 4 November 2008, Prague Monitor&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the Irish electorate the Michal Tošovský Prize,&lt;ref name="MVCR01"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/senat-navsteva-z-evropskeho-parlamentu.aspx |title = Senát - návštěva z Evropského parlamentu|publisher = Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic | format = [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mvcr.cz%2Fmvcren%2Farticle%2Fsenat-navsteva-z-evropskeho-parlamentu.aspx&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en English translation]}}&lt;/ref&gt; picked up by Ganley in Prague on 5 November 2008.&lt;ref name="PMOirish-receive-czech-prize-rejection-lisbon-treaty"/&gt; During his stay in Ireland after a state visit, Klaus visited Ganley in a private capacity and later attended the Shelbourne Hotel dinner given by Ganley for leading Eurosceptics.&lt;ref name="PMOklaus-calls-himself-eu-dissident"&gt;[http://praguemonitor.com/2008/11/11/klaus-calls-himself-eu-dissident "Klaus calls himself 'EU dissident'"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130131185806/http://praguemonitor.com/2008/11/11/klaus-calls-himself-eu-dissident |date=31 January 2013 }}, 11 November 2008, Prague Monitor&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Ganley-disavowed new Czech Eurosceptic party by [[Vladimír Železný]] usurped the Libertas brand by registering itself as ''Libertas.cz''. Ganley's Libertas later claimed Železný's Libertas as an affiliate.&lt;ref name="LIE184"/&gt;

====Greece====
After [[Manolis Kalligiannis]] ({{lang-el|Μανώλης Καλλιγιάννης}}), President of the Greek [[Liberal Party (Greece, modern)|Liberal Party]] had attended Libertas.eu's Rome convention on 1 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/9-news/289-libertas-candidates-sign-petition-for-democracy-at-rome-convention "Libertas candidates sign petition for democracy at Rome Convention"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607061536/http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/9-news/289-libertas-candidates-sign-petition-for-democracy-at-rome-convention |date=7 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manolis Kalligiannis (Μανώλης Καλλιγιάννης, sometimes rendered in English as Emmanuel Kalligiannis), Liberal Party run for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Greece)|2009 European parliament election]] under a Libertas-affiliated list with the name “Κόμμα Φιλελευθέρων – Libertas.eu”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eptanews.gr/2009/05/13/%CE%A1%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%B6/%CE%9F_%CE%B5%CF%85%CF%81%CF%89-%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82_%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD_%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD/2874.html "Ο ευρω-λόγος των κομμάτων"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080541/http://www.eptanews.gr/2009/05/13/%CE%A1%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%B6/%CE%9F_%CE%B5%CF%85%CF%81%CF%89-%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82_%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD_%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD/2874.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, from [http://www.eptanews.gr/ Eptanews.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hungary]], Libertas.eu searched for candidates in an Internet ad&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/belfold/2009/04/28/legyen_on_is_ep-kepviselo/ "Legyen ön is EP-képviselő!: Magyarkúti Barna"], 28 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Károly Lóránt]] was appointed the Hungarian representative. However, as Hungarian concerns that a disorganized EU would only serve Russian strategic interests could not be dissipated, no list was fielded on behalf of Libertas.

====Lithuania====

====Portugal====
In April 2009, the Portuguese [[Green politics|ecologist]] [[Earth Party]] (MPT) announced in a joint press conference with Ganley that it would run for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Portugal)|2009 European Parliament election]] with an open electoral list under the banner of ''Libertas.eu''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-portugal/257-libertas-and-mpt-announce-european-election-partnership "Libertas and MPT announce European election partnership"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604064631/http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-portugal/257-libertas-and-mpt-announce-european-election-partnership |date=4 June 2009 }} 27 April 2009, [http://www.libertas.eu/ http://www.libertas.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovakia====
While the vice-president of the [[EUDemocrats]], [[Peter Kopecký]] had already announced the foundation of a ''Libertas Slovensko'' branch,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnutiedomova.sk/download/Kopeckyletak.pdf "Priatelia, spolupracovníci, príbuzní, rodáci, spoluobčania!"]{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
Declaration of Libertas Slovensko, Bratislava, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; he changed his mind in late February and decided to head the list of the small, but already established [[Agrarian and Countryside Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eudemocrats.org/eud/news.php?uid=152 "EUROPEAN ELECTIONS 2009 - Peter Kopecky to contest European elections"], 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Ganley had to look out to other options and met in [[Bratislava]] with leaders of the conservative parties [[Conservative Democrats of Slovakia|KDS]] and [[Civic Conservative Party|OKS]], and with [[Richard Sulík]], the founder of the new ([[Freedom and Solidarity|Sloboda a Solidarita]]).
While Sulík, whom Ganley had already contacted before, still didn't show much interest, [[Vladimír Palko]] (KDS) agreed to bring in their joint list with OKS into the European network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4321858/ganley-europska-unia-je-skoro-ako-chavez.html "Ganley: Európska únia je skoro ako Chávez"], 23 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-slovakia/362-libertas-announces-alliance-in-slovakia "Libertas announces alliance in Slovakia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517231610/http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-slovakia/362-libertas-announces-alliance-in-slovakia |date=17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as the two partys didn't want to give up their distinct identities, they used ''Libertas'' only as supplementary brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ondrej Jombík |url=http://www.oks.sk/article.php?707#kandidatka |title=Koalícia KDS – OKS: Chceme združenie slobodne spolupracujúcich štátov, nie byrokratický superštát |publisher=Oks.sk |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganley requested a recount of his personal vote but still lost.&lt;ref name="EV65120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="II1766466"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/libertas-leader-threw-toys-out-of-election-pram-1766466.html "Libertas leader threw toys out of election pram"] from [http://www.independent.ie/ http://www.independent.ie/]&lt;/ref&gt; Having made the promise to do so before the election, Ganley retired from politics following his defeat on 8 June 2009:&lt;ref name="EV65120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="II1766466"/&gt; the fate of the party he founded, chaired, owned and governed was left to others.&lt;ref name="EV65120"/&gt; However, the affiliated  [[Libertas Institute (Ireland)|Libertas Institute]] did emerge again in the Republic of Ireland when the Irish government launched its re-run of the [[Lisbon Treaty]], despite its [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2008 (Ireland)|defeat]] the previous year. The Libertas party, along with the other minority political groupings, such as the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] and [[Sinn Féin]], which opposed the European Constitutional Amending Bill, were outspent and outperformed by the political proponents of the bill who [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|won]] by a substantial majority. Declan Ganley went on to praise the Irish Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, on 'what was, politically, a masterful campaign…from a masterful politician who has made glove puppets out of the opposition'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=108444 |title=Opposition Leader Ganley: Irish People Scared into Backing Lisbon Treaty - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Ganley also cited recent [[2008–2011 Irish banking crisis|economic turmoil]] in the country as a major deciding factor in the vote.

==Structure==
Libertas's intended structure evolved with time. It was originally intended to be an alliance of national parties, but it was later envisaged as a single pan-European party with candidates running as individual members of Libertas. By the end of April 2009, Libertas's structure had settled into a loose association of national ''member parties'' (either new or pre-existing), with each member party adhering to a set of core principles (see below) but retaining its independence and adding on additional policies as it felt appropriate.&lt;ref name="LIBE270"&gt;[http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-estonia/270-libertas-eesti-erakond-kinnitas-europarlamendi-valimisnimekirja "Libertas Eesti Erakond kinnitas Europarlamendi valimisnimekirja"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503085121/http://www.libertas.eu/en/news/news-estonia/270-libertas-eesti-erakond-kinnitas-europarlamendi-valimisnimekirja |date=3 May 2009 }} undated page on [http://www.libertas.eu/ http://www.libertas.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of contending the 2009 European Parliament elections, Libertas candidates ran under ''lists'' (the lists of candidates presented to voters in a European election) branded with the Libertas identity, as exemplified by the French approach.&lt;ref name="LAT000350947"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI20090309ARTFIG00343"/&gt; Each list was made up of some combination of the following:

*''members of member parties''
*''members of affiliate parties'' (parties that were not members of Libertas.eu but cooperated with it electorally)
*''individual members'' (people who chose to join Libertas.eu as individuals).

New national member parties established by Libertas had names in the "Libertas X" format, e.g. "[[Libertas Sweden]]"&lt;ref name="LI181"&gt;[http://www.libertas.eu/sweden/181-hjaelp-libertas-bli-ett-registrerat-parti "Hjälp Libertas bli ett registrerat parti"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227090654/http://www.libertas.eu/sweden/181-hjaelp-libertas-bli-ett-registrerat-parti |date=27 February 2009 }} 26 February 2009 from the [http://www.libertas.eu/ Libertas website]&lt;/ref&gt; (except in the UK).&lt;ref group=nb name="UKException"&gt;The UK could not adopt a "Libertas X" format name because that name had already been registered with the Electoral Commission. The Libertas.eu member parties in the UK are "Pro-Democracy: Libertas.eu" and "Libertas Northern Ireland"&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-existing national member parties were asked to change their names to include the word "Libertas" in the title.&lt;ref name="EULT5233"/&gt; Members of member parties were members of Libertas automatically unless they chose otherwise.

Affiliate parties retained their original names.&lt;ref name="TVP858431"&gt;[http://www.tvp.info/news.html?directory=17099&amp;news=858431 "Irlandzki milioner tworzy w Polsce antyeuropejski ruch"], 7 January 2009, from [http://www.tvp.info/ www.tvp.info], English translation here [https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvp.info%2Fnews.html%3Fdirectory%3D17099%26news%3D858431&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN812326"&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/nytt-nejparti-staller-upp-i-eu-valet-1.812326 "Nytt nejparti ställer upp i EU-valet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304203248/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/nytt-nejparti-staller-upp-i-eu-valet-1.812326|date=4 March 2009}}, 3 March 2009, from [http://www.dn.se/ dn.se], English translation here [https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fnyheter%2Fpolitik%2Fnytt-nejparti-staller-upp-i-eu-valet-1.812326&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of affiliate parties were not members of Libertas unless they chose to join as individuals.

'''Managerialism''', on one level, involves [[belief]] in the value of [[professional]] [[manager]]s and of the concepts and methods they use.  Contemporary writers on [[management]] such as Thomas Diefenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.amazon.com/Hierarchy-Organisation-Hierarchical-Management-Organizations/dp/0415843928 |title= Hierarchy and Organisation: Toward a General Theory of Hierarchical Social Systems |last= Diefenbach |first= Thomas |date= 2013-06-21 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 9780415843928 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt; associate managerialism with [[hierarchy]]. But scholars have also linked managerialism to [[control (management) | control]],&lt;ref&gt;

Whether the organization behaves in an organic way is, to an important extent, a result of the management's efforts, and the direction of that organic force is something over which management attempts to exercise control. Thus, managerialism has not accepted the underlying determinism of capitalism and socialism.

[...] Thus, to demonstrate results, managerial accountability is employed with a combination of market accountability with more 'customer' focus to users of public services, and performance management regimes. The idea is to ensure that bureaucrats are more responsive to users of services (downward accountability) and report results and policy delivery to political masters (upward accountability). Ironically[,] managerial regimes have had unintended outcomes with civil servants becoming defensive about performance rather than being innovative - the exact opposite of what managerial regimes are designed to achieve (ibid).

American management experts Robert Locke and J C Spender see managerialism as an expression of a special group – management – that entrenches itself ruthlessly and systemically in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Managerialism-Business-Economic-Controversies/dp/178032071X|title= Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance|last= Locke|first= Robert R.|last2= Spender|first2= J.-C.|date= 2011-09-08|publisher= Zed Books|isbn= 9781780320717|edition= 2011|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deprives owners of decision-making power and workers of their ability to resist managerialism. In fact the rise of managerialism may in itself be a response to people's resistance in society and more specifically to workers' opposition against managerial regimes.

Building on Enteman (1993) and Locke/Spender (2011), Thomas Klikauer in “Managerialism – Critique of an Ideology” (2013) defined managerialism thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Managerialism-Critique-Ideology-T-Klikauer/dp/1137334266/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471326015&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Managerialism+%25E2%2580%2593+Critique+of+an+Ideology%25E2%2580%259D|title= Managerialism: A Critique of an Ideology|last= Klikauer|first= T.|date= 2013-09-12|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 9781137334268|edition= 2013|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/42/3/355|title= Book review: Critical Management Ethics Thomas Klikauer.

[http://sydney.edu.au/arts/economics/staff/profiles/tony.aspromourgos.php] In both cases, managerialism occurs when public institutions are run “as if” these were for-profit organization even though they remain government institutions funded through state taxes. In these cases, the term new public management has been used. [https://www.routledge.com/The-Ashgate-Research-Companion-to-New-Public-Management/Christensen-Laegreid/p/book/9780754678069] But the ideology of managerialism can even extend into more distant institutions such as, for example, a College of Physicians.[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2Mgeg558U3MJ:https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2015/202/10/scourge-managerialism-and-royal-australasian-college-physicians+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-b]

Compare what the historian James Hoopes wrote (2003):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[...] the main genesis of managerialism lay in the [[human relations movement]] that took root at the [[Harvard Business School]] in the 1920s and 1930s under the guiding hand of Professor [[Elton Mayo]]. Mayo, an immigrant from Australia, saw democracy as divisive and lacking in community spirit. He looked to corporate managers to restore the social harmony that he believed the uprooting experiences of immigration and industrialization had destroyed and that democracy was incapable of repairing."&lt;ref&gt;

== Managerialist ideology ==
The managerialist society is not one which responds to the needs, desires, and wishes of a majority of its citizens, but one which is influenced by organizations. The managerialist society responds to the managements of various organizations in relation to their transactions with each other. The needs, desires and wishes of the individual are heard through their membership of an organization. Furthermore, managerialism is both a process and a substantive ideology. Managerialism says that the fundamental social units are not individuals, as [[capitalism]] would declare, but rather that the fundamental social units are organizations. Ultimately, managerialism specifically denies that the fundamental nature of society is an aggregation of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

Instead, managerialism sees the core building-block of contemporary society as the modern [[business sector|business]] company or corporation. To further [[commerce|business]], companies, and corporations is the ideological goal of managerialism. How managerialism functions as such an ideology has been perfectly expressed by one of managerialism's main ideological flagships – the ''Harvard Business Review'' - when the ''HBR'''s former editor Joan Magretta (2012: 80-81) made the following stunning revelation:[[# edn1|[i]]]&lt;blockquote&gt; Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and competition, words that, for them, evoke a world view and value system that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy farmers'. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding, the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect competition and in the direction of monopoly.
----[[# ednref1|[i]]]            Magretta, J. 2012. ''What Management Is: How it works and why it's everyone's business'', London: Profile.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Political ===
Managerialism in [[political science]] is a set of beliefs, attitudes and values which support the view that management is the most essential and desirable element of good administration and government. It follows that in all enterprises and services, both private and public, expertise in management must be taught by training and by incentives to excel. In the political world this may take the form of asserting that much conflict and argument are unnecessary for solving problems. All that is needed is a rational assessment of the problem and this involves gathering and collating information, listing the options, calculating costs of each, evaluating consequences and choosing the best course of action. Recent managerialism has included such devices as "[[performance indicator]]s" (purporting to measure the relative efficiencies of different managers) and "[[market testing]]" (which compares public sector managers' responsibilities and tasks with those of managers in the private sector in order to assess their pay). Managerialism is criticized for weakening the [[public service|public-service]] ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one were to conceive of society as a nation, such as the United States, managerialism concludes that there is no single United States and that individual Americans should not be identified as the fundamental nature of the country. Rather, the country is basically composed of numerous groups which collectively make up the country we call the United States. 
The government is a part of the managerial process. The management of different groups will attempt to influence the direction of government action. Their success or failure will depend upon their ability to pursue their case and upon their ability to blunt the cases of competitors. The success of the subunits depends upon the ability of their managements and other factors such as size, cohesiveness, managerial discretion, and control of resources. Government itself is a collection of governmental units. The government is not state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bealey|first= Frank|title= The Blackwell dictionary of political science|year= 1999|publisher= Blackwell Publishers|location= Oxford, UK|isbn= 9780631206958|edition= 1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
Economically, managerialism is the application of [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/management-techniques-2589.html managerial techniques] in businesses. Managerialism in this regard has to do with the strategic approach of [[goal-setting]]. In order to achieve previously unimagined levels of accumulation and production, businesses within a capitalist economy needed a way of connecting their strategic plan of actions to desired implementations of those plans. Within an organization, the individuals at the top of the organizational hierarchy determine a mission or set of goals, which is then strategically analyzed by individuals lower on the hierarchy (managers) to devise local goals to carry out the overall mission. Put simply, the managerial standard is to receive goals from above and to create new goals for those below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Preston|first= David Seth|title= The Rise of Managerialism|url= http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=the_rise_of_managerialism|work= Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|accessdate= 5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a belief that in managerialism, organizations have more similarities than differences, and thus the performance of all organizations can be optimized by the application of generic management skills and theory. To a practitioner of managerialism, there is little difference in the skills required to run a college, an advertising agency or an oil rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Quiggin |first= John |title= Word for Wednesday: managerialism (definition) |publisher= johnquiggin.com |date= 2003-07-02 |url= http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2003/07/02/word-for-wednesday-managerialism-definition/ |accessdate= 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience and skills pertinent to an organization's core business are considered secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Methodology of Business Studies|last= Emmanuel|first= Mathew|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|year= 2010|isbn= 978-81-3173069-0|location= India|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "managerialism" can be used disparagingly to describe organizations perceived to have a preponderance or excess of managerial techniques, solutions, rules and personnel, especially if these seem to run counter to the common sense of observers. It is said{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the MBA degree is intended to provide generic skills to a new class of managers not wedded to a particular industry or professional sector.&lt;ref&gt;"Managerialism Explained." ''Managerialism Explained''. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been mixed reviews on the efficacy of managerialism, explored extensively in university studies of the State. Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon it and putting it forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The word "managerialism" can also be used pejoratively, as in the definition of a management caste. Robert R. Locke defines it accordingly as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== New Managerialism ==
Managerialism  – also called New Managerialism and New Public Management – is an [[ideology]] used for legitimizing the development of new organizational forms and relationships. It has been coined a practical ideology of being 'business-like’ in order to make the new arrangements work for all forms of jobs, organizations, and education systems. The ‘business-like’ indicates what is called “as if” ideologies. Managerialism is conceptualized in that it seeks firstly to explain the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and political reasons behind why particular organizations  have been developed and, secondly, to describe the ways in which public services are currently being delivered. The idea of Managerialism came to fruition when  new organizational forms originated from a view that professional [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] modes of organization were inefficient and could not cope with the challenges rising from increasing globalization. Managerialism, however, has not remained static over the years as it has had many different versions of its implementation. Its linkage to the changing practices associated with an agenda moves away from a purely [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal]] framework. While neo-liberalism uses politics (e.g. elections) to achieve its goals, Managerialism is fundamentally anti-democratic following instead management’s [[Henri Fayol|command-and-control]] concept. While using business-like mechanisms to ensure great cost effectiveness is still used as a great technique. There have been movements away from purely market based systems that were in place strictly for efficiency, to contractual mechanisms and performance measurement through audit and review. In practice of Managerialism, consumers are redefined as well. Not only do consumers have choice in regard to where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well.&lt;ref&gt;Nickson, Alicen. 2014. "A Qualitative Case Study Exploring the Nature of New Managerialism in UK Higher Education and Its Impact on Individual Academics' Experience of Doing Research." Journal of Research Administration 45, no. 1: 47-80. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In new Managerialism consumers are redefined as well. Not only should they have choice regarding where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well. The Managerialism explains public services not as production functions or firms, but as governance structures. What is at stake is not so much the ethos and practice of management as the culture and structure of governance. Here governance means the organisational culture and structure of the relationship between what [[Max Weber|Weber]] called legitimate domination and the self-constitution of those who are subject to it. What Weber meant by legitimate domination was justified by an authority structure, which was, in turn, legitimated by rational authority. Hence, one finds a renewed interest of Managerialism in fostering managerial leadership. But governance through Managerialism was never only dependent for its legitimization on Weber’s notion of [[legal-rational authority]], but more on forms of rationality that depend upon, for example, strategic management, cost-benefit-analysis, efficiency in the market, etc. Although this Managerialism draws on models of corporate Managerialism as well as accounts of New Public Management, it is also imbued with the practices of self in everyday life. What is new here, is recognition of the technologies of self that individuals employ to implicate themselves in their own governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=managerialism_and_education|title=Managerialism and Education|last=Fitzsimons|first=Patrick|date=01/07/1999|website=EEPAT|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates what became known as “The Entrepreneurial Self”. The way Managerialism achieves this, for example, at university levels is through a re-formulation of research and science, as outlined in the table below.

[[Elton Mayo|George Elton Mayo]] was an Australian psychologist and organizational theorist. A former professor of [[Industrial Management]] at the Harvard Business School, Mayo heavily researched the behavior of workers at Western Electric; a manufacturing facet of AT&amp;T. Today he is considered a major contributor to the intellectual thought process and ideas of business management, as well as critical theories of industrial and organizational psychology.  His book, ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization''  articulates his collective thoughts taken from the famous Hawthorne research study conducted while at Harvard University.

''"Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand."''&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and David McLellan. ''The Grundrisse''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] has set many standards in the fields of philosophy, economics, and sociology as one of the worlds most prominent thinkers. Commonly known for his ideas outlined in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'' Marx has exemplified ideas of management and order with his very apparent [[Socialism|socialistic views]].  Sociologically Marx has identified core interrelations between groups of people classified by class structures, and how those relations lead to the success or failures of a collective society.

 '''Friedrich Nietzsche''' 
''"To do great things is difficult; but to command great things is more difficult"''&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Walter Arnold. Kaufmann. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. New York: Penguin, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th century German philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] heavily contributed to the fields of management and leadership.  Focussing in on ideas of morality; particularly distinguishing the differences between what he labeled the, "master morality," and "slave morality," Nietzsche has exemplified the development of managerial practices through the subjections of moral emphasis and control. "He was especially interested, therefore, in a probing analysis and evaluation of the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he characterized as expressions of the ascetic ideal."http://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Nietzsche

== History ==  
The history of Managerialism is linked to the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. In his collection of books over capitalism appropriately named [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]] he writes about how when capitalist merge with other capitalist and two corporations come together, they are more likely to become diluted and when that happens those who were once wise business leaders were to be just aimless managers he stated his belief in his books (only volume 1 was published while he was alive) as follows, "Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, an administrator of other people's capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere money-capitalists.".&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, Bob, and Russell Wheatley. ''Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought''. London: Routledge, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is talking about what would later be known as Managerialism which is first used by [[James Burnham]] who in his book ''The Managerial Revolution'' expresses his ideas on the difference between Capitalism and Managerialism stating that when the owners of capital are no longer the ones in charge, and managers, relying on only principle are in charge then it is no longer [[Capitalism]], it is now considered Managerialism.  Burnham's ideas, in both that book and a subsequent book ''The Machiavellians'' and also in articles which were published in Partisan Review, and elsewhere are thoroughly criticised by [[George Orwell]] in his 1946 essay ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' (first published in ''Polemic'' (London).

Three '''ballot measures''' were certified for the November 6, 2018, [[Massachusetts general election, 2018|general election]] in the state of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=ballotpedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/ele18/ballot_questions_18/ballot_questions18.htm |title=2018 Ballot Questions |website=sec.state.ma.us |publisher=[[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] can be amended through [[initiative]], and state statutes can be proposed through initiative. The first and second certified measures, "Nurse-Patient Assignment Limits" and "Advisory Commission for Amendments to the U.S. Constitution Regarding Corporate Personhood and Political Spending", were both [[initiated state statute]]s. The third measure, "Gender Identity and Anti-Discrimination", was a [[Popular referendum|veto referendum]].

In Massachusetts, after the state determines which measure(s) will appear on the ballot, an official name is assigned to each question. The [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|Secretary of the Commonwealth]] has discretion over the ordering of questions on the ballot.

==Endorsements==
===Question 1===
On October 23, 2018, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' editorial board endorsed a 'no' vote on Question 1, saying the nursing staff ratio is wrong for Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Editorial |first=Board |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/10/22/question-nursing-staff-ratio-wrong-for-massachusetts/XF9K7ZApFE43g5smP7nkdO/story.html |title=Editorial board endorsement: Vote ‘no’ on Question 1.

===Question 3===
A 'yes' vote on Question 3 has been "wholeheartedly" endorsed by ''The Boston Globe'' in an October 17, 2018, editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stand up for equality: Vote Yes on 3 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/10/17/stand-for-equality-vote-yes/8a8TZNZ7JuHV161hRh8ILL/story.html |accessdate=18 October 2018 |website=The Boston Globe |date=18 October 2018 |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress and LGBT advocate [[Laverne Cox]] also advocated for a 'yes' vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/10/25/laverne-cox-transgender-law-massachusetts |title=Laverne Cox Urges Mass.

==Removed question==
A measure titled "Income Tax for Education and Transportation Amendment", which sought to create a four percent tax on incomes that exceed $1 million, to be used for education and transportation purposes, was removed after the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in June 2018 that the measure had been incorrectly certified by the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/06/18/millionaires-tax-rejected-sjc |title='Millionaire's Tax' Won't Be On The State Ballot, Mass.

==Other potential questions==
Several additional measures received a required number of signatures by December 6, 2017,&lt;ref name=ballotpedia/&gt; but ultimately were not added to the ballot:
* $15 Minimum Wage Initiative
* Paid Family and Medical Leave Initiative
* Sales Tax Decrease and Tax-Free Weekend Initiative

A new law enacting a majority of content from these three measures was signed into law in late June by [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Charlie Baker]]. Hourly [[minimum wage]] will be increased from $11 to $15 by 2023, workers will have paid medical leave of 12 to 20 weeks (depending on circumstance), and there will be an annual August [[Tax holiday|sales tax holiday]]; the state sales tax was not decreased. Initiative organizers agreed to withdraw the associated ballot initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_politics/2018/07/grand_bargain_keeps_voters_from_deciding_ballot_questions |title="Grand bargain" keeps voters from deciding ballot questions |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=July 1, 2018 |accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act (1957)''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] enacted to regulate the [[Mining in India|mining sector in India]]. It was amended in 2015 and 2016. This act forms the basic framework of mining regulation in India.&lt;ref name="Usa2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibp Usa|title=India Energy Policy, Laws and Regulations Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB2XgE_JvWcC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=20 March 2009|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-2292-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the 7th ordinance by the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] government since it took power in May 2014.&lt;ref name=MiningOrdinance/&gt;  The bill to replace the ordinance was introduced in the Parliament on 23 February 2015.&lt;ref name=CoalBills&gt;{{cite news|title=Land and Coal Bills introduced in Lok Sabha|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/land-acquisition-amendment-bill-introduced-in-lok-sabha-amid-opposition-uproar/article6928709.ece|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2014, the [[Supreme Court of India]] cancelled licences of 26 mines in [[Odisha]] state.  These mines were being operating even though the state had not given them renewal leases.  The state was given 6 months to resolve the issues.  During this period, Odisha renewed 8 leases.&lt;ref name=CannotOdisha&gt;{{cite news|title=Mining law ensures auction cannot take off in Odisha|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/mining-law-ensures-auction-cannot-take-off-in-odisha-115030301485_1.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 January 2015, the [[Government of Odisha]] decided to auction its remaining non-coal mining leases awaiting renewal.&lt;ref name=Outsmarts&gt;{{cite news|title=Naveen Patnaik outsmarts Centre on mines auction issue|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-naveen-patnaik-outsmarts-centre-on-mines-auction-issue-2050305|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OdishaAuction&gt;{{cite news|title=Odisha to auction mine leases except coal|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/odisha-to-auction-mine-leases-except-coal-115010500789_1.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state was granted 2 more months on 23 February to decide. However, introduction of the bill delayed Odisha's plans of auction.&lt;ref name=CannotOdisha/&gt;

The amendment seeks to introduce a system of auctions to allocate mining licenses.  A fixed percentage to the revenue of any mine will be allocated to development of the area around it, to be called a District Mineral Foundation.  The state government will set the rates and it will be in addition to the [[royalties|royalty]].&lt;ref name=Plans/&gt;&lt;ref name=Foundation&gt;{{cite news|title=Union govt to create District Mineral Foundation in mining-affected areas|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/union-govt-to-create-district-mineral-foundation-in-miningaffected-areas/article6638970.ece|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A National Mineral Exploration Trust will be set up to explore and promote non-coal minerals.  It will have a starting fund of {{currency|500|INR}} crore and will be funded by a 2% levy from mining license holders.&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to seed mineral trust with Rs500 cr|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/govt-to-seed-mineral-trust-with-rs500-cr/|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The licences will have a validity of 50 years, compared to the previous 30 years.  There will be no renewal of licences, only re-auction.&lt;ref name=LSPasses/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plans/&gt; The bill contains a new license for [[prospecting]]-cum-[[mining]], replacing a two-stage process.&lt;ref name=ProvenReserves&gt;{{cite news|title=Auction of mining leases not useful without proven reserves, says SGAT|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/auction-of-mining-leases-not-useful-without-proven-reserves-says-sgat-115012000785_1.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mining and prospecting-cum-mining licences may be transferred to another party by notifying the state government.  The state government may charge a fees for such transfers.&lt;ref name=Plans/&gt;  Notified minerals like iron ore, [[limestone]], [[manganese]], and [[bauxite]], will not require a prospecting licence.  The mining licence will be auctioned.  For non-notified minerals, a prospecting-cum-mining licence will be required.&lt;ref name=Hefty/&gt;

The amendment will make [[Mining scams in India|illegal mining]], [[trespassing]] and violation of norms, [[cognisable offence]]s punishable by 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.  The state government will be allowed to set up special courts for such trials.&lt;ref name=Hefty&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposed mines Bill for hefty penalty for violators|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/BjAPr5YBi9JBLVl9tnZlWO/Proposed-mines-Bill-for-hefty-penalty-for-violators.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[Live Mint]]|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
In January 2015, after the ordinance was signed, a mining industry [[lobby group]] Society of Geo-scientists and Allied Technologists (SGAT) said that the [[prospecting]]-cum-[[mining]] was useless as no one would apply for such a licence unless they had found a proven reserve by prospecting first.&lt;ref name=ProvenReserves/&gt;

In March 2015, during the session in which the bill was tabled, the central government did accept the changes proposed some opposition members, some of whom staged a [[walk-out]].&lt;ref name=AmidOppnWalkout/&gt; [[Biju Janata Dal]] (BJD) political party of [[Odisha]] said that the bill infringes on the rights of state governments. The view was supported by [[Indian National Congress]] and [[All India Trinamool Congress]] party.&lt;ref name=LSPasses/&gt; [[Kariya Munda]] of [[BJP]] said that provisions for the [[tribal]]s displaced by mines should be made. [[Tathagata Satapathy]] of BJD also voiced similar concerns. The period of validity of licences was criticised as being too long at 50 years.&lt;ref name=AmidOppnWalkout&gt;{{cite news|title=LS Passes Mines and Minerals Bill Amid Oppn Walkout|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/LS-Passes-Mines-and-Minerals-Bill-Amid-Oppn-Walkout/2015/03/04/article2697019.ece|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
The Union Cabinet of India approved amendments in March 2016. The amendment will allow transfer of captive mining leases not granted through auction. Transfer of captive mining leases, granted otherwise than through auction, would allow mergers and acquisitions of companies and facilitate ease of doing business for companies to improve profitability and decrease costs of the companies' dependent on supply of mineral ore from captive leases. The transfer provisions will also facilitate banks and financial institutions to liquidate stressed assets where a company or its captive mining lease is mortgaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/amendment-to-the-mines-and-minerals-development-and-regulation-act-1957-116031000721_1.html |work=[[Business Standard]] |date=10 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Foreign Affairs''' of [[Guatemala]] is the executive office in charge of conducting the [[international relations]] of the country. This ministry can give the Guatemalan [[nationality]], enforces the immigration laws of the country, preserves the national limits and boundaries, negotiates international treaties and agreements with other countries and preserves the copies of the ones signed by Guatemala. It is appointed by law to preserve the national interests overseas and to be part of the National Security System.

== Background and History ==

Starting in the 19th century, right after independence from Spain was signed, the public administration was slowly organized. There was a first stage when Guatemala was a part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]], and a second stage starting in 1847, when [[Guatemala]] became an independent, free and sovereign republic to administer its own public affairs. Through that time, the different executive offices were organized as "secretariats", following the Spanish nomenclature. This terminology included the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, which kept its name until after the Revolution of 1944. Decree #47, passed by the Revolutionary Joint on December 27, 1944, still used this category. However, when the new Constitution came into force on March 15, 1945, the Constitutional system created the Ministries of State. For that reason, Congress passed a bill for the organization of the Executive Branch, which first spoke of a Foreign Affairs Ministry, on April 25, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minex.gob.gt/Visor_Pagina.aspx?PaginaID=109|title=Nuestra Historia|publisher=Minex|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign Affairs ==

Currently, Guatemala holds diplomatic relations with 152 countries. It has 41 embassies throughout the World, and 4 missions in International Organizations.

A '''moshava''' ({{lang-he-n|מושבה}}), plural: ''moshavot'' ({{Hebrew|מושבות}}), was a form of rural Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Ottoman Palestine]], established by the members of the [[Old Yishuv]] since late 1870s and during the first two waves of Jewish Zionist immigration - the [[First Aliyah|First]] and [[Second Aliyah]].
==History==
In a moshava, as opposed to later communal settlements like the [[kibbutz]]  and the [[moshav]], all the land and property are privately owned. The first moshavot were established by the members of the [[Old Yishuv|Jewish community]] and by pioneers of the [[First Aliyah]] arriving to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bennett1971"&gt;{{cite journal

Farms were established along both sides of a broad main street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=yE_7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA439&amp;lpg=PA439&amp;dq=zionist+colonization+early+moshavot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4XrPXU9gAe&amp;sig=BVY3d_O8xcKK_d2tl0O3TBuF6u8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ2OuMxvzYAhVBzqQKHZ8BBtUQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=zionist%20colonization%20early%20moshavot&amp;f=true The Middle East: A Geographical Study, Peter Beaumont, Gerald Blake and J.

The first four moshavot of the First Aliyah period were [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rosh Pinna]], [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] and [[Yesud HaMa'ala]].&lt;ref name="Bennett1971" /&gt;

The driving force behind these early settlements was the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement in Europe, whose branches operated as financially-independent settlement societies. &lt;ref&gt;Rothschild and Early Jewish Colonization, Ran Aaronsohn, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The moshava was governed by a charter outlining communal principles that established a covenent or bond between the residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=IwPMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=moshava+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Si8GlbFV7E&amp;sig=VtQoO3HDB78__niFrU96tnGhbGc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-sJvn4vzYAhXnJsAKHYx9Cyo4ChDoAQg4MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=moshava%20meaning&amp;f=true Contemporary Israel: New Insights and Scholarship edited by Frederick E.

== NTCC - National Territorial Commanders Committee  ==

The National Territorial Commanders Committee, or NTCC, is an informal forum for the exchange of information and for the consultation on multinational issues of mutual (military) interest. The NTCC coordinates [http://www.nato.int/docu/logi-en/1997/lo-1213.htm host nation support] and establishes guidelines to facilitate reception, staging and onward movement (RSOM) of transiting or operating allied and partner nation forces; coordinates operational access to national lines of communication; and coordinates delivery of defense and intergovernmental resources for operations, exercises and contingencies of sending nations.

The NTCC was first established in 1986 by six nations, and today it is composed of senior logistical military commanders and representatives from more than 20 allied and partner nations. The NTCC is staffed with observers from the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), ]][[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]](SHAPE), the [[European Union]](EU) military staff and the [[United States European Command ]](EUCOM). The organization seeks to improve host nation cooperation and enhance NTCC member capabilities to responsively meet allied and partner sending nation support requirements for exercises, contingencies or operations.&lt;ref&gt;wss.apan.org/s/ntcc/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission and Vision ===
The NTCC mission is to streamline [http://www.nato.int/docu/logi-en/1997/lo-1213.htm host nation support] (HNS) coordination between member nations. The organization's vision is to be the leading multinational network for host nation support.&lt;ref&gt;wss.apan.org/s/ntcc/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus Areas===
Through information sharing and capturing lessons learned, the members of the NTCC seek to transform operational processes to create a system of best practices to govern host nation support procedures and capabilities.  

The primary NTCC focus areas are:
* Enhance North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) integration with [[Military alliance|allies]] and partner forces
* Facilitate logistics change initiatives
* Enable knowledge/information sharing
* Improve host nation support capabilities, capacity, and activity
* Assist partner nations in planning, managing and executing [[Military logistics|logistics]] support
&lt;ref&gt;https://wss.apan.org/s/NTCC/about/About%20Us%20Document%20Assets/trifold2014NTCC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role===

The NTCC does not replace bilateral or joint agreements between nations, nor does its capabilities supersede those of NATO or other formal documents/organizations.

Members seek to exchange and share information on issues of common concern, with the end goal of streamlining processes and procedures to ensure rapid response of host nation support during military operations, exercises, crises and in times of peace. The experts of the NTCC facilitate the development and acceptance of bilateral and multilateral logistics arrangements/agreements and liaise with organizations across the spectrum on matters related/adjacent to host nation support matters.

Through participation in multinational logistics planning conferences, [[NATO]] Schools and in allied and joint exercises, the NTCC helps bolster regional and partner confidence in planning, managing and implementing host nation logistics support.

===Organization===

The Commanders of the NTCC meet annually for the National Territorial Commanders Committee Meeting. During this meeting, the Commanders vote on issues of importance to the organization and affirm/execute the guidance and tasks brought forward by the NTCC Steering Committee.

The NTCC Steering Committee meets twice annually and is composed of national single points of contact (SPOCs) who liaise on behalf of their commanders/nations on the day-to-day business of host nation support logistics. The steering committee is chaired by a permanent secretary (PERMSEC) who coordinates the issues of the NTCC and SPOCs in accordance with the official NTCC Terms of Reference.

There are three levels of participation in the NTCC Forum:
* Members: Belong to the signing nations and have full voting status in the NTCC. Members must be unanimously voted in by the member nations of the forum
* Observers: Organizations, agencies or commands who can observe and contribute to the NTCC but possess no voting rights
* Invitees: Invited to observe the activities and procedures of the NTCC, with the option of seeking full membership through official vote by NTCC Members

'''New Llano''' is a [[town]] in [[Vernon Parish, Louisiana|Vernon Parish]], [[Louisiana]], United States. The population was 2,415 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is part of the [[Fort Polk South, Louisiana|Fort Polk South]] [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

Originally known as Stables, the town was renamed when 200 members of the Socialist commune [[Llano del Rio]] Cooperative Colony in [[California]] relocated to this site in 1917, giving the town its present name. It continued to function as a socialist commune with citizens pooling and sharing resources and wealth until 1937.

==Geography==
New Llano is located at {{Coord|31|6|53|N|93|16|47|W|type:city}} (31.114793, -93.279793).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 1.0&amp;nbsp;square mile (2.5&amp;nbsp;km²), all land.

==History==

The ''New Llano Cooperative Colony'' was founded in 1917 when Job Harriman relocated, with other commune members of the Llano del Rio colony, to 20,000 acres of cut-over land two miles south of [[Leesville, Louisiana|Leesville]]. The location chosen was the Gulf Lumber Company sawmill town named Stables. The mill had burned in 1913 and again in 1916. After the sawmill burned the second time it was not rebuilt because the [[stumpage]] reserves were depleted. The land, was sold on contract to the Cooperative Colony. The colony attempted to achieve self-sufficiency with a national socialist newspaper, a broom factory, sawmill, ice plant, and sheet metal factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kplctv.com/story/23247607/history-of-new-llano-socialist-colony-to-be-highlighted-at-new-museum KPLC: History of New Llano]- Retrieved 2017-07-19&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a school, infirmary, hospital, and recreational facilities. The colony closed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vernonparish.org/places-see/historic-places?page=1 Vernon Parish: Places to see]- Retrieved 2017-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Popular Unity Candidacy''' ({{lang-ca|Candidatura d'Unitat Popular, CUP}}) is a [[left-wing]] pro-[[Catalan independence]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Catalonia|political party]] active primarily in [[Catalonia]], where it has political representation, but also in other [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] in [[Spain]] it considers to belong to the [[Països Catalans|Catalan Countries]]. The CUP traditionally has focused on [[municipality|municipal]] politics, and is made up of a series of autonomous candidatures that run in local elections. Its presence is strongest in [[Catalonia]] proper.

In 2012, the CUP decided for the first time to run for [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan parliamentary elections]], gaining 3 MPs out of 135. In the 2015 elections they obtained 10 MPs.

==Organisation==
[[File:CUP's antimonarchist concentration advertisment.jpg|thumb|left|(''In Catalan: For the republic of the Catalan Countries'') CUP poster for an anti-monarchist rally]]
The CUP is made up of autonomous local assemblies representing towns or neighbourhoods. These assemblies may have some ideological differences, but their common ground is independence for the [[Catalan Countries]] and clear left-wing politics, often in the form of [[anti-capitalism]], [[socialism]], and [[eco-socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The different local candidatures are coordinated through the ''Municipal Assembly of the Independentist Left'' (''AMEI'' in Catalan) where the details regarding their [[party platform]] are discussed. On both the local and national level, decisions are made in assembly according to the principles of [[deliberative democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The highly decentralised nature of this party stems from a belief in [[Libertarian municipalism|municipalism]]. The CUP consider municipal government "the only institutions within the reach of the general populace".&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitatpopular.cat/programa/principis-d-accio-politica |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114233648/http://www.unitatpopular.cat/programa/principis-d-accio-politica |archivedate=November 14, 2012 }}{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance given to municipal assemblies is also meant to avoid the hierarchical organisation of most traditional political parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Ideology==
The CUP website describes the entity as "an assembly-based political organisation spread throughout the Catalan Countries that works for a country that's independent, socialist, environmentally sustainable and free from the domination of the patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cup.cat/pagina/qu%C3%A8-%C3%A9s-una-cup |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162939/http://www.cup.cat/pagina/qu%C3%A8-%C3%A9s-una-cup |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

The CUP defends the unity of the Catalan-speaking areas, or Catalan Countries, which they believe should be allowed to constitute an independent republic, according to the principles of [[self-determination]]. The CUP is also strongly in favor of the [[Catalan language]], which should be the "preferential and common language" of the areas where it is traditionally spoken. Still, the 2012 CUP [[political program|program]] refers to the advantages of multilingualism and encourages debate on the status that an independent Catalonia would grant to [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="program"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/cupnacional/docs/cup-programa_politic_2012?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=#222222|title=CUP - Alternativa d'Esquerres - Programa Polític|work=issuu|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

=== Political system ===
[[File:Event against European Union, 2014 (Harmonia del Palomar, Catalonia).JPG|thumbnail|A CUP political event in 2014]] 
The CUP criticise the current political system in place in Spain and France, and defend an  alternative brand of [[participative democracy]]. It has proposed, for example, that the general public be allowed to vote on important issues in [[referendum|referenda]], and have suggested the creation of [[Recall election|representative recall]] ({{lang-ca|Iniciativa Popular Revocatòria}}), which would allow the general public to remove elected officials from office before their term expires.&lt;ref name="program"/&gt; As part of its belief in [[Libertarian municipalism|municipalism]], it also has defended the creation of an Assembly of Councillors ({{lang-ca|Assemblea de Regidors i Regidores Electes}}), made up of municipal councillors, as a national representative body.&lt;ref name="program"/&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

=== Economy ===
The CUP broadly refers to its economic model as [[Socialism|socialist]]. Its political programme calls for a "planned economy based on solidarity, aimed towards fulfilling the needs of the people", and defends the [[nationalisation]] of public utilities as well as transport and communication networks. It also calls for a nationalisation of all banks receiving government [[bailout]]s and considers the public debt "illegitimate".&lt;ref name="program"/&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

===Environment ===
The CUP call for an end to [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], with the use of [[sustainable energy]] in its stead. It also calls for a ban on [[Genetically modified organism|GMOs]] and the creation of an "ecological economy".&lt;ref name="program"/&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

===Civil rights===
The CUP believe in full civic rights for all inhabitants of the Catalan Countries, including migrants. It also calls for voting rights for everyone over 16 years of age as well as an end to discrimination against women and [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name="program"/&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2015}}

===2012 Catalan parliamentary elections===
[[File:David Fernàndez a l'acte central de la CUP al Barcelona Teatre Musical.jpg|thumbnail|David Fernández was a member of the Catalan Parliament for the CUP in the 2012-2015 legislature]]
In 2012, after [[snap elections]] were declared by Catalan president [[Artur Mas]], different local branches of the CUP organised assemblies open to the general public in order to debate whether the CUP should run. On 13 October, the general assembly of the CUP met in [[Molins de Rei]] and decided, with 77% in favour, to run for the first time in the [[Catalan parliamentary election, 2012|Catalan parliamentary elections]]. For this purpose, the CUP decided use the name ''Candidatura d'Unitat Popular – Alternativa d'Esquerres'' (Popular Unity Candidacy – Left-Wing Alternative) in order to include independent candidates who chose to run on CUP lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4047042/20121013/cup-decideix-presentar-eleccions-parlament.html|title=La CUP decideix presentar-se a les eleccions al Parlament|last=|first=|date=|work=VilaWeb.cat|access-date=2017-10-18|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Fernàndez, a journalist from [[Gràcia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blocs.mesvilaweb.cat/user/view/id/5652|title=estirant del fil... {{!}} [No escrivim èglogues] · [Bloc intermitent]|website=blocs.mesvilaweb.cat|language=ca|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was chosen to head the list for Barcelona.

The CUP promised that, if elected, its candidates only would serve one term, earn no more than €1,600 a month, and base their decisions on the opinions expressed by local assemblies. it also promised not to request any loans from banks, so as to avoid being influenced by "financial groups and economic élites".&lt;ref name="principles"/&gt;

The CUP was able to win representation in the Catalan Parliament with three seats, and 126,219 votes. The three CUP seats went to the party's spokesman David Fernàndez, Georgina Rieradevall (number two on the list later on replaced by Isabel Vallet), and Quim Arrufat (number three on the list).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitatpopular.cat/candidats-i-candidates/barcelona|title=Candidats i candidates de la CUP-AE circumscripció de Barcelona|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108060954/http://www.unitatpopular.cat/candidats-i-candidates/barcelona|archivedate=November 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results are historic for the CUP, but its spokesman emphasises that it must keep on working and fighting in the streets for a better future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4058978/20121126/david-fernandez-cup-democracia-defensa-parlament-sino-carrer.html |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2014-10-25 |title=David Fernàndez (CUP): 'La democràcia no es defensa al parlament, sinó al carrer' |language=Catalan |publisher=VilaWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 municipal elections===
In the [[Spanish local elections, 2015|2015 municipal elections]], the CUP presented candidatures in 163 different municipalities, more than double the number of candidatures presented in the previous elections. In Catalonia, the CUP obtained 221,746 votes in all (7.12% percent of those cast). This was more than three times what it had won in 2011, earning 372 council seats, an absolute majority on nine town councils, and a relative majority in four more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resultadoslocales2015.interior.es/99MU/DMU09999CM_L1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526191018/http://www.resultadoslocales2015.interior.es/99MU/DMU09999CM_L1.htm |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CUP mayors were chosen in 14 municipalities, whereas previously the CUP only held three mayorships. For the first time, the CUP won the government of the capital of a ''comarca'', [[Berga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El mapa dels alcaldes de Catalunya|date=2015-06-15|agency=Ara|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Mapa-alcaldes-eleccions-municipals_0_1374462790.html |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions including the CUP won important victories in other municipalities; in [[Badalona]], Catalonia's third most populous city, a coalition including the CUP came in second and won the mayorship with the help of other left-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/88049/cup/entra/al/cinturo/roig/territori/estat/veu/etnicament/propi|title=La CUP entra al Cinturó Roig, territori que l'Estat veu "ètnicament propi"|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-10-18|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CUP managed to win representation in most major cities in Catalonia, including Barcelona, [[Girona]], [[Lleida]], [[Tarragona]], [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat|L'Hospitalet]] and [[Terrassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/municipals2015|title=Resultats Eleccions Municipals 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.naciodigital.cat|language=ca|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Valencian Community]], the CUP ran in four municipalities, and won seats on the municipal councils of two, [[Pedreguer]] and [[Burjassot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4331953/20150525/cup-obte-primers-regidors-pais-valencia.html|title=La CUP obté els primers regidors al País Valencià|last=|first=|date=|work=VilaWeb.cat|access-date=2017-10-18|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Catalan parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Parliamentary elections]], the CUP formed a coalition called ''Candidatura d'Unitat Popular – Crida Constituent'' ([[Popular Unity Candidacy - Constituent Call]]). [[Antonio Baños]], a journalist and writer from the [[Nou Barris]] neighbourhood of [[Barcelona]], was chosen to head the list.

The party won 336,375 votes, almost tripling its previous results, and was awarded 10 seats in the Catalan Parliament. That placed it in the position of [[kingmaker]], with enough seats to form a pro-independence alliance with [[Junts pel Sí|Together for Yes]], which obtained 62 seats.&lt;ref name="Resultats Eleccions al Parlament de Catalunya 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Resultats Eleccions al Parlament de Catalunya 2015|agency=Nació Digital|date=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three months of negotiations in which the CUP rejected the presidency of incumbent [[Artur Mas]], the CUP and Together for Yes reached an agreement by which [[Carles Puigdemont]], mayor of [[Girona]], became president of Catalonia.&lt;ref name="Junts pel Sí i la CUP investeixen Puigdemont per avançar cap a la independència"&gt;{{cite news|title=Junts pel Sí i la CUP investeixen Puigdemont per avançar cap a la independència|agency=Nació Digital|date=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while eight CUP MPs voted in favor of Puigdemont's presidency, two abstained to "express their differences" with Together for Yes.&lt;ref name="http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/vuit-dels-diputats-de-la-cup-votaran-a-favor-de-la-investidura-de-puigdemont/?f=rel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vuit dels diputats de la CUP votaran a favor de la investidura de Puigdemont|agency=Vilaweb|date=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this agreement, two CUP MPs are to work closely with Together for Yes in order to ensure a pro-independence majority in the Parliament of Catalonia.&lt;ref name="http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/urgent-artur-mas-dimiteix-per-desbloquejar-lacord-i-avancar-cap-a-la-independencia/"&gt;{{cite news|title=Artur Mas dimiteix per desblocar l’acord i avançar cap a la independència.

==Prison Litigation Reform Act==
{{Main|Prison Litigation Reform Act}}
In the [[United States]], the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or PLRA, is a federal statute enacted in 1996 with the intent of limiting "frivolous lawsuits" by prisoners. Among its  provisions, the PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust all possibly executive means of reform before filing for litigation, restricts the normal procedure of having the losing defendant pay legal fees (thus making fewer lawyers willing to represent a prisoner), allows for the courts to dismiss cases as "frivolous" or "malicious", and requires prisoners to pay their court fees up front if they have three previous instances of a case having been dismissed as "frivolous."&lt;ref&gt;Meeropol, R. &amp; Head, I. (2010). Brief summary of the prison litigation reform act (PLRA). ''The Jailhouse Lawyer's Handbook.'' Retrieved from http://jailhouselaw.org/brief-summary-prison-litigation-reform-act/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reform laws ''' were a set of [[anticlerical]] laws enacted in Mexico between 1855 and 1863, during the governments of [[Juan Alvarez]], [[Ignacio Comonfort]] and [[Benito Juárez]] that were intended to limit the privileges (''fueros'') of the Roman Catholic Church and the military. The laws also limited the ability of Catholic Church and indigenous communities from collectively holding land. The liberal government sought the revenues from the disentailment of church property, which could fund the [[Reform War|civil war]] against Mexican conservatives and to broaden the base of property ownership in Mexico and encouraging private enterprise. Several of them were raised to constitutional status by the constituent Congress that drafted the [[Liberalism in Mexico|liberal]] [[Constitution of 1857]]. Although the laws had a major impact on the Catholic Church in Mexico, liberal proponents were not opposed to the church as a spiritual institution, but rather sought a secular state and a society not dominated religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hamnett, "Reform Laws" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, pp. 1239-1241. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1854, the [[Plan of Ayutla]] was proclaimed against the dictatorship of [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], indicting him for his sale of the Mesilla Valley to the United States, the [[Gadsden Purchase]]; acting as a repressive dictator, and eliminating democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Knowlton, "Plan of Ayala", vol. 4, p. 420, ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The revolution was led by [[Florencio Villarreal]], Juan Alvarez and Ignacio Comonfort spread to many parts of the country, achieving success in October 1855. Juan Alvarez assumed the presidency on an interim basis who in turn convened a congress. An important aspect of Juan Alvarez was taking in his cabinet young liberals, thanks to it so important for the history of Mexico and [[Melchor Ocampo]], Benito Juarez, [[Guillermo Prieto]] and Ignacio Comonfort men had the opportunity to have an active political participation. In his administration, Alvarez was dedicated to make laws that keep the country under the ideals of liberalism, as the Juárez Law, and the provision of Melchor Ocampo depriving the right to vote the clergy. For personal reasons Juan Alvarez resigned in December 1855 and left Ignacio Comonfort as responsible for the country's presidency.

== Promulgation  ==

=== Government of Juan Álvarez (October-December 1855) ===
* Juárez law or the Law on Administration of Justice and the Courts Organic Nation District and Territories: It was issued by Benito Juarez on 23 November 1855. This law was rejected by the bishops archbishops of Mexico, since it restricted ecclesiastical privileges (''fueros'').&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Ley Juárez" vol. 3, p. 409. ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lafragua Law or freedom of the press law: it allowed freedom of expression in print media, entered into force on 28 December 1855. It was promulgated by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Interior [[José María Lafragua]].

=== Government of Ignacio Comonfort (December 1855-January 1858) ===
* Decree abolished civil coercion of religious vows, promulgated April 26, 1856. 
* Decree that suppressed the [[Society of Jesus]] in Mexico, promulgated June 5, 1856.
* [[Lerdo law]] or Law of Confiscation of Property Plots and Urban Civil and Ecclesiastical Corporations: forced the civil, such as Indian communities, and ecclesiastical corporations to sell houses and land to private individuals. It was drafted by [[Miguel Lerdo de Tejada]] (brother of [[Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada]]) and was promulgated June 25, 1856.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Ley Lerdo" vol. 3, p. 409. ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the most controversial of all the Reform laws, but it was part of a process that had been initiated during Spanish rule in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Brian R. Hamnett, "Reform Laws" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1239. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Lafragua Law or Civil Registration Act. Through this law, the Civil Registry was established for births, marriages, and deaths, removing these from the Roman Catholic Church which had kept records of baptism, holy matrimony, and death. It was issued on January 27, 1857.
* [[Constitution of 1857]] was promulgated on 5 February 1857. Republican and Federalist liberal [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], who fought for these ideals throughout his life, from the [[Cortes of Cadiz]], the Independence of Mexico and the [[Constitution of 1824]] had been repealed by the centralist regime and the dictatorship of Antonio López de Santa Anna. 
* [[Iglesias law]] or Rights Act and parochial perquisites: banned the collection of fees, parochial perquisites and tithe to the poor classes. It was drafted by [[José María Iglesias]] and promulgated April 11, 1857.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Ley Iglesias", vol. 3, p. 409. ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Comonfort's supporters, Juan José Baz, considered this law a provocation of the lower clergy who depended on such fees.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, "Reform Laws" p. 1240.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government of  Benito Juárez ===
* Nationalization Law Ecclesiastical Property: This law complements Law Lerdo confiscation of church property, with an important change: the goods no longer passed into the hands of rentiers. It was issued in Veracruz on July 12, 1859. The law makes explicit the connection between the national debt and disamortization, which early nineteenth-century liberal politicians and ideologues [[Lorenzo de Zavala]] and [[José María Luis Mora]] had written about. In fact, the church held more of its wealth in mortgages to private landowners than in property ownership itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, "Reform Laws", p. 1240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Knowlton, ''Church Property and the Liberal Reform, 1856-1910''. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Civil Marriage Act: was issued in Veracruz on July 23, 1859, through this law was established that the religious marriage had no official validity and established marriage as a civil contract with the State, eliminating the forcible intervention priests and collection thereof by the churches.
* Organic Law on Civil Registration: registration of civil status of persons was in charge of government employees and not the Church. births and deaths as a civil contract with the State declared. It was issued in Veracruz on July 28, 1859. 
* Decree of secularization of cemeteries declared the cessation of any intervention of the clergy in cemeteries and graveyards, was released in Veracruz on July 31, 1859.
* Decree suppression of religious holidays: by this decree declared the days that were to be taken as holidays, prohibiting official assistance to religious functions. 
* Law on freedom of religion: this law Catholicism ceased to be the only one allowed. This law allowed each person was free to practice and choose the cult wished also conducting ceremonies were banned outside churches or temples. It was issued in Veracruz on December 4, 1860. 
* Expulsion decree: by which the exile Luis Clementi apostolic delegate, Archbishop José Lázaro de la Garza y Ballesteros and Pedro Espinosa, bishops and Davalos and Pedro Moreno Barajas and ordered. It was released in Mexico City on January 21, 1861. 
* Decree of hospitals and charity: for which they were secularized these properties. It was released in Mexico City on February 2, 1861. 
* Decree of secularization of nuns and friars by which throughout the republic cloisters and monasteries decreeing the exit of religious men and women living there, with the exception of the Sisters of Charity died.

=== Government of [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] ===
* [[Act of September 25, 1874]]

== Reactions and consequences ==
Through the issuance of these laws and decrees Mexico was achieved in the separation of church and state. The new constitution polarized society, in December 1857 the Conservatives ignored the government and the new constitution by the [[Plan of Tacubaya]], which began the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]] or Three Years' War. Liberals achieved victory, on January 1, 1861, President Juárez returned to Mexico City. It is for this reason that several of the decrees and laws were issued in the port of Veracruz. But the country's stability was again interrupted, the government had to suspend payments on foreign debt. By the London Convention, the governments of France, Britain and Spain decided to intervene in Mexico. an agreement with the British and the Spanish, but not with the French, who with this pretext and with the help of conservatives began armed intervention and shortly after the Second Mexican Empire was achieved. Juarez was forced to flee the capital holding his itinerant government. It was possible to Restore the Republic

The probe passively monitors the [[E-carrier level 1|E1]]/[[Digital Signal 1|T1]] or [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]/[[SONET]] bearer channels, and extracts the signalling information for onward presentation to an application. A passive probe does not affect the network under observation--this is achieved through use of protected monitor points on the network [[distribution frame]]s.

[[Image:Snoezelruimte.JPG|thumb|Room for Snoezelen therapy in the home of a child with a developmental disability in the Netherlands]]

'''Snoezelen''' or '''controlled multisensory environment''' ('''MSE''') is a therapy for people with [[autism]] and other [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], [[dementia]] or [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]]. It consists of placing the person in a soothing and stimulating environment, called the "Snoezelen room". These rooms are specially designed to deliver stimuli to various [[senses]], using lighting effects, color, sounds, music, scents, etc. The combination of different materials on a wall may be explored using tactile senses, and the floor may be adjusted to stimulate the [[sense of balance]]. The person is usually accompanied by an aide or therapist.

Developed in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1970s, Snoezelen rooms have been established in institutions all over the world and are especially common in [[Germany]], where more than 1,200 exist.

There is no evidence that Snoezelen is effective for the treatment of dementia.&lt;ref name=Cochrane /&gt;
==Term==
The term "Snoezelen" (pronounced {{IPA|/ˈsnuzələ(n)/}}) is a [[neologism]] formed from a blend of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "snuffelen" (to snuggle, also: to sniff) and "doezelen" (to doze, to snooze). It was coined by Jan Hulsegge and Ad Verheul who developed the concept while working at [[De Hartenberg Institute]] in the Netherlands.

==Approach==
Ideally, Snoezelen is a non-directive therapy, controlled by the client and not by the therapist. It can be staged to provide a multi-sensory experience or single sensory focus, simply by adapting the lighting, atmosphere, sounds, and textures to the specific needs of the client at the time of use. There is no formal focus on therapeutic outcome—the focus is to assist users to gain the maximum pleasure from the activity in which they and the enabler are involved. An advantage of Snoezelen therapy is that it does not rely on verbal communication and may be beneficial for people with profound autism, as it may provide stimulation for those who would otherwise be almost impossible to reach.

Snoezelen therapy relates to the interdependence of both the space (the physical environment) and the "client-centered" approach of the practitioner (the human environment). The specially designed sensory physical environment together with the input of the "enabling practitioner" initiates changes in arousal by affecting the relaxation process, reducing anxiety/pain (both physical and emotional).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro et al., 1997; 2009a; 2009b; Fornes, Messbauer, Pagliano &amp; Verheul, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to maximize a person's potential to focus on his own free will and to engage on a motivational stimulus (object, activity or person), and thereby to improve communication and functioning.

The defining principles of the MSE help the practitioner to focus attention on the basic elements of this approach. The following are the principles.

# The experience takes place in a specific physical environment.
# The attitude of the practitioners is "client centered".
# Stimuli must be controlled according to the client's needs.
# The MSE is a medium for communication.
# The sensory environment is neither positive nor negative.
# The practitioner relies on the client's point of view. (Shapiro, 2010).

==Research==
Research on the benefits of Snoezelen treatment is scarce, with variable [[clinical study design|study designs]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;Chung JCC, Lai CKY. Snoezelen for dementia. ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2002, Issue '''4'''. Art. No.: [http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD003152/frame.html CD003152]. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD003152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancioni GE, Cuvo AJ, O'Reilly MF. Snoezelen: an overview of research with people with developmental disabilities and dementia. ''Disabil Rehabil.'' 2002; '''24''': 175-84. {{PMID|11926258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small research study carried out in Brussels compared the behavior of nine adult clients with profound autism in both classroom and Snoezelen settings. Though individual results varied, the study claimed a 50% reduction in distress and stereotypical behavior, and seventy-five percent less aggression and self-injury in the Snoezelen environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

This index captures theuman Development of the average person in society, which is less than when there is inequality in the distribution of health, education and income.]]

'''Social inequality''' occurs when resources in a given society are distributed unevenly, typically through [[Norm (social)|norms]] of allocation, that engender specific patterns along lines of socially defined categories of persons. It is the differentiation preference of access of social goods in the society brought about by power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and class. The social rights include labor market, the source of income, health care, and freedom of speech, education, political representation, and participation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Robert H.|title=The Piketty phenomenon and the future of inequality|journal=Real World Economics Review|date=2014|issue=69–7|pages=2–17|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue69/Wade69.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social inequality linked to [[economic inequality]], usually described on the basis of the [[income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] or [[wealth]], is a frequently studied type of social inequality. Though the disciplines of [[economics]] and [[sociology]] generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in [[researching]] this inequality. However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to [[social status]]. Norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[Power (social and political)|social power]], access to [[public goods]] such as [[education]] or the [[judiciary|judicial system]], adequate [[Housing inequality|housing]], [[transportation]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[financial services]] such as [[banking]] and other social [[Good (economics)|good]]s and services.

Many societies worldwide claim to be [[Meritocracy|meritocracies]]—that is, that their societies exclusively distribute resources on the basis of merit. The term "meritocracy" was coined by [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]] in his 1958 dystopian essay "[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]" to demonstrate the social dysfunctions that he anticipated arising in societies where the elites believe that they are successful entirely on the basis of merit, so the adoption of this term into English without negative connotations is ironic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|title=Down with meritocracy|last=Young|first=Michael|date=28 June 2001|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was concerned that the [[Tripartite System]] of education being practiced in the United Kingdom at the time he wrote the essay considered merit to be "intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors ... identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education" and that the "obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications" it supported would create an educated middle-class elite at the expense of the education of the working class, inevitably resulting in injustice and – eventually – revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todd|first=D. D.|date=1 December 1984|title=The Fontana Dictionary of Modern ThoughtBullockAllan and StallybrassOliver, editors London: Fontana/Collins, 1978.

Although merit matters to some degree in many societies, research shows that the distribution of resources in societies often follows hierarchical social categorizations of persons to a degree too significant to warrant calling these societies "meritocratic", since even exceptional intelligence, talent, or other forms of merit may not be compensatory for the social disadvantages people face. In many cases, social inequality is linked to [[#Racial and ethnic inequality|racial inequality]], [[ethnicity|ethnic inequality]], and [[gender inequality]], as well as other social statuses and these forms can be related to corruption.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=27 January 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common metric for comparing social inequality in different nations is the [[Gini coefficient]], which measures the concentration of wealth and income in a nation from 0 (evenly distributed wealth and income) to 1 (one person has all wealth and income). Two nations may have identical Gini coefficients but dramatically different economic ([[Gross domestic product|output]]) and/or [[quality of life]], so the Gini coefficient must be contextualized for meaningful comparisons to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2010/chapters|title=Reports {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Social inequality is found in almost every society. Social inequality is shaped by a range of structural factors, such as geographical location or citizenship status, and are often underpinned by cultural discourses and identities defining, for example, whether the poor are 'deserving' or 'undeserving'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Dimensions of Social Inequality|url = http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/research/socialinequality|website = www.ceelbas.ac.uk|accessdate = 22 September 2015|last = Walker|publisher = |first = Dr. Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simple societies, those that have few social roles and statuses occupied by its members, social inequality may be very low. In [[tribal]] societies, for example, a tribal head or chieftain may hold some privileges, use some tools, or wear marks of office to which others do not have access, but the daily life of the chieftain is very much like the daily life of any other tribal member. [[Anthropologist]]s identify such highly egalitarian cultures as "[[kinship]]-oriented", which appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with materially oriented cultures in which status and wealth are prized and competition and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures may actively work to prevent [[Dominance hierarchy|social hierarchies]] from developing because they believe that could lead to conflict and instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Rural Development | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Deji, Olanike F. | year=2011 | location=London | page=93 | isbn=978-3643901033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world, most of our population lives in more complex than simple societies. As [[social complexity]] increases, inequality tends to increase along with a widening gap between the poorest and the most wealthy members of society.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"/&gt;

Social inequality can be classified into egalitarian societies, ranked society, and stratified society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic inequality in the United States|last=Osberg|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarian societies are those communities advocating for social equality through equal opportunities and rights hence no discrimination. People with special skills were not viewed as superior compared to the rest. The leaders do not have the power they only have influence. The norms and the beliefs the egalitarian society holds are for sharing equally and equal participation. Simply there are no classes. Ranked society mostly is agricultural communities who hierarchically grouped from the chief who is viewed to have a status in the society. In this society, people are clustered regarding status and prestige and not by access to power and resources. The chief is the most influential person followed by his family and relative, and those further related to him are less ranked. Stratified society is societies which horizontally ranked into the upper class, middle class, and lower class. The classification is regarding wealth, power, and prestige. The upper class are mostly the leaders and are the most influential in the society. It's possible for a person in the society to move from one stratum to the other. The social status is also hereditable from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are five systems/types of social inequality which include wealth inequality, treatment and responsibility inequality, political inequality, life inequality, and membership inequality. Political inequality is the difference brought about by the ability to access federal resources which therefore have no civic equality. In treatment and responsibility difference some people are more benefited and can quickly receive more privileged than others. In working stations, some are given more responsibilities and hence better compensations and more benefits than the rest even when equally qualified. Membership inequality this is the number of members in a family, nation or of faith. Life inequality is brought about by the disparity of opportunities if presented they improves a person life quality. Finally, the income and wealth inequality is the disparity due to what an individual can earn on a daily basis contributing to their total revenue either monthly or yearly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The major examples of social inequality include income gap, gender inequality, health care, and social class. In health care, some individuals receive better and more professional care compared to others. They are also expected to pay more for these services. Social class differential comes evident during the public gathering where upper-class people given the best places to seat, the hospitality they receive and the first priorities they receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Status in society is of two types which are [[Ascribed status|ascribed characteristics]] and [[achieved status|achieved characteristics]]. Ascribed characteristics are those present at birth or assigned by others and over which an individual has little or no control. Examples include sex, skin colour, eye shape, place of birth, sexuality, gender identity, parentage and social status of parents. Achieved characteristics are those which we earn or choose; examples include level of education, marital status, leadership status and other measures of [[Meritocracy|merit]]. In most societies, an individual's social status is a combination of ascribed and achieved factors. In some societies, however, only ascribed statuses are considered in determining one's social status and there exists little to no [[social mobility]] and, therefore, few paths to more social equality.&lt;ref name="Sernau13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Inequality in a Global Age (4th edition)|publisher=Sage|year=2013|isbn=978-1452205403|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|author=Sernau, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social inequality is generally referred to as [[caste|caste inequality]].

One's social location in a society's overall structure of [[social stratification]] affects and is affected by almost every aspect of social life and one's [[life chances]].&lt;ref name="Neckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality: Causes and Consequences |author1=Neckerman, Kathryn M.  |author2=Florencia Torche  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Annual Review of Sociology | year=2007 | volume=33 | pages=335–357 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131755| jstor=29737766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single best [[Dependent and independent variables|predictor]] of an individual's future social status is the social status into which they were born. Theoretical approaches to explaining social inequality concentrate on questions about how such [[social differentiation]]s arise, what types of resources are being allocated (for example, reserves versus resources),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018-07-30|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; what are the roles of human [[cooperation]] and [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] in allocating resources, and how do these differing types and forms of inequality affect the overall functioning of a society?

The variables considered most important in explaining inequality and the manner in which those variables combine to produce the inequities and their social consequences in a given society can change across time and place. In addition to interest in comparing and contrasting social inequality at local and national levels, in the wake of today's [[globalization|globalizing]] processes, the most interesting question becomes: what does inequality look like on a worldwide scale and what does such global inequality bode for the future? In effect, globalization reduces the distances of time and space, producing a global interaction of cultures and societies and social roles that can increase global inequities.&lt;ref name="Sernau13" /&gt;

==Inequality and ideology==
Philosophical questions about social [[ethics]] and the desirability or inevitability of inequality in human societies have given rise to a spate of [[ideologies]] to address such questions.&lt;ref name="George90"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ideology and Social Welfare (2nd edition) | publisher=Routledge |author1=George, Victor  |author2=Paul Wilding  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1990 | isbn=978-0415051019}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can broadly classify these ideologies on the basis of whether they justify or [[Legitimation|legitimize]] inequality, casting it as desirable or inevitable, or whether they cast equality as desirable and inequality as a feature of society to be reduced or eliminated. One end of this ideological [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] can be called "[[Individualist]]", the other "[[Collectivism|Collectivist]]".&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; In Western societies, there is a long history associated with the idea of individual ownership of [[private property|property]] and [[economic liberalism]], the ideological belief in organizing the economy on individualist lines such that the greatest possible number of economic decisions are made by individuals and not by collective institutions or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political Ideology Today | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Adams, Ian | year=2001 | location=Manchester | isbn=978-0719060205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laissez-faire]], [[free market]] ideologies—including [[classical liberalism]], [[neoliberalism]], and [[libertarianism]]—are formed around the idea that social inequality is a "natural" feature of societies, is therefore inevitable and, in some philosophies, even desirable. Inequality provides for differing goods and services to be offered on the open [[Market (economics)|market]], spurs ambition, and provides incentive for industriousness and [[innovation]]. At the other end of the continuum, collectivists place little to no trust in "free market" economic systems, noting widespread lack of access among specific groups or classes of individuals to the costs of entry to the market. Widespread inequalities often lead to [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and dissatisfaction with the current social order. Such ideologies include [[Fabian society|Fabianism]] and [[socialism]]. Inequality, in these ideologies, must be reduced, eliminated, or kept under tight control through collective regulation.&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; Furthermore, in some views inequality is natural but shouldn't affect certain [[fundamental human needs]], [[human rights]] and the initial chances given to individuals (e.g. by [[education]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolnai|first1=Aurel|title=Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739100776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcFDFLcXLdkC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is out of proportions due to various problematic systemic structures.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Though the above discussion is limited to specific Western ideologies, it should be noted that similar thinking can be found, historically, in differing societies throughout the world. While, in general, eastern societies tend toward collectivism, elements of individualism and free market organization can be found in certain regions and historical eras. Classic Chinese society in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasties]], for example, while highly organized into tight hierarchies of [[horizontal inequality]] with a distinct power elite also had many elements of free trade among its various regions and subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia Buckley Anne Walthall, James Palais. (2006). ''East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social mobility]] is the movement along social strata or hierarchies by individuals, [[ethnic group]], or nations. There is a change in literacy, [[income distribution]], education and health status. The movement can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to change of jobs or marriage. Horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked. Intra-generational mobility is a social status change in a generation (single lifetime). For example, a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the [[senior management]]. The absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents, and this can be due to improved security, economic development, and better education system.  Relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climbing Mount Laurel: The struggle for affordable housing and social mobility in an American suburb|last=Massey, D.

Today, there is belief held by some that social inequality often creates political conflict and growing consensus that political structures determine the solution for such conflicts. Under this line of thinking, adequately designed social and political institutions are seen as ensuring the smooth functioning of [[Market (economics)|economic markets]] such that there is political stability, which improves the long-term outlook, enhances labour and capital productivity and so stimulates [[economic growth]]. With higher economic growth, net gains are positive across all levels and political reforms are easier to sustain. This may explain why, over time, in more egalitarian societies fiscal performance is better, stimulating greater accumulation of capital and higher growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/ira/wpaper/201405.html | title=Interrelation among Economic Growth, Income Inequality, and Fiscal Performance: Evidence from Anglo-Saxon Countries | publisher=Regional Quantitative Analysis Research Group | website=Research Institute of Applied Economics Working Paper 2014/05 | date=2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Davtyan, Karen | pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inequality and social class==
{{Main article|Social class}}

[[Socioeconomic status]] (SES) is a combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation. It is often used as synonymous with social class, a set of hierarchical social categories that indicate an individual's or household's relative position in a stratified matrix of social relationships. Social class is delineated by a number of variables, some of which change across time and place. For [[Karl Marx]], there exist two major social classes with significant inequality between the two. The two are delineated by their relationship to the [[means of production]] in a given society. Those two classes are defined as the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labour to the owners of the means of production. In capitalistic societies, the two classifications represent the opposing social interests of its members, capital gain for the capitalists and good wages for the labourers, creating [[social conflict]].

[[Max Weber]] uses social classes to examine wealth and status. For him, social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges. It may explain social reproduction, the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well. Such inequalities include differences in income, wealth, access to education, pension levels, social status, socioeconomic safety-net.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph. 2012. The Price of Inequality. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, social class can be defined as a large category of similarly ranked people located in a hierarchy and distinguished from other large categories in the hierarchy by such traits as occupation, education, income, and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Dennis. 2011: The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality, 8th ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], inequalities are often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[Working class|lower class]]. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. "upper middle").&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK-004p0J_EC | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of different classes have varied access to financial resources, which affects their placement in the [[social stratification]] system.&lt;ref name="Doob13"&gt;Doob, B. Christopher (2013). Social Inequality and [[Social Stratification]] in US Society (1st ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education. {{ISBN|0-205-79241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class,  race, and gender are forms of stratification that bring inequality and determines the difference in allocation of societal rewards. Occupation is the primary determinant of a person class since it affects their lifestyle, opportunities, culture, and kind of people one associates with. Class based families include the lower class who are the poor in the society. They have limited opportunities. Working class are those people in blue-collar jobs and usually, affects the economic level of a nation. The Middle classes are those who rely mostly on wives' employment and depends on credits from the bank and medical coverage. The upper middle class are professionals who are strong because of economic resources and supportive institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houkamau|first=C.A.|year=2015|title=Looking Māori predicts decreased rates of home ownership: Institutional racism in housing based on perceived appearance|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0118540|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118540|pmid=25738961|pmc=4349451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the upper class usually are the wealthy families who have economic power due to accumulative wealth from families but not and not hard earned income.

[[Social stratification]] is the hierarchical arrangement of society about social class, wealth, political influence. A society can be politically stratified based on authority and power,  economically stratified based on income level and wealth, occupational stratification about one's occupation. Some roles for examples doctors, engineers, lawyers are highly ranked, and thus they give orders while the rest receive the orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Structure of social stratification in the United States|last=Beeghley|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three systems of social stratification which are the caste system, estates system,  and class system. Castes system usually ascribed to children during birth whereby one receives the same stratification as of that of their parents. The caste system has been linked to religion and thus permanent. The stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person. Estate system is a state or society where people in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection. Communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords. The class system is about income inequality and socio-political status. People can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority. People are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions. Social stratification characteristics include its universal, social, ancient, it’s in diverse forms and also consequential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideological support for the Indian caste system: Social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and karma|last=Cotterill, S., Sidanius, J., Bhardwaj, A., &amp; Kumar, V.|publisher=Journal of Social and Political Psychology|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=98–116|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] variables most often used as an indicator of social inequality are [[income]] and [[wealth]]. In a given society, the distribution of individual or household accumulation of wealth tells us more about variation in [[well-being]] than does income, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Domhoff, G. William | year=2013 | page=288 | isbn=978-0078026713}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), especially ''per capita'' GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality at the [[International inequality|international]] or global level. A better measure at that level, however, is the [[Gini coefficient]], a [[Statistical dispersion#Measures of statistical dispersion|measure of statistical dispersion]] used to represent the distribution of a specific quantity, such as income or wealth, at a global level, among a nation's residents, or even within a metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Gini, C. (1936). "On the Measure of Concentration with Special Reference to Income and Statistics", Colorado College Publication, General Series No. 208, 73–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Other widely used measures of economic inequality are the percentage of people living with under US$1.25 or $2 a day and the share of national income held by the wealthiest 10% of the population, sometimes called "the Palma" measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Is It All About the Tails?

==Patterns of inequality==
There are a number of socially defined characteristics of individuals that contribute to social status and, therefore, equality or inequality within a society. When researchers use quantitative variables such as income or wealth to measure inequality, on an examination of the data, patterns are found that indicate these other social variables contribute to income or wealth as [[intervening variable]]s. Significant inequalities in income and wealth are found when specific socially defined categories of people are compared. Among the most pervasive of these variables are [[sex]]/[[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book | title="Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection" in Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Collins, Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say, in societies wherein merit is considered to be the primary factor determining one's place or rank in the social order, that merit has no effect on variations in income or wealth. It is to say that these other socially defined characteristics can, and often do, intervene in the [[Value theory|valuation]] of merit.

===Gender inequality===
Gender as a social inequality is whereby women and men are treated differently due to masculinity and femininity by dividing labor, assigning roles, and responsibilities and allocating social rewards. Sex- and gender-based [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], called [[sexism]], are major contributing factors to social inequality. Most societies, even [[agrarian society|agricultural ones]], have some [[sexual division of labour]] and [[Occupational segregation#Gendered division of labour|gender-based division of labour]] tends to increase during industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New Family Values: Liberty, Equality, Diversity | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Struening, Karen | year=2002 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7425-1231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on gender inequality is born out of the deepening division in the [[Gender role|roles]] assigned to men and women, particularly in the economic, political and educational spheres. Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes in most states in both the [[Global North]] and Global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html |title=About us |publisher=Un.org |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination, especially concerning the lower social status of women, has been a topic of serious discussion not only within academic and activist communities but also by governmental agencies and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]]. These discussions seek to identify and remedy widespread, institutionalized barriers to access for women in their societies. By making use of [[gender analysis]], researchers try to understand the social expectations, responsibilities, resources and priorities of women and men within a specific context, examining the social, economic and environmental factors which influence their roles and decision-making capacity. By enforcing artificial separations between the social and economic roles of men and women, the lives of women and girls are negatively impacted and this can have the effect of limiting social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Issac Kwaka Acheampong  |author2=Sidharta Sarkar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gender, Poverty &amp; Sustainable Livelihood|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural ideals about [[women's work]] can also affect men whose outward [[gender expression]] is considered "feminine" within a given society. [[Transgender]] and [[gender-variant]] persons may express their gender through their appearance, the statements they make, or official documents they present. In this context, gender normativity, which is understood as the social expectations placed on us when we present particular bodies, produces widespread cultural/institutional devaluations of trans identities, homosexuality and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=" Fugitive flesh: Gender self-determination, queer abolition, and trans resistance" in E.

A variety of [[global issue]]s like [[HIV/AIDS]], illiteracy, and [[poverty]] are often seen as "women's issues" since women are disproportionately affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empowering Women as Key Change Agents|url=http://www.thp.org/what_we_do/program_overview/empowering_women?gclid=CIPt9L6X6KsCFUJ76wodFhJUKw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331234727/http://www.thp.org/what_we_do/program_overview/empowering_women?gclid=CIPt9L6X6KsCFUJ76wodFhJUKw|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, women and girls face problems such as lack of access to education, which limit their opportunities to succeed, and further limits their ability to contribute economically to their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/poverty.htm|website=United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes throughout most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting the Needs of the World's Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, around 20 percent of women were below the $1.25/day international poverty line and 40 percent below the $2/day mark.

Women's participation in work has been increasing globally, but women are still faced with wage discrepancies and differences compared to what men earn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Poverty &amp; Economics|url=http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true globally even in the agricultural and rural sector in developed as well as developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN: Gender discrimination accounts for 90% of wage gap between men and women|url=http://pressroom.ipc-undp.org/2011/un-gender-discrimination-accounts-for-90-of-wage-gap-between-men-and-women/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403022719/http://pressroom.ipc-undp.org/2011/un-gender-discrimination-accounts-for-90-of-wage-gap-between-men-and-women/|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural impediments to women's ability to pursue and advance in their chosen professions often result in a phenomenon known as the [[glass ceiling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glass Ceiling Effect|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/papers/CotterHOV01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to unseen - and often unacknowledged barriers that prevent minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements. This effect can be seen in the corporate and bureaucratic environments of many countries, lowering the chances of women to excel. It prevents women from succeeding and making the maximum use of their potential, which is at a cost for women as well as the society's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janet Henshall Momsen|title=Gender and Development|year=2004|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring that [[women's rights]] are protected and endorsed can promote a sense of belonging that motivates women to contribute to their society.

Women and persons whose gender identity does not conform to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] beliefs about sex (only male and female) continue to face violence on global domestic, interpersonal, institutional and administrative scales. While first-wave [[Liberal feminism|Liberal Feminist]] initiatives raised awareness about the lack of fundamental rights and freedoms that women have access to, second-wave feminism (see also [[Radical Feminism]]) highlighted the structural forces that underlie gender-based violence. [[Masculinities]] are generally constructed so as to subordinate femininities and other expressions of gender that are not heterosexual, assertive and dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connel|first=R.W.|title=Masculinities|year=1995 |origyear=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520246980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender sociologist and author, [[Raewyn Connell]], discusses in her 2009 book, Gender, how masculinity is dangerous, heterosexual, violent and authoritative. These structures of masculinity ultimately contribute to the vast amounts of gendered violence, marginalization and suppression that women, queer, transgender, gender variant and gender non-conforming persons face. 
Some scholars suggest that women's underrepresentation in political systems speaks the idea that "formal citizenship does not always imply full social membership".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 1993 p.504&lt;/ref&gt; Men, male bodies and expressions of masculinity are linked to ideas about work and citizenship. Others point out that patriarchal states tend top scale and claw back their social policies relative to the disadvantage of women.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This process ensures that women encounter resistance into meaningful positions of power in institutions, administrations, and political systems and communities.

===Racial and ethnic inequality===
Racial or ethnic inequality is the result of hierarchical social distinctions between racial and ethnic categories within a society and often established based on characteristics such as skin color and other physical characteristics or an individual's place of origin or culture. Racism is whereby some races are more privileged and are allowed to venture into the labor market and are better compensated than others. Ethnicity is the privilege one enjoys for belonging to a particular ethnic group. Even though race has no biological connection, it has become a socially constructed category capable of restricting or enabling social status.

Racial inequality can also result in diminished opportunities for members of [[marginalized]] groups, which in turn can lead to [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]] and political marginalization. Racial and [[Ethnic group|ethnic categories]] become a [[Minority group|minority category]] in a society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], exclusion, [[oppression]], [[exile|expulsion]], and [[genocide|extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination | publisher=Springer | author=Henrard, Kristen | year=2000 | location=New York | isbn=978-9041113597}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the run-up to the 2012 federal elections in the United States, legislation in certain "[[battleground states]]" that claimed to target voter fraud had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of primarily African American voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=R.

In the United States, [[Angela Davis]] argues that [[Incarceration in the United States|mass incarceration]] has been a modern tool of the state to [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|impose inequality, repression, and discrimination]] upon African American and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|title=Abolition Democracy: Beyond Prisons, Torture, and Empire|publisher=Seven Stories|isbn=978-1583226957|page=160|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[War on Drugs]] has been a campaign with disparate effects, ensuring the constant incarceration of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized populations in North America. Over a million African Americans are incarcerated in the US, many of whom have been convicted of a non-violent drug possession charge.{{cn|date=November 2017}} With the States of Colorado and Washington having legalized the possession of marijuana, drug reformists and anti-war on drugs lobbyists are hopeful that drug issues will be interpreted and dealt with from a healthcare perspective instead of a matter of criminal law. In Canada, Aboriginal, First Nations, and Indigenous persons represent over a quarter of the federal prison population, even though they only represent 3% of the country's population.

===Age inequality===
[[Age discrimination]] is defined as the unfair treatment of people with regard to promotions, recruitment, resources, or privileges because of their age. It is also known as [[ageism]]: the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age. It is a set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, and values used to justify age-based prejudice, discrimination, and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, George R.; Katsiaficas, George N.; Kirkpatrick, Robert George; Mary Lou Emery (1987). Introduction to critical sociology. Ardent Media. p. 261. {{ISBN|978-0-8290-1595-9}}. Retrieved 28 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One form of ageism is [[adultism]], which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) Conspiracy of the Young. Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment, restaurant, or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all. While some people may benefit or enjoy these practices, some find them offensive and discriminatory. Discrimination against those under the age of 40 however is not illegal under the current U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm | title=Age Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As implied in the definitions above, treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination. Virtually every society has [[Age stratification|age-stratification]], meaning that the age structure in a society changes as people begin to live longer and the [[Population ageing|population becomes older]]. In most cultures, there are different social role expectations for people of different ages to perform. Every society manages people's ageing by allocating certain roles for different age groups. Age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less resources. Scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities. For instance, because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens, modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle-aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired (especially those already disadvantaged by income/wealth inequality).&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"&gt;{{cite book | title=Age Discrimination and Diversity Multiple Discrimination from an Age Perspective | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Sargeant, Malcolm (ed.) | year=2011 | isbn=978-1107003774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern, technologically advanced societies, there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged. However, more recently, in the United States the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged. For example, [[Poverty in the United States|poverty levels in the U.S.]] have been decreasing among people aged 65 and older since the early 1970s whereas the number children under 18 in poverty has steadily risen.&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"/&gt; Sometimes, the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives, younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere. The larger contributor to this, however is the increase in the number of people over 65 receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits in the U.S.

When we compare income distribution among youth across the globe, we find that about half (48.5 percent) of the world's young people are confined to the bottom two income brackets as of 2007. This means that, out of the three billion persons under the age of 24 in the world as of 2007, approximately 1.5 billion were living in situations in which they and their families had access to just nine percent of global income. Moving up the income distribution ladder, children and youth do not fare much better: more than two-thirds of the world's youth have access to less than 20 percent of global wealth, with 86 percent of all young people living on about one-third of world income. For the just over 400 million youth who are fortunate enough to rank among families or situations at the top of the income distribution, however, opportunities improve greatly with more than 60 percent of global income within their reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/index_58230.html | title=Global inequality:  Beyond the bottom billion | publisher=UNICEF | website=UNICEF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY WORKING PAPER | date=April 2011 | accessdate=9 July 2014 |author1=Ortiz, Isabel  |author2=Matthew Cummins |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination, in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment. Indeed, non-participation in the labour force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age. On the one hand, the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce: At the same time, old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige. Old age may benefit one in such positions, but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotyping of old people. On the other hand, young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs, because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education. Typically, once they enter the labour force or take a part-time job while in school, they start at entry level positions with low level wages. Furthermore, because of their lack of prior work experience, they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs, where they can be taken advantage of by their employers. As a result, many older people have to face obstacles in their lives.

===Inequalities in health===
{{further information|Health equity|Inequality in disease|Social determinants of health in poverty|Diseases of poverty}}
Health inequalities can be defined as differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Health Impact Assessment: Glossary of Terms Used|url=http://www.who.int/hia/about/glos/en/index1.html|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health care====
Health inequalities are in many cases related to access to health care. In [[industrialized nations]], health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a [[universal health care]] system, such as the United States. Because the US health care system is heavily privatized, access to health care is dependent upon one's [[economic capital]]; Health care is not a right, it is a commodity that can be purchased through private insurance companies (or that is sometimes provided through an employer). The way health care is organized in the U.S. contributes to health inequalities based on gender, [[socioeconomic status]] and race/ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric R.|author2=Perry, Brea L. |title=Medical Sociology and Health Services Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Policy Challenges|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2010|pages=107–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wright and Perry assert, "social status differences in health care are a primary mechanism of health inequalities". In the United States, over 48 million people are without medical care coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Census|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/incpovhlth/2011/highlights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that almost one sixth of the population is without health insurance, mostly people belonging to the lower classes of society.

While universal access to health care may not completely eliminate health inequalities,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=I.|last2=Gaspoz|first2=J.M.|last3=Theler|first3=J.M.|last4=Wolff|first4=H.|date=2012-11|title=High prevalence of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in Switzerland: A population-based study in a region with universal health insurance coverage|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=55|issue=5|pages=521–527|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.08.005|pmid=22940614|issn=0091-7435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=Idris|last2=Luthi|first2=Jean-Christophe|last3=Bowling|first3=Christopher Barrett|last4=Theler|first4=Jean-Marc|last5=Paccaud|first5=Fred|last6=Gaspoz|first6=Jean-Michel|last7=McClellan|first7=William|date=2014|title=Prevalence of Frailty Indicators and Association with Socioeconomic Status in Middle-Aged and Older Adults in a Swiss Region with Universal Health Insurance Coverage: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Journal of Aging Research|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2014/198603|issn=2090-2204|pmc=4227447|pmid=25405033}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that it greatly reduces them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veugeulers|first=P|author2=Yip, A. |title=Socioeconomic Disparities in Health Care Use: Does Universal Coverage Reduce Inequalities in Health?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|year=2003|volume=57|issue=6|pages=107–119|doi=10.1136/jech.57.6.424|pmid=12775787|pmc=1732477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, privatization gives individuals the 'power' to purchase their own health care (through private health insurance companies), but this leads to social inequality by only allowing people who have economic resources to access health care. Citizens are seen as consumers who have a 'choice' to buy the best health care they can afford; in alignment with neoliberal ideology, this puts the burden on the individual rather than the government or the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|title=The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care, and Retirement - and How You Can Fight Back|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries that have a universal health care system, health inequalities have been reduced. In Canada, for example, equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. People don't have to worry about how they will pay health care, or rely on emergency rooms for care, since health care is provided for the entire population. However, inequality issues still remain. For example, not everyone has the same level of access to services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Karen R.|title=Health and Health Care in Essentials of Contemporary Sociology|year=1994|publisher=Copp Clark Longman|location=Toronto|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inequalities in health are not, however, only related to access to health care. Even if everyone had the same level of access, inequalities may still remain. This is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them. While Medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services, which improved the health of low status people, inequities in health are still prevalent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=K.R.|title=The Inverse Care Law in Canada: Differential Access Under Universal Free Health Insurance|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=Toronto|pages=118–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the state of the current social system, which bear other types of inequalities such as economic, racial and gender inequality.

A lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world, where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at. Health equity is needed in order to live a healthier and more sufficient life within society. Inequalities in health lead to substantial effects, that is burdensome or the entire society. Inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care. Health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal. For example, in Indonesia in 1990, only 12% of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20% of households, while the wealthiest 20% consumed 29% of the government subsidy in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well, as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it. A study by Makinen et al. (2000) found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at, there was an upward trend by [[Quantile|quintile]] in health care use for those reporting illness. Wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt | title=Inequalities in Health Care Use and Expenditures: Empirical Data from Eight Developing Countries and Countries in Transition | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume=78 | issue=1 | pages=55–65 | date=January 2000 | last=Mankinen, M.| doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000000100006| pmid=10686733 | pmc=2560608 |display-authors=etal| doi-broken-date=2018-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food====
There has been considerable research in recent years regarding a phenomenon known as [[food desert]]s, in which low access to fresh, healthy food in a neighborhood leads to poor consumer choices and options regarding diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Defines Food Deserts|url=http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts|website=American Nutrition Association|publisher=American Nutrition Association|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that food deserts are significant contributors to the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States and many other countries.

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. This was represented by a type of [[North–South divide]] that existed after [[World War II]] between [[First world]], more [[developed country|developed]], [[industrialized]], wealthy countries and [[Third world]] countries, primarily as measured by GDP. From around 1980, however, through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are numerous limitations of GDP as an economic indicator of social "well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neweconomyworkinggroup.org/visions/living-wealth-indicators/gdp-flawed-measure-progress | title=GDP: A Flawed Measure of Progress | publisher=New Economy Working Group | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, over time, after [[World War II]] the global Gini coefficient sat at just under .45. Between around 1959 to 1966, the global Gini increased sharply, to a peak of around .48 in 1966. After falling and leveling off a couple of times during a period from around 1967 to 1984, the Gini began to climb again in the mid-eighties until reaching a high or around .54 in 2000 then jumped again to around .70 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Two Faces of Globalization | author=Bronko, Milanovic | journal=World Development | year=2003 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=667–683 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(03)00002-0| citeseerx=10.1.1.454.7785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed— between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country of citizenship (an [[ascribed status]] characteristic) explains 60% of variability in global income; citizenship and parental income class (both ascribed status characteristics) combined explain more than 80% of income variability.&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011" /&gt;

==Inequality and economic growth==
[[File:Berg Ostry 2011 Chart 4.gif|thumb|left|Of the factors influencing the duration of [[economic growth]] in both developed and developing countries, [[Economic inequality|income equality]] has a more beneficial impact than trade openness, sound political institutions, and foreign investment.&lt;ref name=BergOstryEE&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Berg |first= Andrew G. |last2= Ostry |first2= Jonathan D. |year= 2011 |title= Equality and Efficiency |journal= Finance and Development |volume= 48 |issue= 3 |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm |accessdate= 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The concept of [[economic growth]] is fundamental in [[capitalist]] economies. [[Productivity]] must grow as population grows and capital must grow to feed into increased productivity. Investment of capital leads to [[returns on investment]] (ROI) and increased [[capital accumulation]]. The hypothesis that economic inequality is a necessary precondition for economic growth has been a mainstay of liberal economic theory. Recent research, particularly over the first two decades of the 21st century, has called this basic assumption into question.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt; While growing inequality does have a positive correlation with economic growth under specific sets of conditions, inequality in general is not positively correlated with economic growth and, under some conditions, shows a negative correlation with economic growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ub.edu/histeco/pdf/milanovic.pdf | title=Global income inequality: the past two centuries and implications for 21st century | publisher=World Bank | date=Autumn 2011 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Milanovic, Branko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostry2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41291 | title=Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth | publisher=International Monetary Fund | date=April 2014 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Ostry, Jonathan D. and Andrew Berg, Charalambos G. Tsangarides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milanovic (2011) points out that overall, global inequality between countries is more important to growth of the world economy than inequality within countries.&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011" /&gt; While global economic growth may be a policy priority, recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective. The recent [[financial crisis]] and [[global recession]] hit countries and shook [[Global financial system|financial systems all over the world]]. This led to the implementation of large-scale fiscal expansionary interventions and, as a result, to massive public debt issuance in some countries. Governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries. Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt; Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth in the case of the UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;

Following the results of Alesina and Rodrick (1994), Bourguignon (2004), and Birdsall (2005) show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth |author1=Alesina, A.  |author2=D.

For 131 countries for which they could estimate the change in Gini index values between 1990 and 2008, they find that those countries that increased levels of inequality experienced slower annual per capita GDP growth over the same time period. Noting a lack of data for national wealth, they build an index using ''[[Forbes]]'' list of billionaires by country normalized by GDP and validated through correlation with a Gini coefficient for wealth and the share of wealth going to the top decile. They find that many countries generating low rates of economic growth are also characterized by a high level of wealth inequality with wealth concentration among a class of entrenched elites. They conclude that extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth globally, regionally and nationally, coupled with the negative effects of higher levels of income disparities, should make us question current economic development approaches and examine the need to place equity at the center of the development agenda.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;

Ostry, et al. (2014) reject the hypothesis that there is a major trade-off between a reduction of income inequality (through [[Redistribution (economics)|income redistribution]]) and economic growth. If that were the case, they hold, then redistribution that reduces income inequality would on average be bad for growth, taking into account both the direct effect of higher redistribution and the effect of the resulting lower inequality. Their research shows rather the opposite: increasing income inequality always has a significant and, in most cases, negative effect on economic growth while redistribution has an overall pro-growth effect (in one sample) or no growth effect. Their conclusion is that increasing inequality, particularly when inequality is already high, results in low growth, if any, and such growth may be unsustainable over long periods.

Piketty and Saez (2014) note that there are important differences between income and wealth inequality dynamics. First, wealth concentration is always much higher than income concentration. The top 10 percent of wealth share typically falls in the 60 to 90 percent range of all wealth, whereas the top 10 percent income share is in the 30 to 50 percent range. The bottom 50 percent wealth share is always less than 5 percent, whereas the bottom 50 percent income share generally falls in the 20 to 30 percent range. The bottom half of the population hardly owns any wealth, but it does earn appreciable income:The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. On average, members of the bottom half of the population, in terms of wealth, own less than one-tenth of the average wealth. The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. Members of the bottom half of the population in income earn about half the average income. In sum, the concentration of capital ownership is always extreme, so that the very notion of capital is fairly abstract for large segments—if not the majority—of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality in the long run | journal=Science | year=2014 | volume=344 | issue=6186 | pages=838–43 | doi=10.1126/science.1251936 | pmid=24855258 | last1 = Piketty | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piketty (2014) finds that wealth-income ratios, today, seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the "classic patrimonial" wealth-based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living. He surmises that wealth accumulation is high because growth is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Capital in the 21st century | publisher=Belknap Press | author=Piketty, Thomas | year=2014 | isbn=978-0674430006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's fear of crime''' refers to women's fear of being a victim of crime, independent of actual [[Victimisation|victimization]]. Although [[fear of crime]] is a concern for people of all genders, studies consistently find that women around the world tend to have much higher levels of fear of crime than men, despite the fact that in many places, and for most offenses, men's actual victimization rates are higher.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanko|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1995|title=Women, Crime, and Fear|jstor=1048395|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=539|pages=46–58|doi=10.1177/0002716295539001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4422-0970-1|location=Lanham, MD|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of crime is related to perceived risk of victimization, but is not the same; fear of crime may be generalized instead of referring to specific offenses, and perceived risk may also be considered a demographic factor that contributes to fear of crime. Women tend to have higher levels for both perceived risk and fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snedker|first=Karen A.|date=2015|title=Neighborhood Conditions and Fear of Crime A Reconsideration of Sex Differences|url=http://cad.sagepub.com/content/61/1/45|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1177/0011128710389587|issn=0011-1287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addington|first=Lynn A.|title=Fear of Crime and Perceived Risk|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396607-0051|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396607-0051|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In women's everyday lives, fear of crime can have negative effects, such as reducing their environmental mobility. Studies have shown that women tend to avoid certain behaviors, such as walking alone at night, because they are fearful of crime, and would feel more comfortable with these behaviors if they felt safer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=Carl|date=1998|title=Evaluating the Influence of Fear of Crime as an Environmental Mobility Restrictor on Women's Routine Activities|url=http://eab.sagepub.com/content/30/1/60|journal=Environment and Behavior|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–74|doi=10.1177/0013916598301003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories on women's fear of crime ==
Social scientists have differing views on the causes of women's fear of crime. Some have argued that women's heightened fear of crime is due to women's higher levels physical vulnerability compared to men, although [[Feminism|feminist]] work generally resists this generalization and often tries to relocate the cause to larger societal factors.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coping with Crime: Individual and Neighborhood Reactions|last=Skogan|first=Wesley G.|last2=Maxfield|first2=Michael G.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1981|isbn=0-8039-1632-9|series=Sage Library of Social Research 124|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nonetheless important that most women are aware of pervasive cultural view that women are more vulnerable than men, which may make them think they are more likely to be victimized and therefore contribute to their fear; in this way, it would be perceived vulnerability and not actual vulnerability that is the cause of women's fear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some research has also suggested that women are in fact not much more fearful about crime than men, but that dominant cultural ideas about masculinity may make men reluctant to talk about their fear or report it in surveys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilchrist|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bannister|first2=Jon|last3=Ditton|first3=Jason|last4=Farrall|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Women and the 'fear of crime': challenging the accepted stereotype|url=|journal=British Journal of Criminology|issue=38.2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Theory ===
Feminist discourse on fear of crime tends to explain women's higher levels of fear with the [[Patriarchy|unequal gender structure]] in most societies, which places women beneath men within the power structure and thus puts them especially at risk for victimization by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This theory refers to the oppressive [[social control]] of women, arguing that some crimes against women (such as rape) and the socialization that women receive to feel vulnerable and fear male violence are used by the patriarchy to assert male dominance and "keep women in their place."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Rape and fear of crime ==
As rape is by far the most gendered crime by victimization, some feminist scholars have suggested that fear of rape is the most important and most unique element of women's fear of crime, or even that women's fear of crime is in fact a generalized fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warr|first=Mark|date=1984|title=Fear of Victimisation: Why Are Women and the Elderly More Afraid?|url=|journal=Social Science Quarterly|issue=65|pages=681–702|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Fear|last=Gordon|first=Margaret T.|last2=Riger|first2=Stephanie|publisher=The Free Press|year=1989|isbn=0-02-912490-5|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this theory, often referred to as the "shadow of sexual assault hypothesis," often note that women tend to fear that rape will co-occur with other crimes, such as burglary, a fear that is not found among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kenneth F.|date=1996|title=Women's fear of victimization: shadow of sexual assault?|url=|journal=Social Forces|issue=2|doi=10.1093/sf/75.2.667|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chui|first=Wing Hong|last2=Cheng|first2=Kevin Kwok-Yin|last3=Wong|first3=Lok-Ping|date=2013|title=Gender, Fear of Crime, and Attitudes Toward Prisoners Among Social Work Majors in a Hong Kong University|url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/57/4/479|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|language=|volume=57|issue=4|pages=479–494|doi=10.1177/0306624X12436524|issn=0306-624X|pmid=22334610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of the theory also note that sexual harassment, which most women will experience in their lifetimes, especially contributes to the fear of rape; in some cases, women's rejection of unwanted sexual advances leads to threats, and even "benevolent" harassment may increase women's wariness and fear of men in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The fear of rape, unlike other fears of specific crimes, is almost exclusive to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Among women, it is also one of the strongest crime-related fears, and is the strongest crime-related fear for young women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Levels of fear of rape vary among women by age, race/ethnicity, residential area, and other factors, but are especially high for women who have been victims of rape in the past or know victims personally (the latter group may include a significant portion of women, with one study estimating that over half of women know rape victims).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The fear of rape may also be related to the fear of murder, as women tend to overestimate the proportion of rape victims who are murdered during their attacks. Stigma and blame are also factors: what many feminists refer to as the "[[rape myth]]," the popular idea that women can be blamed for their rape and that women are responsible for preventing rape by the regulation of their behavior, often serves to support the fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Demographic differences in women's fear of crime ==
Although women as a whole demographic are more fearful of crime, specific subgroups of women may have higher levels of fear or be more likely to change their behavior because of it. In many studies, the demographics found to have the highest generalized fear of crime are single, older, urban, women of color, and of lower socioeconomic class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For fear of victimization for specific crimes, the demographics with the highest levels of fear may be different.

=== Geography ===
Generally, research has demonstrated that women from urban areas have higher levels of fear of crime. Even within cities, fear levels may differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Increased social disorganization in the neighborhood (as measured by homelessness, drug sales, vandalism, prostitution, etc.) and higher rates of neighborhood serious crime lead to higher levels of fear of crime for both men and women, but both factors have a stronger effect on women's fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Urban and rural communities tend to have very different levels of fear of crime. Rural areas are almost always perceived by residents and outsiders as safer, so it is often assumed that fear of crime levels will be lower there. Still, 2005 research in New Zealand and the United Kingdom noted that fear of crime levels in rural areas is on the rise, and found that sources of fear of crime among rural women often include perceived encroachment of urban influence (through people or attitudes) into their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Jo|last2=Panelli|first2=Ruth|last3=Kraack|first3=Anna|date=2005|title=Women's fear of crime: A rural perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074301670500015X|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=21|issue=2|pages=151–163|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
Theorists have suggested that Black and Latina women, and women of color in general, in the United States may have higher rates of fear of crime due to increased [[social vulnerability]]; because of institutional racism and sexism against women of color, their identities may put them at greater risk of victimization, leading to higher levels of fear.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Solutions to women's fear of crime ==
In general, proposed solutions to women's fear of crime either place the responsibility on individual women (through preventive strategies) or on official agencies (through infrastructure improvements, anti-rape education, more involved policing, etc.), and are often framed as a combination of both.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickey|first=Georgina|date=2011|title=From Civility to Self-Defense: Modern Advice to Women on the Privileges and Dangers of Public Space|jstor=41290280|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=39|issue=1/2|pages=77–94|doi=10.1353/wsq.2011.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those that expect women to protect themselves from crime, most focus on the dangers for women in public spaces; however, as women usually face their highest rates of victimization in the home or at the hands of known people, these campaigns have been suggested to be particularly ill-equipped to help solve the problem of women's high fear of crime, and to support an untrue picture of women's victimization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the most common individual strategies for dealing with fear of crime and preventing victimization is simple avoidance, the attempt to stay away from areas (such as dark alleys or public transportation) where it is believed victimization is likely to occur; research has found that women employ avoidance strategies more often than men do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Avoided areas may include neighborhoods with high crime rates, but for many women also include any unfamiliar areas. Women may also employ other isolation strategies by avoiding social interaction with strangers, ignoring them or moving quickly and with purpose to discourage interaction&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nothing Bad Happens to Good Girls: Fear of Crime in Women's Lives|last=Madriz|first=Esther|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-20855-2|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common method of allaying fear of crime among women is by "crime-proofing" homes or possessions. Popular examples include home security systems, locking away valuables, or participating in [[Neighborhood watch|neighborhood watch programs]]. These strategies are used by people of all genders, but some are more often employed by women. For example, many women in an American study reported choosing purses with zippers or holding purses protectively to defend against [[theft]] and purse-snatching.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As interest in women's safety and women's fear of crime has increased, so has interest in precautionary strategies; for example, in the past few decades, women's [[self-defense]] classes, books, and other self-defense instruction have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some women also choose to carry weapons, such as knives or guns, or repellents like [[pepper spray]] and [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] to ward off potential attackers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist commentators usually take the view that the responsibility for reducing women's fear of crime lies with the society, and that fear must be combatted at its source by addressing men's violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Women's fear of crime around the world ==
Although most research on women's fear of crime has been done in English-speaking countries, with the most done in the United States, similar trends in women's fear of crime have been found around the world.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakus|first=Onder|last2=McGarrell|first2=Edmund F.|last3=Basibuyuk|first3=Oguzhan|date=2010|title=Fear of crime among citizens of Turkey|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235210000267|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=174–184|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
A 2014 study using data from 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa concluded that fear of crime has a stronger negative effect on women's subjective well-being compared to men's, with subjective wellbeing defined as self-reported satisfaction with life. In the study, fear of crime had a statistically significant correlation with subjective wellbeing for females, but no significant correlation for males, suggesting that for the men in the study, fear of crime was not an important factor in determining their happiness and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulemana|first=Iddisah|date=2014|title=The Effect of Fear of Crime and Crime Victimization on Subjective Well-Being in Africa|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|journal=Social Indicators Research|language=en|volume=121|issue=3|pages=849–872|doi=10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|issn=0303-8300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
A 2013 study of Hong Kong social work students found significant gender differences in fear of crime levels. Consistent with the shadow of sexual assault hypothesis, the study found that the women had the highest levels of fear for rape, and that fear of rape was a predictor for fear of other crimes. Hong Kong has one of the lowest rates of crime and victimization in the world, so this study may suggest that the presence and size of gender differences in fear of crime are not strongly correlated with total crime and victimization rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
A 1998 study in Glasgow, Scotland, found a gender disparity in fear of crime levels smaller than what is generally accepted. The study also found that men and women with similar fear levels tended to use similar reasoning to explain their fear of crime or lack of fear, although men's and women's fear appeared in different situations (men tended to be more often fearful about property crime, whereas women were more fearful about violent crime).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Middle East ===
A 2010 Turkish study using a large nationwide sample confirmed that women expressed significantly higher levels of fear of crime than men. The study also found that previous victimization, a consistent predictor for higher levels of fear in women, was present at close to equal rates in the male and female samples, suggesting that prior victimization has a stronger effect on women's fear of crime than on men's. Also, if the study's sample is representative of the Turkish population, women have slightly higher victimization rates than men, and so their fear does not reflect the "gender-fear paradox" of victimization found in many other developed countries.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In the [[foreign exchange market]] and [[international finance]], a '''world currency''', '''supranational currency''', or '''global currency''' is a [[currency]] that is transacted internationally, with no set borders.

==Historical and current world==

===Spanish dollar (17th – 18th centuries)===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the use of silver [[Spanish dollar]]s or "pieces of eight" spread from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish territories in the Americas]] westwards to [[Asia]] and eastwards to [[Europe]], forming the first worldwide currency.&lt;ref name="Woodcock2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Woodcock|title=Globalization from Genesis to Geneva: A Confluence of Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_75TAjONToC|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4251-8853-5|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas J. Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvA3jL4CFCMC|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=29 November 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's political supremacy on the world stage, the importance of Spanish commercial routes across the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Pacific]], and the coin's quality and purity of silver helped it become internationally accepted for over two centuries. It was legal tender in [[Spain]]'s Pacific territories of the [[Philippines]], [[Micronesia]], [[Guam]] and the [[Caroline Islands]] and later in [[China]] and other [[Southeast Asian]] countries until the mid-19th century. In the [[Americas]] it was legal tender in all of [[Latin America|South and Central America]] (except [[Brazil]]) and in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] until the mid-19th century. In Europe the Spanish dollar was legal tender in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in most of [[Italy]] including: [[Milan]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], Sicily, [[Sardinia]], the [[Franche-Comté]] ([[France]]), and in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. It was also used in other European states including the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]] territories.

===Gold standard (19th – 20th centuries)===
{{unsourced-section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Gold standard}}
Prior to and during most of the 19th century, international trade was denominated in terms of currencies that represented weights of gold. Most national currencies at the time were in essence merely different ways of measuring gold weights (much as the yard and the meter both measure length and are related by a constant conversion factor). Hence some assert that gold was the world's first global currency. The emerging collapse of the international gold standard around the time of World War I had significant implications for global trade.

===Pound sterling===
Before 1944, the world reference currency was the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[pound sterling]]. The transition between pound sterling and United States dollar and its impact for central banks was described recently.&lt;ref&gt; "[http://cneh09.dal.ca/Schenk_CNEH.pdf The Retirement of Sterling as a Reserve Currency after 1945: Lessons for the US Dollar ?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709043223/http://cneh09.dal.ca/Schenk_CNEH.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}", Catherine R.

In the period following the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, [[exchange rate]]s around the world were [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the [[United States dollar]], which could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold. This reinforced the dominance of the US dollar as a global currency.

Since the collapse of the [[fixed exchange rate]] regime and the [[gold standard]] and the institution of [[floating exchange rate]]s following the [[Smithsonian Agreement]] in 1971, most currencies around the world have no longer been pegged to the United States dollar. However, as the United States has the world's largest economy, most international transactions continue to be conducted with the United States dollar, and it has remained the ''de facto'' world currency. According to [[Robert Gilpin]] in ''Global Political Economy: Understanding the International Economic Order'' (2001): "Somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of international financial transactions are denominated in dollars. For decades the dollar has also been the world's principal reserve currency; in 1996, the dollar accounted for approximately two-thirds of the world's foreign exchange reserves", as compared to about one-quarter held in euros (see [[Reserve Currency]]).

Some of the world's currencies are still pegged to the dollar. Some countries, such as Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama, have gone even further and eliminated their own currency (see [[dollarization]]) in favor of the United States dollar.

Only two serious challengers to the status of the United States dollar as a world currency have arisen. During the 1980s, the [[Japanese yen]] became increasingly used as an international currency,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/markets-forex-yen-idUST24254120080313|title=CHRONOLOGY – Milestones in the yen's history|last=|first=|date=13 March 2008|website=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507133100/https://www.reuters.com/article/markets-forex-yen-idUST24254120080313|archive-date=7 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but that usage diminished with the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Japanese recession]] in the 1990s. More recently, the euro has increasingly competed with the United States dollar in international finance.

===Euro===
The [[euro]] inherited its status as a major reserve currency from the [[German mark]] (DM) and its contribution to official reserves has increased as banks seek to diversify their reserves and trade in the [[eurozone]] expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06153.pdf |work=IMF Working Paper |department=Statistics Department |title=The Euro’s Challenge to the Dollar |first1=Ewe-Ghee |last=Lim |date=June 2006 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |editor-first=Armida |editor-last=San Jose |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617EYHwjs?url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06153.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the dollar, some of the world's currencies are pegged against the euro. They are usually Eastern European currencies like the [[Bulgarian lev]], plus several west African currencies like the [[Cape Verdean escudo]] and the [[CFA franc]]. Other European countries, while not being EU members, have adopted the euro due to currency unions with member states, or by unilaterally superseding their own currencies: Andorra, Monaco, Kosovo, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatican City.

{{As of|2006|12}}, the euro surpassed the dollar in the combined value of cash in circulation. The value of euro notes in circulation has risen to more than €610 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], equivalent to US$800&amp;nbsp;billion at the exchange rates at the time. A 2016 report by the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] shows that the world's energy, food and services trade are made 60% with US dollar and 40% by euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/18338034-95ec-11db-9976-0000779e2340.html|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817215700/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/18338034-95ec-11db-9976-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=17 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November, 2015, the Chinese renminbi was designated as one of the world's global currencies, and became one of the currency in the [[currency basket]] known as special drawing rights.

===Recent proposals (21st century)===
====Governmental====
On 16 March 2009, in connection with the [[2009 G-20 London summit|April 2009 G20 summit]], the [[Kremlin]] called for a supranational reserve currency as part of a reform of the [[global financial system]]. In a document containing proposals for the G20 meeting, it suggested that the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) (or an Ad Hoc Working Group of G20) should be instructed to carry out specific studies to review the following options:

* Enlargement (diversification) of the list of currencies used as reserve ones, based on agreed measures to promote the development of major regional financial centers. In this context, we should consider possible establishment of specific regional mechanisms which would contribute to reducing volatility of exchange rates of such reserve currencies.
* Introduction of a supra-national reserve currency to be issued by international financial institutions. It seems appropriate to consider the role of IMF in this process and to review the feasibility of and the need for measures to ensure the recognition of SDRs as a "supra-reserve" currency by the whole world community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/docs/2009/03/213995.shtml Russian Proposals to the London Summit (April 2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321062847/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/docs/2009/03/213995.shtml |date=21 March 2009 }} Kremlin website. 16 March 2009.

On 24 March 2009, [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], President of the [[People's Bank of China]], called for "creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency," believing it would "significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7961106.stm China presses G20 reform plans.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327130848/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7961106.stm |date=27 March 2009 }} BBC News, 24 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou suggested that the IMF's [[special drawing rights]] (a currency basket comprising dollars, euros, renminbi, yen, and [[Pound sterling|sterling]]) could serve as a super-sovereign reserve currency, not easily influenced by the policies of individual countries. [[Barack Obama|US President Obama]], however, rejected the suggestion stating that "the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j6YzcXlgBTn1fLXu1iFIFS3vIkNQ Obama rejects China's call for new global currency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530154313/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j6YzcXlgBTn1fLXu1iFIFS3vIkNQ |date=30 May 2013 }}.

At the G8 summit in July 2009, the Russian president expressed Russia's desire for a new supranational reserve currency by showing off a coin minted with the words "unity in diversity". The coin, an example of a future world currency, emphasized his call for creating a mix of regional currencies as a way to address the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pronina |first=Lyubov |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aeFVNYQpByU4 |title=Medvedev Shows Off Sample Coin of New ‘World Currency’ at G-8 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2009, at the Second [[Summit of South American-Arab Countries|South America-Arab League Summit]] in Qatar, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] proposed the creation of a petro-currency. It would be backed by the huge oil reserves of the oil producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-petro-currency_N.htm|title=Chavez to seek Arab backing for 'petro-currency' – USATODAY.com|author=|date=|website=www.usatoday.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026005704/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-petro-currency_N.htm|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single world currency==
{{seealso|Geary–Khamis dollar}}
An alternative definition of a world or global currency refers to a hypothetical single global currency or ''supercurrency'', as the proposed [[Terra (currency)|terra]] or the DEY (acronym for Dollar Euro Yen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundthemidnightcry.com/life_church_of_lafayette_/2008/10/theres-a-new-dey-coming.html|title=“There’s A New ‘Dey’ Coming!” - Sound The Midnight Cry|author=|date=|website=www.soundthemidnightcry.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602235218/http://www.soundthemidnightcry.com/life_church_of_lafayette_/2008/10/theres-a-new-dey-coming.html|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  produced and supported by a [[central bank]] which is used for ''all'' transactions around the world, regardless of the nationality of the entities (individuals, corporations, governments, or other organizations) involved in the transaction. No such official currency currently exists.

Advocates, notably [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]],&lt;ref name="singleglobalcurrency.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.singleglobalcurrency.org/related.html |title=related sites |publisher=Singleglobalcurrency.org |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804051634/http://www.singleglobalcurrency.org/related.html |archivedate=4 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a global currency often argue that such a currency would not suffer from inflation, which, in extreme cases, has had disastrous effects for economies. In addition, many&lt;ref name="singleglobalcurrency.org" /&gt; argue that a single global currency would make conducting international business more efficient and would encourage [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI).

There are many different variations of the idea, including a possibility that it would be administered by a global [[central bank]] that would define its own [[monetary standard]] or that it would be on the [[gold standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_05/wallenwein070805.html|title=A Single  Global Currency? – Gold Eagle|author=|date=|website=www.gold-eagle.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034811/http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_05/wallenwein070805.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters often point to the euro as an example of a supranational currency successfully{{dubious|date=March 2014}} implemented by a union of nations with disparate languages, cultures, and economies.

A limited alternative would be a world reserve currency issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]], as an evolution of the existing [[special drawing rights]] and used as reserve assets by all national and regional central banks. On 26 March 2009, a UN panel of expert economists called for a new global currency reserve scheme to replace the current US dollar-based system. The panel's report pointed out that the "greatly expanded SDR (special drawing rights), with regular or cyclically adjusted emissions calibrated to the size of reserve accumulations, could contribute to global stability, economic strength and global equity."&lt;ref name="un_panel"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPdAL1QnNnYKQE69vdeq63KqSTng UN panel touts new global currency reserve system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627191344/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPdAL1QnNnYKQE69vdeq63KqSTng |date=27 June 2013 }} AFP, 26 March 2009. Retrieved 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another world currency was proposed  to use conceptual currency to aid the transaction between countries. The basic idea is to utilize the balance of trade to cancel out the currency actually needed to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldcurrency.quora.com/World-currency-a-different-proposal-1|title=World currency, a different proposal – world currency – Quora|last=Zhong|first=Dale|date=|website=worldcurrency.quora.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309124620/https://worldcurrency.quora.com/World-currency-a-different-proposal-1|archive-date=9 March 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=2016-01-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the idea of a single world currency, some evidence suggests the world may evolve multiple global currencies that exchange on a singular market system. The rise of digital global currencies owned by privately held companies or groups such as [[Ven (currency)|Ven]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1007/gallery.Alternate_Currency.fortune/4.html |title=The dollar alternatives&amp;nbsp;– Ven (4)&amp;nbsp;– FORTUNE |publisher=CNN |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206125920/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1007/gallery.Alternate_Currency.fortune/4.html |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that multiple global currencies may offer wider formats for trade as they gain strength and wider acceptance.

[[Blockchain]] offers the possibility that a decentralized system that works with little human intervention could eliminate squabbling over who would administer the world central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-01/how-about-a-global-currency-|title=How About a Global Currency?|author=|date=1 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119020958/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-01/how-about-a-global-currency-|archivedate=19 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
===Limited additional benefit with extra cost===
Some economists argue that a single world currency is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing many of the benefits of a world currency while avoiding some of the costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/02-aug/p32forward.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205145243/http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/02-aug/p32forward.html |date=5 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the world does not form an [[optimum currency area]], then it would be economically inefficient for the world to share one currency.

===Economically incompatible nations===
In the present world, nations are not able to work together closely enough to be able to produce and support a common currency. There has to be a high level of trust between different countries before a true world currency could be created. A world currency might even undermine national sovereignty of smaller states.

===Wealth redistribution===
The interest rate set by the central bank indirectly determines the interest rate customers must pay on their bank loans. This interest rate affects the rate of interest among individuals, investments, and countries. Lending to the poor involves more risk than lending to the rich. As a result of the larger differences in wealth in different areas of the world, a central bank's ability to set interest rate to make the area prosper will be increasingly compromised, since it places wealthiest regions in conflict with the poorest regions in debt.

===Usury===
[[Usury]]&amp;nbsp;– the accumulation of interest on loan principal&amp;nbsp;– is prohibited by the texts of some major religions. In Christianity and Judaism, adherents are forbidden to charge interest to other adherents or to the poor ([[Leviticus]] 25:35–38; [[Deuteronomy]] 23:19). Islam forbids usury, known in Arabic as [[riba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/usury.htm |title=The facts about usury : Why Islam is against lending money at interest |publisher=Mustaqim.co.uk |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721203741/http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/usury.htm |archivedate=21 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religious adherents who oppose the paying of interest are currently able to use banking facilities in their countries which regulate interest. An example of this is the [[Islamic banking]] system, which is characterized by a nation's central bank setting interest rates for most other transactions.{{fact|date=September 2012}}
