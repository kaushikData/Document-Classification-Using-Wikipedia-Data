The '''{{lang|ht|Akademi Kreyòl Ayisyen}}''' ({{IPA-ht|akademi kɣejɔl ajisjɛ̃}}), known in English as the '''Haitian Creole Academy''', is the [[List of language regulators|language regulator]] of [[Haitian&amp;nbsp;Creole]].&lt;ref name="Dizikes2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.mit.edu/2015/3-questions-michel-degraff-haiti-teaching-kreyol-0720 |title=3 Questions: Michel DeGraff on Haiti's new policy for teaching in Kreyòl |work=MIT News |date=20 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906185229/http://news.mit.edu/2015/3-questions-michel-degraff-haiti-teaching-kreyol-0720 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |dead-url=no |last=Dizikes |first=Peter |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of up to 55{{nbsp}}scholars under the leadership of [[Pauris&amp;nbsp;Jean‑Baptiste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenational.ht/akademi-kreyol-ayisyen-aka-ant-reyalizasyon-ak-pespektiv/ |title=Akademi Kreyòl Ayisyen (AKA): Ant reyalizasyon ak pèspektiv |work=Le National |date=6 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124001952/http://lenational.ht/akademi-kreyol-ayisyen-aka-ant-reyalizasyon-ak-pespektiv/ |archive-date=24 January 2016 |dead-url=no |language=ht |location=Port‑au‑Prince}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Haitian Creole language did not have any regulation until the 1940s, when former Haitian president, [[Élie Lescot]] made attempts at standardizing the language. It had an official orthography by the late 1970s, and it was elevated to being the official language in the [[Haitian Constitution|1987 Haitian Constitution]]. The language still lacked an academy to regulate its evolution until about 25 years later.

==Background==
In December 2014, the Haitian president and legislation approved of the establishment of the Haitian Creole Academy. 33 scholars came together and formed the organization to form a uniformed syntax, to ensure the Haitian government is able to better communicate with its people, lead the way for more publications of books and various other forms of media, and to end the stigma behind speaking the language. The AKA recently{{when|date=July 2018}} published a new alphabet and {{clarify span|set of rules.|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Liga Patriótica Argentina.jpg|thumb|Armed members of the Patriotic League roaming the streets of Buenos Aires.]]
The '''Argentine Patriotic League''' (''Liga Patriótica Argentina'') was a ''[[Nacionalismo (Argentine political movement)|Nacionalista]]'' [[paramilitary]] group, officially created in [[Buenos Aires]] on January 16, 1919, during the [[Tragic week (Argentina)|Tragic week]] events. Presided over by [[Manuel Carlés]], a professor at the Military College and the ''[[Escuela Superior de Guerra (Argentina)|Escuela Superior de Guerra]]'', it also counted among its members the deputy [[Santiago G. O'Farrell]] (1861-1926). The League was merged into the [[Argentine Civic Legion]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Frank. ''Los Artistas del Pueblo: prints and workers' culture in Buenos Aires, 1917-1935''. University of New Mexico Press, 2006. Pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine Patriotic League formed part of a larger [[Patriotic Leagues (Southern Cone)|movement of patriotic leagues]] active in Chile and Argentina during the early 20th century.

Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The colours represent the [[national colours]] of Argentina while the cross represents Christianity.&lt;ref name="Sandra McGee Deutsch 1999. Pp. 210"/&gt;]]

Composed of wealthy youth, the League assaulted workers' neighborhoods, including the [[Jewish]] [[Balvanera|Once]] neighborhood of Buenos Aires. It received military training by members of the [[Argentine Armed Forces]], was subsidised by important members of the [[oligarchy]], and supported by the [[Roman Catholicism in Argentina|Church]].&lt;ref name=Rev/&gt; The League worked hand-in-hand with the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police|Bonaerense]] police forces in the repression of social movements. Some of its members were also members of the [[Radical Civic Union|Radical Party]].&lt;ref name=Rev/&gt;

It quickly extended itself throughout [[Argentina]], on a nationalist, [[xenophobic]], [[anti-Communist]] and [[anti-Semitic]] program. They attacked in particular [[Catalan people|Catalan]]s (accused of being [[Anarchism in Argentina|anarchists]]) and [[History of the Jews in Argentina|Jews]] (accused of being [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]]).&lt;ref name=Rev&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/104.3/br_107.html Book review] {{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} of [[Luis María Caterina]].

Pp. 333 (in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the early 1920s, the League's so-called brigades contained as many as 300,000 members throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Rev/&gt;

The League counted with the official support of the admiral and Minister of Marine [[Manuel Domecq García]].

The League participated to the events known as ''[[Patagonia rebelde]]'' or ''Patagonia Trágica'' (1921-1922), in [[Río Gallegos]], during which 1,500 workers in strike were assassinated.

It also participated to [[José Félix Uriburu]]'s 1930 military coup, which initiated the [[Infamous Decade]].

The '''assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]''' was the result of a conspiracy by many [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senators]] led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], and [[Marcus Junius Brutus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html |title=De vita Caesarum |last=Suetonius |first= |date=121 |website=University of Chicago |publisher= |page=107|trans-title=The Twelve Caesars|access-date= |quote=More than sixty joined the conspiracy against [Caesar], led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html |title=Life of Caesar |last=Plutarch |first= |date= |website=University of Chicago |publisher= |page=595|access-date= |quote=...at this juncture Decimus Brutus, surnamed Albinus, who was so trusted by Caesar that he was entered in his will as his second heir, but was partner in the conspiracy of the other Brutus and Cassius, fearing that if Caesar should elude that day, their undertaking would become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for laying himself open to malicious charges on the part of the senators...}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stabbed Caesar (23 times) to death in a location adjacent to the [[Theatre of Pompey]] on the [[Ides of March]] 15 March 44 BC. Caesar was the [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] of the [[Roman Republic]], having recently been declared ''[[dictator perpetuo]]'' by the [[Senate of the Roman Republic]]. This declaration made several senators fear that Caesar wanted to overthrow the Senate in favour of totalitarianism. The conspirators were unable to restore the Roman Republic, and the ramifications of the assassination led to the [[Liberators' civil war]] and ultimately to the [[Principate]] period of the [[Roman Empire]].

==Background==
Biographers describe tension between Caesar and the Senate,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and his possible claims to the title of king. These events were the principal motive for Caesar's assassination.
[[File:Gaius Iulius Caesar (Vatican Museum).jpg|thumb|Bust of Julius Caesar, posthumous portrait in marble, 44-30 BC, [[Museo Pio-Clementino]], [[Vatican Museums]]]]

The Senate named Caesar ''[[dictator perpetuo]]'' ("dictator in perpetuity"). Roman mints produced a [[denarius]] coin with this title and his likeness on one side, and with an image of the goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and Caesar's title of ''Augur [[Pontifex Maximus]]'' on the reverse. According to [[Cassius Dio]], writing over 200 years later, a senatorial delegation went to inform Caesar of new honours they had bestowed upon him in 44 BC. Caesar received them while sitting in the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], rather than rising to meet them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/44*.html Cassius Dio, 44.8.1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]] wrote (almost 150 years later) that Caesar failed to rise in the temple, either because he was restrained by [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (consul)|Cornelius Balbus]] or that he balked at the suggestion he should rise.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#78 78]&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius also gave the account of a crowd assembled to greet Caesar upon his return to Rome. A member of the crowd placed a [[laurel wreath]] on the statue of Caesar on the [[Rostra]]. The [[tribune]]s [[Gaius Epidius Marullus]] and [[Lucius Caesetius Flavus]] ordered that the wreath be removed as it was a symbol of Jupiter and royalty. Caesar had the tribunes removed from office through his official powers.&lt;ref name=Plu61&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#61 61]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, Caesar was unable to dissociate himself from the royal title from this point forward.&lt;ref name="Sue79.2"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#79 79.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius also gives the story that a crowd shouted to him ''rex'' ("king"), to which Caesar replied, "I am Caesar, not Rex"&lt;ref name="Sue79.2"/&gt;  ("''Ego caesar, non rex.''"). Also, at the [[festival]] of the [[Lupercalia]], while he gave a speech from the Rostra, [[Mark Antony]], who had been elected co-consul with Caesar, attempted to place a crown on his head several times. Caesar put it aside to use as a sacrifice to ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Optimus Maximus''.&lt;ref name=Plu61/&gt;

Plutarch and Suetonius are similar in their depiction of these events, but Dio combines the stories, writing that the tribunes arrested the citizens who placed diadems or wreaths on statues of Caesar. He then places the crowd shouting ''"rex"'' on the Alban Hill with the tribunes arresting a member of this crowd as well. The plebeian protested that he was unable to speak his mind freely. Caesar then brought the tribunes before the senate and put the matter to a vote, thereafter removing them from office and [[Damnatio memoriae|erasing their names from the records]].

Suetonius adds that Lucius Cotta proposed to the Senate that Caesar should be granted the title of "king", for it was prophesied that only a king would conquer [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#79 79.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar intended to invade Parthia, a task that later gave considerable trouble to Mark Antony during the second triumvirate.

His many titles and honors from the Senate were ultimately merely that: honorary. Caesar continually strove for more power to govern, with as little dependence as possible on honorary titles or the Senate. The placating and ennobling of Caesar did not allay ultimate confrontation, as the Senate was still the authority granting Caesar his titles. Formal power resided in them, resulting in tension with Caesar.

[[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] began to conspire against Caesar with his friend and brother-in-law [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] and other men, calling themselves the ''Liberatores'' ("Liberators"). Many plans were discussed by the group, as documented by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]:

{{quote box|The conspirators never met exactly openly, but they assembled a few at a time in each other's homes. There were many discussions and proposals, as might be expected, while they investigated how and where to execute their design. Some suggested that they should make the attempt along the [[Via Sacra|Sacred Way]], which was one of his favourite walks. Another idea was to do it at the elections, during which he had to cross a bridge to appoint the magistrates in the [[Campus Martius]]. Someone proposed that they draw lots for some to push him from the bridge and others to run up and kill him. A third plan was to wait for a coming gladiatorial show. The advantage of that was, because of the show, no suspicion would be aroused if arms were seen. The majority opinion, however, favoured killing him while he sat in the [[Roman senate|Senate]]. He would be there by himself, since only Senators were admitted, and the conspirators could hide their [[dagger]]s beneath their [[toga]]s. This plan won the day.}}

Nicolaus writes that in the days leading up to the assassination, Caesar was told by doctors, friends, and even his wife, [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], not to attend the Senate on the Ides for various reasons, including medical concerns and troubling dreams Calpurnia had:
{{quote box
|...his friends were alarmed at certain rumours and tried to stop him going to the senate-house, as did his doctors, for he was suffering from one of his occasional dizzy spells. His wife, Calpurnia, especially, who was frightened by some visions in her dreams, clung to him and said that she would not let him go out that day. But [Decimus] [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Brutus]], one of the conspirators who was then thought of as a firm friend, came up and said, 'What is this, Caesar? Are you a man to pay attention to a woman's dreams and the idle gossip of stupid men, and to insult the Senate by not going out, although it has honoured you and has been specially summoned by you? But listen to me, cast aside the forebodings of all these people, and come. The Senate has been in session waiting for you since early this morning.' This swayed Caesar and he left.}}

Caesar had been preparing to invade the Parthian Empire (a campaign later taken up by his successor, [[Mark Antony]]) and planned to leave for the East in the latter half of March. This forced a timetable onto the conspirators. Two days before the actual assassination, Cassius met with the conspirators and told them that, should anyone discover the plan, they were to turn their knives on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#58 58.6]&lt;/ref&gt; His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.

The gladiators were provided by [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] in case their services were needed. They waited in the great hall of the theatre's [[quadriportico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, And Tyrant|last=Fuller |first=J. F.

Therefore, Decimus Brutus was sent to fetch him, and managed to persuade Caesar to attend so as not to disappoint the Senate.  [[Mark Antony]], having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified ''Liberator'' named [[Servilius Casca]],&lt;ref&gt;Butler, M. Cary, ed., C. Suetoni Tranquilli, ''Divus Iulius'' [''The Life of Julius Caesar''], Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927, Reissued with new introduction, bibliography, and additional notes by G. B. Townsend, Bristol: Bristol Classical Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for Trebonius to intercept him just as he approached the portico of the Theatre of Pompey, where the session was to be held, and detain him outside (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to Decimus Brutus). When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.

According to [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber|Lucius Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html Plutarch – Life of Brutus]. The brother was Publius Cimber.&lt;/ref&gt; The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Both Plutarch and [[Suetonius]] say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed Caesar's shoulders and pulled down Caesar's [[toga]]. Caesar then cried to Cimber, "Why, this is violence!" ("''Ista quidem vis est!''").&lt;ref name = "suetonius"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html Suetonius, ''Life of the Caesars, Julius'' trans. J C Rolfe]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Servilius Casca|Casca]] produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to [[Plutarch]], he said in Latin, "Casca, you villain, what are you doing?"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Caesar'', chapter 66: "{{lang|grc|ὁ μεν πληγείς, Ῥωμαιστί· 'Μιαρώτατε Κάσκα, τί ποιεῖς;}}'"&lt;/ref&gt; Casca, frightened, shouted "Help, brother!" in Greek ("{{lang|grc|ἄδελφε, βοηθεῖ}}", "''adelphe, boethei''"). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, were stabbing the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood in his eyes, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenseless on the lower steps of the portico. According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], sixty or more men participated in the assassination. Caesar was stabbed 23 times.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, J. (October 11, 2012).

This autopsy report (the earliest known post-mortem report in history) describes that Caesar's death was mostly attributable to blood loss from his stab wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'', {{circa}} 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was killed at the base of the [[Curia]] in the [[Theatre of Pompey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.livescience.com/23900-julius-caesar-assassination-place-discovered.html |title=Spot Where Julius Caesar Was Stabbed Discovered |newspaper=Live Science|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictator's last words are a contested subject among scholars and historians. Suetonius himself says he said nothing,&lt;ref name = "suetonius" /&gt; nevertheless, he mentions that others have written that Caesar's last words were the [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase "{{lang|grc|καὶ σύ, τέκνον;}}"&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#82.2 82.2]&lt;/ref&gt; (transliterated as "''Kai su, teknon?''": "You too, child?" in English).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', translated by Robert Graves, Penguin Classics, p.39, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#66.9 66.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The version best known in the English-speaking world is the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''" ("You too, Brutus?");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Jon R. |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005 |pages=250 |isbn=0-415-96909-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morwood |first=James |title=The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary (Latin-English) |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |year=1994 |chapter= |isbn=0-19-860283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; this derives from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1599), where it actually forms the first half of a [[macaronic]] line: "''Et tu, Brute?'' Then fall, Caesar." This has no basis in historical fact. Shakespeare was making use of a phrase already in common use at the time.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;It appears, for example, in [[Richard Edes|Richard Eedes]]'s Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke &amp;tc'' of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays. {{cite book |title=The Works of William Shakespeare |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Dyce |others=Quoting [[Edmond Malone|Malone]] |year=1866 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |pages=648 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators not involved in the plot; they, however, fled the building.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'', 67&lt;/ref&gt; Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: "People of Rome, we are once again free!". They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. According to Suetonius, all the conspirators made off, and he (Caesar) lay there lifeless for some time, and finally three common slaves put him on a litter and carried him home, with one arm hanging down.&lt;ref&gt;"The Lives of the Twelve Caesars", by C. Suetonius Tranquillus&lt;/ref&gt;

A wax statue of Caesar was erected in the Forum displaying the 23 stab wounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Appian]]'' Bellum Civile 2.147, http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html recovered 12-23-14&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd who had amassed there started a fire, which badly damaged neighboring buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the ensuing years, the [[Liberators' civil war]] resulted in the end of the Republic and the rise of Imperial Rome.

==Portentous events==
Virgil wrote in the ''[[Georgics]]'' that several unusual events took place following Caesar's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html Virgil, ''Georgics, Book 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Who dare say the Sun is false? He and no other warns us when dark uprising threaten, when treachery and hidden wars are gathering strength. He and no other was moved to pity Rome on the day that Caesar died, when he veiled his radiance in gloom and darkness, and a godless age feared everlasting night. Yet in this hour Earth also and the plains of Ocean, ill-boding dogs and birds that spell mischief, sent signs which heralded disaster. How oft before our eyes did Etna deluge the fields of the Cyclopes with a torrent from her burst furnaces, hurling thereon balls of fire and molten rocks. Germany heard the noise of battle sweep across the sky and, even without precedent, the Alps rocked with earthquakes. A voice boomed through the silent groves for all to hear, a deafening voice, and phantoms of unearthly pallor were seen in the falling darkness. Horror beyond words, beasts uttered human speech; rivers stood still, the earth gaped upon; in the temples ivory images wept for grief, and beads of sweat covered bronze statues. King of waterways, the Po swept forests along in the swirl of his frenzied current, carrying with him over the plain cattle and stalls alike. Nor in that same hour did sinister filaments cease to appear in ominous entrails or blood to flow from wells or our hillside towns to echo all night with the howl of wolves. Never fell more lightning from a cloudless sky; never was comet's alarming glare so often seen.}}

==Aftermath of the assassination==

Two days after the assassination, Mark Antony summoned the senate and managed to work out a compromise in which the assassins would not be punished for their acts, but all of Caesar's appointments would remain valid. By doing this, Antony most likely hoped to avoid large cracks in government forming as a result of Caesar's death. Simultaneously, Antony diminished the goals of the conspirators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Romans: From Village to Empire |last=Boatwright |first=Susan |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-973057-5 |location=New York |pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVII 2.7.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman lower classes, with whom Caesar was popular, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had sacrificed Caesar. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the [[Optimates]], perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. But, to his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] his sole heir, bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name as well as making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83.2 83.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing of his adoptive father's death, Octavius abandoned his studies in Apollonia and sailed across the Adriatic Sea to Brundisium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Octavius became ''Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus'' or Octavian, the son of the great Caesar, and consequently also inherited the loyalty of much of the Roman populace. Octavian, aged only 18 at the time of Caesar's death, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position. Antony did not initially consider Octavius a true political threat due to his young age and inexperience, but Octavius quickly gained the support and admiration of Caesar's friends and supporters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the money from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With passage of the [[Lex Titia]] on 27 November 43 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire |author=Osgood, Josiah |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Second Triumvirate]] was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's [[Master of the Horse]] [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#13.1 13.1]; Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6]&lt;/ref&gt; It formally [[Apotheosis|deified]] Caesar as [[Divus Iulius]] in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became ''Divi filius'' ("Son of the Divine").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roman Religion |author=Warrior, Valerie M. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |page=110 |isbn=0-521-82511-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate brought back [[proscription]], abandoned since [[Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6.3]&lt;/ref&gt; It engaged in the legally sanctioned murder of a large number of its opponents in order to fund its forty-five legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Rome: An Introductory History |author=Zoch, Paul A. |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=200 |pages=217–218 |isbn=0-8061-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavian defeated them at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.7.11-14]; Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html 5.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, Mark Antony married Caesar's lover, [[Cleopatra]], intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's [[Battle of Actium|defeat at Actium]], resulted in the final ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name that raised him to the status of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.34.66]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baltic Assembly''' ('''BA''') is a [[regional organization|regional organisation]] that promotes intergovernmental cooperation between [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]. It attempts to find a common position in relation to many international issues, including economic, political and cultural issues. The decisions of the assembly are advisory.

The budget of the BA is funded by the three-member governments. The official languages of the Baltic Assembly are [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. The headquarters and [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]] of the organization are located in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]].

==History==
===Background===
[[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] were independent states since 1918 after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]]. During the outbreak of [[World War II]], under the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]], they were [[Occupation of the Baltic states|illegally annexed]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940 and continued on for fifty years. 

Under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last Soviet leader, the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' has led to the [[Singing Revolution|restoration of]] independence between 1990 and 1991 which led the three countries to break away. The Soviet Union itself recognised the independence of the [[State continuity of the Baltic states|restored]] Baltic states on 6 September 1991 before its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution later that year]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Formation===
The organisation was formed after a decision to establish it was made in [[Vilnius]] on 1 December 1990. It works under regulations approved on 8 November 1991 in [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltasam.org/en/history/pre-history|title=Baltic Assembly - Pre-History|first=Super|last=User|website=baltasam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1994 the three nations agreed to the structure and rules of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltasam.org/en/history/international-inclusion|title=Baltic Assembly - International Inclusion|first=Super|last=User|website=baltasam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements===
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
The BA claims the following as its achievements between 1991 and 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltasam.org/en/history|title=Baltic Assembly - History|website=baltasam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Withdrawal of Russian troops from the member States,
*Formation of the Baltic Council of Ministers as an institution of governmental co-operation,
*Development of common Baltic economic, educational and information technology policies,
*Harmonisation of legislation in conformity with requirements of the European Union,
*Improvement of border-crossing procedures,
*The establishment of the [[Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science|Baltic Assembly Prizes for Literature, the Arts and Science]].

===Cooperation with other Geopolitic-regions===
In 2017 the Baltic Assembly, the [[Benelux]] and three of the members of the [[Nordic Council]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|first=|last=ERR|date=22 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The BA comprises sixty members. Each of the parliaments of the three States appoints twenty of its members to the Assembly. Each of the national parliaments appoints two of the members to be head and deputy head of the national delegation. The six head delegates and deputy head delegates form the BA's Presidium. The Chairman of the Praesidium is the head of the national delegation of the country hosting the next session of the BA. The heads of the other two national delegations are Vice Chairmen of the Presidium. The Preasidium controls the BA between sessions. The Chairman acts as the coordinator of the work of the BA, is its representative with other bodies and liaises with the three members’ governments.

==Sessions==
There are ordinary and extraordinary Sessions. The ordinary Session is convened once a year, as a concluding forum of a country's presidency, which proceeds according to a yearly rotation principle in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Before 2003 there were two Sessions a year – in spring and autumn, and countries - participants had half a year presidency. 

Any national delegation may propose that an extraordinary session is held. On 8-9 February 1998 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], following to the 2nd Joint Meeting of the [[Nordic Council]] and the Baltic Assembly, the first Extraordinary Session of the Baltic Assembly took place. The second Extraordinary Session of the Baltic Assembly was held on 27-29 April 2005 in [[Pärnu]], [[Estonia]], following to the 5th Joint Meeting of the Baltic Assembly and the [[Nordic Council]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltasam.org/en/structure/session|title=Baltic Assembly - Session|first=Super|last=User|website=baltasam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committees==
The following are the standing committees: 
*Budget and Audit
*Communications and IT
*Economic and Social Affairs
*Education, Science, and Culture
*Environment Protection and Energy
*Legal
*Security and Foreign Affairs

Each member of the BA participates in at least one committee.

==Political groupings==
The 20 members of the BA from each country are chosen so that their political make-up reflects the proportions within their home parliament. The members may then form cross-national party groupings of at least five members from at least two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltasam.org/en/structure/national-delegations|title=Baltic Assembly - National Delegations|first=Super|last=User|website=baltasam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, the three political groupings are the [[Conservatism|Conservative-Right]] Party Group, the Centre Party Group, and the [[Social democracy|Social Democratic]] Party Group.

The '''Battle of Pfeddersheim''' ({{lang-de|Schlacht bei Pfeddersheim}}) was a battle during the [[German Peasants' War]] that took place in June 1525 near [[Worms-Pfeddersheim|Pfeddersheim]]. The peasants of the [[Palatinate region]] had previously joined the uprising in southwest Germany against high taxes and attacked, plundered and devastated the estates of the nobility and the monasteries.

{{Campaignbox German Peasants' War}}
== Causes ==
The [[Battle]] of Pfeddersheim was part of the [[Palatine Peasants' War]] of 1525. The unrest amongst the peasants and townsfolk in and around [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] began before 29 April 1525 and reached its zenith in May that year. They demanded that the town authorities comply with 13 articles and make concessions within four days.

These articles were related to three areas: first, in the [[religion|religious]] sphere, they demanded a clear and unbiased [[preaching]] of the Gospel and the free election of priests and preachers by members of the community. Second, in the [[economic]] sphere and where applicable, they demanded that [[interest]], pensions and rent paid to the clergy should be cease when they reached three times the principal sum. The peasants also demanded permission to [[hunting|hunt]], [[fishing|fish]] and cut timber from forests and common land.

The articles, which affected [[constitution]]al law, ended by demanding that the treaty of 1519, known as the ''Rachtung'', be repealed and the records destroyed. All privileges of the clergy, even if they were granted by emperors, kings and popes should be declared void. The clergy should now be charged and pay for [[pasture]], guarding (''Wacht''), [[direct tax]]es (''Schatzung'') [[excise tax]] (''Ungeld'') and ''Kaufhausgeld''.

Although there was no direct contact between the citizens and peasants in April and May 1525, because the Council had forbidden that, both sides were always informed about each other.

In Pfeddersheim the [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and [[monastery]] owned over a third of the arable land. However, there appears to be no particular, local reason for the sudden unrest amongst the Pfeddersheim townsfolk. Rather, they seem to have heard about the situation further afield and followed suit. They had no doubt heard of events in southwest Germany, felt a wave of protest growing and were inclined to join the uprising to improve their social and economic situation. Consequently, it was fairly easy for rebellious peasants to take possession of Pfeddersheim. Meanwhile, after the conquest of [[Würzburg]], Elector Louis V of the Palatinate returned with his army as quickly as possible to his territory to bring an end to the uprising there.

== Battle ==
=== Troops and weaponry ===
==== Peasants ====
The peasants were armed with [[lance]]s, [[morning star (weapon)|morning stars]] and farm implements. In addition, some peasant mobs had captured firearms. However, in comparison with the prince's troops they were poorly equipped because the most of the weapons they had were those they had captured or stolen. The prince's troops, of course, were able to be issued with weapons from the armouries.

==== Elector Louis' troops ====
The Elector's ''[[Landsknecht]]e'' who, unlike the peasants, had received military training were also better armed. Their weapons included several [[kartouwe]]s (siege guns), ''scharfmetzes'', ''notschlangen'', [[culverin]]s, [[demi-culverin]]s and [[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. Elector Louis also had several so-called ''Fähnchen''s, cavalry squadrons each comprising about 150 troopers.

=== Course of the battle ===
==== First phase ====
After the Elector's troops had marched on Pfeddersheim, Marschall von Habern and Schenk Eberhard von Erbach had the [[artillery]] and [[infantry]] deploy on an eminence to the north only a few metres from the town. Shortly thereafter his artillery began to open fire on the town's defences. The rebels replied with their own artillery. The exchange of fire was indecisive.

==== Second phase ====
When the Palatine army failed to overcome the rebels with their artillery, they began to establish observation points in order to ascertain what the peasants might do next. In addition, [[cannon]], which had hitherto played a secondary role in the battle, were set up relatively close around the town. Small mounted ''[[Fähnlein]]s'' were also formed and posted on some heights southwest of Pfeddersheim in order to observe the peasants.

==== Third phase ====
After troops had been deployed both to the north and the southwest and another position established to the west, the [[encirclement]] of Pfeddersheim was almost complete. The east was not occupied because, in the view of the commander, it was unnecessary because there was no gate through which the townsfolk to escape. Nonetheless a final disposition outside the [[circumvallation]] was made, in which the cook, the food supply wagon and, later, [[Louis V of the Palatinate|Elector Louis]], were based. The ''Knechte'' (infantry) established themselves between this new position and the River [[Pfrimm]]. So the various arms of service were all kept separate and not mixed. No fighting took place during this phase.

==== Fourth phase ====
Shortly after the last position had been occupied, a small force of peasants poured out of the west gate of the town. The besiegers suspected that they wanted to advance to the cover of the Georgenberg hill and also that they wanted to attack the horsemen to the south and drive them away. However, neither of these assumptions came to anything because, suddenly, another 7,000 men stormed out of the gate and advanced over the western approaches presumably thinking they could easily defeat the cavalry deployed there. They could not defeat the Prince's cavalry, however, because the latter exceeded the strength and fighting power of the peasants, so they fell back to the hill of [[Wingartberg]], from where they fired on the main body of the cavalry with their guns. Because the Prince's troops did not know where the peasants had gone to when they left the hill, they then waited to see what would happen next. When the peasant bands then stormed the main body of the Prince's army pouring down the southern slopes of the hill, Marshal von Habern went to the aid of the field captain (''[[Feldhauptmann]]'') at his request and placed his troops behind the main body. The artillery grouped around them then immediately fired on the attackers.

As the peasant force now looked overmatched, they tried to flee to the town. The royal troops sought to prevent their escape behind the town walls and pursued with their squadrons and mounted troops, with the result many farmers failed to reach the safety of the town. A total of 4,000 peasants were cut off and then either stabbed or strangled on the spot. The remaining peasants who were still in front of the town gate, tried to enter the town. Some peasants even tried to escape to Worms. This incident decimated the ranks of the peasants.

As it was already night when the last peasants had either been killed or escaped into the town, three ''Fähnleins'', 1,500 ''Knechte'' and 1,000 horsemen were deployed around the town for the rest of the night. The next morning, guns were situated near the town began to open fire. After three hours and after 262 shells had been fired, the peasants capitulated and the Prince's army had won the battle.

== After the battle ==
=== Reasons for the peasants' defeat ===
Although both [[armies]] were, numerically, roughly the same size, the peasants were defeated primarily for two reasons: first, although the peasants were not poorly armed, because they not only had [[pitchfork]]s, [[scythe]]s and [[flail]]s, but also [[pike (weapon)|pikes]], [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s, they were still powerless against the [[cavalry]] since they themselves had no cavalry - a decisive disadvantage. Second, the peasants did not have a military leader who could have coordinated the troops and their direction, objectives and firepower. There were ringleaders amongst the peasants, but they had no influence beyond the boundaries of their home area. At that time, the peasants did not recognize that they would have no chance of success against the Prince without a united approach.

=== Consequences for the peasants ===
On 25 June, all peasants who were not Palatinate subjects, had to leave the town unarmed. Approximately 3,000 obeyed the command. Although they had been warned not to attempt to escape, many farmers took the first opportunity to escape for fear of punishment. The escape attempt failed, however, and the soldiers initiated a [[massacre|bloodbath]] that cost the lives of 800 people. Thirty [[Leadership|ringleaders]] were immediately beheaded; the other peasants were released under strict conditions to their homes.

After the massacre, the troops occupied the town. The remaining peasants had to gather on the [[cemetery]]. 180 ringleaders were detained in the [[shared church]] at Pfeddersheim. The Pfeddersheim townsfolk had to guard them. For each peasant who escaped, they were warned that a citizen had to lose his life. The inhabitants had to hand over all those they had hidden by the next morning. 24 leaders were executed. All the other peasants were allowed to go free for a fee. 

But the Pfeddersheim townsfolk were severely punished. Four of their leaders were beheaded. Heavy penalties were imposed on the town: they had to pay high levels of [[Duty (economics)|duty]], hand over all their [[weapon]]s and give up their letters of freedom.

== Today ==
Even today a road that runs northwards towards Mörstadt - ''Georg Scheu Straße'' - is known locally as ''Bluthohl'' ("blood hollow"). The name comes from the accounts that the battle had raged on the nearby fields that were at a higher level and that the blood of the fallen ran down this road into the town.

[[File:25th CAB trains with Navy divers 130619-A-AB123-068.jpg|thumb|Unmarked black helicopters have been described in conspiracy theories since the 1970s]]

'''Black helicopters''' is a term which became popular in the [[Militia movement (United States)|United States militia movement]] and associated political groups in the 1990s as a symbol and warning sign of an [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|alleged conspiratorial]] [[Military dictatorship|military takeover]] of the United States, though it has also been associated with [[UFO]]s, [[men in black]], and similar conspiracies.&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; Rumors circulated that, for instance, the [[United Nations]] patrolled the US with unmarked black helicopters, or that [[Special agent|federal agents]] used black helicopters to enforce wildlife laws. 

[[metonymy|Metonymic]] use of the phrase ''black helicopters'' sometimes occurs in reference to [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] in general.

==Overview==
Stories of black helicopters first appeared in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d5ZQbQX9pQwC&amp;pg=PA92 ''A culture of conspiracy: apocalyptic visions in contemporary America'']&lt;/ref&gt; and were linked to reports of [[cattle mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://surbrook.devermore.net/worldbooks/pdepartment/pdparanormal.html The Phenomena Department - Paranormal Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the idea originated in [[Hal Lindsey]]'s book ''[[The Late, Great Planet Earth]]'', published in 1970 and popular among conspiracy theorists. Lindsey theorized that the locust-like creatures referenced in the [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]] were actually helicopters, which [[John of Patmos|John]] had never seen and thus did not know how to describe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc-vw.org/articles/hallindsey.htm Hal Lindsey, The Father of Apocalyptic Christian Zionism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126223949/http://www.cc-vw.org/articles/hallindsey.htm |date=January 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Keith]] wrote two books on the subject: ''Black Helicopters Over America: Strikeforce for the New World Order'' (1995), and ''Black Helicopters II: The End Game Strategy'' (1998).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Media attention to black helicopters increased in February 1995, when first-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Idaho Panhandle|northern]] [[Idaho]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Helen Chenoweth-Hage|Helen Chenoweth]] charged that armed federal agents were landing black helicopters on Idaho [[ranching|rancher]]s' property to enforce the [[Endangered Species Act]]. "I have never seen them," Chenoweth said in an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]''. "But enough people in my district have become concerned that I can't just ignore it. We do have some proof."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/199605/priorities.asp Priorities - May/June 1996 - Sierra Magazine - Sierra Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in [[UFO conspiracy theories]] often claim unmarked black helicopters are seen in the vicinity of UFO sightings, the theory being that the choppers belong to an alleged secretive government department who cover up evidence of alien visits and UFOs from the general public.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite news |last1=Austin |first1=Jon |title=UFO MYSTERY: Fifteen black helicopters seen 'flying towards location of bizarre sighting' |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/748228/UFO-helicopters-Albuquerque-New-Mexico |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=[[Daily Express]] |location=London |date=29 December 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black helicopters theory resonates well with the belief held by some in the militia movement that troops from the [[United Nations]] might invade the United States.  The [[John Birch Society]] published an article in ''[[John Birch Society#New American|The New American]]'' detailing how the existence of the covert aircraft was mostly the product of possible visual errors and a tendency towards overabundant caution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrotimes.com/archives/militia/004.html The Paranoid and the Paramilitary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418160611/http://www.metrotimes.com/archives/militia/004.html |date=April 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''''Bumiputera''''' or '''''Bumiputra''''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: بوميڤوترا) is a [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] term to describe [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and other [[indigenous peoples]] of [[Southeast Asia]], i.e. the [[Malay world]], used similarly as in [[Bumiputera (Indonesia)|Indonesia]] and [[Bumiputera (Brunei)|Brunei]]. The term comes from the [[Sanskrit]] and later absorbed into the [[classical Malay]] word ''bhumiputra'', which can be translated literally as "son of the land" or "son of the soil".

In the 1970s, the Malaysian government implemented policies which ''[[The Economist]]'' called "racially discriminatory" designed to favour bumiputras (including [[affirmative action]] in public education) to create opportunities, and to defuse interethnic tensions following the extended violence against [[Malaysian Chinese]] in the [[13 May Incident]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The slaughter of sacred cows|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1677328|accessdate=22 July 2011|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies have succeeded in creating a significant [[urban area|urban]] Malay and [[Borneo|Native Bornean]] middle class as well. They have been less effective in eradicating poverty among [[rural]] communities. Some analysts have noted a backlash of resentment from excluded groups, in particular the sizeable Chinese and Indian Malaysian minorities.

==Definition==
[[File:Article 153 Special Position of Bumiputras.png|thumb|A diagram of the special position of Bumiputras under the [[Malaysian Constitution]]]]

The concept of a bumiputra ethnic group in Malaysia was coined by [[Abdul Razak Hussein]]. It recognised the "special position" of the Malays provided in the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], in particular [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]]. However, the constitution does not use the term bumiputra; it defines only "Malay" and "[[Orang Asli|indigenous peoples]]" (Article 160(2)),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helplinelaw.com/law/constitution/malaysia/malaysia12.php "Part XII: General and Miscellaneous, Constitution of Malaysia (Articles 152–160)"], ''helplinelaw.com''.

Accessed 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and "natives" of Sabah (Article 161A(6) (b)).&lt;ref name="FC" /&gt;  Definitions of ''bumiputra'' in public use vary among different institutions, organisations, and government departments and agencies.

In the book ''Buku Panduan Kemasukan ke Institusi Pengajian Tinggi Awam, Program Pengajian Lepasan SPM/Setaraf Sesi Akademik 2007/2008'' (Guidebook for entry into public higher learning institutions for SPM/equivalent graduates for academic year 2007/2008), the Malaysian Higher Education Ministry defined bumiputra as follows, depending on the region of origin of the individual applicant:&lt;ref name="being_mixed"&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| authorlink=| title=Being 'mixed' is no privilege| date=29 October 2009| publisher=| url=http://www.theborneopost.com/?p=60757| work=Borneo Post| pages=| accessdate=29 October 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101102147/http://www.theborneopost.com/?p=60757| archivedate=1 November 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sarawak]]
#* "If both of the parents are indigenous natives of Sarawak as stated in Article 161A (6)(a) Federal Constitution of Malaysia; thus their child is considered as a Bumiputra"

In addition to the interpretation given above, a broader definition of bumiputra include groups such as [[native Indonesians]], [[Malaysian Siamese]], Muslim Indian Malaysians, [[Peranakan]] and the [[Kristang people]] of Portuguese-Eurasian descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293951-c4204/Malaysia:The.People.Of.Malaysia.html "Malaysia: The People of Malaysia"], TripAdvisor&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these encompass communities that were established in southeast Asia prior to the arrival of the British colonialists who forever altered the demographics of Malaysia. Others{{who|date=July 2012}} favour a definition encompassing all children of Bumiputra; there have been notable cases of people with one Bumiputra parent and one non-Bumiputra parent being dismissed as non-Bumiputra.&lt;ref name="being_mixed"/&gt;

==History==
At the time of Malaya's independence from the British in 1957, the population included many first or second-generation immigrants who had come to fill colonial manpower needs as [[indentured labourer]]s. Chinese legal immigrants, who typically settled in urban areas, played a significant role in the commercial sector after the Indians left the country to return to India, many of the commercial sectors were sold to the Chinese immigrants. The [[Communities Liaison Committee]] (CLC), comprising leading politicians from different racial backgrounds, supported the promotion of economic equality for the Malays, conditional on political equality for the non-Malays. CLC member [[E.E.C. Thuraisingham]] later said, "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals."&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, James P. (1985). ''Nation-building in Malaysia 1946–1974'', pp. 82–84. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-582681-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] of the Constitution states that,

{{quote|It shall be the responsibility of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] to safeguard the special position of the Malays and natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak and the legitimate interests of other communities in accordance with the provisions of this Article.}}

[[Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 160]] defines a Malay as being one who "professes the religion of [[Islam]], habitually speaks the Malay language, conforms to Malay customs and is the child of at least one parent who was born within the Federation of Malaysia before independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957, or the issue (off-spring) of such a person."

[[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 8|Article 8]] of the Constitution, states that all Malaysian citizens shall be equal under the law, and "Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment." Article 153 itself expressly forbids particular forms of discrimination; clause 5 states that "All persons of whatever race in the same grade in the service of the Federation shall, subject to the terms and conditions of their employment, be treated impartially," while clause 9 states: "Nothing in this Article shall empower Parliament to restrict business or trade solely for the purpose of reservations for Malays."

The term of the Bumiputras' special position has been disputed. The [[Reid Commission]], which drafted the Constitution, initially proposed that Article 153 expire after 15 years unless renewed by [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]]{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}. This qualification was struck from the final draft. After the [[13 May Incident]] in 1969, representatives within the government argued over whether the special position of the bumiputras ought to have a [[sunset clause]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] argued that "the question be left to the Malays themselves because ... as more and more Malays became educated and gained self-confidence, they themselves would do away with this 'special position'." Ismail believed the special position was "a slur on the ability of the Malays."&lt;ref name="ismail bio 1"&gt;"Snag in policy implementation", ''New Straits Times'', 31 December 2006, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, however, one member of the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] said that Malay special rights would remain for "hundreds of years to come."&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Kit Siang (1978). ''Time Bombs in Malaysia'', p. 218 (2nd ed.). Democratic Action Party. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the government implemented the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), designed to be a more aggressive form of affirmative action for the Bumiputra than Article 153. Article 153 provides specifically for the use of quotas in the granting of scholarships, positions in the civil service, and business licences, as well as native reservations of land. Policies under the rubric of the NEP include subsidies for real estate purchases, quotas for public equity shares, and general subsidies to Bumiputra businesses.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] and his predecessor Dr. [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] have both suggested that Malays should depend less on government assistance. Many observers believe full abolition of bumiputra privileges is unlikely, especially in view of the constitutional issues involved, although successive administrations since Mahathir have attempted to reform the system of government aid for the bumiputra.{{Citation needed|reason=Aug 2009|date=August 2009}} Some bumiputra groups believe further affirmative action is necessary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] began to use the term ''bumiputra'' in 1965. Following debate of the act to create the [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]] (MARA), the government founded an agency to preserve bumiputra interests.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Chee Koon &amp; Vasil, Raj (ed., 1984). ''Without Fear or Favour'', p. 10. Eastern Universities Press. {{ISBN|967-908-051-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] said that the government would consider the request of the Muslim Indian community to be recognized as Bumiputera, in what is seen as a move to woo voters in the lead-up to the [[14th Malaysian general election| upcoming general election]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.todayonline.com/world/asia/putrajaya-study-indian-muslims-call-be-recognised-bumiputera&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
[[Image:OUM bumiputra.png|thumb|Some institutes of higher learning, such as the [[Open University Malaysia]], have enacted admission policies favouring bumiputra students.]]

Certain but not all pro-bumiputra policies exist as [[affirmative action]] for bumiputras, for NEP is racial-based and not deprivation-based. For instance, all Bumiputra, regardless of their financial standing, are entitled 7 percent discount on houses or property, including luxurious units; whilst a low-income non-Bumiputra receives no such financial assistance. Other preferential policies include quotas for the following: admission to government educational institutions, qualification for public scholarships, marking of universities exam papers, special bumiputras-only classes prior to university's end of term exams, for  positions in government, and ownership of businesses. Most of the policies were established in the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) period. Many policies focus on trying to achieve a bumiputra share of corporate equity, comprising at least 30% of the total. [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] proposed this target after the government was unable to agree on a suitable policy goal.&lt;ref name="ismail bio 1"/&gt;

In a report titled 2012 Investment Climate Statement - Malaysia published by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (US Department of State), under the heading "Ethnic Preferences", part of a paragraph succinctly describes the reality of such Bumiputra policy as follows:"Many of the preference policies are opaque, with details of implementation largely left to the various ministries and civil servants within those ministries. Policies and practices vary greatly. Some practices are explicit and contained in law or regulation, while others are informal, leaving much ambiguity for potential investors. The civil service itself is subject to Bumiputra hiring preferences. The NEM [New Economic Model] proposes reforming ethnic preferences in business ownership and social safety net programs. Some conservative Bumiputra groups have voiced strong opposition to any significant changes to the extensive preferences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2012/191191.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of such policies include:
* Companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (''Bursa Saham Kuala Lumpur'') must have 30% bumiputra ownership of equity to satisfy [[Stock exchange|listing requirements]]. Foreign companies that operate in Malaysia also must adhere to this requirement.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* For a limited period, a certain percentage of new housing in any development has to be sold to bumiputra owners. Housing developers are required to provide a minimum 7% discount to bumiputra buyers of these lots. This is required regardless of the income level of the potential buyer. Remaining unsold houses after a given time period are allowed to be sold to non-bumiputera if the developer proves attempts have been made to fulfill the requirement. There is no bumiputra discount on existing housing.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* A basket of government-run (and profit-guaranteed) [[mutual fund]]s are available for purchase by bumiputra buyers only. The ''Amanah Saham Nasional'' (ASN) has return rates approximately 3 to 5 times that of local commercial banks.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Many government-tendered projects require that companies submitting tenders be bumiputra owned. This requirement has led to non-bumiputras teaming up with bumiputra companies to obtain projects, in a practice known as "[[Ali Baba (Malaysia)|Ali Baba]]". Ali, the bumiputra, is included solely to satisfy this requirement, and Baba (the non-bumiputra) pays Ali a certain sum in exchange.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Projects were earmarked for bumiputra contractors to enable them to gain expertise in various fields.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Approved Permits (APs) for automobiles preferentially allow bumiputra to import vehicles. Automotive companies wishing to bring in cars need to have an AP to do so. APs were originally created to allow bumiputra participation in the automotive industry, since they were issued to companies with at least 70% bumiputra ownership. In 2004, ''The Edge'' (a business newspaper) estimated that APs were worth approximately RM 35,000 each. They also estimated that the late [[Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin SM Amin|Nasimuddin Amin]], the former chairman of the ''[[Naza]]'' group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car marquees are required to pay between 140% to 300% import duty.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As a result of these policies, many bumiputera with good connections quickly became millionaires. According to [[Rafidah Aziz|Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz]], former Minister of Trade and Industry, the policy was to create "Towering Malays". In 2005 she gave a speech that stated: "If there are young Malay entrepreneurs whose companies are successful, then we appreciate their success, we want Towering Malays of glokal (global and local) standard". She also said that the policy of [[Approved Permits]] (APs) had produced many bumiputera entrepreneurs in the automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}[https://archive.is/20070810220021/http://web5.bernama.com/events/umno2005/news.php?id=146744&amp;lang=en] &lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the Government has discussed phasing out certain affirmative action programs and reinstating "[[meritocracy]]". In 2003 it began the system of "Malaysian model meritocracy" for university admission. Admission to public universities was not based upon a common examination such as the [[SAT]] or [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]], but rather upon a two parallel systems of either a one-year matriculation course or a two-year STPM (Malaysian [[Higher School Certificate (Malaysia)|Higher School Certificate]]) programme. Bumiputras compose an overwhelming majority of entrants to the matriculation programme. It is a commonly-held belief that the public university entry requirements are easier for matriculation students and disproportionately difficult for STPM students.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Quotas also exist for Public Services Department (JPA) scholarships, full scholarships offered to students to study in leading universities worldwide. These scholarships are given on the basis of SPM (Malaysian Education Certificate, the equivalent of [[O-Level]]s) results, ethnic group, and certain quotas. The JPA scholars are sent to selected pre-university programmes offered by the government — from there, they apply to universities.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Controversy==

===Early debate===
In the 1965 session of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], [[Singapore]]'s [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] (who was also a Member of that Parliament) questioned the implementation of Malay rights as proposed. Lee asked, "How does the Malay in the ''[[kampung]]'' find his way out into this modernised civil society? By becoming servants of the 0.3 per cent who would have the money to hire them to clean their shoe, open their motorcar doors?" and "How does telling a Malay bus driver that he should support the party of his Malay director (UMNO) and the Chinese bus conductor to join another party of his Chinese director (MCA) — how does that improve the standards of the Malay bus driver and the Chinese bus conductor who are both workers in the same company?"&lt;ref name="lky"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/98/0925/cs2-4.html | work=CNN | title=Memoirs Of Lee Kwan Yew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee closed with "Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (2000).

===Present debate===
At the 2004 annual general assembly of the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which is the largest member of the governing coalition, deputy chair Badruddin Amiruldin cautioned against questioning the Bumiputras' special rights, which met with approval from the delegates: "Let no one from the other races ever question the rights of Malays on this land. Don’t question the religion because this is my right on this land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ioannis | last=Gatsiounis | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Abdullah stirs a hornets' nest | date=2 October 2004 | publisher= | url =http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FJ02Ae05.html | work =Asia Times | pages = | accessdate =8 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Mohd. Johari Baharum, parliamentary secretary of the Prime Minister's Department, stated that the PSD scholarships would remain quota based. He added that there were no plans to convert this to a merit based system, and that the total value of the PSD scholarship since 1996 was 2.4 billion [[Ringgit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/30623 |title=malaysiakini.com |publisher=malaysiakini.com |date=7 October 2004 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial aspect is that the [[Orang Asli]] of peninsular Malaysia are not considered Bumiputra under the Federal constitution. As their settlement predates that of the Malays, this is considered by many, that Bumiputra is about the promotion one religion over another, especially since Orang Asli are much worse off than Muslim Malays. Others argue that the [[Orang Asli]] are in fact considered Bumiputra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temiar.com/temiar.html |title=temiar.com |publisher=temiar.com |date= |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2009, Datuk [[Nik Aziz Nik Mat]], the spiritual leader of the opposition [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] stated that the term “bumiputera” is racist and the policy prevented other races from receiving government aid. Nik Aziz’s remarks were made in response to the criticisms and threats made by [[UMNO]] against [[Democratic Action Party]]’s Dr Boo Cheng Hau, the opposition leader in [[Johor]] when Dr Boo was reported to have compared “bumiputeraism” with state [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nik Aziz says ‘bumiputera’ term is racist |date=1 March 2009 |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/19428-nik-aziz-says-bumiputera-term-is-racist |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=1 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302051938/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/19428-nik-aziz-says-bumiputera-term-is-racist |archivedate=2 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2015, Swiss academic Dr [[Tariq Ramadan]] addresses on how the non Muslims have been treated as second class citizens. He stated: “I’m sorry but some of your fellow citizens in this country who are not Muslims are facing this discrimination, they are facing injustices.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Look in the mirror, Muslim don tells Malaysians critical of Western discrimination|date=1 February 2015| url =http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/look-in-the-mirror-muslim-don-tells-malaysians-critical-of-western-discrimi|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present condition of the Bumiputra==
In 2006, the then Minister of Higher Education, Mustapa Mohamad, has stated that he wants public universities to recruit more non-bumiputra academic staff to "strive for world-class institutions", which may signal a move toward less racial profiling in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goh |first=Leanne |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/30/nation/15280966&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023222954/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F8%2F30%2Fnation%2F15280966&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2007 |title=Archives &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=6 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the manufacturing sector is exempted from the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) Guidelines and the mandatory 30% Bumiputera equity and restrictions in market entry have been removed for all (manufacturing) sub-sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apec.org.au/amfta-Mansurpaper.pdf |title=amfta-Mansurpapar |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030162537/http://www.apec.org.au/amfta-Mansurpaper.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National identification card system and Bumiputera==
Malaysia requires citizens to carry a national identification card called [[MyKad]]. Smart Cards identify citizens as Muslims or Non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M.Krishnamoorthy |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2005/12/23/nation/12943878&amp;sec=nation |title=Easy step to amend religion in MyKad, The Star On-Line, BY M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">The '''Butterfly Peace Garden''' (BPG) is a non-governmental organization established in [[Batticaloa]] Sri Lanka in 1996. Since that time the BPG has provided counseling and support to children traumatized by civil conflict in the region. In late 2004 the BPG also became a centre for helping victims of the [[tsunami]] which devastated the Batticaloa area. The BPG and its staff have been supported by a variety of local and international agencies and charities, including the [[government]]s of [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]], WarChild International and Ashoka International, which named BPG co-founder Paul Hogan a fellow in 2003. 

Children are brought to the BPG each day from surrounding villages in groups that are mixed with respect to gender and ethnicity (e.g. children from Tamil and Muslim villages).  A typical program cycle runs one day a week for nine months and involves activities drawn from a range of visual, dramatic and musical arts.  Activities are conducted by adult animators skilled in one or more artistic discipline, who have in many cases experienced psychological wounds similar to those of the children who come to the BPG.  The BPG has for several years served as a model for innovative and effective programs for war-affected children, families and communities.

==History==

Centralized operations under COINTELPRO officially began in August 1956 with a program designed to "increase factionalism, cause disruption and win defections" inside the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA). Tactics included anonymous phone calls, [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) audits, and the creation of documents that would divide the American communist organization internally.&lt;ref name="Weiner 2012 195"/&gt; An October 1956 memo from Hoover reclassified the FBI's ongoing surveillance of black leaders, including it within COINTELPRO, with the justification that the movement was infiltrated by [[communists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=198|ps=: "On October 2, 1956, Hoover stepped up the FBI's long-standing surveillance of black civil rights activists. He sent a COINTELPRO memo to the field, warning that the Communist Party was seeking to infiltrate the movement." }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. [[T. R. M. Howard|T.R.M. Howard]], a [[civil rights]] leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of [[George W. Lee]], [[Emmett Till]], and other African Americans in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beito |first1=David T. |last2=Beito |first2=Linda Royster |date=2009 |title=Black Maverick: T.R.M.

After the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], Hoover singled out King as a major target for COINTELPRO. Under pressure from Hoover to focus on King, Sullivan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the light of King's powerful demagogic speech. ... We must mark him now if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Soon after, the FBI was systematically bugging King's home and his hotel rooms, as they were now aware that King was growing in stature daily as the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=236|ps=: "The bugs got quick results. When King traveled, as he did constantly in the ensuing weeks, to Washington, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, the Bureau planted hidden microphones in his hotel rooms. The FBI placed a total of eight wiretaps and sixteen bugs on King." }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, King began to publicly criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of [[terrorism]] by white supremacists. Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most "notorious liar" in the United States.&lt;ref name=Branch_1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Branch |first=Taylor |author-link=Taylor Branch |date=1999 |title=Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963–1965 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4165-5870-5 |oclc=933467815 |url={{google books|CUI6tY9RJUYC|plainurl=yes}} |via=Google Books |ref=harv |pages=524–529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1991 memoir, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' journalist [[Carl Rowan]] asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowan |first=Carl T. |author-link=Carl Rowan |date=1991 |title=Breaking Barriers: A Memoir |edition=1st |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-316-75977-9 |oclc=22110131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Historian [[Taylor Branch]] documents an anonymous November 21, 1964 "[[FBI–King suicide letter|suicide package]]" sent by the FBI that contained audio recordings, which were obtained through tapping King's phone and placing bugs throughout various hotel rooms over the past two years&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002&gt;{{cite book |last1=Churchill |first1=Ward |author1-link=Ward Churchill |last2=Vander Wall |first2=Jim |date=2002 |origyear=1990 |title=[[The COINTELPRO Papers]]: Documents from the FBI's Secret Wars Against Dissent in the United States |publisher=[[South End Press]] | isbn=978-0-89608-648-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was created two days after the announcement of King's impending [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; The tape, which was prepared by FBI audio technician John Matter&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; documented a series of King's sexual indiscretions combined with a letter telling him "There is only one way out for you.

DeLoach, commenced a media campaign offering the surveillance transcript to various news organizations including ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Newsday]]''.&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; And even by 1969, as has been noted elsewhere, "[FBI] efforts to 'expose' Martin Luther King Jr. had not slackened even though King had been dead for a year. [The Bureau] furnished ammunition to conservatives to attack King's memory, and...tried to block efforts to honor the slain leader."&lt;ref name=Branch_1999-527_9/&gt;

During the same period the program also targeted [[Malcolm X]]. While an FBI spokesman has denied that the FBI was "directly" involved in Malcolm's murder in 1965, it is documented that the Bureau worked to "widen the rift" between Malcolm and [[Elijah Muhammad]] through infiltration and the "sparking of acrimonious debates within the organization," rumor-mongering, and other tactics designed to foster internal disputes, which ultimately led to Malcolm's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branch|1999|p=243}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-05-14/news/0005140182_1_malcolm-x-kill-malcolm-muhammad |first=Gregory |last=Kane |title=FBI should acknowledge complicity in the assassination of Malcolm X |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |date=14 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI heavily infiltrated Malcolm's [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] in the final months of his life.

Amidst the urban unrest of July–August 1967, the FBI began "COINTELPRO–BLACK HATE", which focused on King and the SCLC as well as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)]], the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]], [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), and the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/101095_FBIBlackExtrOrgsPt1COINTELPRO.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guide to the Microfilm Edition of FBI Surveillance Files: Black Extremist Organizations, Part 1 |website=Lexis-Nexis |access-date=2014-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603094342/http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/101095_FBIBlackExtrOrgsPt1COINTELPRO.pdf# |archive-date=2013-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BLACK HATE established the [[Ghetto Informant Program]] and instructed 23 FBI offices to "disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate type organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 1968 memo stated the program's goal was to "prevent the coalition of militant black nationalist groups"; to "Prevent the RISE OF A '[[messiah|MESSIAH]]' who could unify...the militant black nationalist movement"; "to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence [against authorities]."; to "Prevent militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining RESPECTABILITY, by discrediting them to...both the responsible community and to liberals who have vestiges of sympathy..."; and to "prevent the long-range GROWTH of militant black organizations, especially among youth." Dr. King was said to have potential to be the "messiah" figure, should he abandon nonviolence and integrationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/814 |last=Hoover |first=J.

Individuals such as writers were also listed among the targets of operations.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990&gt;{{cite book |last1=Churchill |first1=Ward |author1-link=Ward Churchill |last2=Vander Wall |first2=Jim |date=1990 |title=The COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI's Secret Wars Against Domestic Dissent |location=Boston |publisher=[[South End Press]] |isbn=9780896083608 |oclc=21908953 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This program coincided with a broader federal effort to prepare military responses for [[urban riots]], and began increased collaboration between the FBI, [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The CIA launched its own domestic espionage project in 1967 called [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=272|ps=: "Some 1,500 army intelligence officers in civilian clothing undertook the surveillance of some 100,000 American citizens. Army intelligence shared all their reports over the next three years. The CIA tracked antiwar leaders and black militants who traveled overseas, and it reported back to the FBI. The FBI, in turn, shared thousands of selected files on Americans with army intelligence and the CIA. All three intelligence services sent the names of Americans to the National Security Agency for inclusion on a global watch list; the NSA relayed back to the FBI hundreds of transcripts of intercepted telephone calls to and from suspect Americans."}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A particular target was the [[Poor People's Campaign]], a national effort organized by King and the SCLC to occupy Washington, D.C. The FBI monitored and disrupted the campaign on a national level, while using targeted smear tactics locally to undermine support for the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKnight|1998|pp=26–28|ps=: "By March the Hoover Bureau's campaign against King was virtually on a total war footing. In a March 21 'urgent' teletype, Hoover urged all field offices involved in the POCAM project to exploit every tactic in the bureau's arsenal of covert political warfare to bring down King and the SCLC."}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Panther Party]] was another targeted organization, wherein the FBI collaborated to destroy the party from the inside out.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

Overall, COINTELPRO encompassed disruption and sabotage of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (1961), the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (1964), the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Black Panther Party]] (1967), and the entire [[New Left]] social/political movement, which included antiwar, community, and religious groups (1968). A later investigation by the Senate's [[Church Committee]] (see below) stated that "COINTELPRO began in 1956, in part because of frustration with Supreme Court rulings limiting the Government's power to proceed overtly against dissident groups."&lt;ref name="cfr3a"/&gt; Official congressional committees and several court cases&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1984738737F2d1_1738/HOBSON%20v.%20WILSON Hobson v. Wilson]'', 737&amp;nbsp;F.2d 1 (1984); ''[https://www.leagle.com/decision/2001791257F3d534_1744/RUGIERO%20v.%20U.S.%20DEPT.%20OF%20JUSTICE Rugiero v. U.S. Dept. of Justice]'', 257&amp;nbsp;F.3d 534, 546 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded that COINTELPRO operations against communist and socialist groups exceeded statutory limits on FBI activity and violated constitutional guarantees of [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of association|association]].&lt;ref name="church-final-report"/&gt;

===Program exposed===
[[File:One Vets Sq Media Delco PA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|The building broken into by the Citizen's Commission to Investigate the FBI, at One Veterans Square, Media, Pennsylvania]]
The program was secret until 1971, when the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burgled an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], took several dossiers, and exposed the program by passing this material to news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Johanna |date=18 May 2015 |title=1971: Citizens Who Exposed COINTELPRO |website=PBS: Independent Lens |url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/1971/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boxing match, known as the [[Fight of the Century]], between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]] in March 1971 provided cover for the activist group to successfully pull off the burglary; Muhammad Ali was himself a COINTELPRO target due to his involvement with the Nation of Islam and the anti-war movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Medsger|first=Betty|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/|title=In 1971, Muhammad Ali Helped Undermine the FBI's Illegal Spying on Americans|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news organizations initially refused to publish the information. Within the year, Director J. Edgar Hoover declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over, and that all future [[counterintelligence]] operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cassidy |first1=Mike |last2=Miller |first2=Will |date=May 26, 1999 |url=http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |title=A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO |website=Albion Monitor |publisher=Wayward Press Inc. |access-date=July 13, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104133/http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=293}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the FBI by [[NBC]] correspondent Carl Stern, the Socialist Workers Party, and a number of other groups. In 1976 the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, commonly referred to as the "[[Church Committee]]" for its chairman, Senator [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]], launched a major investigation of the FBI and COINTELPRO. Many released documents have been partly, or entirely, [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]].

The Final Report of the Select Committee castigated the conduct of the intelligence community in its domestic operations (including COINTELPRO) in no uncertain terms:

{{quote|The Committee finds that the domestic activities of the intelligence community at times violated specific statutory prohibitions and infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens. The legal questions involved in intelligence programs were often not considered. On other occasions, they were intentionally disregarded in the belief that because the programs served the "national security" the law did not apply. While intelligence officers on occasion failed to disclose to their superiors programs which were illegal or of questionable legality, the Committee finds that the most serious breaches of duty were those of senior officials, who were responsible for controlling intelligence activities and generally failed to assure compliance with the law.&lt;ref name="church-final-report"/&gt;

Many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity, but COINTELPRO went far beyond that ... the Bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of [[First Amendment]] rights of speech and association, on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence.&lt;ref name=cfr3a/&gt;}}

The Church Committee documented a history of the FBI exercising political repression as far back as World War I, through the 1920s, when agents were charged with rounding up "anarchists, communists, socialists, reformists and revolutionaries" for deportation. The domestic operations were increased against political and anti-war groups from 1936 through 1976.

==Intended effects==
The intended effect of the FBI's COINTELPRO was to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, or otherwise neutralize" groups that the FBI officials believed were "subversive"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deflam, Mathieu|title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond|publisher=Emerald Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt; by instructing FBI field operatives to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deflam, Mathieu|title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond|publisher=Emerald Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4|pages=184–185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Create a negative public image for target groups by surveiling activists and then releasing negative personal information to the public.

2. Break down internal organization by creating conflicts by having agents exacerbate racial tensions, or send anonymous letters to try to create conflicts.

3. Create dissension between groups by spreading rumors that other groups were stealing money.

4. Restrict access to public resources by pressuring non-profit organizations to cut off funding or material support.

5. Restrict the ability to organize protest.

6. Restrict the ability of individuals to participate in group activities by character assassinations, false arrests, surveillance.

==Range of targets==
At its inception, the program's main target was the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Marr]] in February 1996, [[Noam Chomsky]]—a political activist and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor of [[linguistics]]—spoke about the purpose and the targets of COINTELPRO, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks but by the national political police, the FBI, under four administrations... by the time it got through, I won't run through the whole story, it was aimed at the entire new left, at the women's movement, at the whole black movement, it was extremely broad. Its actions went as far as political assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|oG24vg8js4o}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Church Committee:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the "national security" or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power. Indeed, nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the Bureau believed they represented a "potential" for violence—and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in Vietnam were targeted because they gave "aid and comfort" to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause.

The imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included "a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black." Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-"Hate Group."

Furthermore, the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the [[National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee]] and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently "anti-Communist". The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from [[Antioch College]] ("vanguard of the New Left") to the New Mexico Free University and other "alternate" schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of surveillance, spanning all presidents from FDR to Nixon, both legal and illegal, contained in the Church Committee report:&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.ilstu.edu/~jkshapi/COINTELPRO.S.pdf Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his "national defense" policy and supporting Col. [[Charles Lindbergh]].
* [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] received inside information on a former Roosevelt aide's efforts to influence his appointments, labor union negotiating plans, and the publishing plans of journalists.
* [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] received reports on purely political and social contacts with foreign officials by [[Bernard Baruch]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]].
* The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had the FBI wiretap a congressional staff member, three executive officials, a lobbyist, and a Washington law firm. [[US Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] received the fruits of an FBI wire tap on [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and an electronic listening device targeting a congressman, both of which yielded information of a political nature.
* [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson]] asked the FBI to conduct "name checks" of his critics and members of the staff of his 1964 opponent, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. He also requested purely political intelligence on his critics in the Senate, and received extensive intelligence reports on political activity at the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] from FBI electronic surveillance.
* [[Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon]] authorized a program of wiretaps which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security, including information about a Supreme Court Justice.

The COINTELPRO operators targeted multiple groups at once, and encouraged splintering of these groups from within. In letter writing campaigns (wherein false letters were sent on behalf of members of parties), the FBI ensured that groups would not unite in their causes. For instance they, launched a campaign specifically to alienate the Black Panther Party from the Mau Maus, Young Lords, Young Patriots and SDS. These racially diverse groups had been building alliances, in part due to charismatic leaders such as Fred Hampton and his attempts to create a "Rainbow Coalition". The FBI was concerned with ensuring that groups could not gain traction through unity, specifically across racial lines. One of the main ways of targeting these groups was to arouse suspicion between the different parties and causes. In this way the bureau took on a divide and conquer offensive.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

The COINTELPRO documents show numerous cases of the FBI's intentions to prevent and disrupt protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. Many techniques were used to accomplish this task. "These included promoting splits among antiwar forces, encouraging [[red-baiting]] of socialists, and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive, peaceful demonstrations." One 1966 COINTELPRO operation tried to redirect the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, Nelson. ''COINTELPRO: The FBI's Secret War on Political Freedom'', Pathfinder, New York. 1975. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FBI]] has said that it no longer undertakes COINTELPRO or COINTELPRO-like operations. However, critics have claimed that agency programs in the spirit of COINTELPRO targeted groups such as the [[Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador]],&lt;ref&gt;Gelbspan, Ross.

According to attorney Brian Glick in his book ''War at Home'', the FBI used five main methods during COINTELPRO:
# '''Infiltration:''' Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit, disrupt and negatively redirect action. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
# '''Psychological warfare:''' The FBI and police used myriad "dirty tricks" to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used [[bad-jacketing]] to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

# '''Harassment via the legal system:''' The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, "investigative" interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.&lt;ref name="icdc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIc.htm|title=The FBI'S Covert Action Program to Destroy the Black Panther Party|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/html/ChurchB3_0001a.htm|title=Assassination Archive and Research Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Illegal force:''' The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt; The objective was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.
# '''Undermine public opinion:''' One of the primary ways the FBI targeted organizations was by challenging their reputations in the community and denying them a platform to gain legitimacy. Hoover specifically designed programs to block leaders from "spreading their philosophy publicly or through the communications media". Furthermore, the organization created and controlled negative media meant to undermine black power organizations. For instance, they oversaw the creation of "documentaries" skillfully edited to paint the Black Panther Party as aggressive, and false newspapers that spread misinformation about party members. The ability of the FBI to create distrust within and between revolutionary organizations tainted their public image and weakened chances at unity and public support.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

The FBI specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black power movement, for example between the Black Panthers and the [[US Organization]]. For instance, the FBI sent a fake letter to the US Organization exposing a supposed Black Panther plot to murder the head of the US Organization, Ron Karenga. They then intensified this by spreading falsely attributed cartoons in the black communities pitting the Black Panther Party against the US Organization.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt; This resulted in numerous deaths, among which were San Diego Black Panther Party members John Huggins, Bunchy Carter and Sylvester Bell.&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt; Another example of the FBI's annonymous letter writing campaign is how they turned the Blackstone Rangers head, Jeff Fort, against former ally Fred Hampton, by stating that Hampton had a hit on Fort.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt; They also were instrumental in developing the rift between Black Panther Party leaders Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, as executed through false letters inciting the two leaders of the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

[[Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad|Dhoruba Bin Wahad]] a former Black Panther, reflects on how these tactics made him feel, saying he had a combat mentality and felt like he was at war with the government. When asked about why he thinks the Black Panthers were targeted he said, "In the United States, the equivalent of the military was the local police. During the early sixties, at the height of the civil rights movement, and the human rights movement, the police in the United States became increasingly militaristic. They began to train out of military bases in the United States. The Law Enforcement Assistance Act supplied local police with military technology, everything from assault rifles to army personnel carriers. In his opinion, the Counterintelligence Program went hand-in-hand with the militarization of the police in the Black community, with the militarization of police in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad |last=Bin Wahad |first=Dhoruba |authorlink2=Mumia Abu-Jamal |first2=Mumia |last2=Abu-Jamal |first3=Assata |last3=Shakur |authorlink3=Assata Shakur |title=Still Black, Still Strong |publisher=[[Semiotext(e)]] |date=1993 |pages=18–19 |isbn=978-0936756745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI also conspired with the police departments of many U.S. cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago) to encourage repeated raids on Black Panther homes—often with little or no evidence of violations of federal, state, or local laws—which resulted directly in the police killing many members of the Black Panther Party, most notably Chicago Black Panther Party Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] on December 4, 1969.&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI Secrets 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Elaine |title=A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story |publisher=New York: Doubleday |date=1992 |pages=204–06 |isbn=978-0385471077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the death of Hampton long-term infiltrator, William O'Neal, shared floor plans of his apartment with the COINTELPRO team. He then gave Hampton a dose of secobarbital that rendered Hampton unconscious during the raid on his home.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

In order to eliminate black militant leaders whom they considered dangerous, the FBI is believed to have worked with local police departments to target specific individuals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/doc156.gif Paul Wolf, "COINTELPRO"], ICDC&lt;/ref&gt; accuse them of crimes they did not commit, suppress exculpatory evidence and falsely incarcerate them. [[Elmer Pratt|Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt]], a Black Panther Party leader, was incarcerated for 27 years before a California Superior Court vacated his murder conviction, ultimately freeing him. Appearing before the court, an FBI agent testified that he believed Pratt had been framed, because both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department knew he had not been in the area at the time the murder occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/10/pratt.release/ |publisher=CNN |title=Former Black Panther freed after 27 years in jail |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKqQinXr?url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/10/pratt.release/ |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/law/inrepratt82CalRptr2d260.htm|title=In re Pratt, 82 Cal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 the FBI special agent in San Francisco wrote Hoover that his investigation of the Black Panther Party had concluded that in his city, at least, the Panthers were primarily engaged in feeding breakfast to children. Hoover fired back a memo implying the agent's career goals would be directly affected by his supplying evidence to support Hoover's view that the Black Panther Party was "a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means".&lt;ref&gt;FBI document, 27 May 1969, "Director FBI to SAC San Francisco", available at the FBI reading room.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover supported using false claims to attack his political enemies. In one memo he wrote: "Purpose of counterintelligence action is to disrupt the Black Panther Party and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge."&lt;ref&gt;FBI document, 16 September 1970, Director FBI to SAC's in Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], San Francisco, and Washington Field Office.

In one particularly controversial 1965 incident, white civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]] was murdered by [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was [[Gary Thomas Rowe]], an acknowledged FBI informant.&lt;ref name="The Informant"&gt;Gary May, The Informant: The FBI, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Luzzo, Yale University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001422_pf.html |work=The [[Washington Post]] |title=Jonathan Yardley |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKqS0VOK?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001422_pf.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI spread rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the [[Communist Party]] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with [[African Americans]] involved in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name="uua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |author=Joanne Giannino |work=Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography |accessdate=2008-09-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227131648/http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html# |archivedate=2008-12-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlRearview Mirror"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427180231/http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archivedate=1999-04-27 |title=The Detroit housewife who moved a nation toward racial justice |author=Kay Houston |work= [[The Detroit News]], Rearview Mirror }}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI records show that [[J.

FBI informant Rowe has also been implicated in some of the most violent crimes of the 1960s civil rights era, including attacks on the [[Freedom Riders]] and the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]].&lt;ref name="The Informant" /&gt;

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], in another instance in [[San Diego]], the FBI financed, armed, and controlled an extreme right-wing group of former [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|Minutemen]], transforming it into a group called the Secret Army Organization that targeted groups, activists, and leaders involved in the Anti-War Movement, using both intimidation and violent acts.&lt;ref name="chomsky.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://osdir.com/ml/culture.discuss.cia-drugs/2005-10/msg00404.html Watergate and the Secret Army Organization - msg#00404 - culture.discuss.cia-drugs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crca.ucsd.edu/~esisco/friendlyfire/A1972.html|title=1972|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover ordered preemptive action "to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence."&lt;ref name="WRH"/&gt;

==Illegal surveillance==
The final report of the [[Church Committee]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been illegally collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret and biased informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone "bugs", surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of [[American citizen]]s. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous—and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations—have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.

Groups and individuals have been assaulted, repressed, harassed and disrupted because of their political views, social beliefs and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory, harmful and vicious tactics have been employed—including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.

Governmental officials—including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law—have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law.

The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them.&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Book II, Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities United States Senate (Church Committee)|publisher=United States Senate|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019170937/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tapped Out Why Congress won't get through to the NSA.|work=Slate |date=February 2, 2006 |author=Patrick Radden Keefe |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135325/|accessdate=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-COINTELPRO operations==
While COINTELPRO was officially terminated in April 1971, domestic espionage continued.&lt;ref&gt;Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz. ''The Price of Dissent: Testimonies to Political Repression in America''. University of California Press, 2001: "Although the FBI officially discontinued COINTELPRO immediately after the Pennsylvania disclosures 'for security reasons,' when pressed by the Senate committee, the bureau acknowledged two new instances of 'Cointelpro-type' operations. The committee was left to discover a third, apparently illegal operation on its own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74beCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=judi+bari,+assassination,+cointelpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW96-6nLvbAhUm0FkKHXOnCysQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=judi%20bari,%20assassination,%20cointelpro&amp;f=false|title=The FBI Encyclopedia|last=Newton|first=Michael|date=2012-01-16|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9781476604176|location=|pages=143–146|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athan G. Theoharis, et al. ''The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide.'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999: "More recent controversies have focused on the adequacy of recent restrictions on the Bureau's domestic intelligence operations. Disclosures of the 1970s that FBI agents continued to conduct break-ins, and of the 1980s that the FBI targeted CISPES, again brought forth accusations of FBI abuses of power—and raised questions of whether reforms of the 1970s had successfully exorcised the ghost of FBI Director Hoover."&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1974, it is documented that the Bureau planted over 500 bugs without a warrant and opened over 2,000 pieces of personal mail. More recent targets of covert action include the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), [[Earth First!]], and [[Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador|Committees in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91FyAJDjAvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=glenn+fine.+cointelpro.+patriot+act.+letters&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3u7yGiMrbAhVIQ6wKHZFoCBgQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=COINTELPRO&amp;f=false|title=Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: An Encyclopedia of American Espionage|last=Hastedt|first=Glenn P.|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851098071|location=|pages=180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] show that the FBI tracked the late [[David Halberstam]]—a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and author—for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Associated Press]], {{cite news |title=FBI tracked journalist for over 20 years |work=Toronto Star |date=November 7, 2008 |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/533203 |accessdate=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Counterterrorism" guidelines implemented during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] have been described as allowing a return to COINTELPRO tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz.

The '''Calmfors–Driffill hypothesis''' is a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory in [[labour economics]] that states that there is a direct relationship between the degree of [[collective bargaining]] in an economy and the level of unemployment.  Specifically, it states that the relationship is roughly that of an 'inverted U': as [[trade union]] size increases from nil, unemployment increases, and then falls as unions begin to exercise [[monopoly]] power.  It was advanced by [[Lars Calmfors]] and [[John Driffill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Calmfors |first=Lars |last2=Driffill |first2=John |title=Bargaining Structure, Corporatism and Macroeconomic Performance |journal=[[Economic Policy (journal)|Economic Policy]] |volume=3 |issue=6 |year=1988 |pages=13–61 |jstor=1344503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale is related to [[Mancur Olson]]'s idea, from ''The Rise and Decline of Nations'', that organised interests are at their most harmful when they do not internalise significant amounts of the costs they impose on society, but become less harmful as their interest becomes encompassing enough to suffer the costs.

[[File:Cers-spot-prices-2012.svg|thumb|Certified emission reduction units (CERs) monthly spot prices 2012]]
'''Certified Emission Reductions''' (CERs) are a type of emissions unit (or [[carbon credit]]s) issued by the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) Executive Board for emission reductions achieved by CDM projects and verified by a DOE (Designated Operational Entity) under the rules of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. 

CERs can be used by [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex 1]] countries in order to comply with their emission limitation targets or by operators of installations covered by the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) in order to comply with their obligations to surrender [[EU Allowances]], CERs or [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs) for the [[greenhouse gas|{{CO2}} emissions]] of their installations. CERs can be held by governmental and private entities on electronic accounts with the UN. 

CERs can be purchased from the primary market (purchased from an original party that makes the reduction) or secondary market (resold  from a marketplace).

At present, most of the approved CERs are recorded in CDM Registry accounts only. It is only when the CER is actually sitting in an operator's trading account that its value can be monetized through being traded.  The UNFCCC's International Transaction Log has already validated and transferred CERs into the accounts of some national climate registries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/pressrelease_itl_go-live_english.pdf Central cornerstone of Kyoto Protocol’s electronic emissions trading system in place] UNFCCC&lt;/ref&gt; although European operators are waiting for the [[European Commission]] to facilitate the transfer of their units into the registries of their Member States.

Temporary CERs and Long CERs are special types of CERs issued for forestry projects. They are two ways of accounting for non-permanence in forestry CDM project activities. Temporary CER or tCER is a CER issued for an afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM which expires at the end of the commitment period following the one during which it was issued. Long-term CER or lCER is a CER issued for an afforestation or reforestation project activity which expires at the end of its crediting period.&lt;ref name="Kyotodecisions"&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cmp1/eng/08a01.pdf Decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol], Report of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol on its first session, held at Montreal from 28 November to 10 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 prices for CERS were $20 a tonne. By September 2012, prices for CERS had collapsed to below $5. This was in response to the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone debt crisis]] reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]].

A '''courtier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔːr|t|i|ər}}; {{IPA-fr|kuʁtje|lang}}) is a person who is often in attendance at the [[Court (royal)|court]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch or other royal personage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/courtier ''Courtier'']&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest historical examples of courtiers were part of the [[retinues]] of rulers. Historically the court was the centre of [[government]] as well as the [[Official residence|residence]] of the monarch, and the social and political life were often completely mixed together.

==Description==
[[File:A disgruntled courtier compares himself to a Brahmin.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a Persian courtier]]
[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]]]]
Monarchs very often expected the more important nobles to spend much of the year in attendance on them at court. Not all courtiers were [[Nobility|noble]], as they included [[clergy]], [[soldier]]s, [[clerk (position)|clerk]]s, [[secretary|secretaries]], agents and middlemen with business at court. All those who held a [[court appointment]] could be called courtiers but not all courtiers held positions at court. Those personal favourites without business around the monarch, sometimes called the [[camarilla]], were also considered courtiers. As social divisions became more rigid, a divide, barely present in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or the [[Middle Ages]], opened between menial servants and other classes at court, although [[Alexandre Bontemps]], the head [[valet de chambre]] of [[Louis XIV]], was a late example of a "menial" who managed to establish his family in the nobility. The key commodities for a courtier were access and information, and a large court operated at many levels:  many successful careers at court involved no direct contact with the monarch.

The largest and most famous European court was that of the [[Palace of Versailles]] at its peak, although the [[Forbidden City]] of [[Beijing]] was even larger and more isolated from national life. Very similar features marked the courts of all very large monarchies, including in [[List of Indian monarchs|India]], [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Byzantium]] or the [[Caliph]]s of [[Baghdad]] or [[Cairo]]. Early medieval European [[Court (royal)|courts]] frequently travelled from place to place following the monarch as he travelled. This was particularly the case in the early French court. But, the [[European nobility]] generally had independent power and was less controlled by the monarch until around the 18th century, which gave European court life greater complexity.

==History==
The earliest courtiers coincide with the development of definable courts beyond the rudimentary entourages or [[retinues]] of rulers. There were probably courtiers in the courts of the [[Akkadian Empire]] where there is evidence of court appointments such as that of [[Cup-bearer]] which was one of the earliest court appointments and remained a position at courts for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radner|first1=Karen|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture|date=22 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-955730-1|pages=358–379}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the earliest titles referring to the general concept of a courtier were likely the ''ša rēsi'' and ''mazzāz pāni'' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groß|first1=Melanie|last2=Pirngruber|first2=Reinhard|title=On Courtiers in the Neo-Assyrian Empire: ša rēsi and mazzāz pāni|journal=Imperium and Officium Working Papers (IOWP)|date=September 2014|url=http://iowp.univie.ac.at/sites/default/files/IOWP_groß:pirngruber_courtiers.pdf|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The courts influenced by the court of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] such as those of the [[Median Empire]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]] had numerous courtiers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dandamayev|first1=Muhammad|title=Courts And Courtiers.

The [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|imperial court]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] at [[Constantinople]] would eventually contain at least a thousand courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Byzantine Court Culture from 829 to 1204|last = Kazhdan|first = Alexander P.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1995|isbn = 9780884023081|pages = 175|last2 = McCormick|first2 = Michael|editor-first = Henry|editor-last = Maguire|chapter = The Social World of the Byzantine Court|chapter-url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic450602.files/McCormickM1997.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's systems became prevalent in other courts such as those in the [[Balkans|Balkan]] states, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New approaches to Balkan studies|last = Angelov|first = Dimiter G.|publisher = Brassey's|year = 2003|isbn = 1574887246|pages = 3, 11|chapter = Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantinism]] is a term that was coined for this spread of the Byzantine system in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New approaches to Balkan studies|last = Angelov|first = Dimiter G.|publisher = Brassey's|year = 2003|isbn = 1574887246|pages = 8|chapter = Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, the term is often used metaphorically for contemporary political [[favourite]]s or hangers-on.

==In literature==
In modern literature, courtiers are often depicted as insincere, skilled at flattery and intrigue, ambitious and lacking regard for the national interest. More positive representations include the role played by members of the court in the development of politeness and the arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Data activism is a social practice that is becoming more well-known with the expansion of technology, open-sourced software and the ability to communicate beyond an individual's immediate community. The culture of data activism emerged from previous forms of [[media activism]], such as hacker movements. A defining characteristic of data activism is that ordinary citizens can participate, in comparison to previous forms of media activism where elite skill sets were required to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milan|first1=Stefania|title=Data activism as the new frontier of media activism|journal=Shaping Inquiry in Culture, Communication and Media Studies|date=2016|volume=Media Activism|url=https://www.academia.edu/20044875/Data_activism_as_the_new_frontier_of_media_activism?auto=download|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data activism can be the act of providing data on events or issues that individuals feel have not been properly addressed by those in power. For example, the first deployment of the [[Ushahidi]] platform in 2008 in Kenya visualized the post-electoral violence that had been silenced by the government and the new media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Miren|title=Data activism and social change|date=2018|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=London|isbn=978-3-319-78319-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The social practice of data activism revolves around the idea that data is political in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures &amp; Their Consequences|date=2014|publisher=Sage|location=London|isbn=978-1-4462-8747-7|pages=165–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data activism allows individuals to quantify a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milan|first1=Stefania|title=Data activism as the new frontier of media activism|journal=Shaping Inquiry in Culture, Communication and Media Studies|date=2016|volume=Media Activism|url=https://www.academia.edu/20044875/Data_activism_as_the_new_frontier_of_media_activism?auto=download|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By collecting data for a particular purpose, it allows data activists to quantify and expose specific issues.

== Types ==
A twofold classification of data activism has been proposed by Stefania Milan and Miren Gutiérrez&lt;ref name=MEDIACIONES2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milan|first=Stefania|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Miren|date=2015-10-08|title=Citizens' Media Meets Big Data: The Emergence of Data Activism|url=http://biblioteca.uniminuto.edu/ojs_desa/index.php/med/article/view/1086|journal=MEDIACIONES|language=es|volume=0|issue=14|pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later explored more in-depth by Stefania Milan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milan|first=Stefania|date=2016-01-31|title=Data Activism as the New Frontier of Media Activism|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2882030|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, according to the type of activists' engagement with data politics. 'Re-active data activism' can be characterized as motivated by the perception of massive data collection as a threat, whereas 'pro-active data activism' sees the increasing availability of data as an opportunity to foster social change. These differentiated approaches to datafication result in different repertoires of action, which are not at odds with each other, since they share a crucial feature: they take information as a constitutive force capable of shaping social reality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/83980106|title=Change of state : information, policy, and power|last=Sandra.|first=Braman,|date=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262025973|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=83980106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contribute to generate new alternative ways of interpreting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milan|first=Stefania|last2=Velden|first2=Lonneke van der|date=2016-12-01|title=The Alternative Epistemologies of Data Activism|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/dcs.2016.2.issue-2/dcs-2016-0205/dcs-2016-0205.xml|journal=Digital Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.14361/dcs-2016-0205|issn=2364-2122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of re-active data activism include the development and usage of encryption and anonymity networks to resist corporate or state surveillance, while instances of pro-active data activism include projects in which data is mobilized to advocate for change and contest established social narratives.&lt;ref name=MEDIACIONES2015 /&gt; 

== Examples ==

=== End the Backlog ===
It was discovered that in the United States between 180,000 and 500,000 [[rape kits]] were left unprocessed in storage in forensic warehouses.&lt;ref name ="Oconnor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prevost O'Connor|first1=Katherine L.|title=Eliminating the Rape-Kit Backlog: Bringing Necessary Changes to the Criminal Justice System|journal=UMKC Law Review 7.1|date=2003|volume=72|pages=193–214|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc72&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registration and entry of criminal DNA had been inconsistent, which caused this large backlog in date rape kits. The delay in analysing these DNA samples would approximately be six months to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prevost O'Connor|first1=Katherine L.|title=Eliminating the Rape-Kit Backlog: Bringing Necessary Changes to the Criminal Justice System|journal=UMKC Law Review 7.1|date=2003|volume=72|page=196|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc72&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information from rape kits was mean to be entered into the forensic warehouse database, but there was a disconnect between the warehouse system and the national DNA database Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) that left these rape kits unexamined. Testing these rape kits is important in identifying and prosecuting offenders, recognizing serial rapists, and providing justice for rape victims.&lt;ref name ="Oconnor"/&gt; The Ending the Backlog Initiative brought attention to this issue by demanding that the data from these rape kits be processed. It was this initiative that brought this issue to the attention of the United States government, who began stated that this was unacceptable and put $79 million in grants would be used to help eliminate the backlog of rape kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maloney joins Vice President Biden, Attorney General Lynch, and Manhattan DA Vance to announce grants to reduce rape kit DNA testing backlog|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1711123150|website=Congressional Documents and Publications|publisher=Federal Information &amp; News Dispatch, Inc.|location=Lanham|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantification of this data changed the ways in which the public perceived the process of analysing rape kits. This data was then used to gain the attention of politicians.

== Criticism ==
While data activists may have good intentions, one criticism is that by allowing citizens to generate data without training or reliable forms of measurement, the data can be skewed or presented in different forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abe|first1=Yasuhito|title=Safecast or the Production of Collective Intelligence on Radiation Risks after 3.11|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=2014|volume=12|issue=7|page=5|url=http://apjjf.org/-Yasuhito--Abe-/4077/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safecast ===
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in 2011, [[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]] was an organization established by a group of citizens that were concerned about high levels of radiation in the area. After receiving conflicting messages about levels of radiation from different media sources and scientists, individuals were uncertain which information was the most reliable. This brought about a movement where citizens would use [[Geiger counter]] readings to measure levels of radiation and circulate that data over the internet so that it was accessible by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abe|first1=Yasuhito|title=Safecast or the Production of Collective Intelligence on Radiation Risks after 3.11|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=February 2014|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1–10|url=http://apjjf.org/-Yasuhito--Abe-/4077/article.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safecast was developed as a means of producing multiple sources of data on radiation. It was assumed that if the data was collected by similar Geiger counter measurements in mass volume, the data produced was likely to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abe|first1=Yasuhito|title=Safecast or the Production of Collective Intelligence on Radiation Risks after 3.11|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=2014|volume=12|issue=7|page=5|url=http://apjjf.org/-Yasuhito--Abe-/4077/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safecast allows individuals to download the raw radiation data, but Safecast also visualizes the data. The data that is used to create a visual map is processed and categorized by Safecast. This data is different from the raw radiation data because it has been filtered, which presents the data in a different way than the raw data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abe|first1=Yasuhito|title=Safecast or the Production of Collective Intelligence on Radiation Risks after 3.11|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=2014|volume=12|issue=7|page=5|url=http://apjjf.org/-Yasuhito--Abe-/4077/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in presentation of data may alter the information that individuals take from it, which can pose a threat if misunderstood.

The '''Federal Desktop Core Configuration''' is a list of [[Computer security|security]] settings recommended by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for general-purpose [[microcomputers]] that are connected directly to the network of a [[List of United States federal agencies|United States government agency]].

The FDCC is a list of agreed upon Microsoft Windows operating system common core system functions, applications, files, and services that are changed in their configuration around which a framework for a more secure, and security-reliable MS Windows operating system was created. The standards were then made mandatory for every federal government computer effective Feb 1, 2008. If you wanted to connect to a federal office computer network your system had to meet or exceed the FDCC standard or you were denied access.

FDCC applied only to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] desktop and laptop computers and was replaced by the [[United States Government Configuration Baseline]] (USGCB), which included settings for Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

For Windows 7, the NIST changed the naming convention to the US Government Computer Baseline (USGCB ver 2.0). In addition to un-classifying a general Windows settings guide, the NIST also publishes guides specifically for Windows Firewall, Internet Explorer, and a guide (Vista-Energy, for example) created to capture settings that adhere to energy conservation policies.

==History==
On 20 March 2007 the [[Office of Management and Budget]] issued a memorandum instructing United States government agencies to develop plans for using the Microsoft Windows XP and Vista security configurations.&lt;ref name="faq13"&gt;{{Cite web

--&gt;
The FDCC baseline was developed (and is maintained) by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in collaboration with [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], [[United States Department of the Interior|DOI]], [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt; with input from [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|public comment]].&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; It applies to Windows XP Professional and Vista  systems only&amp;mdash;these security policies are not tested (and according to the NIST, will not work) on Windows 9''x''/ME/NT/2000 or Windows Server 2003.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt;

Major Version 1.1 (released 31 October 2008) had no new or changed settings, but expanded SCAP reporting options.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; As with all previous versions, the standard is applicable to general-purpose workstations and laptops for [[End-user (computer science)|end user]]s. Windows XP and Vista systems in use as servers are exempt from this standard. Also exempt are [[Embedded system|embedded computer]]s and "special purpose" systems (defined as specialized [[Computational science|scientific]], [[Health informatics|medical]], [[Programmable logic controller|process control]], and experimental systems), though {{abbr|NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology}} still recommends that FDCC security configuration be considered "where feasible and appropriate".&lt;ref name="faq1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q1|title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Is FDCC applicable to special purpose (e.g., scientific, medical, process control, and experimental systems) computers?|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|work=National Vulnerability Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDCC settings, generally speaking, block open connections in operating systems, disables functions, disables rarely used applications in the SOHO environment, disables unnecessary services, changes permissions on items, changes the way log files are collected and recorded, affects Group Policy Object (GPO) settings, and alters entries in the Windows system registry.

InfoWeek introduced the FDCC to mostly administrators and engineers with the article titled ‘The Feds Don’t Allow It. Should You?’ written by Kelly Jackson Higgins of DarkReading.com and published on February 4, 2008.

Due to the complexity of the guidelines response initially was slow. Implementation took time while the settings were internally researched by both government and enterprise implementation techs. The NIST and the NSA published guidelines in hundreds-of-page texts and introduced what they called SCAP files for applications. (See Wikipedia SCAP page)

The Windows platform was built for easy interoperability and networking and therefore left opportunities within the operating systems for all types of auto- and semi-automatic connections to other computers.  These weren’t flaws or programming mistakes, it was purposefully built that way. An example of this can be found by looking at the Windows Remote Connection program which is ''enabled by default'' after a typical Windows operating system installation.  The FDCC/USGCB configuration, for instance, reverses that setting so that you have to manually re-enable to allow remote connections.

==Requirements==
Organizations required to document FDCC [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] can do so by using [[Security Content Automation Protocol|SCAP]] tools.

There are 600+ settings in the average FDCC/USGCB document – but not all of them are usable for the average small or home office (SOHO) computer. For instance, released on 20 June 2008, FDCC Major Version 1.0 specifies 674 settings.&lt;ref name="download"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C download page
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/download_fdcc.cfm
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "all wireless interfaces should be disabled".&lt;ref name="faq10"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Are there any conditions under which wireless is allowed?
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q10
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition that not all recommended settings will be practical for every system, exceptions (such as "authorized enterprise wireless networks") can be made if documented in an FDCC deviation report.&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="faq10" /&gt;

Strict implementation of all of the recommended settings has been known to cause usability issues. The NIST publishes a list of known issues and it can be found here (&lt;nowiki&gt;https://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/microsoft_content.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  There are a few third-party software vendors that have emerged that claim to have tested settings in a SOHO environment however, at this time, the general public still remains relatively unaware of the FDCC and USGCB security settings developed and put forward by the NIST.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18988">The basic law of the [[suffrage|electoral franchise]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] is Article 16 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], which states who can vote for [[Dáil Éireann]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Oireachtas]] or parliament. [[Irish citizen]]s who are Dáil electors have the right to vote in [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|all other elections]], though not conversely.

==Before independence==
In the pre-1801 [[Irish House of Commons]], the [[forty-shilling freehold]] was used in [[county constituencies]], while [[borough constituencies]] were mostly [[rotten borough]]s with closed electorates. [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholics]] were explicitly disenfranchised from the [[Disenfranchising Act]] of 1727 to 1793, although earlier [[penal laws]] had effectively prevented Catholics from voting:&lt;ref name="Johnston-Liik2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston-Liik|first=E. M.|title=Commons, Constituencies and Statutes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NyIAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 December 2015|series=History of the Irish Parliament 1692-1800|volume=Vol.VI|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation|isbn=9781903688717|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1703 [[Popery Act]] required an [[oath of abjuration]] which most found incompatible with their faith,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433035265143;view=1up;seq=62 2 Anne c.6 s.24]; Simms 1960, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1716 act required this oath at least six months before an election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433035265143;view=1up;seq=451 2 George I c.19 s.7]; Simms 1960, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Act of Union 1800]] to the 1922 creation of the [[Irish Free State]], Irish electoral law was largely the same as [[Elections in the United Kingdom#History|contemporary British law]]. One difference was that [[voter registration]] was every eight years in Ireland instead of annually.&lt;ref name="ball2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ball |first1=Stephen |title=The Irish dimension |url=https://victoriancommons.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/the-irish-dimension/ |website=The Victorian Commons |accessdate=20 September 2018 |date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], which allowed Catholics to stand for Parliament, also increased the freeholder qualification from forty shillings (two pounds) to ten pounds, reducing the [[county constituencies]] electorate from c.216,000 to c.37,000.&lt;ref name="ball2013"/&gt; This was a quid-pro-quo to secure support from Protestants afraid of being overwhelmed by votes of less well-off Catholics.&lt;ref name="ball2013"/&gt; The [[Irish Reform Act 1832]]  was vaguely worded and provoked numerous court cases, although the ancillary [[Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1832]] increased the total electorate from c.75,000 to c.90,000.&lt;ref name="ball2013"/&gt; In the wake of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], the [[Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1850]] quadrupled the electorate.&lt;ref name="ball2013"/&gt;

From 1836, members of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] (DMP) were not allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1836/act/13/enacted/en/print.html|title=Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1836|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|nopp=Y|page=sec.18|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1836/act/29/enacted/en/print|title=Dublin Police Act, 1836|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|nopp=Y|page=sec.19|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to preserve the impression of the forces' political impartiality.&lt;ref name="dail1922111500037"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1922111500037#N32|title=Disqualifications — Committee Stage|date=15 November 1922|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police in England and Wales were enfranchised from 1887, this did not extend to Ireland.&lt;ref name="Emsley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=Clive|title=The English Police: A Political and Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhCPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|accessdate=21 December 2015|date=2014-09-19|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317890232|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Police Disabilities Removal Acts 1887 and 1893 (franchise for parliamentary and local elections respectively)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coakley |first1=John |last2=Gallagher |first2=Michael |title=Politics in the Republic of Ireland |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317312697 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=oW5ADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 September 2018 |page=30 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] developed [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|as in Great Britain]]. In England and Wales, [[Local Government Act 1894|an 1894 act]] allowed women to vote for the local authorities [[Local Government Act 1888|established in 1888]]; the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] replicated both the 1888 authorities and the 1894 suffrage in Ireland. The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] allowed all men over 21 and most women over 30 to vote in parliamentary elections. The [[Second Dáil]] resolved to hold [[Irish general election, 1922|a general election in June 1922]] for an assembly which would be both the [[Third Dáil]] of the soon-to-be-defunct [[Irish Republic]] and a Provisional Parliament for the nascent [[Irish Free State]]. The republican minority wanted the franchise for this election to be equal for men and women, but the pro-Free State majority argued it was impractical and unlawful to change the 1918 franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-03-02/23/|title=Irishwomen and the Franchise|date=2 Mar 1922|work=Dáil Éireann (2nd Dáil)|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides were motivated by the belief that young women tended to be republican.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Cal|title=Cumann na mBan and the Irish Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOtFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT304|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2007-04-03|publisher=Collins Press|isbn=9781848898608|chapter=Division and Civil War 1921–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Dáil did agree that, if [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|the post-election government]], which was [[responsible government|responsible]] to the new assembly, were to collapse, the consequent election would be on "Adult Suffrage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-05-20/2/|title=National Coalition Panel : Joint Statement|date=20 May 1922|work=Dáil Éireann (2nd Dáil)|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since independence==
{{seealso|Elections in the Republic of Ireland}}
The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] reduced the voting age for women in elections for [[Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house) from 30 to 21, the same as for men.&lt;ref name="const1922a14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=10 December 2015|nopp=Y|pages=Article 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was retained by the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1972070500006|title=Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1972: Second Stage.|date=5 July 1972|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol.262 No.5 p.6 cc.672–703|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad]] (upper house) voting age was 30 for both sexes from its establishment in 1922 until 1928, when direct election was abolished.&lt;ref name="const1922a14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1928/act/13/enacted/en/print|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Act, 1928|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only direct election was [[Irish Seanad election, 1925|in 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ireland's Unique Electoral Experiment: The Senate Election of 1925 |doi=10.1080/07907180500359327 |first=John |last=Coakley |journal=Irish Political Studies |date = September 2005|volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=231–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[University constituencies]], where graduates vote for legislators, existed in the lower house until 1937, and have been in the Seanad since [[Seanad Éireann|its recreation in 1938]]. [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]] was enfranchised in the pre-Union Commons in 1613, and the [[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]] at Westminster in 1918. In 1979, the [[Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Seventh Amendment of the Constitution]] allowed for the franchise to be extended to graduates of other [[Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland|Irish third-level institutions]], but this has not been invoked. One of the arguments made in support of [[Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2013|the rejected 2013 proposal]] to abolish the Seanad was the elitism of giving graduates an extra legislative vote; some proposals for Seanad reform would give non-graduates a vote for the [[Vocational panel]] senators instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.senatorkatherinezappone.ie/files/Open_It,_Dont_Close_It_-_Seanad_Reform.pdf#page=26|page=25; §7.2|chapter=Options For A More Democratic Seanad Through Legislative Change|title=Radical seanad reform through legislative change|author=[[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], [[Joe O'Toole]], [[Noel Whelan (politician)|Noel Whelan]], [[Feargal Quinn]] and [[Katherine Zappone]]|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the voting age for women was reduced from 30 to 21 for local elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1935/act/9/section/2/enacted/en/html|title=Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Act, 1935, Section 2|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, members of the [[Garda Síochána]] were allowed to vote; the 1923 electoral act had carried forward the previous ban on RIC and DMP members voting for parliament, though they could vote in local elections.&lt;ref name="dail1922111500037"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1923/act/12/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5|title=Electoral Act, 1923, Section 5|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1960/act/43/enacted/en/print|title=Electoral Act, 1960|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=sec.3 and Schedule|accessdate=4 December 2015}}; {{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1955110200026|title=Private Members' Business. - Garda Síochána Franchise—Motion.|date=2 November 1955|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=8 December 2015}}; {{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1960120600038 |title=Electoral Bill, 1960 — Second Stages |last=Blaney |first=Neil|date=6 December 1960|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|quote=One of the important proposals is contained in Section 3 and in the Schedule which provides for the repeal of the prohibition on the registration of Gardaí as voters at Dáil elections.

In 1985, [[UK citizens]] gained the right to vote in Dáil elections,&lt;ref name="act1985s2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1985/act/12/section/2/enacted/en/html|title=Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985, Section 2|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reciprocating Irish citizens' right to vote in UK elections under the [[Ireland Act 1949]]. The [[Ninth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Ninth Amendment of the Constitution]] was passed in 1984 to allow for this.

The '''Party Human Environment Animal Protection''' ({{lang-de|Partei Mensch Umwelt Tierschutz}}, short form: '''Animal Protection Party''', {{lang-de|Tierschutzpartei}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Germany]], founded in 1993. In 2014 one candidate was elected to the [[European Parliament]]. As of December 2014 the party has no members in the state parliaments, the European Parliament or the [[Bundestag]].

== Overview ==
The party aspires to turn away from the [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] view of life. Its main goal is the introduction of more [[animal rights]] into the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Those include the right to live and the protection from physical and psychological damages. The Tierschutzpartei also demands prohibition of [[animal testing]], [[bullfighting]], [[hunting]], the production of [[fur]]s, [[circus]] [[Animal training|animal]]s and agricultural [[animal husbandry]], as well as the adaptation of the people to [[veganism]]. The party supports a ban on [[genetic engineering]] and wants a reduction of car [[traffic]] and an immediate exit from [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Economically it supports more social justice, a stamp duty and a free basic income.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Germany)|2014 European parliament elections]], the Animal Protection Party received 1.25% of the national vote (366,303 votes in total) and returned one [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], [[Stefan Eck]], who sits with the [[EUL-NGL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ Bundesergebnis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072802/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |date=2015-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 Eck left the party and became an independent MEP in the EUL-NGL-group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22136">{{Politics of Kazakhstan}}

[[Kazakhstan]]'s [[human rights]] situation is uniformly described as poor by independent observers. [[Human Rights Watch]] says that "Kazakhstan heavily restricts [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], and [[freedom of religion|religion]]. In 2014, authorities closed newspapers, jailed or fined dozens of people after peaceful but unsanctioned protests, and fined or detained worshipers for practicing religion outside state controls. Government critics, including opposition leader [[Vladimir Kozlov (politician)|Vladimir Kozlov]], remained in detention after unfair trials. [[Torture]] remains common in places of detention."&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan World Report 2015: Kazakhstan], accessed October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan's political structure concentrates power in the presidency. President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been the country's leader since 1989, when he was named First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan|Communist Party]] of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]], and was [[Kazakhstani presidential election, 1991|elected]] the nation's first president following its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991. No election ever held in Kazakhstan has met international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=C.J.|title=Kazakh President Re-elected; voting Flawed, Observers Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/06/international/asia/06kazakhstan.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 April 2014|work=The New York Times|date=6 December 2005|quote=Kazakhstan has never held an election that met international standards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pannier|first=Bruce |title=Kazakhstan's long term president to run in snap election – again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/kazakhstan-president-early-election-nursultan-nazarbayev|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 March 2015|quote=Nazarbaev has clamped down on dissent in Kazakhstan, and the country has never held an election judged to be free or fair by the West.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Kazakhstan was elected as a member of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. During the [[Universal Periodic Review]] of Human Rights in 2014, national representatives "commended Kazakhstan’s establishment of a mechanism to prevent torture and of a national human rights institution" but "shared concerns about legal restrictions on freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15723&amp;LangID=E Human Rights Council adopts outcomes of Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan, Angola and Iran - See more at: http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15723&amp;LangID=E#sthash.cA8jiR5R.dpuf] - Human Rights Council, 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics, freedom of speech and the press==
Political expression was reported to be restricted in Kazakhstan in the months leading up to presidential elections in December 2005, according to observers, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Freedom House]]:[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=277]&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakh authorities reportedly attempted to restrict freedom of speech and shut down independent media and civil society groups. In September, the Vremya printing house unexpectedly cancelled contracts with seven newspapers, with no explanation given. Likewise, other printing firms in Kazakhstan's former capital, [[Almaty]], also refused to print the publications. After a week-long hunger strike by the editors of these papers, the Daur publishing house agreed to publish five of the newspapers. Virtually all of Kazakhstan's broadcast media are owned by firms closely associated with the government; newspapers are some of the few sources of independent reporting.&lt;ref name="IFEX 2005"&gt;International Freedom of Expression Exchange:[http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/69862/ GOVERNMENT MUZZLING FREE EXPRESSION IN RUN-UP TO ELECTIONS], 19 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some outsider observers, including HRW, have noted increasing anxiety in the Kazakh government after recent democratic revolutions in former Soviet states including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Efforts to restrict dissent ahead of the 2 December 2005 elections may have indicated the government's attempt to prevent such transformation from occurring in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="IFEX 2005"/&gt;

In 2016 Astana hosted a roundtable discussion on [[Human Rights Day]], December 10. The event brought together Kazakh officials and representatives of international organizations, such as International Organisation for Migration (IOM), EU, [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan Marks Human Rights Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan Marks Human Rights Day|url=http://astanatimes.com/2015/12/kazakhstan-marks-human-rights-day/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2018 Dmitry Senyavskii a [[trade union]] leader in Kazakhstan was attacked and viciously beaten up by some unidentified persons and was taken to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/11/12/kazakhstan-attack-trade-union-leader Kazakhstan: Attack on Trade Union Leader]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) has frequently called on the government of Kazakhstan to modify the restricting trade laws and maintain its commitments with international labor rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/06/trade-union-leaders-freed-kazakhstan Trade Union Leaders Freed in Kazakhstan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to fair trial==
According to a US government report released in 2014, in Kazakhstan:
{{quote|The law does not adequately provide for an independent judiciary. The executive branch sharply limited judicial independence. Prosecutors enjoyed a quasi-judicial role and had the authority to suspend court decisions ... Corruption was evident at every stage of the judicial process. Although judges were among the most highly paid government employees, lawyers and human rights monitors alleged that judges, prosecutors, and other officials solicited bribes in exchange for favorable rulings in the majority of criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013: Kazakhstan". Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=220395#wrapper. Retrieved on September 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Religious freedom==
In 1992 after gaining independence Kazakhstan adopted the Law on Freedom of Religion and Religious Associations, which aimed to ensure inter-faith tolerance and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials: New Laws Protect Freedom of Religion|url=http://astanatimes.com/2013/04/officials-new-laws-protect-freedom-of-religion/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there were over 3400 religious organizations in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Ministry Holds Briefing for Diplomats on Religious Freedom in Country|url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/03/foreign-ministry-holds-briefing-diplomats-religious-freedom-country/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights watch however has said that "Minority religious groups continued to be subjected to fines and short-term detention in 2014 for violating a restrictive religion law". A UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion recommended "far-reaching reforms" to the 2011 religion law, finding, for example, that "non-registered religious communities ... suffer from serious infringements of their freedom of religion."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2014 Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=World Report 2015: Kazakhstan|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan#ada87c|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to promote inter-confessional dialogue and prevent religious conflict worldwide, Kazakhstan hosts regular Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. The first congress was held in 2003 and was attended by 17 religious delegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/organizations/congress-of-the-leaders-of-world-and-traditional-religions|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to address the threat of religious extremism, the Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions held international conference, Religions against Terrorism, on May 31, 2016. One day later the Congress held its 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; session in Astana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentarians, Religious Leaders Discuss Ways to Unite Religions against Terrorism in Astana|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/06/parliamentarians-religious-leaders-discuss-ways-to-unite-religions-against-terrorism-in-astana/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Hare Krishna evictions=== 
{{wikinews|International response to demolition of Hare Krishna property in Kazakhstan}}
On November 20, 2006, three buses full of [[riot police]], two ambulances, two empty lorries, and executors of the Karasai district arrived at the community in sub-zero weather and evicted the [[Hinduism in Kazakhstan|Hare Krishna]] followers from thirteen homes, which the police proceeded to demolish. The [[Forum 18|Forum 18 News Service]] reported, "Riot police who took part in the destruction threw personal belongings of the Hare Krishna devotees into the snow, and many devotees were left without clothes. Power for lighting and heating systems had been cut off before the demolition began. Furniture and larger household belongings were loaded onto trucks. Officials said these possessions would be destroyed. Two men who tried to prevent the bailiffs from entering a house to destroy it were seized by 15 police officers who twisted their hands and took them away to the police car."&lt;ref&gt;[[Forum 18|Forum 18 News Service]]:[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=876 KAZAKHSTAN: Will rest of Hare Krishna commune now be destroyed?], 24 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these events the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] issued a statement: "It appears that state-sponsored action has been focused upon members of the Hare Krishna community in a manner that suggests they have been targeted on the basis of their religious affiliation." Kazakh officials claims that the evictions were legitimate, and that the properties had been acquired illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finn|first1=Peter|title=Local Property Dispute Grows Into International Issue for Kazakhstan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/24/AR2007072402310.html|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights dialogue==
In 2008, in line with its "Strategy for a New Partnership" with Central Asia, the [[European Union]] agreed with the Republic of Kazakhstan to establish an annual human rights dialogue, and its first round was held on 15 October 2008 in Astana.&lt;ref name=EU1&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union – Kazakhstan Civil Society Seminar on Human Rights. Judicial System and Places of Detention: Towards the European Standards|url=http://www.eucentralasia.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/CS_seminars__final_reports/eu_kazakhstan_seminar_final_report_sept_2009_en.pdf|website=eucentralasia.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dialogues constitute an essential part of the EU's overall strategy to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable development, peace and stability.&lt;ref name=EU2&gt;{{cite web|title=EU human rights dialogues in Central Asia|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/central_asia/docs/factsheet_hr_dialogue_en.pdf|website=eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2014 the European Union and Kazakhstan held the sixth round of the annual Human Rights Dialogue in Brussels.&lt;ref name=EU3&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: EU-Kazakhstan Human Rights Dialogue|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2014/141112_03_en.htm|website=eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kazakh delegation was led by Mr Yogan Merkel, First Deputy Prosecutor General, who was accompanied by Mr Vyacheslav Kalyuzhnyy, Director of the National Centre for Human Rights, and other senior officials.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt; The EU delegation was led by Mr Silvio Gonzato, Director for Human Rights and Democracy at the European External Action Service.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt; The dialogue was held in a positive and constructive atmosphere.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt; The EU welcomed Kazakhstan's development of a functioning National Preventive Mechanism for the monitoring of places of detention, and encouraged further steps to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt; The EU acknowledged Kazakhstan's recent engagement in the second cycle of the Universal Period Review (UPR) process at the UN Human Rights Council, and encouraged the Kazakh authorities to consider accepting a number of UPR recommendations that it initially did not support.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt; 
The next round of the EU-Kazakhstan Human Rights Dialogue is expected to take place in Astana in 2015.&lt;ref name=EU3/&gt;{{Update inline|date=September 2015}}

OSCE and the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law conduct joint training programs on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = OSCE Programme Office in Astana supports human rights education for police {{!}} OSCE|url = http://www.osce.org/astana/191616|website = www.osce.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule of law==
Kazakhstan was ranked 65th in the [[Rule of Law Index]] 2015. The country climbed six positions up the rankings compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan improved its position in Rule of Law Index|url=http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2786934|website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Kazakhstan introduced amendments to the law on nongovernmental organisation (NGO) activities. The law guarantees to NGOs free access to public, international and private financing allowing them to actively participate in the social and political development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NGO Law to Ensure Liberty, Equality, Accountability and Transparency|url=http://astanatimes.com/2015/10/ngo-law-to-ensure-liberty-equality-accountability-and-transparency/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 Kazakhstan's President proposed a reform aimed at delegating some of the President's powers to the Parliament. This initiative is expected to create a stronger system of checks and balances in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakh President, Special Panel Mull Major Political Reforms|url=http://astanatimes.com/2017/01/kazakh-president-special-panel-mull-major-political-reforms/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan is a member of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] (HCCH) since May 2017. The HCCH is aimed at promoting the harmonisation of conflict of laws principles in diverse subject matters within private international law, which contributes to the promotion of rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan joins Hague Conference on Private International Law|url=http://akipress.com/news:592528/|website=akipress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic diversity==
Kazakhstan supports co-existence of different cultures. The [[Assembly of People of Kazakhstan]] supports nearly 200 centres where children and adults can study 30 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=astanatimes.com|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/04/why-kazakhstans-model-of-maintaining-ethnic-diversity-deserves-attention/|website=Why Kazakhstan's Model of Maintaining Ethnic Diversity Deserves Attention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan (APK) introduced a Day of Gratitude as a new holiday of Kazakhstan. The proposal to establish it was delivered by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Day of Gratitude is celebrated on 1 March and marks the historic past and multi-ethnic unity of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nazarbayev Congratulates Kazakh People on Day of Gratitude, Recalls Country’s Historic Past|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/03/nazarbayev-congratulates-kazakh-people-on-day-of-gratitude-recallscountrys-historic-past/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

59.2% of the Kazakhstan population is Kazakh, 29.6% is Russian, while 10.2% comprises Germans, Tatars, Ukrainians, Uzbek and Uyghurs. Representatives of more than 140 ethnic groups live in Kazakhstan and some 818 ethnic and cultural associations operate under the auspices of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#Kazakhstan: A model of inter-ethnic tolerance and social harmony|url=https://www.eureporter.co/featured/2016/11/11/kazakhstan-a-model-of-inter-ethnic-tolerance-and-social-harmony/|website=www.eureporter.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's rights==
Kazakhstan's Human Rights Commissioner for Children's Rights and UNICEF Representative for Kazakhstan adopted a Statement of Intentions on Cooperation. The parties agreed to take necessary actions to develop an independent system of monitoring of ensuring children's rights in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=inform.kz|url=http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2890673|website=Children’s Rights Ombudsman, UNICEF's Kazakhstan Country Office signed Statement of Intentions on coop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy places high emphasis on the protection of childhood. Kazakhstan adopted over 90 laws and other normative acts aimed at protecting children's rights.&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan Marks Human Rights Day"/&gt;

Kazakhstan is a party to the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

==Commissioner for Human Rights==
The institution of the Commissioner for human rights (Kazakhstan's Ombudsman) was established on September 19, 2002 by the President’s Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Kazakhstan Human Rights Ombudsman|url=http://www.ombudsman.kz/en/about/history.php|website=www.ombudsman.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioner and his associated organization, the National Center for Human Rights, are empowered to investigate human rights issues in the government per the decree of President Nazarbayev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Imbudsman|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/content/human-rights-ombudsman|website=www.kazakhembus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Alliance for Europe''' was founded in summer 2002 by Professor Brigid Laffan of [[University College Dublin]] in order to lead the [[civil society]] campaign in favour of the [[Treaty of Nice]] at the second Irish referendum. Adrian Langan was recruited as full-time Campaign Director from a similar, voluntary, position in [[Ireland for Europe]]. It led all sectors of Irish society, campaigning effectively through the mass media, local canvassing, and postering nationwide. {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In late 2007, the organisation was resurrected by [[Ruairi Quinn]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] and former [[European Movement Ireland]] [[CEO]], Brendan Kiely in order to campaign on the [[Lisbon Treaty]] referendum..

==Early years==
Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born in 1934 in [[Hampstead]],&lt;ref&gt;"Morris-Goodall, Valerie J" in Register of Births for Hampstead Registration District, volume 1a (1934), p. 748&lt;/ref&gt; to businessman Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall (1907–2001) and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph (1906–2000),&lt;ref&gt;''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916-2007''&lt;/ref&gt; a novelist from [[Milford Haven]], [[Pembrokeshire]]&lt;ref&gt;''1911 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote under the name Vanne Morris-Goodall.&lt;ref name="JGBio"/&gt;

As a child, as an alternative to a teddy bear, her father gave Goodall a stuffed chimpanzee named Jubilee, and she has said her fondness for this figure started her early love of animals, commenting that "My mother's friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares." Today, Jubilee still sits on Goodall's dresser in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=Jane |author2=Phillip Berman |title=Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey |publisher=Warner Books |year=2000 |location=New York |page=4 |isbn=978-0-446-67613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall has a younger sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday. The two were born four years apart.

== Africa ==
Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957.&lt;ref name="JanesStory" /&gt; From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned [[Louis Leakey]], the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early [[hominids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=June 2007 |title=Jane Goodall helps humans and animals live together |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07.html |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |location=[[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his wife [[Mary Leakey]], Louis sent Goodall to [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanganyika]] (present-day [[Tanzania]]), where he laid out his plans.

In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with [[William Charles Osman Hill|Osman Hill]] and primate anatomy with [[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]].&lt;ref name=Morell1995&gt;{{cite book |last=Morell |first=Virginia |year=1995 |title=Ancestral Passions: the Leakey family and the quest for humankind's beginnings |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-80192-2 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to [[Gombe Stream National Park]], becoming the first of what would come to be called [[The Trimates]].&lt;ref name="GoodallPeterson2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodall |first1=Jane |last2=Peterson |first2=Dale |title=Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters: The Later Years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kdr0TP7ou0wC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |date=25 September 2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-618-25734-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety.&lt;ref name="JanesStory"&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Days |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/janes-story |accessdate=28 July 2010 |publisher=[[Jane Goodall Institute]] |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to [[Cambridge University]]. She went to [[Newnham College]], and obtained a PhD degree in [[ethology]].&lt;ref name="JanesStory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Peterson|title=Jane Goodall: The Woman Who Redefined Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzJIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261|date=11 November 2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-52579-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD there without first having obtained a BA or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]].&lt;ref name="JGBio" /&gt; Her thesis was completed in 1965 under the tutorship of [[Robert Hinde]], titled ''Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees'', detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.&lt;ref name="JGBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae, Jane Goodall, PhD, DBE |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |url=http://www.janegoodall.org.hk/downloads/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005905/http://www.janegoodall.org.hk/downloads/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Goodall has been married twice. On 28 March 1964, she married a Dutch nobleman, wildlife photographer Baron [[Hugo van Lawick]], at [[Chelsea Old Church]], London, and became known during their marriage as Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall. The couple had a son, Hugo Eric Louis (born 1967); they divorced in 1974. The following year, she married Derek Bryceson (a member of [[Tanzania]]'s parliament and the director of that country's [[national park]]s); he died of cancer in October 1980.&lt;ref name="GreatApes"&gt;{{cite book |title=Walking With the Great Apes |last=Montgomery |first=Sy |year=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-395-51597-1 |pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson was able to protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe while he was alive.&lt;ref name="GreatApes" /&gt;

Goodall has expressed fascination with [[Bigfoot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/jane-goodall-fascinated-bigfoot-article-1.1172959 |title=Chimp expert Jane Goodall says she is 'fascinated' by Bigfoot |publisher=NY Daily News |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if she believes in God, Goodall said in September 2010: "I don't have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me."&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall's Questions &amp; Answers, ''Readers Digest'', p. 128, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Research at Gombe Stream National Park ===
[[File:Jane Goodall, The Green Interview.webm|thumb|right|Goodall in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]] discussing her work.]]
Goodall is best known for her study of [[chimpanzee]] social and family life. She began studying the [[Kasakela chimpanzee community]] in [[Gombe Stream National Park]], [[Tanzania]], in 1960.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Study Corner – Gombe Timeline |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-gombe-timeline |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |year=2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without collegiate training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; She found that, "it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow."&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees/introduction/1908/ |title=Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees |year=1996 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what we consider "human" actions.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of "the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years."&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.

Goodall's research at Gombe Stream is best known to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively "fishing" for termites.&lt;ref name="Chimp"&gt;Goodall, Jane. ''Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey''. New York: Warner Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.&lt;ref name="Chimp" /&gt; Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as "Man the Toolmaker". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, "We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!".&lt;ref name="Chimp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodall"&gt;The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp "Chimpanzee Central"], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.&lt;ref name="Goodall" /&gt; The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.&lt;ref name="Goodall" /&gt; The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.

But perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].&lt;ref name="Chimp" /&gt; She says of this revelation, "During the first ten years of the study I had believed […] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. […] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal—that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature."&lt;ref name="Chimp" /&gt; She described the 1974–1978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.

Goodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.  She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months.  Among those that Goodall named during her years in Gombe were:&lt;ref&gt;see [[Kasakela chimpanzee community]] for a more complete list and details.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kasakela chimpanzee community|David Greybeard]], a grey-chinned male who first warmed up to Goodall;&lt;ref name="Gombe"&gt;[http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/chimpanzees/gombe/default.asp Gombe National Park], Chimpanzee Central, Janegoodall.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jane Goodall Institute ===
[[File:Jane Goodall at RS Hungary.JPG|thumbnail|right|Jane Goodall in 2009 with Hungarian Roots &amp; Shoots group members.]]

In 1977, Goodall established the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI), which supports the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe]] research, and she is a global leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. With nineteen offices around the world, the JGI is widely recognised for community-centred [[conservation movement|conservation and development]] programs in Africa. Its global youth program, [[Jane Goodall Institute (Hong Kong)#Roots &amp; Shoots|Roots &amp; Shoots]] began in 1991 when a group of 16 local teenagers met with Goodall on her back porch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They were eager to discuss a range of problems they knew about from first-hand experience that caused them deep concern. The organisation now has over 10,000 groups in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsandshoots.org/aboutus/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720235233/http://www.rootsandshoots.org/aboutus/history |archivedate=20 July 2011 |title=Our History |work=Roots &amp; Shoots |publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jane Goodall and Lou Perrotti 2009 by DS.jpg|thumb|Goodall in 2009 with Lou Perrotti, who contributed to her book, ''Hope for Animals and Their World''.]]
Due to an overflow of handwritten notes, photographs, and data piling up at Jane's home in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1990s, the Jane Goodall Institute's Center for Primate Studies was created at the [[University of Minnesota]] to house and organise this data. Currently all of the original Jane Goodall archives reside there and have been digitised and analysed and placed in an [[online database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees-gsrc|title=JGICPS|publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210215503/http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees-gsrc|archive-date=10 February 2011|dead-url=yes|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2011, [[Duke University]] spokesman Karl Bates announced that the archives will move to Duke, with [[Anne E. Pusey]], Duke's chairman of evolutionary anthropology, overseeing the collection. Pusey, who managed the archives in Minnesota and worked with Goodall in Tanzania, had worked at Duke for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2011/mar/18/wsmet03-goodall-papers-headed-to-duke-ar-872387/ |title=Goodall papers headed to Duke |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126232610/http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2011/mar/18/wsmet03-goodall-papers-headed-to-duke-ar-872387/ |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Goodall devotes virtually all of her time to advocacy on behalf of chimpanzees and the environment, travelling nearly 300 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/crime-courts/ci_13473075?source=rss |title=Goodall promotes peace, youth empowerment at talk in Berkeley |first=Kristin |last=Bender |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2009 |publisher=[[The Oakland Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Coward | first = Ros | author-link = Rosalind Coward | title = New mission for chimps' champion  | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/10/academicexperts.environment | date = 10 October 2004 | access-date = 12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goodall is also a board member for the world's largest chimpanzee sanctuary outside of Africa, Save the Chimps in Fort Pierce, Florida.

=== Activism ===
[[File:Jane Goodall and Allyson Reed.jpg|right|thumb|Goodall with Allyson Reed of [[Skulls Unlimited International]], at the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] annual conference, September 2009.]]

Goodall credits the 1986 ''Understanding Chimpanzees'' conference, hosted by the [[Chicago Academy of Sciences]], with shifting her focus from observation of chimpanzees to a broader and more intense concern with animal-human conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Goodall Recalls '86 Chicago Lesson | work=Chicago Tribune | date=August 19, 2016 | author=Johnson, Steve | location=Section 1 | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the former president of [[Advocates for Animals]], an organisation based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], that campaigns against the use of animals in medical research, zoos, farming and sport.

Goodall is a vegetarian and advocates the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. In ''The Inner World of Farm Animals'', Goodall writes that farm animals are "far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings in their own right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?"&lt;ref&gt;Hatkoff, Amy. 2009. ''The Inner World of Farm Animals'', page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall has also said: "Thousands of people who say they 'love' animals sit down once or twice a day to enjoy the flesh of creatures who have been treated so with little respect and kindness just to make more meat."

In April 2008, Goodall gave a lecture entitled "Reason for Hope" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

In May 2008, Goodall controversially described [[Edinburgh Zoo]]'s new primate enclosure as a "wonderful facility" where monkeys "are probably better off [than those] living in the wild in an area like [[Budongo]], where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Mike Wade, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article3972868.ece Zoos are best hope, says Jane Goodall.] ''The Times'', 20 May 2008.

Retrieved 18 July 2008. "She's entitled to her opinion, but our position isn't going to change. We oppose the keeping of animals in captivity for entertainment."&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Goodall confirmed that she had resigned the presidency of the organisation which she had held since 1998, citing her busy schedule and explaining, "I just don't have time for them."&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;Yudhijit Bhattacharjee, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/320/5881/1269a Defending captivity.] ''Science'', Vol. 320. no. 5881, p. 1269, 6 June 2008.

In 2011, Goodall became a patron of Australian animal protection group [[Voiceless, the animal protection institute]]. "I have for decades been concerned about factory farming, in part because of the tremendous harm inflicted on the environment, but also because of the shocking ongoing cruelty perpetuated on millions of sentient beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voiceless, the animal protection institute |url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/who-we-are/jane-goodall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Goodall wrote to [[Air France]] executives criticizing the airline's continued transport of monkeys to laboratories.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Jane Goodall at TEDGlobal 2007-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goodall at [[TEDGlobal]] 2007]]
Some primatologists have suggested flaws in Goodall's methodology which may call into question the validity of her observations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Goodall used unconventional practices in her study, for example, naming individuals instead of numbering them. At the time, numbering was used to prevent emotional attachment and loss of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].

Goodall wrote in 1993: "When, in the early 1960s, I brazenly used such words as 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'motivation', 'excitement', and 'mood' I was much criticised. Even worse was my crime of suggesting that chimpanzees had 'personalities'. I was ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman animals and was thus guilty of that worst of ethological sins -anthropomorphism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodall|first1=Jane|editor1-last=Cavalieri|editor1-first=Paola|title=The Great Ape Project : Equality Beyond Humanity|date=1993|publisher=Fourth Estate|location=London|isbn=1857021266|page=10|url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/goodall01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and [[social relation]]ships. This argument is the focus of a book published by Margaret Power in 1991.&lt;ref name="power"&gt;Power, Margaret (1991). The Egalitarians – Human and Chimpanzee An Anthropological: View of Social Organization. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-40016-3}}.{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that higher levels of aggression and conflict with other chimpanzee groups in the area were due to the feeding, which could have created the "wars" between chimpanzee social groups described by Goodall, aspects of which she did not witness in the years before artificial feeding began at Gombe. Thus, some regard Goodall's observations as distortions of normal chimpanzee behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature03999 |pmid=16136128 |title=A century of getting to know the chimpanzee |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=56–9 |year=2005 |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans B. M. |bibcode=2005Natur.437...56D |quote=skeptics attributed chimpanzee 'warfare' to competition over the food that researchers provided }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall herself acknowledged that feeding contributed to aggression within and between groups, but maintained that the effect was limited to alteration of the intensity and not the nature of chimpanzee conflict, and further suggested that feeding was necessary for the study to be effective at all. [[Craig Stanford]] of the Jane Goodall Research Institute at the [[University of Southern California]] states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to inter-group conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stanford |first=Craig |title=The Egalitarians- Human and Chimpanzee |publisher=International Journal of Primatology |date=Winter 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent studies, such as those by Crickette Sanz in the [[Goualougo Triangle]] ([[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]) and Christophe Boesch in the [[Taï National Park]] ([[Ivory Coast]]), have not shown the aggression observed in the Gombe studies.&lt;ref&gt;Washington University Record, Vol 28 No 28, April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other primatologists disagree that the studies are flawed; for example, Jim Moore provides a critique of Margaret Powers' assertions&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215932/http://cogprints.org/738/0/Power.html The Egalitarians (by M. Power, 1991)&lt;!-- Bot generated title, dead link --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; and some studies of other chimpanzee groups have shown aggression similar to that in Gombe even in the absence of feeding.&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Primatology 58:175–180 (2002), Noboyuki Kutsukake and Takahisa Matsusaka.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plagiarism and ''Seeds of Hope'' ===

On 22 March 2013, Hachette Book Group announced that Goodall's and co-author Gail Hudson's new book, ''Seeds of Hope,'' would not be released on 2 April as planned due to the discovery of plagiarised portions.&lt;ref&gt;Italie, Hillel (Associated Press).

=== Gary Larson cartoon incident ===

One of [[Gary Larson]]'s [[The Far Side|''Far Side'']] cartoons shows two chimpanzees grooming. One finds a blonde human hair on the other and inquires, "Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?"&lt;ref name="Strange Legacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comicsalliance.com/tribute-gary-larson-far-side/ | title=The Strange Legacy of Gary Larson's 'The Far Side' | publisher=ComicsAlliance | date=August 14, 2015 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Chris Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the Jane Goodall Institute thought this was in bad taste, and had their lawyers draft a letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate, in which they described the cartoon as an "atrocity." They were stymied by Goodall herself when she returned and saw the cartoon, as she stated that she found the cartoon amusing.&lt;ref name="farside"&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Prehistory of the Far Side: a 10th anniversary exhibit''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8362-1851-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to ''The Far Side Gallery 5'', detailing her version of the controversy, and the Institute's letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete ''Far Side'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Far Side Gallery 5''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-8362-0425-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behaviour of humans and animals. In 1988, when Larson visited Gombe&lt;ref name="farside" /&gt; he was attacked by a chimpanzee named Frodo.&lt;ref name="Strange Legacy"/&gt;

'''John Tengo Jabavu''' (11 January 1859 &amp;ndash; 10 September 1921) was a political activist and the editor of [[South Africa]]'s first newspaper to be written in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]].

In 1876, Jabavu took over editorship of the ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Isigidimi samaXhosa|Isigidimi samaXhosa]]'' ("The Xhosa Messenger"), and by the early 1880s had become an important political force. Jabavu's writings tended to focus on the threat of growing [[Afrikaner]] [[nationalism]] and his demands for equal rights for South Africa's black population. Tengo Jabavu was also known as a proponent of [[women's rights]] as well as public education.

In recognition of his political influence, a group of prominent [[Cape Colony]] political figures approached Tengo Jabavu in 1883 with a request for him to stand for election to the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]]. They recommended that he represent one of the constituencies of the Cape where Black African voters formed a significant percentage of the electorate, such as Victoria East. However Jabavu declined, citing the possibility that such a move would unite and aggravate reactionary elements in the Cape Parliament and would therefore be counterproductive.{{sfn|McCracken|1967|p=}} Nonetheless, he later lent his powerful support to the more liberal leaders of the Cape's [[South African Party (Cape Colony)|South African Party]] against the repressive policies of [[Cecil Rhodes|Rhodes]]'s [[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|"Progressives"]]&lt;ref&gt;Cape Argus Weekly 7 September 1898 &amp; 23 Dec. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Tengo Jabavu founded his own newspaper, ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Imvo Zabantsundu|Imvo Zabantsundu]]'' ("Black Opinion"); a year later, he married Elda Sakuba, who would die in 1900, leaving four sons. The eldest of these sons, [[Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu]], would become a respected author and activist in his own right; the second eldest, Alexander, succeeded John Tengo Jabavu as editor of ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Imvo Zabantsundu|Imvo Zabantsundu]]'', following his 1921 death in the home of D.D.T. Jabavu at [[Fort Hare]].

In the 1890s, Tengo Jabavu's movement ''[[Imbumba]]'' ("The Union") faced a growing rival, the [[South African Native National Congress]] led by [[Walter Rubusana]]. While it aspired to unity, Jabavu's movement was still perceived as dominated by [[Fengu people]] like Jabavu himself. By contrast, Rubusana's movement was perceived as dominated by [[Gcaleka]]. Rivalry was exacerbated by subtle ethnic tensions, but largely came to an end as some degree of unity was achieved under the larger [[African National Congress]], intended finally to lay to rest "the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud."{{sfn|Plaut|2016|p=24}}

'''Kukoi Samba Sanyang''' (1952 – 18 June 2013) led a 1981 [[rebellion]] against the [[Democracy|democratically]] elected [[The Gambia|Gambian]] government of [[President of the Gambia|President]] [[Dawda Jawara]].

On 31 July 1981, while Jawara was abroad, a 12-member [[National Revolutionary Council]] (NRC) headed by Sanyang seized control of the country. The [[leftist]] NRC accused [[Dawda Jawara|Jawara]]'s government of being "[[Political corruption|corrupt]], [[Tribalism|tribalistic]], and [[Despotism|despotic]]". They also announced the suspension of the country's constitution and proclaimed their intention to establish a "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]".

The attempted [[coup]] ended on 5 August when [[Senegal]]ese troops defeated the rebel forces. Sanyang took refuge in [[Libya]], which had also given him some backing for the coup attempt.&lt;ref name=Corbridge&gt;''Development: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences'', by [[Stuart Corbridge]]. Book review, p. 104 [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=CcK&amp;q=%22Kukoi+Samba+Sanyang%22+%22Dr+Manning%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] visited Libya several times, probably between 1986 and 1989. He met with Sanyang and other Gambians who had participated in the 1981 coup attempt. In 1989 “Dr. Manning” was listed by the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] as Taylor's vice-president, but was soon edged out by Taylor and retired to manage a bar in [[Ouagadougou]].&lt;ref name=Corbridge/&gt;

In 1995 the [[Farafenni]] army camp was attacked by half a dozen men, who killed some Gambian soldiers and held the camp for several hours. Some of the attackers, later captured, claimed they were Sanyang's collaborators. They have been condemned to death and are awaiting their execution. Another was arrested in 2003, is held in Banjul and is still on trial as to early 2007. In 2003 Sanyang based himself in Senegal and went several times to the Gambia to talk with Gambian President [[Yahya Jammeh]] at his Kanilai residence. In August 2003 the negotiations failed and Sanyang returned to Senegal for permanent residence. 

In early June 2006, shortly before the Gambian presidential elections, he was along with some of his men put in detention, “at the house of a military officer in [[Bissau]] during a visit to that country”, says [https://web.archive.org/web/20071215093131/http://www.gambianow.com/news/News/Gambia_news_Kukoi_And_Men_Kidnapped.html ''The Gambia Journal''] on January 30, 2007; “(at the Masuang Military Camp) in maximum military detention”, says [https://web.archive.org/web/20081119094705/http://www.thegambiaecho.com/Homepage/tabid/36/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/487/Default.aspx The Gambia Echo] on May 12, 2007. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071215093131/http://www.gambianow.com/news/News/Gambia_news_Kukoi_And_Men_Kidnapped.html ''The Gambia Journal''] on January 30, also states that some military officers in Bissau blocked their own government in its attempts to hand Kukoi Sanyang over to the authorities in Banjul. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20081119094705/http://www.thegambiaecho.com/Homepage/tabid/36/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/487/Default.aspx ''The Gambia Echo''], That government has spent close to three million US dollars in its attempts at extradition, wanting to arrange for Sanyang's repatriation to Banjul against Casamance hard-line rebel leader being handed over to Senegal. It has been suggested that Sanyang may have been preparing an attack on Yahya Jammeh prealably to the elections, and then seize power. 

Sanyang, Sheriffba Jobe and Mohammed Sowe escaped on May 11. Their pick up was organized by the [[UNHCR]] ([[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]) office who got opportunistically alerted to their presence in Bissau's Justice ministry, while the Justice Minister was arguing with the Army Chief's services and refusing the impromptu transfer of the trio to his jurisdiction. Both Jobe and Sowe were accorded refugee status prior to their arrest, and are now under UN jurisdiction.

He died in Mali in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/Homepage/tabid/36/newsid367/8804/Koukoie-Samba-Sanyang-Is-Dead/Default.aspx |title=Welcome to Freedom Newspaper Online |publisher=Freedomnewspaper.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621193613/http://freedomnewspaper.com/Homepage/tabid/36/newsid367/8804/Koukoie-Samba-Sanyang-Is-Dead/Default.aspx |archivedate=2013-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12651">The '''League of Nations Union''' ('''LNU''') was an organization formed in October 1918 in the [[United Kingdom]] to promote international justice, [[collective security]] and a permanent peace between nations based upon the ideals of the [[League of Nations]]. The League of Nations was established by the [[Great power|Great Powers]] as part of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Treaties]], the international settlement that followed the [[First World War]]. The creation of a general association of nations was the final one of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]]. The LNU became the largest and most influential organisation in the British [[peace movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. M. |last=Douglas |title=The Labour Party, Nationalism and Internationalism, 1939-1951: A New World Order |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |page=27|isbn=9780203505786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swarthmore&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/CDGB/leagueofnationsunion.htm |title=League of Nations Union Collected Records, 1915-1945 |website=Swarthmore College Peace Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1920s, it had over a quarter of a million registered subscribers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John T. |last=Callaghan |title=The Labour Party and Foreign Policy: A History |publisher=Routledge |date=2007 |page=69|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U--CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|isbn=9781134540150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its membership eventually peaked at around 407,775 in 1931. By the 1940s, after the disappointments of the international crises of the 1930s and the descent into [[World War II]], membership fell to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph Preston |last=Baratta |title=Politics of World Federation: From world federalism to global governance |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2004 |page=74|isbn=9780275980689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The LNU was formed on 13 October 1918&lt;ref name=Swarthmore /&gt; by the merger of the League of Free Nations Association and the League of Nations Society, two older organisations already working for the establishment of a new and transparent system of [[international relations]], [[human rights]] (as then understood) and for world peace through [[disarmament]] and universal [[collective security]], rather than traditional approaches such as the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] and the creation of power blocs through secret treaties.&lt;ref name="LSE Collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=LNU |title=LNU - League of Nations Union Collection |website=[[London School of Economics|LSE]] Library Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters of the LNU were set up in the [[dominion]]s and in allied nations, including in the capital cities of all of the states of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138874 |degree=PhD |title=From hope ... to hope : story of the Australian League of Nations union, featuring the Victorian Branch, 1921-1945 |first=Hilary |last=Summy |publisher=The University of Queensland |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal structure==
The headquarters of the LNU were located variously at [[Buckingham Gate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith M. | last=Phelps |title=Selected Articles on a League of Nations |publisher=H. W. Wilson &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1919 |pages=xxvi &amp; xxxvii |url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedarticle05phelgoog#page/n42/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grosvenor Crescent]], [[Belgravia]]. In the 1940s, it moved to smaller premises in [[St Martin's Lane]], [[London WC2|WC2]], for reasons of economy.&lt;ref name="LNU archives"&gt;[http://library-2.lse.ac.uk/archives/pressuregroups/lnu.html Archives of League Of Nations Union, 1918-1971.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715154728/http://library-2.lse.ac.uk/archives/pressuregroups/lnu.html |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its top organ of administration was the General Council, which met twice a year and was responsible for LNU policy under its 1925 [[Royal Charter of Incorporation]]. Beneath the General Council sat the Executive Committee, which met every two weeks and co-ordinated all activities, such as the LNU's campaigns and educational programmes; received reports from branches; monitored the output of specialist sub-groups and had responsibility for the LNU's staff.

LNU branches had their own independent management structures.&lt;ref name="LSE Collection" /&gt;

==Activities==
The LNU played an important role in inter-war politics. According to one source it had been successful in converting the mainstream of British society, including labour, the churches and the principal newspapers, to the cause of the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=B. J. C. |editor-last=McKercher |title=Anglo-American Relations in the 1920s: The Struggle for Supremacy |publisher=University of Alberta |date=1990 |page=23|isbn=9781349119196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also carried great influence in traditional political circles and particularly in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. One historian has gone so far as to describe the LNU as "a key Liberal pressure group on foreign policy" and to call Liberal Party members the "true believers" of the LNU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=McDonough |title=Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement, and the British Road to War |publisher=Manchester University Press |date=1998 |page=111|isbn=9780719048326 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3tQoAEo9Y6oC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first president was [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] the Liberal [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]] during the First World War. Other leading Liberal lights in the LNU included [[Geoffrey Mander]]&lt;ref name="LNU archives" /&gt; [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[Wolverhampton East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton East]] from 1929 to 1945 and Professor [[Gilbert Murray]], who was this Vice-President of the League of Nations Society from 1916 and Chairman of the LNU after 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Morewood |title=The British Defence of Egypt, 1935-1940: Conflict and Crisis in the Eastern Mediterranean |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yM6PAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |isbn=9781135776664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recruitment of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politicians to support the LNU and the League of Nations itself was more problematic for the LNU, but they pursued it to demonstrate the cross-party nature of the Union, which was important for the credibility of an organisation active politically in pursuit of international goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francis |last=West |title=Cecil Murray: A Life |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1984 |pages=200-201}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile Conservatives then came into the LNU, notably [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] and [[Austen Chamberlain]] who were both members of the LNU Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Dutton |title=Austen Chamberlain: Gentleman in Politics |publisher=Transaction |location=New Brunswick |date=1985 |page=307 |isbn=9781412817639}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Conservatives were deeply suspicious of the LNU's support for pacifism and disarmament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. A. |last=Thompson |title=Lord Cecil and the Pacifists in the League of Nations Union|journal=The Historical Journal |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=December 1977 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=949-59 |jstor=2638416}}&lt;/ref&gt; an analogous position being the opinions held by Conservatives in the 1980s in respect of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Even Austen Chamberlain remarked that the Executive Committee contained "some of the worst cranks I have ever known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neville |last=Thompson |title=The Anti-Appeasers: Conservative Opposition to Appeasement in the 1930s |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1971 |page=37 |isbn=9780198214878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] said of the Union: "What impresses me most about them is their long suffering and inexhaustible gullibility".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1932/nov/23/debate-on-the-address HC Deb 23 November 1932 vol 272 cc73-211]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace Ballot===
One example of the significance of the political impact the LNU could have was its organisation of the [[Peace Ballot]] of 1935, when voters were asked to decide on questions relating to international disarmament and collective security. The Peace Ballot was not an official [[referendum]], but more than eleven million people participated in it, representing strong support for the aims and objectives of the League of Nations, influencing policy makers and politicians. The results of the Peace Ballot were publicised worldwide. It has been suggested that one outcome was the interpretation of the result by the [[Axis powers]] as an indication of Britain's unwillingness to go to war on behalf of other nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pat |last=Thane |authorlink=Pat Thane |title=Cassell's Companion to Twentieth-Century Britain |publisher=Cassell |date=2001 |page=311 |isbn=9780304347940}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the vote for military action against international aggressors, as a matter of last resort, was almost three-to-one.

===Educational programmes===
The LNU's other main activities were education and awareness raising. It provided publications, speakers and organised courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Cook |title=Sources in British Political History, 1900-1950 Volume 1 |publisher=MacMillan |location=London |date=1975 |page=144 |isbn=978-0-333-15036-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its programmes had a lasting impact on British schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library-2.lse.ac.uk/archives/handlists/LNU/LNU.html British Library of Political and Economic Science, League of Nations Union, 1918-1971.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714044449/http://library-2.lse.ac.uk/archives/handlists/LNU/LNU.html |date=2012-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The failure of the League of Nations to ensure collective security during the international crises of the 1920s and 1930s in prominent conflicts such as [[Mukden Incident|Manchuria]], the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]], the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]] diminished public faith in the League and its principles. In addition the withdrawal, exclusion or expulsion of key nations from its counsels (the US refused to join, Germany and Japan left in 1933, Italy went in 1937 and the Soviet Union was expelled in 1939) made clear the limitations of collective security without full and active participation of all the powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. A. |last=Cannon |chapter=League Of Nations |title=The Oxford Companion to British History |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1997 |page=567 |isbn=9780198661764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by United Nations Association==
It was plain a new international settlement would be needed after the Second World War and in 1948, the [[United Nations Association – UK|United Nations Association]] (UNA) was founded to promote the work of the [[United Nations Organisation]], which was established in 1945 after the previous year's [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]]. Ass a result, the LNU arranged for the transfer of its complete organisation and membership to the UNA. However, under the provisions of its Royal Charter, the LNU was able to continue until the mid-1970s in a limited capacity to handle bequests and administer the payment of pensions to former employees.

==Papers and records==
The papers, records, minute books, pamphlets, reports and leaflets of the LNU are deposited at the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]] at the [[London School of Economics]] in Westminster.&lt;ref name="LSE Collection" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8755">In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist regime]] undertook a political [[purge]] of the members of the [[Romanian Academy]]. In all, 113 members were removed that June, representing over two-thirds of the total membership at the beginning of the year. Fifty-five members of the "old" academy, mainly scientists, were admitted into the "new" one. In 1990 and 1994, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], 97 of the purged members were restored to the academy, post-mortem. This list presents the names of the purged members, along with the names of those who died in prison and those who spent time in prison.

In January 1949, he co-founded the [[Reform Club of Hong Kong]] with other expatriates to push for constitutional reform as initiated by the [[Young Plan (Hong Kong)|Young Plan]] and the [[Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association]] with a Chinese-oriented membership. In 1953, he founded the [[United Nations Association of Hong Kong]] (UNAHK) to promoted the [[United Nations]] values to Hong Kong residents, especially the rights of [[self-government]] of the colonised people. He also held the "Hyde Park Forum" and the "Public Opinion Forum" weekly at the City Hall.&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sparkpost.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/ma-man-fai-1/|title=港獨之父馬文輝：六十年代的民主運動（上）}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, he and other self-government advocates founded the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] to call for the internal self-government in Hong Kong. He was soon squeezed out from the party leadership. Without any result, the self-government party became less active in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ma"/&gt;

In 1983, his position in the UNAHK was squeezed out and replaced by a [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] leadership. Afterwards, he left the association. He continued to hold the "Hyde Park Forum" at the City Hall until his death in 1994. He was remembered with his iconic long beard and [[changshan|cheongsam]].

The '''Mexican oil expropriation''' ({{lang-es|expropiación petrolera}}) was the '''[[Nationalization of oil supplies|nationalization of all petroleum]]''' reserves, facilities, and [[Big Oil|foreign oil companies]] in [[Mexico]] on March 18, 1938.  In accordance with Article 27 of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]], [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] declared that all mineral and oil reserves found within Mexico belong to "the nation", i.e., the federal government.  This measure caused an international [[boycott]] of Mexican products in the following years, especially by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Netherlands]].

The anniversary, March 18, is now a Mexican [[Public_holidays_in_Mexico#Civic_holidays|civic holiday]].

==Background==
{{History of Mexico |Modern}}
On August 16, 1935, the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (''Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la República Mexicana'') was formed and one of the first actions was the writing of a lengthy draft contract transmitted to the petroleum companies demanding a 40-hour working week, a full salary paid in the event of sickness, and the payment of 65 million pesos towards benefits and wages. The foreign oil companies refused to sign the agreement, and counter offered with a payment of 14 million pesos toward wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Lorenzo (2000). «La institucionalización del nuevo régimen». In Daniel Cosío Villegas et al. ''Historia general de México. México''. El Colegio de México. pp. 823–880. {{ISBN|968-12-0969-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1937, the union demanded that the companies sign the collective agreement and on May 17, the union summoned a strike in case their demands were not met. On May 28 the strike became effective throughout the country.

The petroleum workers' struggle was well regarded by the President and the population despite problems caused by the petroleum shortage. Due to these problems, the union accepted a lift of the strike on June 9, after the president urged them to present their case before the General Arbitration and Conciliation Board (''Junta General de Conciliación y Arbitraje''). In July, as instructed by the arbitration board, a commission of financial experts was formed that investigated the petroleum companies' finances, concluding that their profits easily permitted them to cover the demands of the workers. The report stated that just one company (El Aguila) had received annual profits of over 55 million pesos. The arbitration board concluded that the oil companies should pay 26 million pesos for wages and benefits to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Herzog, Jesús (2003). «México y el vampirismo petrolero». En Óscar Flores Torres. Historiadores de México siglo XX. México: Editorial Trillas. pp. 226–238. {{ISBN|968-24-6669-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The companies, however, insisted the demands would cripple production and bankrupt them, and refused to pay. The president once again intervened to mediate between the parties, and met with oil company representatives at the National Palace on September 2. In this meeting, one of the El Aguila representatives took issue with the description of it being a foreign company, and stated that El Aguila was a Mexican company. In response, [[Jesus Silva Herzog]] (present in the meeting) responded with a financial newspaper from London that cited a report from the Royal Dutch Shell of 1928: "Our Mexican subsidiary, Oil Company El Aguila, has obtained good returns during the last fiscal cycle." It was also explained that El Aguila de Mexico would set the price of an oil barrel at 1.96 when sold to The Eagle Shipping company. This price was below the market value of 3.19 USD per barrel. This way profits would be hidden to the Mexican treasury, and taxes were saved.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Herzog, Jesús (2003). «México y el vampirismo petrolero». En Óscar Flores Torres. Historiadores de México siglo XX. México: Editorial Trillas. pp. 55-56. {{ISBN|968-24-6669-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But, on December 8, the companies hired other unemployed workers and had not responded to the arbitration board. On December 18, 1937, the board gave a verdict in favor of the union by means of a "laudo" (binding judgment in arbitration) which demanded that the companies fulfil the requirements of the petitions and pay 26 million pesos in lost salaries. The petroleum companies initiated a lawsuit on January 2, 1938 before the [[Mexican Supreme Court]] to protect their property from the labor union and arbitration board, which denied the request.

Consequently, the foreign companies rebelled against the imposed contract, and the maximum Judicial Authority responded by rendering a decision on March 1, giving the companies until March 7 to pay the 26 million pesos penalty.

In 1935, all companies in the business of extraction, processing, and exporting of oil in Mexico were foreign companies with foreign capital. These companies attempted to block the creation of [[labor unions]] and used legal and illegal tactics to do so. However, the creation of individual unions within each company was made possible, but work conditions differed from one another.

On December 27, 1935, the Sindicato Único de Trabajadores Petroleros was created, despite the legal opposition in the [[Mexican states|states]] of [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Veracruz]]. On January 29, 1936, this union joined the Comité de Defensa Proletaria ("Committee of Proletarian Defense") which would become in February the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]] (CTM). On July 20, the union celebrated its first convention, in which it was proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company and it was decided on a strike to push towards an agreement.

Lázaro Cárdenas intervened between the union and the oil companies in order to force an agreement on the contract. The strike was delayed for six months, but the companies never agreed to the contract and on May 28, the strike took place. The entire country was paralyzed for 12 days, with consumers unable to buy gasoline. Cárdenas convinced the union to end the strike until a decision by the companies could be made. However, the companies declared themselves unable to meet the demands because of financial problems. Cárdenas ordered an investigation and on August 3, and the findings were that the [[oil industry in Mexico|Mexican oil industry]] produced higher returns than the [[Petroleum industry in the United States|U.S. oil industry]].

==Legal conflicts==
After the publication of the findings, the oil companies threatened to leave Mexico and take all of their capital with them. The government entity in charge of the conflict between these companies and the union, the Junta Federal de Conciliación y Arbitraje (Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board), was not able to make a decision quickly and the union declared a 24-hour strike in protest on December 8.

On December 18, the Arbitration Board declared in favor of the union. The oil companies had to pay 26 million [[Mexican peso|peso]]s of wages lost because of the strike, but they appealed to the [[Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación|Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court then rejected the appeal and ordered them to raise salaries and improve working conditions for the union members. The oil companies protested this decision and President Cárdenas mediated a compromise; the union would accept 26 million. Cárdenas offered to end the strike if the oil companies paid the sum. According to witnesses of this meeting, representatives of the oil companies asked the President "''Who can guarantee that the strike will be over''", to which the President replied "I, the President of the Republic." After the businessmen asked with sarcasm "You?" President Cárdenas ended the meeting saying "Sirs, we are finished!".

As a result, Cárdenas decided to [[Nationalization|expropriate]] the oil industry and create a national oil company.

==March 18, 1938==
On March 18, 1938 President Cárdenas embarked on the expropriation of all oil resources and facilities by the state, nationalizing the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] ([[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]]) operating companies. Two hours before informing his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of his decision, he made the announcement on the radio to the rest of the country. Five days later, a crowd of 100,000 (according to the press) rallied in support of Cárdenas (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20080530090115/http://www.imp.mx/petroleo/expropiacion/img/respaldo.jpg photo]).

On April 12, 1938, a crowd of thousands of women gathered in front of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] to make donations to pay the debt to foreign companies. Donations varied from [[chicken]]s to [[jewelry]], since the women encompassed all [[social class]]es.

On June 7, 1938, President Cárdenas issued a decree creating [[Pemex|Petróleos Mexicanos]] (PEMEX), with exclusive rights over exploration, extraction, refining, and commercialization of oil in Mexico. On June 20, PEMEX started operations.

==Opposition==

===International===
In retaliation, the oil companies initiated a [[public relations]] campaign against Mexico, urging people to stop buying Mexican goods, and [[lobbying]] to embargo US technology to Mexico. Many foreign governments closed their markets to Mexican oil, hoping that PEMEX would drown in its own oil. However, the U.S. government of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] had issued the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], aiming to recalibrate U.S.-Latin American relations; the U.S. government did not intervene to aid U.S. oil companies affected by the Mexican  expropriation. Mexican finances suffered due to the boycott, the Mexican peso was devalued, and an immediate 20% increase in prices was suffered by the Mexican population. In a trip to NY to negotiate with oil companies,  Mexican treasury minister, Suarez, serendipitously met an American intermediate, [[William Rhodes Davis]] from Davis Oil Company, who had a refinery in Europe, and asked for a collaboration. Davis mediated between Mexico and Germany to a barter agreement where Mexico would give crude oil to Davis, who then would provide refined oil products to Germany in exchange for machinery to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/library/allied-multinationals-supply-nazi-germany-world-war-2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, Mexico had an agreement with the American [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]] to sell crude oil to the U.S, and the full-scale war in Europe guaranteed that Mexican oil would have international customers.&lt;ref&gt;Mexico Between Hitler and Roosevelt : Mexican Foreign Relations in the Age of L Zaro C Rdenas, 1934-1940 by Friedrich E. Schuler; Chapter 5;  University of New Mexico Press; 1999; {{ISBN|0826321607}};&lt;/ref&gt;     PEMEX developed into one of the largest [[oil companies]] in the world and helped Mexico become the world's seventh largest oil exporter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=mx&amp;v=88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local===
[[:es:Saturnino Cedillo|Saturnino Cedillo]], a ''[[cacique]]'' from [[San Luis Potosí]] and former [[Secretary of Agriculture]], showed the strongest opposition to Cárdenas's measures. Cedillo had in the past supported Cárdenas in a conflict with ex-President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], but disagreed with his plan of reforms. On May 15 of the same year, the state congress of San Luis Potosí issued a decree where it refused to recognize Cárdenas as President and declared that the ''expropiación petrolera'' did not benefit the [[economy of Mexico]]. Cárdenas did not consider this a serious threat and minimized efforts to suppress the rebellion, instead choosing persuasion. The US government did not support the rebellion because it was more concerned that fascist and [[communist]] movements from [[Europe]] would spread to Mexico.

The key to the success of the measures taken by Cárdenas was not just to control the opposition, but to keep afloat an industry in the absence of qualified personnel. The government had to depend on the [[Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la República Mexicana]] (STPRM, or the Union of Oil Workers of the Mexican Republic) to resolve disagreements over the management of oil resources, and deal with threats of [[Strike action|strike]]s and [[sabotage]]. In spite of these and technical challenges, local workers who replaced the foreign technicians were successful in making the new nationalized oil industry work. [[Josephus Daniels]], U.S. [[ambassador]] to Mexico, explained to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] that Cárdenas' reforms could not be undone, since his position as president and the position of PEMEX were secure.

Critics of the expropriation point out that since Pemex took control of the nation's petroleum, the company has been rife with corruption through every administration since that of Cárdenas, including both the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN (Partido Accion Nacional). In addition, the ''casus belli'' of the expropriation was a wage hike of 26 million pesos. In fact, in the aftermath, not only was the promised wage hike postponed indefinitely, wages were actually cut.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yergin, (2009).

'''Ministry of War of the Russian Empire''', ({{lang-ru|Военное министерство}}, ''Military Ministry'') was an administrative body in the [[Russian Empire]] from 1802 to 1917.

It was established in 1802 as the ''Ministry of ground armed forces'' ({{lang-ru|Министерство военно-сухопутных сил}}) taking over responsibilities from the [[College of War]] during the [[Government reform of Alexander I]]. It was renamed to the ''Ministry of War'' in 1815.

== Structure ==
At the end of 19th century Ministry of war had following structure.
* Military Council

== Buildings ==
[[File:SPB War Offices (Lobanov-Rostovsky palace) 1890-1900.jpg|thumb|The Lobanov-Rostovsky Residence around 1900]]
The Ministry was initially accommodated in Count [[Zakhar Chernyshyov]]'s former palace on Moika River Embankment, which was bought by the State Treasury for the Military Collegium in 1795 (later it was rebuilt and transformed into the [[Mariinsky Palace]]). 

In 1824, the mezzanine and the first floor of the [[Lobanov-Rostovsky Residence]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804003747&lt;/ref&gt; (12 Admiralteysky Avenue) were rented for the Ministry of War for 63,000 roubles a year. On 23 June 1828, the entire building was bought by the State Treasury for one million roubles, and in 1829-1830 it was renovated to meet the Ministry's needs. It housed the principal establishments of the Ministry until its dissolution in 1918. The main entrance is guarded by white marble [[Medici lions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804003747&lt;br&gt;http://www.leospb.ru/en/leo.php?id=42&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monosodium glutamate''' ('''MSG''', also known as '''sodium glutamate''') is the [[sodium]] [[Salt (chemistry)#Nomenclature|salt]] of [[glutamic acid]], one of the most abundant naturally occurring [[Essential amino acid|non-essential]] [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name="natural occurrence"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ninomiya K, Technical Committee, Umami Manufacturers Association of Japan |title=Natural occurrence |journal=Food Reviews International |volume=14 |issue=2 &amp; 3 |pages=177–211 |year=1998 |doi=10.1080/87559129809541157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glutamic acid is found naturally in [[tomato]]es, [[grape]]s, [[cheese]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]] and other foods.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Q&amp;A on MSG|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm328728.htm|website=fda.gov|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HealthCanada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monosodium glutamate (MSG) - Questions and Answers|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/food-additives/monosodium-glutamate-questions-answers.html|website=Government of Canada|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSG is used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer with an [[umami]] taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups.&lt;ref name="Ikeda"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ikeda K |title=New seasonings |journal=Chem Senses |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=847–849 |date=November 2002 |pmid= 12438213 |doi=10.1093/chemse/27.9.847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMG I love MSG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=OMG I love MSG|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/45578b88-ff2d-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz424XCOJsY|website=[[Financial Times]]|publisher=Nikkei|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]], who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of ''[[kombu]]'', an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups.

==Society and culture==
It has been suggested that a fear of MSG may reflect [[Yellow Peril|anti-Asian racism]], with MSG being seen as an alien arrival in Western cooking, likely to be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney|first1=John|title=The Notorious MSG's Unlikely Formula For Success|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnmahoney/the-notorious-msgs-unlikely-formula-for-success|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dickerman|first1=Sarah|title=Could MSG make a comeback?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2006/05/could_msg_make_a_comeback.html|website=Slate magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibanga|first1=Imaeyen|title=China food scare: a dash of racism|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Health/story?id=3413105|website=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food critic [[Jeffrey Steingarten]] argued that fear of MSG should be seen as a Western-centric mindset, lacking awareness of its common use in Far Eastern cooking without apparent problems: "If MSG is a problem, why doesn't everyone in China have a headache?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haber|first1=Barbara|title=Life on the Culinary Edge|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/life-on-the-culinary-edg.html|website=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Renton|first1=Alex | authorlink=Alex Renton |title=If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn't everyone in Asia have a headache?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/10/foodanddrink.features3|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Usage}}Use==
Pure MSG is reported to not have a pleasant taste until it is combined with a savory aroma.&lt;ref name=Rolls09&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rolls, Edmund T., Oxford Centre for Computational Neuroscience, United Kingdom, Supported by the Medical Research Council and in part by the International Glutamate Technical Committee, a nongovernmental organization funded by industrial producers and users of glutamate in food. |title=Functional neuroimaging of umami taste: what makes umami pleasant? |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=804S–813S|date=September 2009 |pmid=19571217 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic sensory function of MSG is attributed to its ability to enhance savory taste-active compounds when added in the proper concentration.&lt;ref name="Loliger" /&gt; The optimum concentration varies by food; in clear soup, the pleasure score rapidly falls with the addition of more than one gram of MSG per 100 mL.&lt;ref name="Umami"&gt;{{cite book|title=Umami: a basic taste|veditors=Kawamura Y, Kare MR |publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc.| location=New York, NY|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sodium content (in [[mass percent]]) of MSG, 12%, is about one-third of that in sodium chloride (39%), due to the greater mass of the glutamate counterion.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi06"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Yamaguchi, Shizuko, Central Research Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Japan; Takahashi, Chikahito, Central Research Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Japan. |title=Interactions of monosodium glutamate and sodium chloride on saltiness and palatability of a clear soup |journal=[[Journal of Food Science]]|volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=82?85|date=January 1984|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1984.tb13675.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although other salts of glutamate have been used in low-salt soups, they are less palatable than MSG.&lt;ref name="Ball02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ball P, Woodward D, Beard T, Shoobridge A, Ferrier M.

MSG is safe to consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-msg-got-a-bad-rap-flawed-science-and-xenophobia/|title=How MSG Got A Bad Rap: Flawed Science And Xenophobia|first=Anna Maria|last=Barry-Jester|date=8 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular belief is that MSG can cause [[headaches]] and other feelings of discomfort but double-blind tests have found no good evidence to support this.&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; MSG has been used for more than 100 years to season food, with a number of studies conducted on its safety. Consumption and manufacture of high-salt and high-glutamate foods, which contain both sodium and glutamate, stretch back far longer, with evidence of cheese manufacture as early as 5,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020|title=Art of cheese-making is 7,500 years old|publisher=Nature|date=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International and national bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer.&lt;ref name="Walker00"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker R, Lupien JR, School of Biological Sciences, University of Surrey, UK, and Food and Nutrition Division, [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] of the United Nations, Italy. |title=The safety evaluation of monosodium glutamate|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=130 |issue=4S Suppl |pages=1049S–52S|date=April 2000 |pmid=10736380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of sodium chloride (3 g/kg in rats). The use of MSG as a food additive and the natural level of glutamic acid in foods are not toxicological concerns in humans.&lt;ref name="Walker00"/&gt;

A 1995 report from the [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]] (FASEB) for the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) concluded that MSG is safe when "eaten at customary levels" and, although a subgroup of otherwise-healthy individuals develop an MSG symptom complex when exposed to 3 g of MSG in the absence of food, MSG as a cause has not been established because the symptom reports are anecdotal.&lt;ref name = "FASEB"&gt;

According to the report, no data support the role of glutamate in chronic disease. A controlled, [[double-blind]], multiple-location clinical trial failed to demonstrate a relationship between the MSG symptom complex and actual MSG consumption.

Adequately controlling for experimental bias includes a double-blind, [[placebo-controlled]] [[experimental design]] (DBPC) and administration by capsule, because of the unique aftertaste of glutamates.&lt;ref name="Tarasoff" /&gt; In a study by Tarasoff and Kelly (1993), 71 fasting participants were given 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred.&lt;ref name="freeman"/&gt; A study by Geha ''et al.'' (2000) tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple DBPC trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two people out of the 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;

===Chinese restaurant syndrome===
A hypothetical MSG symptom complex, named "[[Chinese restaurant syndrome]]", attracted attention in the period after 1968, when Robert Ho Man Kwok reported symptoms he felt after an American-Chinese meal.

[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] (FSANZ) MSG technical report concludes, "There is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality. The studies conducted to date on Chinese restaurant syndrome (CRS) have largely failed to demonstrate a causal association with MSG. Symptoms resembling those of CRS may be provoked in a clinical setting in small numbers of individuals by the administration of large doses of MSG without food. However, such effects are neither persistent nor serious and are likely to be attenuated when MSG is consumed with food. In terms of more serious adverse effects such as the triggering of bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals, the evidence does not indicate that MSG is a significant trigger factor."&lt;ref name=FSANZreport&gt;{{cite web|title=MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, A Safety Assessment, TECHNICAL REPORT SERIES NO. 20 |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/publications/Documents/MSG%20Technical%20Report.doc |website=FoodStandards.gov.au |publisher=[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]], Health Minister Chair, Peter Dutton MP |date=June 2003 |accessdate=January 17, 2015 |isbn=0642345201 |issn=1448-3017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FSANZsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Monosodium glutamate search |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/Search/pages/results.aspx?k=Monosodium+glutamate|website=FoodStandards.gov.au |publisher=[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]], Health Minister Chair, Peter Dutton MP |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the FSANZ MSG report says that although no data are available on average MSG consumption in Australia and New Zealand, "data from the United Kingdom indicates an average intake of 590&amp;nbsp;mg/day, with extreme users (97.5th percentile consumers) consuming 2330&amp;nbsp;mg/day" (Rhodes ''et al.'' 1991). In a highly seasoned restaurant meal, intakes as high as 5000&amp;nbsp;mg or more may be possible (Yang ''et al.'' 1997). When very large doses of MSG (&gt;5 g MSG in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] dose) are ingested, plasma glutamate concentration will significantly increase. However, the concentration typically returns to normal within two hours. In general, foods providing metabolizable carbohydrate significantly attenuate peak plasma glutamate levels at doses up to 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight. Two earlier studies—the 1987 Joint [[FAO]]/[[World Health Organization|WHO]] Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the 1995 [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]] (FASEB)—concluded, "there may be a small number of unstable asthmatics who respond to doses of 1.5–2.5 g of MSG in the absence of food". The FASEB evaluation concluded, "sufficient evidence exists to indicate some individuals may experience manifestations of CRS when exposed to a ≥3 g bolus dose of MSG in the absence of food".&lt;ref name=FSANZreport/&gt;

==Production==
MSG has been produced by three methods: hydrolysis of vegetable proteins with hydrochloric acid to disrupt [[peptide bond]]s (1909–1962); direct chemical synthesis with [[acrylonitrile]] (1962–1973), and [[bacterial fermentation]] (the current method).&lt;ref name=Sano09/&gt; Wheat gluten was originally used for hydrolysis because it contains more than 30 g of glutamate and glutamine in 100 g of protein. As demand for MSG increased, chemical synthesis and fermentation were studied.  The [[polyacrylic acid|polyacrylic]] fiber industry began in Japan during the mid-1950s, and [[acrylonitrile]] was adopted as a base material to synthesize MSG.&lt;ref name="Yoshida70"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yoshida T, Ajinomoto Co., Planning and Development Department, Japan. |title=Industrial manufacture of optically active glutamic acid through total synthesis|journal=Chem Ing Tech|volume=42 |pages=641?644 |year=1970 |doi=10.1002/cite.330420912 |issue=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently (2016), most global MSG is produced by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for neutralization. During fermentation, ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugar cane, tapioca or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. The Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.&lt;ref name="Kinoshita57"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kinoshita Shukuo, Tokyo Research Laboratory, Kyowa Fermentation Industry Company; Udaka, Shigezo; Shimamoto, Masakazu. |title =Studies on amino acid fermentation. Part I. Production of L-glutamic acid by various microorganisms |journal=J Gen Appl Microbiol |volume=3 |pages=193?205|year=1957 |doi=10.2323/jgam.3.193 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion yield and production rate (from sugars to glutamate) continues to improve in the industrial production of MSG, keeping up with demand.&lt;ref name=Sano09 /&gt; The product, after filtration, concentration, acidification, and crystallization, is glutamate, sodium, and water.

==Chemical properties==
The compound is usually available as the [[water of hydration|monohydrate]], a white, odorless, crystalline powder. The solid contains separate sodium cations {{chem|Na|+}} and glutamate anions in zwitterionic form, &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;OOC-CH({{chem|N|H|3|+}})-({{chem|C|H|2}})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=struc&gt;Chiaki SANO, Nobuya NAGASHIMA, Tetsuya KAWAKITA, Yoichi IITAKA (1989), "Crystal and Molecular Structures of Monosodium L-Glutamate Monohydrate".

MSG is freely soluble in water, but it is not [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] and is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as [[Diethyl ether|ether]]).&lt;ref name="Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Biochemistry |editor=Win. C.|publisher=Brown Pub Co.| location=Boston, MA|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally stable under food-processing conditions. MSG does not break down during cooking and, like other amino acids, will exhibit a [[Maillard reaction]] (browning) in the presence of sugars at very high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Yamaguchi98/&gt;

===Regulations===

====United States====
MSG is one of several forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is pervasive in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including [[hydrolyzed vegetable protein]], [[autolyzed yeast]], [[hydrolyzed yeast]], [[yeast extract]], [[soy]] extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term "spices and flavorings". The [[ribonucleotide]] food additives [[disodium inosinate]] and [[disodium guanylate]] are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term "natural flavor" is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium [[ion]]). The Food and Drug Administration does not require disclosure of components and amounts of "natural flavor."&lt;ref name=FDACFR&gt;{{cite web |title=CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Vol 6, Part 501, Subpart B—Specific Animal Food Labeling Requirements |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=501.22 |website=FDA.gov |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA considers labels such as "no MSG" or "no added MSG" misleading if the food has ingredients which are sources of free glutamate, such as [[hydrolyzed protein]]. In 1993, it proposed adding "contains glutamate" to the common names of certain hydrolyzed proteins with substantial amounts of glutamate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====Australia and New Zealand====
Standard 1.2.4 of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires MSG to be labeled in packaged foods. The label must have the food-additive class name (e.g. "flavour enhancer"), followed by the name of the additive ("MSG") or its [[International Numbering System]] (INS) number, 621.&lt;ref name=AUGovLbl4231&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodstandards/foodstandardscode/standard124labelling4231.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821130741/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodstandards/foodstandardscode/standard124labelling4231.cfm|archivedate=2010-08-21 |title=Standard 1.2.4 Labelling of Ingredients |work=Food Standards Code |publisher=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moravané''' ({{lang-en|Moravians}}) is a small non-parliamentary [[political party]] in [[Moravia]] in the [[Czech Republic]].

==History==
It arose in 2005 through a merger of two older local parties: ''Hnutí samosprávné Moravy a Slezska – Moravské národní sjednocení'' ("The Movement of Autonomous Moravia and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]] - Moravian National Union") and ''Moravská demokratická strana'' ("the Moravian Democratic Party").  [[Pavel Dohnal]] became the party chairman. The party first participated in the nationwide parliamentary election in June 2006 and won 0.23% of the national popular vote, falling below the minimum threshold to gain any seats. ''Moravané'' is a member party of the [[European Free Alliance]]. A youth wing of the party (''Mladí Moravané'' - Young Moravians) also operates.

In March 2009, party leadership passed to [[Jiří Novotný (politician)|Jiří Novotný]].

==Ideology==
The main goal of the party is as follows: "''On the principle of the right of self-determination of the Moravian nation, ''Moravané'' advocates for the independence of Moravia via restoration of the Moravian legislative parliament within the territorial scope of the Moravian ecclesiastical province.''"&lt;ref&gt;Modern [[Regions of the Czech Republic|Czech regions]] don't follow ''Moravané''&amp;#39;s claimed boundaries of the Moravian state&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moravane.cz/program.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201031834/http://www.moravane.cz/program.php |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party strongly disfavours state centralism, and expresses anti-Czech ([[Bohemians|Bohemian]]) sentiment; "Prague" (both the [[Prague|city]] and [[Government of the Czech Republic|Czech government]]) is blamed for "suppressing Moravian culture, traditions and language" and for "pauperising of Moravia".&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of such statements can be seen in the party's election spots: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD0IYC86MH0 Vote No. 16] (elections 2009) or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohvctli2jTk&amp;feature=related The Moravian Truth and Czech/Bohemian Lie] (both in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Moravané'', the future of the Europe lies in dismantling the modern European nation-states and establishing new states on historical territorial boundaries. Moreover, the party supports the codification and recognition of the [[Moravian language]], traditionally considered a dialect of [[Czech language|Czech]] by linguists and the public.

==Activities==
The party organises open air actions, meetings and sit-ins, "candle marches" (founded at 2005) in [[Brno]] and [[Olomouc]], "pilgrimages to the [[Morava (river)|Morava river]] spring", demonstrations against "Bohemiazation" etc.

During a 'candle march' on 27 February 2010, forty party members decorated with numerous Moravian flags marched through the historical part of [[Brno]] to the pre-war Moravian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] building, which ''Moravané'' claims to be occupied by a "foreign state", and the Moravian Square. The protest was poorly received by passers-by, with one on-looker noting "at this rate, the [Moravian people] will be looked on as fools".&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt; The march was not registered with the Police and was later halted.&lt;ref name="diet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moravané ke "své" sněmovně nesměli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">The '''natural rate of unemployment''' is the name that was given to a key concept in the study of [[Economics|economic]] activity. [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Edmund Phelps]], tackling this 'human' problem in the 1960s, both received the [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize in economics]] for their work, and the development of the concept is cited as a main motivation behind the prize. A simplistic summary of the concept is:  'The natural rate of unemployment, when an economy is in a steady state of "full employment", is the proportion of the workforce who are unemployed'. Put another way, this concept clarifies that the economic term "full employment" does not mean "zero unemployment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It represents the hypothetical [[unemployment rate]] consistent with [[Gross domestic product|aggregate production]] being at the "long-run" level. This level is consistent with [[Gross domestic product|aggregate production]] in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in [[Labor economics|labor]] and goods markets. The natural rate of unemployment therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a [[Classical economics|classical]] view of determination of activity. It is mainly determined by the economy's supply side, and hence production possibilities and economic institutions. If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities, the natural rate of unemployment may feature [[involuntary unemployment]]. The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an efficient, expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium.

Occurrence of disturbances (e.g., cyclical shifts in investment sentiments) will cause actual unemployment to continuously deviate from the natural rate, and be partly determined by aggregate demand factors as under a [[Keynesian]] view of output determination. The policy implication is that the natural rate of unemployment cannot permanently be reduced by demand management policies (including [[monetary policy]]), but that such policies can play a role in stabilizing variations in actual unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reductions in the natural rate of unemployment must, according to the concept, be achieved through structural policies directed towards an economy's supply side. According to multiple surveys, two-thirds to three-quarters of economists generally agree with the statement, "There is a natural rate of unemployment to which the economy tends in the long run."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Alston|first1=Richard M.|last2=Kearl|first2=J.R.|last3=Vaughan|first3=Michael B.|publisher=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=82|issue=2|pages=203–209|url=http://www.weber.edu/wsuimages/AcademicAffairs/ProvostItems/global.pdf|title=Is There a Consensus Among Economists in the 1990's?|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=Dan|last2=Geide-Stevenson|first2=Doris|publisher=The Journal of Economic Education|volume=34|issue=4|pages=203–209|jstor=30042564|title=Consensus Among Economists: Revisited|year=2003|via=[[JSTOR]]|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'natural rate of unemployment' ... is the level that would be ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations, provided there is embedded in them the actual structural characteristics of the labour and commodity markets, including market imperfections, stochastic variability in demands and supplies, the costs of gathering information about job vacancies, and labor availabilities, the costs of mobility, and so on."

However, this remained a vision – Friedman never wrote down a model with all of these properties. When he illustrated the idea of the Natural Rate he simply used the standard text-book labor market demand and supply model &lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M., 1977. 'Inflation and unemployment', Journal of Political Economy, 85, 451-72.&lt;/ref&gt; that was essentially the same as [[Don Patinkin]]'s model of full employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huw Dixon|Dixon H]] (2001), [http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/chapter3.pdf Of coconuts, decomposition, and a jackass: the genealogy of the natural rate], [http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/index.html Surfing Economics], Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; In this there is a competitive labor market with both labor supply and demand depend on the real wage and the natural rate is simply the competitive equilibrium where demand equals supply.  Implicit in his vision is the notion that the natural rate is ''Unique'': there is only one level of output and employment that is consistent with equilibrium.

==Phillips curve==
Milton Friedman argued that a natural rate of inflation followed from the [[Phillips curve]]. This showed wages tend to rise when unemployment is low. Friedman argued that inflation was the same as wage rises, and built his argument upon a widely believed idea, that a stable negative relation between inflation and unemployment existed.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; This belief had the policy implication that unemployment could be permanently reduced by expansive demand policy and thus higher inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Friedman and Phelps opposed this idea on theoretical grounds, as they noted that if unemployment were to be permanently lower, some real variable in the economy, like the real wage, would have changed permanently. That this should be the case because inflation was higher appeared to rely on systematic irrationality in the labor market. As Friedman remarked, wage inflation would eventually catch up and leave the real wage, and unemployment, unchanged. Hence, lower unemployment could only be attained as long as wage inflation and inflation expectations lagged behind actual inflation. This was seen to be only a temporary outcome. Eventually, unemployment would return to the rate determined by real factors independent of the inflation rate. According to Friedman and Phelps, the Phillips curve was therefore vertical in the long run, and expansive demand policies would only be a cause of inflation, not a cause of permanently lower unemployment.

Milton Friedman emphasized expectations errors as the main cause of deviation in unemployment from the natural rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Edmund Phelps focused more in detail on the labor market structures and frictions that would cause aggregate demand changes to feed into inflation, and for sluggish expectations, into the determination of the unemployment rate. Also, his theories gave insights into the causes of a too high natural rate of unemployment (i.e., why unemployment could be [[Structural unemployment|structural]] or [[Unemployment types#Classical unemployment|classical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Criticisms==
The major criticism of a "natural rate" is that there is no credible evidence for it, as [[Milton Friedman]] himself said we "cannot know what the “natural” rate is".&lt;ref&gt;M Friedman, ‘The Role of Monetary Policy’ (1968) 58(1) American Economic Review 1, 11. E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural rate hypothesis makes the fundamental assumption that there exists a unique equilibrium level of unemployment. Importantly, [[Milton Friedman]] himself never wrote down an explicit model of the natural rate (in his Nobel Lecture, he just uses the simple labor supply and demand model).  Others have argued that there might be multiple equilibria: for example due to search externalities as in the [[Diamond coconut model]] or that there might exist a "natural range" of unemployment levels rather than a unique equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Huw Dixon |last=Dixon |first=H. |year=1988 |title=Unions, Oligopoly and the Natural Range of Employment |journal=Economic Journal |volume=98 |issue=393 |pages=1127–1147 |jstor=2233723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bhaskar |first=V. J. |year=1990 |jstor=2234184 |title=Wage Relativities and the Natural Range of Unemployment |journal=Economic Journal |volume=100 |issue=Conference supplement |pages=60–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Ian M. |year=1987 |title=Customer Markets, Trade Unions and Stagflation |journal=Economica |volume=54 |issue=214 |pages=139–153 |jstor=2554387 | doi = 10.2307/2554387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Farmer]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], the assumption that, after a [[Shock (economics)|shock]], the unemployment rate returns to its so called “natural rate' does not hold in the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Farmer |first=Roger E. A. |year=2013 |title=The Natural Rate Hypothesis: An idea past its sell-by date |work=NBER Working Paper No. 19267 |ssrn=2304694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">'''Operation Ngatipedzenavo''' ({{lang-en|'''Let Us Finish Them Off'''}}), was a large scale [[Zimbabwe]]an government assassination plot intended to eliminate the MDC leadership and punish those who supposedly voted for the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] in the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] rather than for [[ZANU-PF]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=81482 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |title= ZIMBABWE: The divorce becomes final | work=IRIN | location=Bulawayo | date=2008-11-14}} &lt;/ref&gt;

However, the campaign met with harsh condemnation from Zimbabwean opposition parties, church groups, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and the wider [[international community]]. Also people were beaten thoroughly, forced to sit on hot plate stoves, cut fingers, cut arms and skinned alive that intimidated individuals.

'''Permanent campaign''' is a [[political science]] theory and phrase.
==Concept==
The concept of a permanent campaign also describes the focus which recent presidents have given to electoral concerns during their tenures in office, with the distinction between the time they have spent governing and the time they have spent campaigning having become blurred.&lt;ref name=dohertysummery&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1859-0.html |title=The Rise of the President's Permanent Campaign |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=www.kansaspress.ku.edu |publisher=[[University of Kansas]] |access-date=July 11, 2017 |quote= Brendan Doherty provides empirical evidence of the growing focus by American presidents on electoral concerns throughout their terms in office, clearly demonstrating that we can no longer assume that the time a president spends campaigning for reelection can be separated from the time he spends governing. To track the evolving relationship between campaigning and governing, Doherty examines the strategic choices that presidents make and what those choices reveal about presidential priorities. He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office—illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff. He also shows how decisions about electoral matters previously made by party officials are now made by voter-conscious operatives within the White House.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political observers who bolster the opinion that a permanent campaign has had a significant impact on recent presidencies argue that decisions by presidents have increasingly been made with considerations to their impact on voter approval.&lt;ref name=dohertysummery/&gt; Political observers consider the rise in presidential fundraising as a symptom of the permanent campaign.&lt;ref name=dohertysummery/&gt; 

The disproportionately large amounts of time that presidents have spent visiting key electoral states (and comparatively small amount of they have spent visiting states that pose little electoral importance to them) has been pointed to as evidence of ulterior electoral motives influencing presidential governance, demonstrating the blurred lines between campaigning and governance in the White House.&lt;ref name=dohertysummery/&gt;&lt;ref name=permanentbrookings&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/permanent-campaign-brushes-aside-tradition/ |title=Permanent Campaign Brushes Aside Tradition |last1=Corrado |first1=Anthony |last2=Tenpas |first2=Kathryn Dunn |date=March 30, 2004 |website=www.brookings.edu |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |access-date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
====Patrick Caddell====
[[Patrick Caddell]] conceived the "permanent campaign" as a theory of [[political science]]. Caddell was then a young pollster for U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], wrote a memo on December 10, 1976 entitled "Initial Working Paper on Political Strategy".

"Essentially," Caddell wrote, "it is my thesis governing with public approval requires a continuing political campaign."  &lt;ref&gt;Joe Klein, [http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,1124237,00.html The Perils of the Permanent Campaign]. ''[[Time Magazine]]'', October 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Sidney Blumenthal====
The phrase "the permanent campaign," its concept and history, were first defined by journalist and later presidential senior adviser [[Sidney Blumenthal]] in his 1980 book, ''The Permanent Campaign''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iBgHAAAAMAAJ The Permanent Campaign] First edition 1980. Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0807032085}} Second edition 1982. Touchstone Book. {{ISBN|0671453416}} &lt;/ref&gt; In it, he explained how the changes in American politics from old-style patronage and party organization to that based on the modern technology of computer driven polling and media created a fundamentally new system. 
He explained that political consultants had replaced the party bosses and brought with them a new model by which campaigning became the forms of governing.

Blumenthal's work resolved the problem in political science of "critical realignment." According to [[Walter Dean Burnham]], the leading political scientist of realignment theory, {{Quote|If we view the arena of American electoral politics in historical perspective, we can say that the contemporary status quo extends back to some point in the mid-to-late 1960s. In his recent study ''The Permanent Campaign'', Sidney Blumenthal has advanced the argument that a critical realignment in fact occurred at about the point—1968—where many analysts had been expecting. They were, however, looking for realignment in the wrong place. For crucial to this one, and the 'sixth electoral era' which he argues followed from it, was the exact opposite of all previous events of this type. Instead of being channeled through, and thus revitalizing the political parties, this realignment involved the conclusive marginal displacement of these parties by the permanent campaign... The older linkages between rulers and ruled become ever hazier, ever more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dean Burnham, "The 1984 Election and the Future of American Politics," in Ellis Sandoz and C.V. Crabb, Jr., ed., ''Election 84: Landslide without Mandate'', New American Library, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;206.&lt;/ref&gt;}}   

Strategies of this nature have been in active development and use since [[Lyndon Johnson]], where priority is given to short term tactical gain over long term vision. The frenzied, headline grabbing atmosphere of [[presidential campaign]]s is carried over into the office itself, thus creating a permanent campaign that limits the ability of policies to deviate from the perceived will of the people (hence, intensive [[Opinion poll|polling]]). 

==Examples==
===Bill Clinton===
The permanent campaign is frequently associated with [[Bill Clinton]], stretching from his long political career, first as Governor of Arkansas, then President of the United States, and his continued prominence on the national stage as a former President and surrogate for his wife [[Hillary Clinton]]. 

A famous example that illustrates just how strongly this mind-set has come to influence politics was during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] when pollster [[Dick Morris]] asked voters to help decide where Bill Clinton would go on vacation. In the words of columnist [[Joe Klein]], "The pressure to 'win' the daily news cycle—to control the news—has overwhelmed the more reflective, statesmanlike aspects of the office." {{cn|date=May 2015}} 

[[Robert Reich]] has suggested that [[Bill Clinton]] is in a state of "permanent election", due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://prospect.org/article/permanent-election The Permanent Election]. (August 27, 2003) ''The American Prospect''. Retrieved February 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===George W. Bush===
[[Scott McClellan]], former [[White House Press Secretary]] for U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], wrote in his 2008 memoir [[What Happened (McClellan book)|''What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception'']]&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, Scott.  (2008)  ''What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception''.  Public Affairs.  {{ISBN|1-58648-556-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Bush White House suffered from a "permanent campaign" mentality, and that policy decisions were inextricably interwoven with politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/washington/28mcclellan.html?hp|title=In Book, Ex-Spokesman Has Harsh Words for Bush|author=Elisabeth Bumiller|date=May 28, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's presidency offers an example of how presidential travel can disproportionately target states of electoral importance. George W. Bush embarked on 416 domestic trips during his first three years in office. This was 114 more than his predecessor had in his first three years.&lt;ref name=permanentbrookings/&gt; In his first year, 36% of Bush's domestic trips were to the 16 states that were considered swing states after having been decided the closest margins during the [[United States presidential election 2000|2000 election]].&lt;ref name=permanentbrookings/&gt; In his second year, 45% of his domestic travel was to these states, and his third year 39% of his domestic travel was to these states.&lt;ref name=permanentbrookings/&gt;

A '''private intelligence agency''' ('''PIA''') is a [[private sector]] (non-governmental) or quasi-non-government organization devoted to the collection, analysis, and exploitation of information, most commonly through the evaluation of public sources ([[OSINT]] or Open Source INTelligence) and cooperation with other institutions.&lt;ref name="Private Intelligence Companies"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=Private Intelligence Companies |publisher= |date=2008-06-01 |url=http://www.michaelsmithwriter.com/pdf/intelligence_companies.pdf |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205143528/http://michaelsmithwriter.com/pdf/intelligence_companies.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some private agencies make their services available to governments as well as individual consumers; however, most of these agencies sell their services to large corporations with an interest or investment in the category (e.g. [[crime]], [[disease]], [[corruption]], etc.) or the region (e.g. [[Middle East]], [[Vietnam]], [[Prague]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ripley|first=Amanda|title=Rent A-Spook |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/15527/rent-a-spook |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The private intelligence industry has boomed due to shifts in how the [[U.S. government]] is conducting [[espionage]] in the [[War on Terror]]. Some US$56 billion or 70% of the US$80 billion national intelligence budget of the United States was in 2013 earmarked for the private sector according to the New York Times' Tim Shorrock. Functions previously performed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and other [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] are now outsourced to private intelligence corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbot|first=Sebastian|title=The Outsourcing of U.S. Intelligence Analysis|url=http://newsinitiative.org/story/2006/07/28/the_outsourcing_of_u_s_intelligence|work=News21 Project|accessdate=28 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208055727/http://newsinitiative.org/story/2006/07/28/the_outsourcing_of_u_s_intelligence|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private intelligence agencies have also been seen in fiction. [[Rubicon (TV series)|''Rubicon'']], a [[Television series|TV series]] from [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], was devoted to the intelligence consultancy American Policy Institute (API). In the [[Kingsman (franchise)|''Kingsman'' franchise]], we see the inner workings of Kingsman, a private intelligence service of which main character Eggsy is a member.

McKitrick has said, "It has become a commonplace to refer to the 'environmental crisis.' But I find the crisis rather hard to locate. On specific issues there is a continuum, ranging from non-issues, situations of concern, problems, and onward up to actual crises. Not everything is a crisis, just as not everything is a non-issue. Things mostly fall in between"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Background ==
After the [[September 11 attacks]], traffic increased significantly to chatrooms on the U.S. Army's website, goarmy.com, increasing costs of staffing the live chatrooms. As a cost-cutting measure, the SGT STAR project was initiated as a partnership between the [[United States Army Accessions Command]] and Next IT, a [[Spokane, Washington]]-based company specializing in "intelligent [[Virtual assistant|virtual assistants]]," using software called ActiveAgent. Testing began in 2003, and SGT STAR launched to the public in 2006.&lt;ref name="eff201404"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maass |first1=Dave |title=Answers and Questions About Military, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence Agency Chatbots |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/answers-questions-about-military-law-enforcement-and-intelligence-agency-chatbots |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=1 August 2018 |language=en |date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "STAR" is an [[acronym]] for "strong, trained and ready."&lt;ref name="armysite"/&gt;

SGT STAR was launched in a chat interface on goarmy.com, but has since been developed as a mobile application&lt;ref name="armysite"/&gt;, as well as a life-size animated projection that has appeared live at public events.&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergeant Star |url=http://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/sgt-star/ |website=ict.usc.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGT STAR can also interact with users on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An intelligent interface that is ready when you are |url=http://www.nextit.com/case-studies/army |website=Next IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sand dams''' are a simple, low-cost and low-maintenance, replicable rainwater harvesting technology. They provide a clean, local water supply for domestic and farming use and are suited to semi-arid areas of the world.

==Operation==

A sand dam is a reinforced concrete wall (or a similarly robust and impermeable [[weir]]) built 1–5 metres high across a seasonal sand river.

When it rains the dam captures soil laden water behind it – the sand in the water sinks to the bottom, whilst the silt remains suspended in the water. 

Research on Kenyan dams shows that only 1 to 3% of rainwater is retained behind any individual dam, the remainder continues its natural flow towards the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Hut et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the dams fill with sand - sometimes after only one rainfall or over 1 – 3 seasons. 25 to 40% of the volume of the sand held is actually water.              

A mature sand dam can store millions of litres of water – refilling after each rainfall providing a year round supply of clean water to over 1,000 people.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Application ==

The highest concentration of sand dams with the strongest track record is found in Kenya although examples are found throughout world’s semi-arid regions from Angola to Zimbabwe. Further examples are recorded in Japan, India, Thailand, SW USA and Brazil.

[[File:Africa sand dams.jpg|400px]]

Sand dams can be built in the upper and middle courses of seasonal sandy river valleys (also known as [[wadis]]). Typically, sand dams are built in the transition zone between hills and plains where the gradient of the river bed is between 0.2 - 4%, but in extreme cases sand storage dams have been constructed on slopes of 10-16% (Nilsson 1988). Dams must be built on bed rock or highly compacted sub-soil. For the obvious reason of economy on materials and labour, the stream must be reasonably narrow with well defined and stable river banks and the bedrock or impermeable subsoil within a few metres of the stream bed. Rocky banks and gorges are the most apt features. Further advice on the siting, design and construction of sand dams is available from the organisations and in the manuals listed below

== Extracting stored water ==

There are two simple ways:

#Scooping a hole in the sand. The water will naturally emerge to the surface. Scope holes used for domestic water should be protected from contamination by livestock (by using acacia fencing or similar)
#A slotted pipe buried in the sand that either passes through the dam wall or is connected to a simple hand pump situated on the river bank

== Benefits ==

# Low cost and maintenance: Sand dams are the lowest cost form of rainwater harvesting known – 3 to 100 times lower cost than other technologies. A sand dam is built to last over 50 years, has no operational costs and requires little maintenance.
# Community owned and managed: Most examples of sand dams are built by members of the communities they serve with support local and international development agencies. Community ownership and management is key to their successful operation.
# They save time and enable increased food production and tree planting: During drought periods in semi-arid regions, people might have to walk up to 12 hours a day to fetch water, which is often unsafe to drink. Freed from the chore of walking sometimes the whole day to collect the water, farmers are able to improve food production and generate surplus income.
# They provide a clean, secure and local year-round water supply in water scarce environments: The sand effectively acts as a large [[slow sand filter]] resulting high quality potable water. As the water is held under the sand, evaporation is minimal, people are protected from water-borne diseases and mosquitoes can’t breed – reducing the threat of malaria.
# Wider benefits for health, education and communities: In areas where sand dams have been built, communities have observed a dramatic fall in water related disease, an increase in school attendance and a significant increase in household income and food production.
# They transform the local ecology: The water held in the sand behind the dam spreads horizontally creating a permanent increase in the water table, allowing trees to grow naturally and transform the local ecology. The dams create a natural buffer that reduces the threat posed by flooding and drought and builds the resilience of communities to cope with the impacts of climate change in semi-arid regions.

== Case Study: A socio-economic effort at Community Development in Kitui, Kenya ==
On a global scale climate change and effects there of have exerted tremendous pressure on the biophysical, economic, political and social systems that govern the sustenance of a majority of African populations. (Zierrogel et al, 2009)

“Climate Change is expected to intensify existing problems and create new combinations of risks, particularly in Africa where there is widespread poverty and dependence on the natural environment.” (Zierrogel et al. 2009)

Kitui is a region in Eastern Kenya, East Africa, where the sand dam project has been relatively more successful in comparison to other regions that adopted the same or similar systems. The Kitui region has approximately five hundred functional sand dams that help with water storage for subsistence and commercial purposes for example irrigation, domestic use and for feeding and sustaining livestock. (Maurits, 2008)

'''Effectiveness of Sand Dams in Kitui'''

With the setup of over 500 dams in the region there is no question to how these sand dams are a major community requirement. The image below shows an overview of the multiple uses of sand dams in the Kitui region. (Lasagne, 2008)

'''Image 2.0: Table showing Sand Dams use in Kitui (Lasagne, 2008)'''

[[File:Sand Dams.jpg|centre|frame|Image 2.0: Table showing Sand Dams use in Kitui (Lasagne, 2008)]]

Human welfare:- these dams provide water security during the dry season and numerous rivers an wells dry up due to the harsh conditions of the region. (Lasagne, 2008)

Quality of Nature:- The dams provide water to the ecosystem by feeding the water table hence trees and flora are able to thrive in the surrounding areas. (Lasagne, 2008)

Food Capacity:- Due to access to water reserves numerous individuals engage in subsistence and semi-commercial farming which creates a source of income and livelihood for the Kitui People. (Lasagne, 2008)

Industrial Use:- On a larger Sale these dams provide water for industrial capacity as individuals are able to engage on economic activities such as Charcoal production, Basket making and brick laying which creates a semi-stable source of income for the locals. (Lasagne, 2008)

'''Hindrances to the sand dam project'''

There are numerous obstacles to the sand dam projects but the major ones that stand out are irregularity of the rainy seasons, slow funding, lack of communal platforms to run the projects and maintain them. (Lasagne, 2008)

'''Conclusion'''

“The average income of farmers using sand dams rose with 9000 KSh. (USD 120), while less than 3% of total runoff is used. It is estimated that in 10 years time, more than 100,000 people have better access to water through low cost measure at an investment of about 35 USD per capita.” (Lasagne, 2008) If these projects had more government, Non-governmental participation and an increased community involvement, Kitui could be a world renown model for the ability of rural communities to combat drought , famine and other effects of climate change.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
The [[German language|German]] term '''''Schießbefehl''''' ("order to fire") was the common term to refer to a [[General order|standing order]] that instructed [[East German]] border guards stationed along the [[inner German border]] to use all means, including lethal force, to prevent unauthorised crossings of the border from East Germany in the direction of [[West Germany]]. 

While many national borders throughout history have been militarised for the purpose of stopping would-be migrants ''entering'', the significance of the ''Schießbefehl'' was that East Germany's own citizens were thereby prevented from ''leaving'' their country, in violation of Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. That any citizen of [[communist]] East Germany would voluntarily defect to the [[capitalist]] West was a source of embarrassment to successive East German governments, and preventing such defections was a longstanding political objective. Over the 28 years when the [[Berlin Wall]] was in place, the number of East Germans shot dead by their own border guards was in the hundreds. After the [[reunification of Germany]], the [[Berlin District Court]] indicted East German Chancellor [[Erich Honecker]] on charges of mass murder stemming from the ''Schießbefehl'', but his failing health along with legal disputes over jurisdiction caused his trial to be abandoned.

==Prescribed procedure==

The GDR border troops ([[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|Grenztruppen der DDR]]), who were not formally integrated into the regular armed forces (the [[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]), typically carried [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] [[assault rifle]]s or [[SKS]] [[Semi-automatic rifle|semiautomatic carbines]], and were instructed to follow certain rules of engagement when encountering persons moving illegally within the border strip:

*First, to call out ''"Halt, stehenbleiben, oder ich schieße!"'' ("Stop, stand still or I will shoot").
*Next, to fire a ''warning shot''.
*Finally, if the fugitive failed to comply, to fire an ''aimed shot'', preferably at the legs, to stop the person.

The border troops were told to avoid shooting in the direction of the territory of [[West Berlin]] and [[West Germany]].

[[Image:Berlinermauer.jpg|300px|thumb|Inner German Border Strip at the Berlin Wall]]

After stopping a potential escape attempt, the shooter would be rewarded and granted a special leave. All occurrences at border outposts were kept secret. Often the soldier would be transferred to another military unit and ordered to keep silent. By contrast, when a fugitive was successful and crossed the border into West Germany, disciplinary measures taken against those border guards who had failed to prevent this "Grenzverletzung und [[Republikflucht]]" (border violation and desertion from the Republic), which often included prison terms in the infamous military prison at [[Schwedt]]. Many soldiers tried to let fugitives escape while deflecting such accusations by deliberately shooting off-target. 

Each attempted or successful escape was followed by a formal investigation by the military prosecution authority and the ''Ministerium für Staatssicherheit'' (MfS, or "Ministry for State Security", better known as the ''[[Stasi]]''). When would-be escapees were killed, strict regulations were imposed on the family regarding the funeral; for instance, no [[obituary|obituaries]] were to be printed in the local newspapers. 

East German law only allowed crossing the border at so called ''Grenzübergangsstellen'' ("[[border checkpoint|checkpoint]]s"), such as the famous [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. Checkpoint Charlie was special, since this was one of the few border crossing points in Berlin where foreigners could enter East Berlin. Elsewhere, warning signs were posted telling people not to enter the border zone. Any violation was considered a criminal act. However, these are only the formal aspects of the law. After construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, authorized travel by East Germans into West Germany and West Berlin was very limited; many young people were motivated to attempt a desperate flight over the [[inner German border]]. Overall, a total of about 260 people were killed attempting to cross at the Berlin Wall, at the main East-West border, or via the [[Baltic Sea]] (though the exact number of fatalities is difficult to estimate; see ''[[Inner_German_border#Border_deaths|Inner German border deaths]]''). In [[Berlin]] alone, 190 people were killed in the course of 28 years. An unknown number were heavily wounded and later arrested. The last victim of the Berlin Wall was [[Chris Gueffroy]]. On 6 February 1989, ''Schießbefehl'' was formally abolished.

The victims of this system also include border police soldiers who were shot by fugitives.

To avoid negative press, the ''Schießbefehl'' was suspended for public holidays or state visits. Border occurrences were recorded by the ''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (''BGS'' or ''Federal Border Guard'', the West German border guards), the West Berlin police, and by the [[military police]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. Files were collected in the central registration office at [[Salzgitter]].

==After reunification==
After [[German reunification]], the ''Todesschützen'' ("death shooters": soldiers who allegedly killed those attempting to escape East Germany) were brought to trial in the federal courts in what were known as the ''Mauerschützen-Prozesse'' (Berlin Wall shooters trials). Also, high-ranking officers of the border police and of the ''Nationale Verteidigungsrat'' (National Defense Council of the GDR) were charged in court. The verdicts generally agreed that even the common soldier should have and must have recognised that the GDR border laws were so fundamentally in conflict with the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which the GDR had signed and ratified, that they were not law at all but formalized injustice, and thus the soldiers ought to have disobeyed their commanding officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Die Todesopfer an der Berliner Mauer 1961–1989.

The '''South African Party''' was a small political party in South Africa from 1977 to 1980.

It was formed by six self-described centrists MPs who had been expelled from the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] on 19 January 1977 for refusing to accept the party's decision to accept the Marais plan to create a new united opposition party, which became the [[New Republic Party (South Africa)|New Republic Party]].&lt;ref name=omalley&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Malley|first=Padraig|title=1977|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01539/05lv01562/06lv01570.htm|work=The Heart of Hope: South Africa's Transition from Apartheid to Democracy|publisher=Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The six constituted themselves as the Independent United Party. The party renamed itself the South African Party (SAP) and elected MP [[Myburgh Streicher]] as its leader at its founding conference held in Pretoria on 27 and 28 May 1977. The new party committed itself to a federal or confederal solution to the country's political future and to the maintenance of separate group identities under white leadership with the rejection of power-sharing at every level.&lt;ref name=omalley/&gt;

The party contested the [[South African general election, 1977|1977 general election]] and won three seats in the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]], however, Streicher was defeated in his [[Cape Town]] constituency of [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]]. 

[[John Wiley (South African politician)|John Wiley]] became the party's new leader following the election. In parliament, the SAP supported the government during the 1979 [[Muldergate Scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition starts bid to impeach Vorster|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xJYuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=haEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4398,2451166&amp;dq=south-african-party&amp;hl=en|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|date=27 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 June 1980, SAP leader John Wiley announced that his party was disbanding and that its three MPs were joining the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Malley|first=Padraig|title=1980|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01539/05lv01573/06lv01574.htm|work=The Heart of Hope: South Africa's Transition from Apartheid to Democracy|publisher=Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wiley served as Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in [[P.W. Botha]]'s government, and was the only cabinet minister of English descent, until his death in 1987 of a gunshot wound to the head. Wiley's death remains an unsolved case, although suicide had not been ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Croft|first=Adrian|title=Pretoria cabinet minister found dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gi41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_KULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1314,7206566&amp;dq=john-wiley+south+africa&amp;hl=en|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=Glasgow Herald|date=30 March 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Mark Wiley, is a [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] legislator in Western Cape province. Streicher was returned to the House of Assembly in 1981 as a National Party MP. He served from 1986 to 1989 as deputy minister of transportation and from 1994 to 1997 chairman of the National Party caucus in parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">The '''South African Students' Organisation''' (SASO) was a body of [[South African]] students who resisted [[apartheid]] through political action. The organisation was formed in 1968, spearheaded by [[Steve Biko]], and played a major role in the [[Black Consciousness Movement]].

==Background==
Up until SASO's formation, the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS) considered multi-racialism to be the solution to racism and apartheid.  The SASO differed from this viewpoint, advocating a black identity separate from any white or multi-racial identity, and succeeded in attracting large numbers of black, coloured, and Indian youths.

In 1974, nine leaders from SASO were arrested and tried for conspiring to overthrow the state by unconstitutional means. The so-called "SASO Nine" were [[Saths Cooper]], [[Strini Moodley]], [[Aubrey Mokoape]], [[Mosiuoa Lekota]], [[Nkwenkwe Nkomo]], [[Zithulele Cindi]], [[Muntu Myeza]], [[Pandelani Nefolovhodwe]] and [[Kaborone Sedibe]].&lt;ref&gt;Veli Mbele,

The '''Strategic Hamlet Program''' (  SHP; {{lang-vi|Ấp Chiến lược}} ) was a plan by the governments of [[South Vietnam]] and the [[United States]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to combat the communist insurgency by pacifying the countryside and reducing the influence of the communists among the rural population.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 1070"&gt;Tucker, Spencer, ''The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History'', ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 1070.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the government of South Vietnam, with advice and financing from the United States, began the implementation of the Strategic Hamlet Program.  The strategy was to isolate the rural population from contact with and influence by the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front (NLF)]], more commonly known as the [[Viet Cong]]. The Strategic Hamlet Program, along with its predecessor, the Rural Community Development Program, played an important role in shaping of events in South Vietnam during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Both of these programs attempted to create new communities of "protected hamlets." The rural [[peasants]] would be provided protection, economic support, and aid by the government, thereby strengthening ties with the South Vietnamese government (GVN). It was hoped this would lead to increased loyalty by the peasantry towards the government.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 1070"/&gt;

The Strategic Hamlet Program was a failure, alienating more rural Vietnamese than it helped and contributing to the growth in influence of the [[Viet Cong]]. After President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] was overthrown in a coup in November 1963, the program was cancelled.  Peasants moved back into their old homes or sought refuge from the war in the cities. The failure of the Strategic Hamlet and other [[counterinsurgency]] and [[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam)|pacification]] programs were causes that led the United States to decide to intervene in South Vietnam with air strikes and ground troops.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 1070"/&gt;

==Background and precursor program==

In 1952, during the [[First Indochina War]] ( 19 December 1946 — 1 August 1954 ) French commander [[François de Linares]], in [[Tonkin]] began the construction of "protected villages," which the French later named [[agrovilles]].  By constructing quasi-urban amenities, the French designed the agrovilles to attract peasants away from their villages. This policy was known as "pacification by prosperity." In addition to offering social and economic benefits, the French also encouraged villagers to develop their own militias, which the French trained and armed. "Pacification by Prosperity" had some success, but it was never decisive, because the settlers felt insecure, a feeling which the numerous French guard posts along the perimeter could do little to dispel so long as the [[Viet Minh]] operated at night, anonymously, and intimidated or gained the support of village authorities.&lt;ref name="vietnam.ttu.edu"&gt;[[Vietnam Center and Archive]], [[Texas Tech University]]; 2002_Symposium Paper | http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/events/2002_Symposium/2002Papers_files/peoples.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1952 and 1954, French officials transplanted approximately 3 million Vietnamese into ''agrovilles'', but the project was costly. To help offset the cost, the French relied partially on American financial support, which was "one of the earliest objects of American aid to France after the outbreak of the Korean War."  According to a private Vietnamese source, the U.S. spent about "200,000 dollars on the 'show' ''agroville'' at Dong Quan."&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military ...
 edited by Spencer C. Tucker : Dong Quan Pacification Project : 1953 (Google_books extract)&gt;| https://books.google.com/books?id=qh5lffww-KsC&amp;pg=PA307 &lt;/ref&gt; After visiting the villages of Khoi Loc in Quang Yen Province and Dong Quan in Ha Dong Province, noted Vietnam War correspondent [[Bernard B. Fall|Bernard Fall]] stated that, "the French strategic hamlets resembled [[Briggs' Plan|British [Malayan] prototypes]] line for line." However, in contrast to the British, the French were reluctant to grant Vietnam its independence, or allow the Vietnamese a voice in government affairs; therefore, the agroville program had little effect.&lt;ref name="vietnam.ttu.edu"/&gt;

The [[First Indochina War]] terminated and the [[Geneva Conference (1954)]] partitioned Vietnam into communist (north) and non-communist (south) parts and the terms [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] became the common usage.

Beginning in 1954, [[Viet Minh]] sympathizers in the South were subject to escalating suppression by the Diem government, but by December 1960 the [[Vietnam National Liberation Front|National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam]] had been formed and soon rapidly achieved de facto control over large sections of the South Vietnamese countryside. At the time, it is believed that there were approximately 10,000 Communist insurgents throughout South Vietnam.

In February 1959, recognizing the danger that the guerrillas posed if they had the support of the peasants, [[President Diem]] and his brother, [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], made a first attempt at resettlement.  A plan was put forth  to develop ''centers of agglomeration''. Through force and/or incentives, peasants in rural communities were separated and relocated. The primary goal of the centers was to [[Concentration camp|concentrate]] the villagers, so they were not able to provide aid, comfort, and information to the [[Viet Cong]].

The Government of Vietnam (GVN) developed two types of centers of agglomeration.&lt;ref name="vietnam.ttu.edu"/&gt;  
:The first type, qui khu, relocated Viet Cong (VC) families, people with relatives in North Vietnam, or people who had been associated with the Viet Minh into new villages; thus, providing easier government surveillance. 

The second type of relocation center, qui ap, relocated into new villages those families that supported the South Vietnamese government but lived outside the realm of government protection and were susceptible to Viet Cong attacks. 
By 1960, there were twenty-three of these centers, each consisting of many thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;Zasloff, J.J. "Rural Resettlements in South Vietnam: The Agroville Programme", ''Pacific Affairs'', Vol. XXXV, No. 4, Winter 1962-1963, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

This mass resettlement created a strong backlash from peasants and forced the central government to rethink its strategy. A report put out by the [[Caravelle Manifesto|Caravelle group]], consisting of eighteen signers, leaders of the [[Cao Dai]] and [[Hoa Hao]] sects, the Dai Viet, and dissenting Catholic groups described the situation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tens of thousands of people are being mobilized… to take up a life in collectivity, to construct beautiful but useless agrovilles which tire the people, lose their affection, increase their resentment and most of all give an additional terrain for propaganda to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, 1965, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia article the [[Caravelle Manifesto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Concept==

In late 1961, President Kennedy sent [[Roger Hilsman]], then director of the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]], to assess the situation in Vietnam. There Hilsman met [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Sir Robert Thompson]], head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam (BRIAM). Thompson was a veteran of the [[Malayan Emergency#British response|Malayan counter-insurgency]] effort and a [[counter-insurgency]] advisor to the Diem government.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 1070"/&gt; Thompson shared his revised system of resettlement and population security, a system he had proposed to Diem that would eventually become the Strategic Hamlet Program. Thompson's proposal, adopted by Diem, advocated a priority on winning control of the South Vietnamese rural population rather than killing insurgents.  The police and local security forces would play an important role coupled with anti-insurgent sweeps by the [[Army of the Republic of South Vietnam|South Vietnamese army]] (ARVN).&lt;ref&gt;Krepinevich, Jr., Andrew F. (1986), ''The Army and Vietnam'', Baltimore:Johns Hopkins University Press, pp 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

After his meetings with Thompson, on 2 February 1962 Hilsman described his concepts of a Strategic Hamlet Program in a policy document entitled "A Strategic Concept for South Vietnam", which President Kennedy read and endorsed.&lt;ref&gt;Hilsman, Roger, ''To Move a Nation'', New York: Doubleday and Company, 1967, pp. 427-438; [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent1.html ''The Pentagon Papers: Senator Gravel Edition''], 5 vols. Boston: Beacon Press, 1971, 2:139ff; Thompson, Robert, ''No Exit From Vietnam'', London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hilsman proposed heavily fortified strategic hamlets. "Each strategic village will be protected by a ditch and a fence of barbed wire.  It will include one or more observation towers...the area immediately around the village will be cleared for fields of fire and the area approaching the clearing, including the ditch, will be strewn with booby-traps...and other personal obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, Michael L. (2006) "Redirecting the Revolution?  The USA and the Failure of Nation Building in South Vietnam", ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 27, No. 2, p. 35. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilsman proposed that each strategic hamlet be protected by a self-defense group of 75 to 100 armed men.  The self-defense group would, in addition to defending the hamlet, be responsible for "enforcing curfews, checking identity cards, and ferreting out hard-core Communists."  The objective was to separate, physically and politically, the Viet Cong guerrillas and supporters from the rural population.&lt;ref name="Latham, p. 35"&gt;Latham, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in the establishment of a strategic hamlet would be a census carried out by the South Vietnamese government.  Next, villagers would be required to build fortifications and the members of the self-defense force identified and trained.  The villagers would be registered and be given identity cards and their movements would be monitored.  Outside the fortifications would be a [[free fire zone]].&lt;ref name="Latham, p. 35"/&gt;

The South Vietnamese government on its part would provide assistance to the strategic hamlet and build an "essential socio-political base" that would break old habits and orient the residents toward identification with the country of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

President Diem in an April 1962 speech outlined his hopes for the Program:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... strategic hamlets represented the basic elements in the war undertaken by our people against our three enemies: communism, discord, and underdevelopment. In this concept they also represent foundation of the Vietnamese society where values are reassessed according to the personalist revolution where social, cultural, and economic reform will improve the living conditions of the large working class down to the remotest village.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, 1965, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, General [[Lionel C. McGarr]], was initially skeptical of the Strategic Hamlet Program, especially because it emphasized police and local security forces rather than military action against insurgents.  The U.S. military also objected to the proposed focus of the program on the most populated areas of South Vietnam; the U.S. wished to focus on areas where communist influence was greatest. After compromises were made to secure U.S. agreement, the Strategic Hamlet Program began implementation in March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Krepinevich, Jr., p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Sunrise==
[[Operation Sunrise (Vietnam War)|Operation Sunrise]] began on 19 March 1962 in [[Binh Duong]] province, bordering the city of [[Saigon]] on the North.  The province was heavily influenced by the Viet Cong, especially in the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]], a Viet Cong stronghold.  The selection of Binh Duong was contrary to Thompson's advice to choose a more secure area for the initial phase of the Strategic Hamlet Program. The United States [[Agency for International Development]] provided $21 per family to compensate farmers for their loss of property when forced to move into a strategic hamlet.  Of the first 210 families relocated, 140 were reported to have been moved at gunpoint.  South Vietnamese soldiers burned their former villages.  By May, South Vietnam's government-owned newspaper reported that only 7 percent of 38,000 rural dwellers in the target area had been relocated either voluntarily or by force.&lt;ref&gt;Krepinevich, Jr., p. 67-68; Latham, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problematic implementation==

Although many people in both the U.S. government and the government of South Vietnam (GVN) agreed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was strong in theory, its actual implementation was deficient  on several grounds. Roger Hilsman himself later claimed that the GVN's execution of program constituted a "total misunderstanding of what the [Strategic Hamlet] program should try to do."&lt;ref&gt;Hilsman, Roger, ''To Move a Nation'', p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of the implementation of the Program was one of the main causes for its eventual failure.  The [[Pentagon Papers]] reported that in September 1962, 4.3 million people were housed in 3,225 completed hamlets with more than two thousand still under construction.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pentagon Papers v.2". Gravel ed. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  By July 1963, over eight and a half million people had been settled in 7,205 hamlets according to figures given by the Vietnam Press.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  In less than a year, both the number of completed hamlets and its population had doubled.  Given this rapid rate of construction, the GVN was unable to fully support or protect the hamlets or its residents, despite funding by the United States government.  Vietcong insurgents easily sabotaged and overran the poorly defended communities, gaining access to the South Vietnamese peasants. Only twenty percent of the hamlets in the Mekong Delta area were controlled by the GVN by the end of 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview, a resident of a hamlet in Vinh-Long described the situation: "It is dangerous in my village because the civil guard from the district headquarters cross the river to the village only in the daytime…leaving the village unprotected at night.  The village people have no protection from the Viet Cong so they will not inform on them to the authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other important problems that the GVN faced in addition to those created by the failure to provide basic social needs for the peasants and over-extension of its resources.  One of these was wide public opposition to the Program stemming partly from an aggressive propaganda campaign by the Viet Cong, but also brought about by the inability of the committee to choose safe and agriculturally sound locations for the hamlets.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Strategic Hamlets in South Viet-nam: A Survey and Comparison'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to the Pentagon Papers, the most important source of failure was the inflexible nature of the ruling Ngo family.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pentagon Papers v.2." Gravel ed. Boston, MA: Beacon Press, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], President Diem's brother, headed the Strategic Hamlet Program, attempting to build fortified villages that would provide security for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Viet Cong out so that they could not operate among the villagers. Colonel [[Phạm Ngọc Thảo]] supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts they were compelled to build, he advised Nhu it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. The Ngôs were unaware Thảo, ostensibly a Catholic, was in fact a communist double agent acting to turn the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo helped to ruin Nhu's scheme by having strategic hamlets built in communist strongholds. This increased the number of communist sympathizers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Viet Cong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.

===Forced relocation===

In the best case scenario, restructuring peasant villages to create a defensible perimeter would require the forced relocation of some of the peasants on the outskirts of the existing villages. To ease the burden, those forced to move were supposed to be financially compensated, but they were not always paid by the GVN forces. To make matters worse, their old homes were often burned before their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent1.html ''Pentagon Papers''], 2:149; Sully, Francois, "South Vietnam: New Strategy", ''Newsweek'' (9 April 1962), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; These people were forced to build new ones with their own labor and at their own expense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Compounding these traumas were the long days of compulsory labor the South Vietnamese government forced on the peasants, leading [[Noam Chomsky]] to compare the hamlets to "virtual concentration camps."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Rules the World?|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|publisher=Metropolitan Books, Henry Holt and Company|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

President Diem and his brother Nhu, who oversaw the program, decided -— contrary to Hilsman's and Thompson's theory—that in most cases they would relocate entire villages rather than simply restructuring them. This decision led to large-scale forced relocation that was deeply unpopular among the peasantry. The mostly-Buddhist peasantry practiced ancestor worship, an important part of their religion that was disrupted by being forced out of their villages and away from their ancestors' graves and their ancestral homes.  Some who resisted resettlement were summarily executed by GVN forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Neil, ''A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam'', New York: Random House, 1988, pp. 309-310; Castan, Sam, "Vietnam’s Two Wars", ''Look'' (28 Jan. 1964), pp. 32-36; Kuno Knoebl, ''Victor Charlie'', New York: Frederick A. Praegar Publishers, 1967, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption===

Promised compensation for resettled peasants was not always forthcoming and instead found its way in the pockets of South Vietnamese government officials. Peasants were promised wages for their labor building the new villages and fortifications; some corrupt officials kept the money for themselves. Wealthier peasants sometimes bribed their way out of working on construction, leaving more labor for the poorer peasants. Although the U.S. provided materials like sheet metal and barbed wire, corrupt officials sometimes forced the locals to buy the materials intended to provide them with protection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sheehan, Neil, ''Bright Shining Lie'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security shortcomings===

Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the Strategic Hamlet Program was its failure to provide the basic security envisioned by its proponents. This failure was partly due to poor placement of the hamlets. Ignoring the "oil-blot" principle (establish first in secure areas, then spread out), the South Vietnamese government began building strategic hamlets as quickly as possible and seemingly without considering "geographical priorities," according to a U.S. official. The randomly placed hamlets were isolated, not mutually supporting, and tempting targets for the Vietcong.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United States: 1961-1963: Vietnam'', 4 vols. (Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1991), 2:429; Hilsman, Roger, ''To Move a Nation'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each hamlet was given a radio with which to call for South Vietnamese army [[ARVN]] support, but in fact ARVN forces were unreliable in responding to calls for help, especially when attacks occurred after nightfall. The villagers were also given weapons and training, but were only expected to hold out until conventional reinforcements arrived. Once it became clear that ARVN could not be relied upon, many villagers proved unwilling to fight even small Vietcong detachments, which could then capture the villagers' weapons. "Why should we die for weapons?" asked one Vietnamese peasant.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations'', 4:688; Castan, "Vietnam’s Two Wars", p. 35; Knoebl, ''Victor Charlie'', p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure==

Despite the Diem government's attempt to put a positive spin on the Strategic Hamlet Program, by mid-1963 it was clear to many that the program was failing. American military advisors such as [[John Paul Vann]] criticized the program in their official reports. They also expressed concerns to reporters who began to investigate more closely. [[David Halberstam|David Halberstam's]] coverage of the Strategic Hamlet Program's shortcomings caught the eye of President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;[[John M. Newman|Newman, John M.]], ''JFK and Vietnam: Deception, Intrigue, and the Struggle for Power'', New York: Time Warner Books, 1992, pp. 316-330; Halberstam, David, "Rift With Vietnam on Strategy Underlined by 2 Red Attacks", ''New York Times'' (16 Sept. 1963), p. 2; Halberstam, David, "Vietnamese Reds Gain in Key Area", ''New York Times'' (15 Aug. 1963), 1; ''Foreign Relations'', 4:237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strategic Hamlet Program was exposed as an almost complete failure in the aftermath of the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1, 1963 coup]] that left Diem and his brother Nhu murdered. US officials discovered, for example, that only 20% of the 8600 hamlets that the Diem regime had reported "Complete" met the minimum American standards of security and readiness. The situation had passed the point of possible recovery. The program officially ended in 1964.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 1070"/&gt;

On the ground in Vietnam, the demise of the program was visible. By the end of 1963, empty hamlets lined country roads, stripped of valuable metal by the Vietcong and the fleeing peasants. According to [[Neil Sheehan]], "The rows of roofless houses looked like villages of play huts that children had erected and then whimsically abandoned."&lt;ref&gt;Hilsman, Roger, ''To Move a Nation'', pp. 522-523; ''Foreign Relations'', 4:687, 4:715; Sheehan, Neil, ''Bright Shining Lie'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Vietnam: a History'' (Viking,1983) [[Stanley Karnow]] describes his observations: 
:In the last week of November . . I drove south from Saigon into Long An, a province in the [[Mekong Delta]], the rice basket of South Vietnam where 40 per cent of the population lived. 
:There I found the strategic hamlet program begun during the Diem regime in shambles. 
:At a place called Hoa Phu, the strategic hamlet built during the previous summer now looked like it had been hit by a hurricane.  The barbed wire fence around the enclosure had been ripped apart, the watchtowers were demolished and only a few of its original thousand residents remained, sheltered in lean-tos... A local guard explained to me that a handful of Vietcong agents had entered the hamlet one night and told the peasants to tear it down and return to their native villages. The peasants complied... 
:From the start, in Hoa Phu and elsewhere, they had hated the strategic hamlets, many of which they had been forced to construct by corrupt officials who had pocketed a percentage of the money allocated for the projects. Besides, there were virtually no government troops in the sector to keep them from leaving. If the war was a battle for "hearts and minds,"...the United States and its South Vietnamese clients had certainly lost Long An. 
:My cursory impression, I later discovered, was confirmed in a more extensive survey conducted by Earl Young, the senior U. S. representative in the province. He reported in early December that three quarters of the two hundred strategic hamlets in Long An had been destroyed since the summer, either by the Vietcong or by their own occupants, or by a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: A History –[[Stanley Karnow]] Penguin Books, 1997 — Chapter 9 The Commitments Deepen pp.335,336 (first published: Viking, 1983) | http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/faculty/hauser/ps493origins/ps493vietnam/karnowvietnamhistory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later Roger Hilsman stated his belief that the strategic hamlet concept was executed so poorly by the Diem regime and the GVN "that it was useless."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-11/hilsman1.html Episode 11: Vietnam], "An interview with Roger Hilsman," from the [[National Security Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present status==
Telugu and English are the two dominant languages of instruction in the schools of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, while there are also schools who use other regional languages such as Urdu as the medium of instruction. Telugu is a compulsory subject in schools in both states, with fluency in the language being a requirement for matriculation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/telangana-telugu-school-1044430-2017-09-14|title=Telugu now a mandatory subject for Telangana Class 1 to 12 school students|date=2017-09-14|website=India Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government in Andhra Pradesh is working to increase the number of English medium schools state schools, with some proposals calling for English to be the only medium of instruction in state schools, claiming that this policy reflects the growing desire of parents and that the state sector is losing pupils due to its inability to meet the increased demand for English medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/010517/english-medium-must-in-state-schools-says-andhra-pradesh.html|title=English medium must in state schools, says Andhra Pradesh government|date=2017-05-01|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2017-09-27/AP-mulls-over-English-medium-in-government-schools-/329362|title=AP mulls over English medium in government schools|website=The Hans India|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Telangana, the government has issued plans to mandate English-medium education in all the private schools in the state.

Many educated Telugu people began travelling around the world in search of knowledge-based jobs, and have observed that many countries are prospering faster than India by imparting education in their native languages without depending on English.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Throughout India, native-language advocates are demanding less reliance on English.

==Telugu promotion==

'''''Terra nullius''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|r|ə|.|n|ʌ|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|s}}, plural ''terrae nullius'') is a [[Latin]] expression meaning "nobody's land",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ''terra nullius''- English Dictionary|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-terra+nullius.html|publisher=Allwords.com|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a principle sometimes used in [[public international law|international law]] to describe territory that may be acquired by a state's [[Acquisition of sovereignty#Effective occupation|occupation]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
''Terra nullius'' stems from the [[Roman law]] term ''[[res nullius]]'', meaning ''nobody's thing''. According to the Roman law ''res nullius'', or things without an owner, such as wild animals (''ferae beastiae''), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure.

A part of the debate over the history of ''terra nullius'' is when the term itself was first used. According to [[historian of ideas]] Andrew Fitzmaurice, ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' were two different, albeit related, legal terms. He claims that ''territorium nullius'' was first used in a meeting of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1888 where the legal principles of the [[Berlin conference]] discussed and that ''terra nullius'' was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions.&lt;ref name="surplusvalue.org.au"&gt;http://surplusvalue.org.au/Misc%20Articles%20and%20Poems/terra%20nullius%20copy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Michael Connor on the other hand, argues that ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' are the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunray22b.net/truth_or_not_in_academic_accusations.htm|title=Null truth to academic accusations|author=|date=|website=www.sunray22b.net|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both scholars are active in the [[Australia]]n [[history wars]] debate.

There is considerable debate among historians about how and when the ''terra nullius'' concepts were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country's history, the dispossession of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and whether the land should best be characterized as having been "settled" or "conquered". A part of this debate concerned whether ''terra nullius'' as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.

On one side of the debate are historians such as Alan Frost and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] who claims that in the 15th and 16th century, European writers adopted the ''res nullius'' concept for territorial conquest. Frost writes:

{{quote|By the mid–eighteenth century, the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged. If a European state (a Christian Prince) had already established an effective possession of a region, another might acquire title to it only by formal cession (which might or might not involve outright purchase). If the region was not already possessed by a rival, then a state might acquire it in one of three ways, viz.: – by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship; – by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it; – by unilateral possession, on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation.&lt;ref name="samuelgriffith.org.au"&gt;http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol1/chap11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians debate whether "first discovery and effective occupation" was applied to territory inhabited by [[indigenous people]] that European empires sought to acquire or not. According to Frost:

{{quote|However, if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family, but no further; if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way; or if the region were literally uninhabited, then Europeans considered it to be terra nullius (i.e., belonging to no one), to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation.&lt;ref name="samuelgriffith.org.au"/&gt;}}

On the other side of the debate are historians which claim that ''terra nullius'' is a much younger concept, which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century. Historian Merete Borch writes:

{{quote|When the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/76.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law &amp;mdash; that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker. Michael Connor in his book "The Invention of Terra Nullius" takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of Australia as being ''terra nullius''.  He calls the concept a [[legal fiction]], a straw man developed in the late 20th century:

{{quote|By the time of Mabo in 1992, terra nullius was the only explanation for the British settlement of Australia. Historians, more interested in politics than archives, misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood, and Reynolds' version of our history, especially The Law of the Land, underpinned the Mabo judges' decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Connor in ''The Bulletin'' (Sydney), 20 August 2003: (see further Connor 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current claims of ''terra nullius''==
Few territories are currently considered ''terra nullius''.

===Bir Tawil===
[[File:Egypt Sudan claims.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified map showing Egypt's claim (yellow and green), Sudan's claim (blue and green) and Bir Tawil (white)]]

[[Bir Tawil]] is an example of a territory often claimed to be ''terra nullius''.&lt;ref&gt;There is some disagreement of whether Bir Tawil is 'terra nullius'' or not. See f.e Chris Borgen,
 [http://opiniojuris.org/2014/07/16/man-king-daddys-little-princess-territorial-claim/ The Man Who Would Be King, Daddy’s Little Princess, and their Territorial Claim]&lt;/ref&gt; Between [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] is the {{convert|2060|km2|abbr=on}} landlocked territory of [[Bir Tawil]], which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1903.  One border placed Bir Tawil under Sudan's control and the [[Hala'ib Triangle]] under Egypt's; the other border did the reverse.  Both countries assert the border that lets them claim Hala'ib, which is significantly larger and next to the [[Red Sea]], with the side effect that Bir Tawil is unclaimed by either nation. The area is, however, under the ''de facto'' control of Egypt, although it is not shown on official Egyptian maps.&lt;ref&gt;Central Intelligence Agency. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html''CIA World Factbook 2009''] MobileReference, 2009. {{ISBN|1607783339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bir Tawil has no settled population but the land is used by [[Bedouins]] who roam the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdvr.com/2014/07/17/man-lays-claim-to-african-land-to-make-daughter-real-life-princess/|title=Man lays claim to African land to make daughter real life ‘princess’|author=|date=17 July 2014|website=kdvr.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antarctica===
[[File:Antarctica, territorial claims.svg|thumb|250px|[[Territorial claims in Antarctica]], with the unclaimed part of West Antarctica shown in off-white. In the purple sector the area near the South Pole may be unclaimed, as Norway's 2015 extension of its sector to include this area violated the [[Antarctic Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-28019b.html|title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen|author=|date=|website=aftenposten.no|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
While several countries have made [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|claims to parts of Antarctica]] in the first half of the 20th century, the remainder, including most of [[Marie Byrd Land]] (the portion east from [[150th meridian west|150°W]] to [[90th meridian west|90°W]]), has not been claimed by any sovereign nation. Signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] of 1959 agreed not to make such claims, except the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], who reserved the right to make a claim.

==Historical claims of ''terra nullius''==
Several territories have been claimed to be ''terra nullius''. In a minority of those claims, international and domestic courts have ruled on whether the territory is or was ''terra nullius'' or not.

===Australia===
[[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aborigines]] had inhabited Australia for over 65,000 years before [[European settlement of Australia|European settlement]], which commenced in 1788.  [[Customary law in Australia|Indigenous customs, rituals and laws]] were unwritten. It has been claimed that Australia was considered ''terra nullius'' at the time of settlement.

In 1971, in the controversial case of ''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'', popularly known as the Gove land rights case, [[Richard Blackburn|Justice Richard Blackburn]] ruled that Australia had been considered "desert and uncultivated" (a term which included territory in which resided "uncivilized inhabitants in a primitive state of society") before European settlement, and therefore, by the law that applied at the time, open to be claimed by right of occupancy, and that there was no such thing as [[native title]] in [[Law of Australia|Australian law]]. The concept of ''terra nullius'' was not considered in this case, however.&lt;ref name="Milirrpum"&gt;''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'' (1971) 17 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 141 (27 April 1971) [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|Supreme Court]] (NT).&lt;/ref&gt; Court cases in 1977, 1979, and 1982 &amp;ndash; brought by or on behalf of Aboriginal activists &amp;ndash; challenged Australian sovereignty on the grounds that ''terra nullius'' had been improperly applied, therefore Aboriginal sovereignty should still be regarded as being intact. The courts rejected these cases, but the Australian High Court left the door open for a reassessment of whether the continent should be considered "settled" or "conquered". Later, on 1 February 2014, the traditional owners of land on [[Badu Island]] received freehold title to 10,000 hectare in an act of the [[Queensland Government]].&lt;ref&gt;''Torres News'', 10–16 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Eddie Mabo]] and four other [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Strait Islanders]] from Mer ([[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]]) started legal proceedings to establish their traditional land ownership. This led to ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 1)]]''. In 1992, after ten years of hearings before the [[Queensland Supreme Court]] and the [[High Court of Australia]], the latter court found that the Mer people had owned their land prior to annexation by Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;

The ruling thus had far-reaching significance for the land claims of both Torres Strait Islanders and other Indigenous Australians.

The controversy over Australian land ownership erupted into the so-called "[[history wars]]". The 1992 Mabo decision overturned the doctrine of ''terra nullius'' in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/native-title-research/overturning-doctrine-terra%20nullius-the-mabo-case.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Svalbard===
[[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] or [[Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Denmark–Norway]] all claimed sovereignty over the archipelago of [[Svalbard]] in the seventeenth century, but none permanently occupied it. Expeditions from each of these polities visited Svalbard principally during the summer for [[whaling]], with the first two sending a few wintering parties in the 1620s and 1630s.&lt;ref name="surplusvalue.org.au"/&gt;

During the 19th century, both [[Norway]] and [[Russia]] made strong claims to the archipelago. In 1909, Italian jurist Camille Piccioni described [[Spitzbergen]], as it was then known, as ''terra nullius'':

{{quote|The issue would have been simpler if Spitzbergen, until now terra nullius, could have been attributed to a single state, for reasons of neighbouring or earlier occupation. But this is not the case and several powers can, for different reasons, make their claims to this territory which still has no master.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Piccioni, Revue generale de droit international public vol. XVI (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The territorial dispute was eventually resolved by the [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 9 February 1920 which recognized [[Norway|Norwegian]] sovereignty over the islands.

===Eastern Greenland===
[[Norway]] occupied and claimed parts of (then uninhabited) Eastern [[Greenland]] in 1931, claiming that it constituted ''terra nullius'' and calling the territory [[Erik the Red's Land]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] ruled against the Norwegian claim. The Norwegians accepted the ruling and withdrew their claim.

===Scarborough Shoal===
The [[Philippines]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] both claim the [[Scarborough Shoal]] or Panatag Shoal or Huangyan Island (黄岩岛), nearest to the island of [[Luzon]], located in the [[South China Sea]]. The Philippines claims it under the principles of ''terra nullius'' and EEZ ([[Exclusive Economic Zone]]). China's claim refers to its discovery in the 13th century by Chinese fishermen. The former Nationalist government on the Chinese mainland had also claimed this territory after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. However, despite China's position of non-participation based on the [[UNCLOS]], the 2016 PCA denied the lawfulness of China's "Nine Dash Line" claim. Despite this, China continues to build artificial islands in the South China Sea and Scarborough Shoal is a prime location for another one. Chinese ships have been seen in the vicinity of the shoal. Observers of the photos have concluded that the ships lack dredging equipment and therefore represent no imminent threat of reclamation work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qz.com/775382/all-eyes-are-on-the-scarborough-shoal-the-reef-rimmed-lagoon-that-would-allow-beijing-to-control-the-south-china-sea/|title=The "strategic triangle" that would allow Beijing to control the South China Sea|last=Mollman|first=Steve|newspaper=Quartz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Island of New Zealand===
In 1840, Lieutenant [[William Hobson]], following instructions of the British government, pronounced the [[South Island|southern island]] of [[New Zealand]] to be uninhabited by civilized peoples, which qualified the land to be ''terra nullius'', and therefore fit for the Crown's political occupation.
Hobson's decision was also influenced by a small party of French settlers heading towards [[Akaroa]] on [[Banks Peninsula]] to settle in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Tipene O'regan, 'The Ngai Tahu Claim' in I H Kawharu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[Joseph Trutch]], the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, insisted that [[First Nations]] had never owned land, and thus could safely be ignored. It is for this reason that most of [[British Columbia]] remains unceded land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubcic.bc.ca/Resources/shortcommentary.htm |title=A Short Commentary on Land Claims in BC |publisher=Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[R. v. Guerin|Guerin v. The Queen]]'', a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on aboriginal rights, the Court stated that the government has a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] toward the First Nations of Canada and established aboriginal title to be a [[sui generis]] right. Since, there has been a more complicated debate and a general narrowing of the definition of "fiduciary duty".

===Guano Islands===
The [[Guano Islands Act]] of 18 August 1856 enabled citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing [[guano]] deposits. The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied and not within the jurisdiction of other governments. It also empowers the President of the United States to use the military to protect such interests, and establishes the criminal jurisdiction of the United States.

===Pinnacle Islands (Senkaku/Diaoyu)===
A [[Senkaku Islands dispute|disputed archipelago]] in the [[East China Sea]], the uninhabited [[Senkaku Islands]], are claimed by Japan to have become part of its territory as ''terra nullius'' in January 1895, following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].  However, this interpretation is not accepted by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), both of whom claim sovereignty over the islands.

===Burkina Faso and Niger===
A narrow strip of land adjacent to two territorial markers along the [[Burkina Faso]]–[[Niger]] border was claimed by neither country until the [[International Court of Justice]] settled a more extensive territorial dispute in 2013. The former unclaimed territory was awarded to Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/149/judgments |title=Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders: Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger) |publisher=International Court of Justice|date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clipperton Island===
The sovereignty of [[Clipperton Island]] was settled by arbitration between France and Mexico. King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] of Italy rendered a decision in 1931 that " 'the sovereignty of Clipperton Island belongs to France from the date of November 17, 1858.' The Mexican claim was rejected for lack of proof of prior Spanish discovery and, in any event, no effective occupation by Mexico before 1858, when the island was therefore ''territorium nullius'', and the French occupation then was sufficient and legally continuing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundaries, possessions, and conflicts in Central and North America and the Caribbean| page=320|year=1941|last=Ireland| first=Gordon|publisher=Octagon Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockall===
According to Ian Mitchell, [[Rockall]] was ''terra nullius'' until it was claimed by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=isles&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM-8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Isles of the North |author=[[Ian Mitchell (author)|Ian Mitchell]] |publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]] |date=2012 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formally annexed in 1972.&lt;ref name=isles /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm |title=1955: Britain claims Rockall |series=On This Day: 21 September |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/2/pdfs/ukpga_19720002_en.pdf |title=Island Of Rockall Act 1972 |website=[[legislation.gov.uk]] |date=10 February 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sealand===
One of the few micronations to control a physical location, the [[Principality of Sealand]] has existed de facto since 1967 on an abandoned British anti-aircraft gun tower in the North Sea. At the point when it was taken over, the tower had been abandoned by the Royal Navy and was outside British territorial waters.&lt;ref name="sealandgov.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandgov.org/about |title=History of Sealand |publisher=The Principality of Sealand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001184858/http://www.sealandgov.org/about |archive-date=1 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Roy Bates, who styled himself Prince, claimed that it was ''terra nullius''. Despite rejecting this claim on the basis that the tower is an artificial structure, the British government has never attempted to evict the Sealanders, and a court in 1968 confirmed that at that point, the tower was outside British jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Regina v. Paddy Roy Bates and Michael Roy Bates'', The Shire Hall, Chelmsford, 25 October 1968. {{cite web |url=http://www.seanhastings.com/havenco/sealand/judgement.html |title=Regina v.

===Western Sahara===
At the request of [[Morocco]], the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1975 addressed whether [[Western Sahara]] was ''terra nullius'' at the time of Spanish colonization in 1885. The court found in its [[International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion on Western Sahara|advisory opinion]] that Western Sahara was not ''terra nullius'' at that time.

'''Tommy Cheung Sau-yin''' ({{zh-t|張秀賢}}; born 16 April 1994) is a Hong Kong activist. He is the former spokesman of [[Scholarism]], president of the Student Union of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and the standing committee of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS).

==Biography==
He was a core member of [[Scholarism]] which was formed in 2011 to launch campaigns against the proposed [[Moral and National Education]] which was seen as biased pro-Communist curriculum and became the spokesman of the group. The campaign successfully mobilised the thousands in protest and led to the turndown of the curriculum by the government in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electoral Politics in Post-1997 Hong Kong: Protest, Patronage, and the Media|first=Stan Hok-Wui|last=Wong|page=93|publisher= Springer|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheung was later enrolled to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], studying Politics and Public Administration. He became the president of the Student Union in 2014 and the member of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS). He was actively involved in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|massive Occupy protests]] in 2014 against the [[831 Decision|Beijing's decision]] on the framework of the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Chief Executive election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student protesters to decide on next step soon|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20141124-student-protesters-to-decide-on-next-step-soon/|date=24 November 2014|work=Ejinsight}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the nine leading figures arrested in 2017 for initiating the illegal assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Occupy’ heads set to face charges|date=28 March 2017|url=https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2017-03/28/content_15592524.html|newspaper=Chind Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the seven-member "Student United 2017" running in the [[Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections, 2016|Election Committee subsector elections]] in December 2016 on the capacity of the former member of the Chinese University’s Senate but his candidacy was barred by the Returning Officer of the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]] because of his "insufficient connection" with the Higher Education subsector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four more barred from Hong Kong Election Committee bid, including student activist Tommy Cheung|date=18 November 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2047280/four-more-barred-hong-kong-election-committee-bid-including}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Territories East by-election, 2018|2018 New Territories East by-election]], Cheung announced his candidacy and joined the pro-democracy primary, running against [[Gary Fan]] of [[Neo Democrats]] and [[Kwok Wing-kin]] of the [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]].

'''We the People''', launched September 22, 2011,&lt;ref name="White House Blog"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/22/petition-white-house-we-people White House blog press release regarding the new "We the People" petitioning platform]&lt;/ref&gt; was a section of the [[whitehouse.gov]] website (under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]) for [[Right to petition|petitioning]] the administration's policy experts. Petitions that met a certain threshold of signatures were typically reviewed by Administration officials who prepared and issued official responses, however, this was not always the case.&lt;ref name="White House Blog" /&gt;  Criminal justice proceedings in the United States and other processes of the federal government are not subject to White House website petitions.  We the People, rather, served as a public relations device for the Obama administration to provide a venue for citizens to express themselves.  On August 23, 2012, the White House Director of Digital Strategy [[Macon Phillips]] released the source code for the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Macon|title=We the Coders: Open-Sourcing We the People, the White House's Online Petitions System|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/23/open-sourcing-we-the-people|work=The White House Blog|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[source code]] is available on [[GitHub]], and lists both public domain status as [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|a work of the U.S. federal government]] and licensing under the [[GPL v2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We the People GitHub repository|url=https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions/blob/7.x-1.x/README.md#license|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2017, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] announced its intention to shut down the website and replace it with a "new platform would save taxpayers more than $1m a year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House to 'temporarily' shut petition website|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42409634|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2018, the site is operating as it was before it shut down.

==Overview==
Users who wish to create a petition are required to register a free whitehouse.gov account. To sign a petition, users only need to provide their name and their email address, and they will receive an email with a link that they must click to confirm their signature. It is not necessary to have a whitehouse.gov account to sign a petition.

===Thresholds===
Under the Obama administration's rules, a petition had to reach 150 signatures ([[Dunbar's Number]]) within 30 days to be searchable on WhiteHouse.gov, according to [[Tom Cochran (technologist)|Tom Cochran]], former director of digital technology.&lt;ref name="cochranrecode"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Cochran|authorlink=Tom Cochran (technologist)|url=https://www.recode.net/2016/12/1/13765002/president-obama-digital-trump-administration-open-source|title=Farewell to Obama, our first digital president|publisher=Recode|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had to reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days to receive an official response.&lt;ref name="TOS"&gt;[https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation ''We the People'' terms of participation page], whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The original threshold was set at 5,000 signatures on September 1, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/01/we-people-announcing-white-house-petitions-how-they-work|title=We the People: Announcing White House Petitions &amp; How They Work|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was raised to 25,000 on October 3, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog20111003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon |last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/03/good-problem-have-raising-signature-threshold-white-house-petitions|title=A good problem to have: Raising the signature threshold for White House petitions|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised again to 100,000 as of January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="whblog3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/why-we-re-raising-signature-threshold-we-people|title=Why We're Raising the Signature Threshold for We the People|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House typically would not comment when a petition concerned an ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin&gt;Eilperin, Juliet (June 10, 2013). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/10/white-house-petition-to-pardon-edward-snowden-gathers-steam/ "White House petition to pardon Edward Snowden gathers steam"], ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's unclear whether Trump's advisors will make a tradition of publicly responding to petitions from the American people," Dell Cameron wrote for the Daily Dot on the day that Trump was inaugurated,&lt;ref name="dailydot"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dell|last=Cameron|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/white-house-petitions-president-trump|title=Trump's team removes all old, pending 'We the People' petitions|publisher=Daily Dot|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Trump administration that same day "archived" (that is, deactivated) all petitions in progress on the 'We the People' site. New petitions were created, but only two petitions—both created on Inauguration Day—soared above the 100,000-signature threshold within the Trump administration's first week, while other petitions created subsequently seemed not to count signatures at all.&lt;ref name="disruptivedissertation"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Lieberman|url=http://disruptivedissertation.blogspot.com/2017/01/under-trump-administration-we-people.html|title=Under Trump administration, 'We the People' White House petition website is mysteriously broken|publisher=Disruptive Dissertation|date=January 28, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was later fixed to count signatures but the Trump administration did not respond to any of the petitions until March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15022050/donald-trump-white-house-petition-we-the-people-update Will Donald Trump keep the White House petition site alive?] The Verge, March 22, 2017&lt;br/&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable petitions==

===Death Star===
In November 2012, a petition was created urging the government to create a [[Death Star]] as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 25,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response released in January 2013&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shawcross |first=Paul |title=This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/white-house-death-star/ |date=January 11, 2013 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $852 quadrillion and at current rates of steel production, would not be ready for more than 833,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-rejects-death-star-petition-doomsday-devices-us-could-build-instead-1014682|title=White House Rejects Death Star Petition: Doomsday Devices US Could Build Instead|date=January 15, 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response also noted that "the Administration does not support blowing up planets" and questions funding a weapon "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" as reasons for denying the petition.&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deathstar"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's a trap!

===Newtown shooting===
Following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|spree shooting in Newtown, Connecticut]] on December 14, 2012, a petition for new gun-control measures achieved 100,000 signatures within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin /&gt;

===Cell phone unlocking bill===
In February 2013, a petition started by [[OpenSignal]] co-founder and digital rights activist [[Sina Khanifar]] reached the 100,000-signature threshold required for a response from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/15/heres-how-cell-phone-unlocking-became-legal|title=Here's How Cell Phone Unlocking Became Legal|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the Obama administration issued a response urging the FCC and Congress to take and legalize [[cell phone unlocking]]. A year later, Congress passed the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]], the first piece of legislation driven by an online petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/01/answering-publics-call|title=Answering the Public's Call|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by President Obama on August 1, 2014.

===Prosecute 47 senators under the Logan Act===
In March 2015, as the United States and the [[P5+1]] group were negotiating with [[Iran]] on an [[Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program|agreement to restrain Iran's nuclear program]], 47 Republican [[United States Senate|Senators]] sent an open letter to the leaders of Iran strongly suggesting that a future president or Congress could nullify any such agreement. This action was widely construed as deliberate interference with the negotiations, and possibly a violation of the [[Logan Act]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/republican-senators-wrote-iran-guilty-crime-maybe "Were 47 Republican senators who wrote to Iran guilty of a crime?"], Ben Jacobs, ''[[The Guardian]],'' March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response, several similar petitions were posted on March 9, 2015. One petition, entitled ''"File charges against the 47 U.S. Senators in violation of the Logan Act in attempting to undermine a nuclear agreement"'', passed the 100,000-signature threshold within one day. The petition had reached the number 1 spot, garnering more than 320,000 signatures by April 8, 2015, more than three times the number of signatures required to qualify for a response from the White House. For a variety of reasons, however, pundits, news analysts and legal scholars are largely skeptical that the petition will receive a favorable response leading to the requested prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News Cover"&gt;ABC News.com, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iran-letter-165000-sign-petition-prosecute-gop-senators/story?id=29564985 / "Iran Letter: 165,000+ Sign Petition to Prosecute GOP Senators for Treason"], Katelyn Marmon, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg.com, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-12/can-231-445-people-who-want-tom-cotton-tried-for-treason-be-wrong-yes-/"Can 231,445 People Who Want Tom Cotton Tried for Treason Be Wrong?"], David Weigel, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;Huffington Post, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-bauer/the-logan-act-and-the-treason-meme-click-bait-for-liberals_b_6849040.html/ "The Logan Act and the Treason Meme: Click Bait for Liberals"], Monica Bauer, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR Debate"&gt;NPR.com, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/03/11/392323244/why-the-gop-iran-letter-is-spurring-debate-over-an-18th-century-law/ "Why The GOP Iran Letter Is Spurring Debate Over An 18th Century Law"], Miles Parks, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump taxes===
"Within hours"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/obama-white-house-website/index.html |title=What happened to Obama's White House website? |author=Tal Kopan| date=January 20, 2017| access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] on January 20, 2017, two petitions had been started on the site. One, for the release of his taxes, "with all information needed to verify emoluments clause compliance" reached the 100,000 signature threshold within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316382-petition-demanding-trumps-tax-returns-gets-record-number-of|title=Petition for Trump's tax returns gets record number of signatures|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=26 January 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=27 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, for the President to divest himself of his assets or put them in a blind trust, had some seventy-seven thousand. On January 22, Presidential aide [[Kellyanne Conway]] declared that the tax returns will not be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns.html?_r=0|title=Trump Won't Release His Tax Returns, a Top Aide Says|date=January 22, 2017|publisher=New York Times|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hershfeld|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, the petitions had over 385,000 and 119,000 signatures, respectively, with the former being a record number of signatures for any petition on the site. By the February 17 deadline to reach 100,000 signatures, it had exceeded one million signatures, making it the first petition on the site to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Allee|last2=Kelly|first2=Kaitlyn|title=One Million People Demand Trump's Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record|url=http://www.vocativ.com/403165/we-the-people-petition-white-house-trump-taxes/|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=Vocativ|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Antifa (United States)|American Antifa]]===
In August 2017, a petition requesting that "AntiFa" be classified by the Pentagon as a terrorist organization was launched. The petition had over 100,000 signatures within three days. The final count before White House responded was 368,423. The originator of the "AntiFa" petition, who goes by the pseudonym "Microchip", remarked to ''[[Politico]]'' that getting conservatives to share and discuss the petition was the entire point, rather than prompting any concrete action by the government.&lt;ref name="Spurious We the People petition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/24/antifa-white-house-petition-trump-troll-241990|title=White House 'antifa' petition written by pro-Trump troll|last=Musgrave|first=Shawn|date=August 24, 2017|work=Politico|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House responded to the petition, stating "Although Federal law provides a mechanism to designate and sanction ''foreign'' terrorist organizations and foreign state sponsors of terrorism, there is currently no analogous mechanism for formally designating ''domestic'' terrorist organizations. Nonetheless, law enforcement has many tools at its disposal to address violent individuals and groups." (emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns about the efficacy of We the People have been raised since before the first White House responses were published.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;Forbes.com, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/09/23/what-the-people-want-abolishment-of-the-tsa-and-marijuana-legalization/ "What The People Want: Abolishment of the TSA and Marijuana Legalization"], Kashmir Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2013, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' website published an article about 30 petitions that had been left unanswered for an average of 240 days despite each having met the signature goals. The article refers to the website www.whpetitions.info for taking "its own tally and highlights petitions that have received enough signatures but have not received responses."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;WashingtonPost.com, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/13/here-are-the-30-questions-the-white-house-doesnt-want-to-answer/ "Here are the 30 questions the White House doesn’t seem to want to answer"], Andrea Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 16 October 2016, 323 White House petitions have met their signature thresholds.  The White House has responded to 321 of them (99%) with an average response time of 117 days.  Average waiting time so far for two unanswered petitions: 23 days, according to whpetitions.info.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whpetitions.info/ whpetitions.info]&lt;/ref&gt;  The total number of petitions created and percent that have reached an actionable level beyond a response are unable to be determined at this time.

Criticism has been directed{{by whom|date=February 2015}} at the choice of administration official to answer the petitions regarding the legalization of marijuana. [[Gil Kerlikowske]], the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], was chosen to craft the administration's response.&lt;ref name="WH-Response1"&gt;whitehouse.gov, [https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/what-we-have-say-about-legalizing-marijuana We The People petition response, What We Have to Say About Legalizing Marijuana], Gil Kerlikowske&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism stems from the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, which states that the Director must oppose all attempts to legalize the use of illicit drugs in any form.&lt;ref name="ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 1998"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/reauthorization-act Title VII Sec. 704(b)(12)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redbook.gao.gov1"&gt;redbook.gao.gov, [http://redbook.gao.gov/17/fl0083064.php Application of Anti-Lobbying Laws to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Open Letter to State Level Prosecutors], B-301022, March 10, 2004, Anthony H. Gamboa&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions of We the People have focused on its technical glitches,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post1"&gt;''The Huffington Post'', [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jh-snider/we-the-people-petition-website_b_1062883.html/ The Case of the Missing White House Petition], October 31, 2011, J.H.

Snider&lt;/ref&gt; There is criticism about the willingness of the administration to answer petitions that meet the threshold for response, when several qualifying petitions have been unanswered for months or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Josh Feldman |date=April 2, 2014|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-white-house-petition-demands-the-white-house-actually-answer-white-house-petitions/ |title=New White House Petition Demands the White House Actually Answer White House Petitions |publisher=MediaIte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Digital divide in the United States|digital divide]] means that poor communities will have difficulty participating equally in We The People.&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;''New Statesman'', [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/voices/2012/04/britains-other-islanders-petition-white-house/ Britain's Other Islanders Petition the White House], April 3, 2012, Sean Carey&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weeks of the presidency of Donald Trump, ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reported that many popular petitions did not appear to be receiving any signatures. Additionally, certain URLs to the petitions led to error pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hooton|first1=Christopher|title=White House petition to save arts funding not registering signatures|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/president-donald-trump-arts-funding-nea-neh-cpb-prs-npr-petition-white-house-a7541631.html|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The Independent|date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PenzeyMoog|first1=Caitlin|title=White House petitions are basically turned off|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/white-house-petitions-are-basically-turned-249143|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The A.V. Club|date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macon Phillips, the man behind ''We the People'', told ''[[BuzzFeed|BuzzFeed News]]'' that the issue stemmed from issues with its [[Cache (computing)|cache]]. He also thought that Trump's administration "is still trying to get their heads around how it works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=Blake|title=No, Signatures On The White House Petition Site Aren't Intentionally Frozen|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/blakemontgomery/signatures-on-the-white-house-nea-petition-site|accessdate=January 31, 2017|work=BuzzFeed|date=January 27, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
