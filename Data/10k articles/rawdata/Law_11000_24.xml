      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11227">[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information|title=Freedom of Information|last=|first=|date=|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] of the country and a law that falls below [[Council of Europe]] standards in the [[Northern Cyprus|Northern part of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is ''de facto'' divided.

As to 2011, a research by the [[Open Cyprus Project]] showed that there was a level of 75% of [[administrative silence]] island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus. Report and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. 

'''On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Northern Cyprus ==
The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of  access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be “necessary in a democratic society”. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007.

The Right to Access Information Law obliges “public bodies” to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/nat/11269|title=Open Cyprus Project: Results|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2011|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Cyprus ==
The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Access to Official Documents]] as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention’s minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/28182|title=Civil society warn Cyprus’ draft transparency law under threat if excessive exceptions persist|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017)

The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following:
* Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution;
* the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s);
* the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same  terms;
* the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies;
* the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis;
* the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period;
* the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002;
* the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990;
* the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200;
* the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001;
* the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999.
According to experts, these non-specific laws that might grant access to some classes of information, such as environmental information or archives, require amendments to comply with the basic international and European standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/10/18/ministry-defends-planned-freedom-of-information-law/|title=Ministry defends planned freedom of information law|last=Psyllides|first=George|date=October 18, 2015|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister [[Ionas Nicolaou]] expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be “one of the best in the [[European Union]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/20942|title=Access Info welcomes Cyprus’ commitment to strong FOI law|last=Pavlou|first=Andreas|date=October 21, 2015|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in February 2017, the association [[Access Info Europe]] has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/27727|title=Cypriot lawmakers challenged to ensure FOI is free and exceptions are limited|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/18/ngo-calls-foi-fees-axed/|title=NGO calls for FOI fees to be axed|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=February 18, 2017|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no [[public interest]] test.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Comments_FOIlaw_cyprus_parliamentarycommittee_28feb2016.pdf|title=Σχόλια από Access Info Europe περί το νομοσχέδιο που ρυθμίζει το δικαίωμα πρόσβασης σε ληροφορίες του δημόσιου τομέα (Comments from Access Info Europe on the draft law regulating the right of access to Public Sector Information)|last=|first=|date=February 28, 2016|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, [[Citizen Service Centres]] have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/nrp2016_cyprus_en.pdf|title=EUROPE 2020- Cyprus National Reform Programme 2016|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''age of consent''' is the age below which a minor is considered to be [[legally incompetent]] to consent to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]]. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was [[Consent|consensual]], and such sexual activity may be considered [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances.

The term ''age of consent'' rarely appears in legal [[statute]]s.&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}} Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to [[marriageable age|marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry for "age of consent"&lt;/ref&gt; but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], and [[List of countries by minimum driving age|driving age]].

Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a [[misdemeanor]], such as ''corruption of a minor'', to what is popularly called ''[[statutory rape]]''.

There are many "grey areas" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between [[federal law|federal]] and [[state law|state]] laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt;

==History and social attitudes==

===Traditional attitudes===
In traditional societies, the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of [[puberty]], [[menstruation]] for a woman, and pubic hair for a man.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |title= Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society |website=faqs.org |publisher = Internet FAQ Archives |accessdate = 25 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928120836/http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |archive-date=28 September 2008 |first=Vern |last=Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]] in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (c. 700&amp;nbsp;BC) suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty, and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty.

Reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce. In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN—BOOK FOUR—TITLE I—Betrothals and Marriages—C3 |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archivedate=17 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than&amp;nbsp;seven: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of two- and three-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

The first ''recorded'' age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]] made it a misdemeanor to "ravish" a "maiden within age," whether with or without her consent. The phrase "within age" was later interpreted by jurist Sir [[Edward Coke]] (England, 17th century) as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627095601/http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |archivedate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only nine when she was married to William Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958061287|title=By birth or consent: children, law, and the Anglo-American revolution in authority.|last=Brewer|first=Holly|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=0807829501|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Edward Coke "made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a [[dower]] from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In the 16th century, a small number of Italian and German states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls, setting it at twelve years. Towards the end of the 18th century, other European countries also began to enact similar laws. The first French Constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at eleven years. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at ten to twelve years.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230|title = Children and Youth in History—Age of Consent Laws|publisher = George Mason University|accessdate = 29 June 2015|last = Robertson|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age of consent laws were, historically, difficult to follow and enforce: legal norms based on ''age'' were not, in general, common until the 19th century, because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt;

In [[Christianity|Christian]] societies, [[fornication|sex outside marriage]] was forbidden. Older children were themselves often punished for being complicit in sexual interaction with an adult.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Western Christianity also deemed that children were born into the [[original sin]], and, as such, were perceived as inherently immoral.&lt;ref name="aic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/special/007/Historical-review-sexual-offence-child-sexual-abuse.pdf|title=Historical review of sexual offence and child sexual abuse legislation in Australia: 1788–2013|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology|last1=Boxall|first1=Hayley|last2=Tomison|first2=Adam M.|last3=Hulme|first3=Shann|date=2014|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children had very few rights and were considered the [[wikt:chattel|chattel]] of the father.&lt;ref name="aic"/&gt; From the late 18th century, and especially in the 19th century, attitudes started to change. By the mid-19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="aic"/&gt;

===Reforms in the 19th and 20th century===
A general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era. Attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood. While ages from ten to thirteen years were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in [[western world|Western countries]] during the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"/&gt;

[[File:William Thomas Stead.jpg|thumb|200 px|Several articles written by investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] in the late 19th century on the issue of [[child prostitution]] in London led to public outrage and ultimately to the raising of the age of consent to sixteen.]]

English [[common law]] had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of ten to twelve years old, but the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1875]] raised this to thirteen in Great Britain and Ireland. Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.

The investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he "purchased" one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four exposés entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental "pleasure palaces". The "Maiden Tribute" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|title = Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727184445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|archivedate = 27 July 2014|last = Hogenbloom|first = Melissa|date = 1 November 2012|publisher = BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The New York Times/1895/10/15/Purity Congress Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

In [[France]], Portugal, Denmark, the [[Swiss canton]]s and other countries, the minimum age was raised to between thirteen and sixteen years in the following decades.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"/&gt; Though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality, since then the ''raison d'être'' of the laws has changed to [[child welfare]] and a so-called right to childhood or innocence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Emergence of a New Taboo: The Desexualization of Youth in Western Societies Since 1800.'' by Martin Killias.

===21st century and present day situation===
In the 21st century, concerns about [[child sex tourism]] and [[commercial sexual exploitation]] of children gained international prominence, and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions, as well as in the adoption of several international instruments.

The [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] ([[Lanzarote]], 25 October 2007), and the [[European Union]]'s ''Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council'' of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF|title=DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted.

The [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] came into force in 2002.

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], which came into force in 2003, prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolTraffickingInPersons.aspx|title=Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|publisher=[[OHCHR]]|date=15 November 2000|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] (which came into force in 2008) also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children.

Several Western countries have raised their ages of consent recently. These include [[Ages of consent in Canada|Canada]] (in 2008—from 14 to 16); and in Europe, [[Ages of consent in Europe#Iceland|Iceland]] (in 2007—from 14 to 15), [[Ages of consent in Europe#Lithuania|Lithuania]] (in 2010—from 14 to 16), [[Ages of consent in Europe#Croatia|Croatia]] (in 2013—from 14 to 15), and [[Ages of consent in Europe#Spain|Spain]] (in 2015—from 13 to 16).

The International Criminal Court Statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape/sexual violence statute, but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons "''incapable of giving genuine consent''"; and the explicative footnote states, "It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or ''age-related incapacity''." (see note 51)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/336923D8-A6AD-40EC-AD7B-45BF9DE73D56/0/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf|title=Elements of Crimes|publisher=[[International Criminal Court]]|date=2011|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a crime in most countries, exceptions to this include, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. Jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense, including ''[[child sexual abuse]]'', ''[[statutory rape]]'', ''illegal [[carnal knowledge]]'', ''corruption of a minor'',&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; besides others.

The enforcement practices of age-of-consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture (see above). Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g. a teacher, minister, or doctor). The [[sex]] of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual's guilt and therefore enforcement.&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt;

===Age===
The threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions ([[#Age of consent by location|see above]]). Most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent.&lt;ref name="SOA2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 9 to 12)|publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after the onset of their [[puberty]], such as [[Ages of consent in Asia#Yemen|Yemen]], but only in marriage. Ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used, such as the [[Lunar calendar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukm.my/ijwas/images/koleksi_jurnal_pdf/vol4_n1_2012a/3_Pesalah_KanakKanak_Article.pdf|title=Child offenders in Iran: Legal Analysis on the Age of Criminal Responsibility|publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|last1=Mousavi|first1=Shohreh|last2=Shapiee|first2=Rohimi|last3=Nordin|first3=Rohaida|date=30 June 2012|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193702/http://www.ukm.my/ijwas/images/koleksi_jurnal_pdf/vol4_n1_2012a/3_Pesalah_KanakKanak_Article.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; how [[February 29#Births|birth dates]] in [[leap year]]s are handled, or even the method by which birth date is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Defenses and exceptions===
The age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor's ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age, for example:
; Reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent: In some jurisdictions it is a defense if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent. However, where such a defense is provided, it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show [[due diligence]] in determining the age of the victim (e.g. an underage person who used a fake identification document claiming to be of legal age).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Larry W. Myers | title=Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed defense to Statutory Rape| journal= Michigan Law Review| volume= 64| issue=1|year=1965|pages=105–136 | doi=10.2307/1287118|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1287118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Marriage: In various jurisdictions, age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other.
; {{visible anchor|Close-in-age exemptions}}: Some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age to them. For instance, in [[Canada]], the age of consent is 16, but there are two close-in-age exemptions: sex with minors aged 14–15 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older, and sex with minors aged 12–13 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002644/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/01/crime-bill.html| archivedate= 20 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development: for instance, the age of consent in [[Finland]] is 16, but the law states that the act will not be punished if "there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039 |title=FINLEX ®—Translations of Finnish acts and decrees: 39/1889 English |publisher=Finlex.fi |date=2009-05-29 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age. For example, the age of consent in the US state of [[Delaware]] is 18, but it is allowed for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Delaware Code | title = TITLE 11, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, Delaware Criminal Code, CHAPTER 5.

; Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies: Some jurisdictions, such as [[the Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Suriname]] have a higher age of consent for [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] sexual activity. In both the United Kingdom and Western Australia, for example, the age of consent was originally 21 for same-sex sexual activity between males (with no laws regarding [[lesbian]] sexual activities), while it was 16 for [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] sexual activity; this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;''The Causes and Cures of Criminality'' Eysenck, Hans 1989 Plenum Press New York page 229&lt;/ref&gt; However, such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged. In [[Canada]], the age of consent for [[anal sex]] is officially higher at 18 years, compared with 16 years for vaginal and oral sex.&lt;ref name="can"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.159.html |title=159.

; Gender-age differentials: In some jurisdictions (such as [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref name="Indonesia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaIndonesia.asp |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080229151529/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaIndonesia.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 February 2008 |title=Sexual Offences Laws – Indonesia |publisher=Interpol |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person. In countries where there are gender-age differentials, the age of consent may be higher for girls—for example in [[Papua New Guinea]], where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is 16 for girls and 14 for boys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pg/LRC/WP_1.htm |title=Law, Ethics and HIV/AIDS: Existing Law of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Paclii.org |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419132305/http://www.paclii.org/pg/LRC/WP_1.htm |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be higher for males, such as in Indonesia, where males must be 19 years old and females must be 16 years old.&lt;ref name="Indonesia" /&gt; There are also numerous jurisdictions—such as Kuwait&lt;ref name="Kuwait"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=Summary record of the 488th meeting : Kuwait |publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palestinian National Authority|the Palestinian Territories]]&lt;ref name="Palestine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/palestine.htm |title=Palestinian Territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip – Marriage Age |publisher=Emory Law |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—in which [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage laws]] govern the gender-age differential. In these jurisdictions, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage, so the ''de facto'' age of consent is the marriageable age. In Kuwait, this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old.
; Position of authority/trust: In most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 (such as England and Wales),&lt;ref name=SOA2003_a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 16 to&amp;nbsp;24) |publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18, the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher. Examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students. For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes&amp;nbsp;18.

; Circumstances of the relationship: In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called "estupro" defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person.

A growing number of countries have specific [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial legislation]] that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children. In 2008, [[ECPAT]] reported that 44 countries had extraterritorial child sex legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Child Sex Tourism? - ECPAT International|url=http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/cst_faq_eng.pdf|page=35|publisher=[[ECPAT]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[PROTECT Act of 2003]], a federal United States law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with U.S. citizens from another state, if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal, state, or local law. This applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the United States, or from one state into another, for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423|title=18 U.S. Code § 2423—Transportation of minors|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOLR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solresearch.org/~SOLR/rprt/USnatlAoC.asp |title=Research on sex offender laws and their effects on people and society |year=2009 |publisher=SOL Research.org |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Gender of participants===
There is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter, in law or in practice. Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt; Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt; On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an "unequal act" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs,&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA writes that "Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men."[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents]&lt;/ref&gt; and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in ''[[Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County|Michael M. v. Superior Ct.450 U.S. 464 (1981)]]'' it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because "the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html|title=Michael M. v. Superior Ct. :: 450 U.S. 464 (1981) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys (the latter acts often falling under [[sodomy]] and [[buggery]] laws). This means that in some legal systems, issues of women having sexual contact with underage partners were rarely acknowledged. For example, until 2000, in the UK, before the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]], there was no statutory age of consent for [[lesbian]] sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1045383.stm|title=BBC News—UK—Q and A: The age of consent|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], before 2005, there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys.&lt;ref&gt;"In respect of sexual conduct with a young person aged under 16, the bill [Crimes Amendment Bill (No 2) which became law in 2005 [http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL5923_1/crimes-amendment-bill-no-2] significantly toughens the law.

The age at which a person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent. In jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent, those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of a married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent. Some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age, as in the case of [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Power |first=Carla |title=Nujood Ali &amp; Shada Nasser win "Women of the Year Fund 2008 Glamour Award" |publisher=Yemen Times |date=12 August 2009 |url=http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |accessdate=6 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405190616/http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |archivedate=5 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Human Rights Watch| title= World Report 2001|chapter= Yemen: Human Rights Developments | publisher= Human Rights Watch | year=2001 | url= https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html | accessdate=8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214816/http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html| archivedate=15 June 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, states, or other jurisdictions, the age of consent may be lower than the age at which a person can appear in [[pornography|pornographic]] images and films. In many jurisdictions, the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is 18. As such, in some jurisdictions, films and images showing individuals under the age of 18, but above the age of consent, that meet the legal definition of [[child pornography]] are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction's age of consent laws. In those cases, it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered a sex crime. For example, in the United States under federal law it is a crime to film minors below 18 in sexual acts, even in states where the age of consent is below 18.&lt;ref name="SOLR" /&gt; In those states, charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with a minor, who could not be otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape, provided they filmed or photographed the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brilliant |first=Jeremy |title=New Castle detective resigns over child porn charges |url=http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=10854092&amp;nav=9Tai |accessdate=25 May 2012 |newspaper=wthr.com Eyewitness News |date=August 5, 2009 |location=Henry County |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524173904/http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=10854092&amp;nav=9Tai |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
{{Main article|Age of consent reform}}
Age-of-consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups, for different reasons, to alter or abolish age-of-consent laws. These efforts advocate five main positions:
* Introductions of close-in-age exceptions.
* A change in the way that age-of-consent laws are examined in court.
* Either increases in the ages of consent or more severe penalties or both.
* Either decreases in the ages of consent or less severe penalties or both.
* Abolition of the age-of-consent laws either permanently or as a temporary, practical expedient.

'''Angostura bitters''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|æ|ŋ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|s|tj|ʊər|ə}}) is a concentrated [[bitters]] (herbal [[ethanol|alcoholic]] preparation) based on [[gentian]], herbs and spices,&lt;ref name="Fallis"&gt;{{cite book

| title=Wine
| publisher=iUniverse
| page=214

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[House of Angostura]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It is typically used for flavouring beverages or, less often, food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (now [[Ciudad Bolívar]], [[Venezuela]]), hence the name, but do not contain [[angostura bark]]. The bottle is easily recognisable by its distinctive oversized label. 'Angostura' is Spanish for 'narrowing', the town of Angostura having been located at the first narrowing of the [[Orinoco River]].

==History==
The recipe was developed as a tonic by a German, [[:es:Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert|Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert]] (1796–1870),&lt;ref&gt;Siegert v. Gandolfi et al., reported in ''The Federal Reporter'' '''149''' 1907:100ff.&lt;/ref&gt; surgeon general in [[Simón Bolívar]]'s army in Venezuela.  Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;1830 date given as testimony in Siegert v. Findlater, 1876, reported  in N.C. Moak,''Reports of Cases Decided by the English Courts:'' "8. Chancery Division" (Albany, NY, 1880) pp21ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegert was based in the town of Angostura and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians.&lt;ref name="Mysteries"&gt;Raymond, J.[https://web.archive.org/web/20000925211208/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography/bio_JGB_Siegert_bitters.htm "Mysteries in Angostura Museum: Story of founder Dr. Siegert comes to life", ''Trinidad Guardian''] January 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;Siegert v. Findlater; Siegert v. Gandolfi.&lt;/ref&gt; Angostura won a medal at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien]]. The medal is still depicted on the oversized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] in profile.

The exact formula is a [[Trade secret|closely guarded secret]], with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Uses==
Angostura bitters are extremely concentrated and may be an [[acquired taste]]; though 44.7% alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring.&lt;ref name=shortage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbcompanion.com/herbs-in-the-kitchen/in-the-news-angostura-bitters-shortage.aspx|title=In the News: Angostura Bitters Shortage|author=|date=|website=Mother Earth Living|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angostura bitters are a key ingredient in many [[cocktails]]. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in Simón Bolívar's army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with [[gin]]. The mix stuck in the form of a [[pink gin]], and is also used in many other alcoholic [[cocktails]] such as [[long vodka]], consisting of [[vodka]], Angostura bitters, and [[lemonade]]. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: the [[Old Fashioned]], made with [[whiskey]], bitters, sugar, and water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink407.html|title=Old Fashioned recipe|author=|date=|website=www.drinksmixer.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]], made usually with [[rye whiskey]] and sweet [[vermouth]]. In a [[Pisco Sour]] a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a [[Champagne Cocktail]] a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.

In Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local [[Gunner (cocktail)|Gunner]] cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the [[Mojito]] cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in "soft" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is [[lemon lime and bitters]]. In [[Malawi]], bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, [[ginger ale]] and [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] to make a 'rock shandy'.

Angostura bitters are an essential ingredient. along with Earl Grey tea, tabasco sauce and green chillies, in the popular North London cocktail, the Flaming Hilary. 

''Angostura Bitters Drink Guide'', a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.

Among certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia) shots of Angostura are taken as the 'bartender's handshake' either during or after the shift is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talesofthecocktail.com/culture/praise-bartenders-handshake|title=In Praise of the Bartender's Handshake|date=2017-02-01|work=Tales of the Cocktail|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)|Washington Island]] off the northeast tip of [[Door Peninsula]] in [[Door County]], [[Wisconsin]].  The pub began selling shots of bitters as a ''stomach tonic for medicinal purposes'' under a pharmaceutical license during [[Prohibition in the United States]].  The practice, which helped the pub to become the oldest continuously-operating tavern in Wisconsin, remained a tradition after the repeal of Prohibition. As of 2018, the pub hosts a Bitters Club, incorporates bitters into food menu items, and sells upwards of 10,000 shots per year.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunkel|first1=Leigh|title=How a Tiny Wisconsin Island Became the World's Biggest Consumer of Bitters|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/washington-island-wisconsin-bitters-shots|website=[[Atlas Obscura]]|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angostura bitters is often incorrectly believed to have poisonous qualities because it is associated with angostura bark (although it does not actually contain any), which, although not toxic, during its use as a medicine was often adulterated by unscrupulous sellers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthnotes.tripod.com/angostura.htm|title=Angostura - Herb Database + Images|first=Ernestina Parziale|last=CH|date=|website=earthnotes.tripod.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who padded out the sacks of bark with cheaper, poisonous ''[[Strychnos nux-vomica]]'' or [[copalchi]] bark.&lt;ref name="Fallis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since 2007, Angostura has also produced Angostura Orange, an [[orange bitters]].

==Shortage of 2009==
There was a shortage of Angostura bitters in 2009;&lt;ref name=shortage /&gt; the company reported that this was caused primarily by a problem in their supply of bottles. There were incorrect rumours of a product recall, or that production of the bitters had stopped at the plant in Trinidad. The shortage was the subject of many news articles and blogs, particularly in the cocktail industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/19/AR2010011900877.html/|title=Spirits: The Angostura Bitters Shortage calls for creativity|author=|date=|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arun Ferreira''' is a political activist in India. He was arrested in 2007 for alleged links to the Indian [[Naxalite]] movement and spent five years in prison before he was acquitted in 2012. He began a career as a criminal lawyer defending political prisoners. He was arrested again in August 2018 and is currently under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/knock-on-ferreiras-door-came-at-6am-arrest-9-hours-later/articleshow/65585938.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ferreira’s career and interests in social activism were strongly influenced by his close relationship with his family, specifically his uncle, Father Faymond D’Silva,&lt;ref&gt;https://mronline.org/2008/05/13/mumbais-rebels-those-who-couldnt-remain-unmoved/&lt;/ref&gt; who was also a [[liberation theologist]].  As a member of the [[All-India Catholic University Students’ Association]], he began to explore the strong social sinfulness of the millions of impoverished people and why there is so much poverty while at the same time india is abundant in resources.  D’Silva taught many Catholic youths about the strong social imbalances between the wealthy, and the impoverished.  Ferreira was raised hearing about the unequal distribution of resources and the rich who always remained in control.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
 
Ferreira’s attended [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St Xaviers College]] in early 1990’s and as a student, he took a large part in an organization called Cheshire home, assisting in reading to blind children and orphans..  Arun also became interested in liberation theology, and then grew to express his thoughts about liberation overpowering theology, and soon adopted a more radical view of politics and the rights that human beings should be given and graduated in 1993 from St. Xavier.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
 
After graduating, Ferreira worked in favor of the slum-dwellers and squatters of Mumbai, where he became involved in helping slum rehabilitation at [[Dindoshi]] where he worked for the relocation of slums from [[Colaba]] to [[Goregaon]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Education ==
Ferreira attended [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St Xaviers College]] in [[Mumbai]]. During his time there, he was known to aid the annual blood donation drive by sketching caricatures for those who donated blood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/the-trial-of-arun-ferreira-a-political-activist-writes-about-the-oppressive-life-in-an-indian-jail/|title=The Trial of Arun Ferreira: A political activist writes about the oppressive life in an Indian jail|date=2014-10-26|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2016, he attended [[Siddharth Law College]] and received his degree in law.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/cartoonist-and-activist-arun-ferreira-among-the-five-detained-for-naxal-links-heres-all-you-need-to-know-about-him&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
As reported by the Chandrapur superintendent of police, Cherring Dorje, Ferreira used to run a government banned organisation named Vidyarthi Pragati Sangathana in Mumbai. The Vidyarthi Pragati Sanghatana is a student organisation that took many struggles and campaigns for the rights of students and other oppressed sections. With his VPS comrades, Arun Ferreira hoped to transform a class- and caste-ridden country into a more just and equitable one. He was a big part of the organisation’s decision-making process, fighting for the democratisation of student councils in the various colleges, cultivating student-worker and student-peasant solidarity, the latter, buttressed by its “go-to-the-village”campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

He moved to Chandrapur in 2001 until 2006 when along with Arun Bhelke, he started the Deshbhakti Yuva Manch to recruit more youths for the banned outfit, Communist Party of India (Maoist). Arun was horrified at the brutal killings of four members of a dalit family on September 29, 2006 in Khairlanji village (Bhandara district) and the police and government’s attempt at a coverup. Arun was active in the post-Khairlanji protests — the protesters’ endeavour was to hasten the emergence of an uncompromising leadership among the dalits, and to find support for the dalit cause among the underprivileged kunbis, marathas and “other backward classes”.  He was also organising students in Chandrapur, some of whom (of the Deshbakth Yuva Sanghatan) have since been persecuted by the police.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

He was arrested in his late 30’s on May 8, 2007 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on charges of sedition and spent four years and eight months at the Nagpur jail. Here he began to draw and these sketches marked the beginning of Ferreira’s book Colours of the Cage (Aleph).The book depicts the torture and misery Ferreira and other inmates go through behind bars. Ferreira does not hold back in his descriptions of the atrocities he and other inmates were forced to endure. Here is an excerpt; “To make me more amenable to their demands, they stretched out my body completely, using an updated version of the medieval torture technique of drawing (though there was no quartering). My arms were tied to a window grille high above the ground while two policemen stood on my outstretched thighs to keep me pinned to the floor.” Colours of the Cage stands as a testimony to the urgent need of justice within the justice system of India. Journalist Lindsay Perreira is among the few that openly praise this memoir. She writes, “Ferreira takes us into a world of blatant violations of justice, in India’s dark corners, untouched by the unrelenting glare of TV cameras. It’s where time appears to have stopped, where torture is encouraged, corruption is endemic and helplessness is taken for granted.”{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 2008, Arun Ferreira took to a hunger strike along with other imprisoned activists. Over the course of his sentence, Arun Ferreira had 11 cases filed against him under the UAPA and the Arms Act. In 2010, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that Maoists were “India’s greatest internal security threat”.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

After his acquittal in 2011, Ferreira completed his degree from Siddharth Law College and began working as a lawyer in December 2016. He then became a part of the ‘Indian Association of People’s Lawyers’ and the ‘Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights’. IAPL was created to gather lawyers involved in the legal support of collective struggles for people’s rights and in situations of gross rights violations. The main objective of the CPDR has been to educate people on their democratic rights as provided in the Constitution of India and struggle against violation of civil rights by the state as well as civil society elements. Arun Ferreira carried out social work with an NGO, Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which was a left-wing Indian association that sought to foment revolution against the British Raj, (the rule by the British Crown in the Indian subcontinent), by gathering together worker and peasant youths. This social work was deemed “covert Naxalite activity” which was cause for more charges. Arun works to protect rights of minorities and is critical of the Indian Prime Minister, [[Narendra Modi]]. Arun stated in a 2015 interview that there has been in increase in attacks on Christians and Muslims since Modi came to power. He believes the government is responsible for anti-minority propaganda and stirring feelings of hate towards minorities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Arrests ==

=== 2007 arrest and imprisonment ===
Ferreira was arrested under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]], and imprisoned in 2007. He spent four years and eight months in [[Nagpur]] jail as a political under trial. He was kept in [[solitary confinement]]. During this time, he took up cartooning again. All of his charges were dropped in September 2011 only for him to be arrested again in 2012. He was released on 4 January 2012 with the dropping of all his charges. His lawyer at the time was [[Surendra Gadling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/naxalite-arun-ferreira-spends-time-with-family/story-IRKdOyexTsMjcLfPEk26jK.html|title=‘Naxalite’ Arun Ferreira spends time with family|date=2012-01-06|work=hindustantimes.com|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his release, he published a book on his experiences in prison, titled Colours of the Cage. In his book, he detailed his own experiences of torture and solitude, the life of prisoners, and the policies that govern them. In his memoir, he recounted many instances of the harsh nature of the Nagpur jail and the harsh questioning tactics used by the police. While Ferreira was being questioned, not only was he interrogated by the local Nagpur police, he was questions by officers from the Anti-Naxal cell he was placed in along with the Anti-Terrorism Squad, the Intelligence Bureau and even the Special Intelligence Bureau of Andhra Pradesh. He was interrogated for ten days. After all preliminary interrogation techniques failed, he was transported to a Hospital where the government authorized sodium pentothal to be used for Ferreira’s narco-analysis where he was questioned while under the influence of the drug. This ensured that the forensic scientists and psychologists could get true answers about Ferreira’s background as an activist. While in jail, the Nagpur Police continued to carry out searches in Ferreira’s residence and spread the news that he was a high-ranking leader of the banned Communist Party of India and he was responsible for spreading violence around the country. Ferreira denies any news about spreading violence and harming citizens. On 29 January 2014, he was [[acquitted]] of all charges .{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== 2018 arrest ===
In August 2018, Ferreira was again arrested for connections to organizing “Elgaar Parishad”, an event that marks the 200th year of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. The Battle of Bhima Koregaon &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thequint.com/explainers/what-was-bhima-koregaon-battle-explainer&lt;/ref&gt; is controversial in India with right-wing groups claiming that it was a battle between British and Indian rulers and left-wing groups maintaining that the battle was a victory against caste-based oppression. The event was violent and allegedly, the police had uncovered a letter that included plans to assassinate the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/who-are-gautam-navlakha-varavara-rao-arun-ferreira-vernon-gonsalves-sudha-bharadwaj-5-activists-arrested-for-maoist-links/1296070/&lt;/ref&gt; 
Currently, Ferreira is under house arrest with policeman posted in his complex after the Supreme Court intervened in the arrest. His arrest was part of a multi-city operation by the Pune Police, in which they also arrested [[Sudha Bharadwaj]], [[Varavara Rao]], Vernon Gonsalves and [[Gautam Navlakha]], and raided the residences of [[Anand Teltumbde]], Stan Swamy and [[K. Satyanarayana (academic)|K. Satyanarayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/latest/892159/police-raids-reported-on-homes-of-human-rights-activists-in-mumbai-ranchi-and-hyderabad|title=Delhi, Mumbai, Faridabad, Hyderabad, Ranchi, Goa: Pune police raids, arrests human rights activists|last=Staff|first=Scroll|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Beneficial use'''" is a legal term describing a person's right to enjoy the benefits of specific [[property]], especially a view or access to light, air, or water, even though title to that property is held by another person.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This may also be termed "beneficial enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare this with a "beneficial interest", where a [[beneficiary]] has an interest in a thing ("[[Res (disambiguation)|res]]"), such as a [[Trust law|trust]] or [[Estate (law)|estate]], but does not own the underlying property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Also, compare this to [[beneficial owner]] where specific property rights ("use and title") in equity belong to a person even though legal title of the property belongs to another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Butterfield v. Forrester''''', 11 East. 60, 103 Eng. Rep. 926 (K.B. 1809), was an [[Law of England|English]] [[legal case|case]] before the [[King's Bench]] that was the first appearance of [[contributory negligence]] as a [[common law]] [[defense (legal)|defence]] against [[negligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Forrester (D) placed a pole against the road next to his house in the course of making repairs to the house. Butterfield (P) was riding at a high speed at approximately 8 pm at twilight and did not see the pole. He struck the pole and suffered personal injuries when he fell off his horse. 
A witness testified that visibility was 100 yards away at the time of the accident and Butterfield might have seen and avoided the pole had he not been riding at such a high speed. There was no evidence that Butterfield had been intoxicated at the time of the accident.
At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if an individual riding with reasonable care could have avoided the pole, and if the jury found that Butterfield had not used reasonable care, the verdict should be in Forrester's favour. The jury returned a verdict for Forrester and Butterfield appealed.

==Decision==
The court determined that the plaintiff had failed to use common and ordinary caution, and he was therefore barred from recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
Under United States [[tax]] laws and [[accounting]] rules,  '''cost segregation''' is the process of identifying personal property assets that are grouped with real property assets, and separating out personal assets for tax reporting purposes.  According to the American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals, a cost segregation is "the process of identifying property components that are considered "personal property" or "land improvements" under the federal tax code."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascsp.org American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cost segregation study''' identifies and reclassifies personal property assets to shorten the [[depreciation]] time for taxation purposes, which reduces current income tax obligations. Personal property assets include a building’s non-structural elements, exterior land improvements and indirect construction costs.The primary goal of a cost segregation study is to identify all construction-related costs that can be depreciated over a shorter tax life (typically 5, 7 and 15 years) than the building (39 years for non-residential real property).Personal property assets found in a cost segregation study generally include items that are affixed to the building but do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of the building.

Land Improvements generally include items located outside a building that are affixed to the land and do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of a building. Reducing tax lives results in accelerated depreciation deductions, a reduced tax liability,and increased cash flow.

A Cost Segregation study allows a taxpayer who owns real estate to reclassify certain assets as Section 1245 property with shorter useful lives for depreciation purposes, rather than the useful life for Section 1250 property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/the-cost-segregation-section-1031-exchange-combination-is-even-more-important-under-tax-reform?feed=00000158-20c2-d6a2-adfb-70eb85460000|title=The cost seg/1031 exchange combo is even more important under tax reform|work=Accounting Today|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Property asset classification ==
Analysis of capital expenditures is used to determine appropriate asset classifications. Cost segregation identifies building costs that would typically be depreciated over a 27.5 or 39-year period and reclassifies them to permit a shorter, accelerated method of depreciation for certain building costs. Costs for non-structural elements, such as wall covering, carpet, [[accent lighting]], portions of the electrical system, and exterior site improvements such as sidewalks and landscaping, can often be depreciated over five, seven or 15 years, rather than over 27.5 or 39 years.

== Eligibility ==
Real property eligible for cost segregation includes buildings that have been purchased, constructed, expanded or remodeled since 1987. A formal engineering based study is typically cost-effective for buildings purchased or remodeled at a cost greater than $750,000.   A cost segregation study is most efficient for new buildings recently constructed, but it can also uncover retroactive tax deductions for older buildings which can generate significant short benefits due to "catch-up" depreciation.

== Cost segregation study process ==
"A cost-segregation specialist can perform a nonintrusive yet detailed engineering study of a building's walls, flooring, and ceilings; and its plumbing, electrical, lighting,
telecommunications, heating and cooling systems" (Money Doesn't Grow on Trees, But It Could be Hidden in the Walls By William J. Barnes, CPA). 

Usually, a construction engineer will analyze architectural drawings, mechanical and electrical plans, and other blueprints to segregate the structural and general building electrical and mechanical components from those linked to personal property.  The study also allocates “soft costs,” such as architect and engineering fees, to all components of the building.

"In general, a study by a construction engineer is more reliable than one conducted by someone with no engineering or construction background. However, the possession of specific construction knowledge is not the only criterion. Experience in cost estimating and allocation, as well as knowledge of the applicable law, are other important criteria.  A quality study identifies the preparer and always references his/her credentials, experience and expertise in the cost segregation area" (www.irs.gov - Cost Segregation Audit Technique Guide - Chapter 4 - Principal Elements of a Quality Cost Segregation Study and Report).

== Tax benefits of cost segregation ==
In addition to providing lower taxes, cost segregation can benefit businesses in a number of ways:
# Maximizing tax savings by adjusting the timing of deductions. When an asset’s life is shortened, depreciation expense is accelerated and tax payments are decreased during the early stages of a property’s life.  This, in turn, releases cash for investment opportunities or current operating needs.
# Creating an audit trail. Improper documentation of cost and asset classifications can lead to an unfavorable audit adjustment. A properly documented cost segregation helps resolve IRS inquiries at the earliest stages.
# Playing Catch-Up: Retroactivity. Since 1996, taxpayers can capture immediate retroactive savings on property added since 1987.  Previous rules, which provided a four-year catch-up period for retroactive savings, have been amended to allow taxpayers to take the entire amount of the adjustment in the year the cost segregation is completed.  This opportunity to recapture unrecognized depreciation in one year presents an opportunity to perform retroactive cost segregation analyses on older properties to increase cash flow in the current year.
# Additional tax benefits. Cost segregation can also reveal opportunities to reduce real estate tax liabilities and identify certain sales and use tax savings opportunities.

== Downsides to Cost Segregation Studies ==
Downsides to cost segregation studies include cost, the triggering of depreciation recapture and understatement penalties for taxpayers that use cost segregation too aggressively.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy"&gt;http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2004/Aug/CostSegregationApplied.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">The '''Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China''' (CPL) is a procedural statute in China intended to ensure the correct implementation of the [[Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China|Criminal Law]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinalawtranslate.com/criminal-procedure-law/?lang=en|title=China Law Translate {{!}} Criminal Procedure Law (2012)|last=Translate|first=China Law|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPL defines how trials are to be conducted, what rights suspects of crimes have to defend themselves, the role and scope of the activities of defense lawyers, and the entire process of the administration of justice through the courts in China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

China's CPL has been criticized as offering inadequate protections for those suspects of crimes by Chinese police. Lawyers have called for the CPL to be amended to demand that criminal defense lawyers be present during interrogations by police, as well as video and audio recordings being made mandatory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cecc.gov/publications/commission-analysis/detention-torture-of-anhui-teens-reflect-continuing-criminal|title=Detention, Torture of Anhui Teens Reflect Continuing Criminal Procedure Violations {{!}} Congressional-Executive Commission on China|website=www.cecc.gov|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these measures would prevent the torture and other abuse in custody widely employed to gain confessions.

The CPL is also often not enforced, and ignoring it rarely results in penalties administered by the procuratorate or other supervisory organs. There are multiple documented cases of the procuratorate and public security bureau ignoring the CPL and instead taking direction from the political-legal committees at various levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Deliberative process privilege''' is the [[common-law]] principle that the internal processes of the executive branch of a government are immune from normal disclosure or discovery in civil litigations, [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests, etc.

The theory behind the protection is that by guaranteeing confidentiality, the government will receive better or more candid advice, recommendations and opinions, resulting in better decisions for society as a whole.  The deliberative process privilege is often in [[dynamic tension]] with the principle of maximal transparency in government.

In the context of the U.S. presidential offices and their workproducts, this principle is often referred to as [[executive privilege]], or as a type of executive privilege that is distinct from "presidential communications privilege".

{{Eurocodes}}
The '''eurocodes''' are the ten European standards (EN; harmonised technical rules) specifying how [[Structural engineering|structural design]] should be conducted within the [[European Union]] (EU). These were developed by the [[European Committee for Standardization|European Committee for Standardisation]] upon the request of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="EN1990"&gt;EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the eurocodes is to provide:&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;
* a means to prove compliance with the requirements for mechanical strength and stability and safety in case of fire established by European Union law.&lt;ref name="89-106-EEC"&gt;European Council Directive 89/106/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;
* a basis for construction and engineering contract specifications.
* a framework for creating harmonized technical specifications for building products ([[CE mark]]).

By March 2010 the Eurocodes are mandatory for the specification of European public works and are intended to become the de facto standard for the private sector.  The Eurocodes therefore replace the existing national [[building code]]s  published by national standard bodies (e.g. [[BS 5950]]), although many countries had a period of co-existence. Additionally, each country is expected to issue a National Annex to the Eurocodes which will need referencing for a particular country (e.g. The UK National Annex). At present take up of Eurocodes is slow on private sector projects and existing national codes are still widely used by engineers.

==History==
In 1975, the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Community]] (presently the European Commission), decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was to eliminate technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonised technical
rules for the design of construction works which, in a first would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a steering committee with representatives of the member states, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s.

In 1989, the Commission and the member states of the EU and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) decided, on the basis of an agreement between the Commission and to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) through a series of mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products - CPD and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 921S0lEEC and 89/440lEEC on public works and services and equiva1ent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market).

Each of the codes (except EN 1990) is divided into a number of Parts covering specific aspects of the subject. In total there are 58 EN Eurocode parts distributed in the ten Eurocodes (EN 1990 – 1999).

All of the EN Eurocodes relating to materials have a Part 1-1 which covers the design of buildings and other civil engineering structures and a Part 1-2 for fire design. The codes for concrete, steel, composite steel and concrete, and timber structures and earthquake resistance have a Part 2 covering design of bridges. These Parts 2 should be used in combination with the appropriate general Parts (Parts 1).

{{Politics sidebar|Organs}}
The '''executive''' is the organ exercising [[authority]] in and holding [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for the governance of a [[State (polity)|state]]. The executive executes and enforces [[law]].

In [[political system]]s based on the principle of [[separation of powers]], [[authority]] is distributed among several branches (executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Judiciary|judicial]])—an attempt to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of people. In such a system, the executive does not pass laws (the role of the legislature) or interpret them (the role of the judiciary). Instead, the executive enforces the law as written by the legislature and interpreted by the judiciary. The executive can be the source of certain types of law, such as a [[decree]] or [[executive order]].  Executive bureaucracies are commonly the source of [[regulation]]s.

In the [[Westminster system|Westminster political system]], the principle of separation of powers is not as entrenched. Members of the executive, called [[Minister (government)|ministers]], are also members of the legislature, and hence play an important part in both the writing and enforcing of law.

In this context, the executive consists of a leader(s) of an office or multiple offices.  Specifically, the top leadership roles of the executive branch may include:

*[[head of state]] – often the [[supreme leader]], the [[president]] or [[monarch]], the chief public representative and living symbol of national unity. 
**[[head of government]] – often the ''[[de facto]]'' leader, [[prime minister]], overseeing the administration of all affairs of state.
***[[defence minister]] – overseeing the [[armed forces]], determining military policy and managing external safety.
***[[interior minister]] – overseeing the [[police forces]], enforcing the law and managing internal safety. 
***[[foreign minister]] – overseeing the [[diplomatic service]], determining [[foreign policy]] and managing [[foreign relations]].
***[[finance minister]] – overseeing the treasury, determining [[fiscal policy]] and managing [[national budget]].
***[[justice minister]] – overseeing criminal prosecutions, corrections, enforcement of court orders.
 
In a [[presidential system]], the leader of the executive is both the ''head of state and head of government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Executive Branch|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/executive-branch|website=The White House|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[parliamentary system]], a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[minister (government)|minister]] [[vote of no confidence|responsible to the]] [[legislature]] is the head of government, while the head of state is usually a largely ceremonial monarch or president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Branch of Government in Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/compendium/web-content/c_d_executivebranchgovernmentcanada-e.htm|website=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11995">The '''Faeq al-Mir arrest controversy''' refers to the arrest, imprisonment, and calls for release of Faeq al-Mir, leader of the Syrian [[Syrian Democratic People's Party|People’s Democratic Party]], after he telephoned [[Elias Atallah]], a Lebanese politician critical of Syrian policies there. In the call, taped by Syrian Intelligence forces, al-Mir gave condolences to Atallah regarding the assassination of [[Pierre Amine Gemayel|Pierre Gemayel]], Lebanon's Minister of Industry. Al-Mir was detained by Syrian security forces at his home in [[Latakia]] on December 13, 2006, and charged in March 2007 with "undertaking acts that weaken national sentiment during times of conflict" and "communicating with a foreign country to incite it to initiate aggression against Syria or to provide it with the means to do so." On December 31, 2007, Damascus's First Criminal Court ruled him guilty of "circulating false or exaggerated news which would weaken the morale of the nation" and sentenced him to three years in prison, though the duration was immediately reduced to 18 months. Human rights groups, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], criticized the arrest and demanded al-Mir's unconditional release.

== Background ==
Having worked together for communist organizations in the mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship at the time of the arrest.&lt;ref name=Now&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=19063|title=Life in prison for a phone call?|last=Long|first=Taylor|date=2007-11-09|work=[[NOW Lebanon]]|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing [[Syrian Democratic People's Party|People’s Democratic Party]], an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/001/2008/en/|title=Syria: Amnesty International calls for release of political activist|date=2008-01-03|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the [[Democratic Left Movement (Lebanon)|Democratic Left Movement]], a leftist Lebanese party.&lt;ref name=Now/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty" /&gt; He was also a senior figure in the [[March 14 Alliance]], a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/11/06/syria-leftist-leader-faces-life-prison-phone-call|title=Syria: Leftist Leader Faces Life in Prison for Phone Call|date=2007-11-06|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like [[Samir Kassir]].&lt;ref name=Now/&gt; Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999,&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of [[George Hawi]], a former leader of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]]. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

While the Syrian constitution liberally grants free speech, a state of emergency in effect since the [[Baath Party]] seized power suspends this freedom.&lt;ref name=Now/&gt; Syria has stringently approached dissidents who question its policies in neighboring Lebanon;&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ya&gt;{{cite news |url=http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/11/syrian_dissiden.php |title=Syrian dissident jailed for mourning assassinated Lebanese |date=2007-11-08 |work=Ya Libnan |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109213905/http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/11/syrian_dissiden.php |archivedate=2008-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian authorities detained and imprisoned ten activists who signed the [[Beirut-Damascus Declaration]] petition in May 2006.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; The petition, of which al-Mir was a signatory, advocated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the normalization of relations between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Now/&gt;

===The call ===
In a December 2006 phone call, al-Mir bestowed his condolences to Atallah regarding the November 21 assassination of [[Pierre Amine Gemayel|Pierre Gemayel]], Lebanon's Minister of Industry&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; and an anti-Syrian politician.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ixxZqO4b9kU4TFqQyL-GwWX51oVg|title=Syria dissident trial verdict postponed|date=2007-11-08|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call was taped by Syrian intelligence forces, known as the [[Mukhabarat (disambiguation)#Syria|Mukhabarat]].&lt;ref name=Now/&gt;&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

== Arrest and Trial ==
On December 13, 2006, Syrian security forces arrested al-Mir at his home in [[Latakia]] on Syria's western coast, and he has remained in detention since.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

In March 2007, Syrian authorities charged al-Mir with "undertaking acts that weaken national sentiment" during times of conflict and "communicating with a foreign country to incite it to initiate aggression against Syria or to provide it with the means to do so."&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carnegie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&amp;article=20707 |title=Opposition Leader Faces Life in Prison; Activist Arrested |date=November 2007|publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806211908/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&amp;article=20707 |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second charge bears a life sentence&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; and could entail the death penalty if the foreign nation initiates aggression against Syria.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Al-Mir's trial began before the Damascus First Criminal Court on August 29, 2007.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; His indictment stated he "contacted enemies of the state in Lebanon including members of the [[March 14 Alliance|March 14 group]], and he knows that the ideas and direction of this group are in accordance with the American and [[Zionism|Zionist]] direction which are against the national approach of the Syrian government." It accused al-Mir of conveying "support for the approach and direction of March 14" during the phone call.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Al-Mir denied this, stating that he called Atallah only as head of the [[Democratic Left Movement (Lebanon)|Democratic Left Movement]].&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; On November 8, the court adjourned his trial, postponing the verdict until November 28&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; as a result of the defense filing a petition to dismiss the judge in session.&lt;ref name=Now/&gt;

On December 31, 2007, the Damascus First Criminal Court ruled al-Mir guilty of "circulating false or exaggerated news which would weaken the morale of the nation".&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; In accordance with an amnesty provision, the court dropped the charge of “circulating knowingly false or exaggerated news abroad, which would harm the State or its financial standing".&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; He was sentenced to three years in prison, though the duration was immediately commuted to one and a half years.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/cchrp/events/2009/month01/Ziadeh_Jan30_HR_in_%20Arab_Region.pdf|title=Human Rights in the Arab Region: Annual Report 2008|last=Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies|year=2008|work=Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|pages=135|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court elected to consider al-Mir's detention before the trial as part of his prison term.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Rquote|right|Syria’s arrest and prosecution of Faeq al-Mir reveals the government’s intolerance for even the slightest hint of opposition. Al-Mir face[d] the possibility of life in prison or even execution for phoning a Lebanese opponent of Syria’s policies there.|Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;}}

Deeming the charges against him "politically motivated", [[Human Rights Watch]] called for al-Mir's immediate release.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; The organization included his arrest in the Syrian section of its 2008 World Report, a human rights assessment.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/englishwr2k8/docs/2008/01/31/syria17619.htm|title=Syria: Events of 2007|date=2008-01-30|work=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] judged al-Mir a "prisoner of conscience" and called for "his immediate and unconditional release."&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; Atallah — speaking to [[NOW Lebanon]], a Lebanese newspaper — praised al-Mir's human-rights activism and commented "arresting someone for a phone call is unheard of... every free and democratic Lebanese citizen is in solidarity with [Mir] and his comrades, and they demand that he is set free along with all the political prisoners in Syria.”&lt;ref name=Now/&gt;

According to NOW Lebanon, al-Mir's indictment implied that "any support for March 14 – the ruling parliamentary majority in Lebanon – is tantamount to treason," a precedent that was "portentous for the future of Lebanese-Syrian relations or for the revitalization of democracy inside of Syria."&lt;ref name=Now/&gt; In a letter smuggled out of [[Adra Prison]] and published by a Lebanese newspaper, al-Mir and five other imprisoned activists denounced the "repressive climate" in their country and wrote "Our situation as prisoners of conscience is part ... of the crisis of public freedoms and human rights in Syria, which started with the [[state of emergency]] [[Syria#Emergency Law|imposed 44 years ago]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/getstory?openform&amp;1FB4B3DCC1C3A991C225738C006D9259|title=Watchdog Pleads for Syrian Jailed for Phoning Lebanese Politician|date=07-11-07|work=(AFP-Naharnet)|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mir was released from prison on July 13, 2008 after spending a year and a half in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menassat.com/?q=ar/alerts/3947-|title=Syria opposition member Faik al-Mir is released from Prison |date=2008-06-16|work=Menassat|accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Syrian Uprising==
Faeq al-Mir became actively involved in the [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)]] right from the beginning. As a result, he went into hiding in [[Ghouta]] near Damascus to avoid arrest by the security agencies of the Syrian government. However, on Monday October 7, 2013, he was arrested during a visit to the city of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freesyriantranslators.net/2013/12/14/faiek-almeer%E2%80%8E/|title=Faiek Almeer|date=2013-12-14|work=Free Syrian Translators|accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faeq al-Mir is known among supporters of the Syrian opposition with the title "al-e'mem" ([[Levantine Arabic]]: العميم, meaning "the uncle") in recognition for his lifelong political activism against the dictatorship of [[Al-Assad family]] in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annahar.com/article/73781-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A/|title=Faeq al-Mir in the Prisons of the Syrian Regime|date=2013-10-08|work=[[An-Nahar]]|accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9901">'''Free warren'''&amp;mdash;often simply ''warren''&amp;mdash;refers to a type of [[Exclusive right|franchise]] or [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] conveyed by a [[sovereign]] in [[medieval]] [[England]] to an English subject, promising to hold them harmless for killing [[game (hunting)|game]] of certain species within a stipulated area, usually a [[Woodland|wood]] or small [[forest]].  The sovereign involved might be either the [[monarch]] or a [[Marcher Lords|marcher lord]].

==Law==
The grant of free warren could be as a gift, or in exchange for consideration, and might be later alienated by the grantee.  The stipulated area might be coextensive with the [[frank-tenement]] of the grantee, or it might be discontinuous or even at a considerable remove from the grantee's holdings.  The right of free warren did not extend automatically to the [[Fee simple|freeholder]] of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |ref=harv|last=Craies
|first=William Feilden |year=1911a |wstitle=Game Laws |volume=11 |pages=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rights of free warren are usually discussed in the context of [[Royal forest#Forest law|forest law]], the only law which applied within the warren was [[common law]].  Thus, even though the warrant ultimately derived from the sovereign, the only statutes applied to [[poaching|poachers]] in a warren were the common-law crimes of [[theft]] and [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/McKechnie0323/HTMLs/0032_Pt02_Text.html Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with and Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege of free warren was a [[Mutual assent|reciprocal]] relationship.  The grantee of the warren was granted an exemption from the law (under which all game in the realm was property of the sovereign), but the grantee owed the sovereign the stewardship and protection of the game from all others who might wish to hunt it.

==Etymology==
Modern [[English language|English]] ''warren'' ← [[Middle English|ME]] ''warrene'', ''warreine'' ← [[Old Norman|ONF]]  ''warrenne'' ← [[Germanic language|Germanic]] present participle of *''warian''  "to take care; to cause to care (for)" ← causative of *''waran'' "to care" ← ''*war'' "care".  Doublet of ''[[guarantor]]''.  Related to [[Old High German|OHG]] ''werien'' (i.e. ''*wärian'') "to defend, protect", and also to English "a-ware, wary".
&lt;ref&gt;A [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] etymology for ''warren'' has been proposed, based on the notion of "post → enclosure"; but this ignores the documented evolution of the term from the [[Germanic language|Germanic]], as well as being semantically inappropriate for an unenclosed [[woodland]].[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=warren&amp;searchmode=none]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free warren and domestic warren==
The original use of ''free warren'' was as a legal term.  However, as the franchise defined both a set of species and a geographic extent, the natural semantic extensions arose, namely for the individual animals as a group, or for the land they inhabited.  As it became pragmatically necessary for [[Fee simple|freeholders]] not holding a free warren to enclose their breeding establishments, these "closed warrens" or '''[[Warren (domestic)|domestic warren]]s''' began also to be designated simply as "warrens" (use recorded in 1378; [[OED]]). In 1649 the metaphoric use as "cluster of densely populated living spaces" is recorded.

==Warren and warden==
The [[Mediaeval Latin]] form of the word ''warenna'' was used in legal documents such as [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Library/magnacharta.htm Magna Charta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the office of warden is used for the overseer of a warren:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(5) But the warden, as long as he hath the custody of the lands, shall keep up and maintain the houses, parks, warrens, ponds, mills, and other things belonging to them, our of their issues;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The warden of a [[Royal forest]] was often the [[castellan]] or [[constable]] of the nearest royal castle; over time the less exalted title of ''warrener'' evolved for the custodian of the lowest of the hunting franchises, the warren.

==Warren and warrant==
The adjective ''free'' in ''free warren'' does not refer to the lack of enclosure surrounding the precincts of the warren, but rather to the fact the "liberty" of hunting derives from a [[warrant (law)|warrant of the sovereign]]. That is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Craies |first=William Feilden |year=1911b |wstitle=Warrant |volume=28 |pages=327–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "warrant" occurs very early in constitutional documents: it is found in the Assize of Clarendon and the Assize of the Forest, both in the reign of Henry II., but in neither case in its modern meaning. The original meaning seems to have been more akin to guarantee (q.v.), warranty or security; and to some extent the term implies something in the nature of a guarantee or representation by the person issuing the warrant that the person who acts on it can do so without incurring any legal penalty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All of the terms ''warrant'', ''warrantor'', and ''warranty'' are used in [[Henry II of England]]'s [[Assize of the Forest]] (a.k.a. [[Assize of Woodstock]]) in 1184:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uFA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 ''The Assize of the Forest (Woodstock) 1184 Henry II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:Article 2. Item, he has commanded that no one shall have bows, arrows, dogs, or hounds in his forests, unless [such person] has the '''warrant''' of the king or of some other man who can [lawfully] be his '''warrantor'''.

:Article 9. Item, the king forbids all clergymen to commit any offences touching his venison or his forests. He strictly orders his foresters that, if they find such men committing offences, they shall not hesitate to lay hands on those men in order to hold them and put them under attachment; he himself will give full '''warranty'''.

==Beasts of warren==
The permission to take game was limited to certain types of animals.  Generally, the killing of [[vermin]] (defined as [[predator]]s and other beasts not fit for the table) was not regulated.  This definition was flexible, however, depending on whether the animal was thought to provide good sport, as wolves, foxes, badgers, or bears.  In practice, vermin could only be killed on the [[commons]] or waste, since none but the grantee was permitted to have instruments of the hunt within the warren.

===Manwood===
The most cited authority on [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]], [[John Manwood]], cites these beasts of warren:&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/calhounabode/josh/TheText.htm Treatise, I:3]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The beasts and fouls of Warren are these, The Hare, the Cony, the Pheasant, and the Partridge, and none other are accompted beasts or fouls of Warren."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Manwood is mistaken in his assignments, since the [[roe deer]] was transferred to "beast of warren" from "beast of the forest" in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The roe ceased to be a beast of forest in the fourteenth century owing to a decision in the Court of King's Bench, 13 Edw. III, which decided that it was a beast of warren on the ground that it drove away the other deer (Turner, Select Pleas of the Forest (Selden Soc.),  xxi). [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22180. 'Sport, ancient and modern: Introduction', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford,  East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 253-58, Note 20.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roe deer are still found within woodlands named "Warren" in contemporary England.  The [[1911 Encyclopedia]] adds roe, woodcock, quail, and rail to Manwood's list.&lt;ref&gt;"Beasts of (free) warren are roe, hare, rabbit, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, quail, rail and heron" {{harv|Craies|1911a|p=441}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[grouse]] are not birds of warren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/historical/articles/arukbacongame1856.htm] Matthew Bacon’s ''[[Bacon's Abridgement|A New Abridgment of the Law]]'', (1778): Devonshire v. Lodge, 7 Barn. &amp; C. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox, wolf, cat, badger, and squirrel are sometimes also added.&lt;ref&gt;//www.hants.org.uk/newforest/history/history1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes domestic swine are mistakenly thought to be beasts of warren, due the right of [[pannage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household//chapter17.html The Book of Household Management, by Isabella Beeton (chapter17)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{fact|date=August 2015}}
Example 1:
* A owns a business, as does B.
* A wishes to make a merger with B.
* B agrees to the business merger by handshake deal.
* Six months later, A wishes to begin the merger, but B declines.
:* B does not have to accept because the deal was not binding.

Example 2:
* A owns a business, as does B.
* A wishes to make merger with B.
* B agrees to the business merger by handshake deal.
:* At the time C sees the Deal occur.
* Six months later, A wishes to begin the merger, but B declines
:* Since C saw the handshake deal occur, it was binding and B must perform the merger.

Example 3:
* While in a bar together, A and B want to begin a business.
* On a napkin, they agree to share profits, 50/50.
* Some time later, A and B make a very successful business.
* A finds out that he was receiving 40% of profits while B was receiving 60% of profits.
:* Since the deal was also written on a napkin, it became binding.
:* In court, it was decided that A must be reimbursed by B for the total money A has been cheated out of.

'''Hexamolybdenum''', is a [[molybdenum]] dominant [[alloy]] discovered during a nanomineralogy investigation of the [[Allende meteorite]].&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Hexamolybdenum was discovered in a small ultra[[refractory]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] within the [[Allende meteorite]].&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; This inclusion has been named ACM-1.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Hexamolybdenum is [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]], with a calculated [[density]] of 11.90&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; The new mineral was found along with [[allendeite]].&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; These minerals, are believed to demonstrate conditions during the early stages of the [[Solar System]], as is the case with many CV3 [[carbonaceous chondrites]] such as the Allende meteorite.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Hexamolybdenum lies on a continuum of high-temperature alloys that are found in meteorites and allows a link between [[osmium]], [[ruthenium]], and [[iron]] rich meteoritic alloys.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;  The name hexamolybdenum refers to the [[crystal symmetry]] (primitive hexagonal) and the molybdenum rich composition.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; The [[Allende meteorite]] fell in 1969 near [[Pueblito de Allende]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Hexamolybdenum was found as nano-crystals in an ultrarefractory inclusion in the Allende meteorite.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; The Allende meteorite has shown to be full of new minerals, after nearly forty years it has produced one in ten of the now known minerals in meteorites.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; This CV3 [[carbonaceous chondrite]] was the largest ever recovered on earth and is referred to as the best-studied meteorite in history.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;
The inclusion has only been viewed via [[electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; The hexamolybdenum specimen was lost during an attempted ion probe analysis of a bordering grain.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Other specimens can be found, however, in the [[Smithsonian]] Institution's National Museum of Natural History Allende section USNM 3509HC12 and in section USNM 7590 of NWA 1934, another VC3 chondrite.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

It has also been reported from the NWA 1934 CV3 carbonaceous chondrite meteorite from the [[Erfoud]] region of [[Morocco]] and in the Danubian placer of [[Straubing]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

==Chemical composition==
Hexamolybdenum is an (molybdenum, [[ruthenium]], [[iron]], [[iridium]], [[osmium]]) alloy.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|Daughter of [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]
{{Western dress codes}}
'''Informal wear''', also called '''business/corporate/office wear''', '''tenue de ville''' and (colloquially) '''dress clothes''', is a [[Western dress codes|Western dress code]] for [[clothing]] typified by a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] with [[necktie]] for men, and [[cocktail dress]] or [[pant suit]] for women. On the scale of formality, it is considered less formal than [[semi-formal]] but more formal than [[casual wear]], yet retaining availability for more personal expression than [[semi-formal]] dress.

Thus, informal should not be confused with [[casual wear]] such as [[business casual]] or [[smart casual]] despite that in loose common usage, some people may refer to informal dress as "formal" in contrast with merely casual. The technical, traditional definition of ''informal'' is used in this article.

The informal attire is most commonly used for [[business]] events and meetings, job interviews, or in professions like [[law]] and [[finance]]. It is a traditional dress code that aims to indicate respect to the situation and not draw attention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://successattire.com/business-professional-attire/|title=Business Professional Attire for Men: The Complete Guide|last=|first=|date=Sep 10, 2016|website=Success Attire|publisher=Success Attire|access-date=Sep 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923195336/http://successattire.com/business-professional-attire/|archive-date=2016-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[suit (clothing)|suit]] originated in the 19th-century as a leisurewear. Seeking a casual alternative to the long, heavy [[frock coat]]s then considered appropriate business dress, men began to wear lighter coats cut just below the waist when not engaged in business.

Standard suit-making fabric is fine combed wool, with the inclusion of cashmere in more expensive fabrics. Middle-price suits are often made of wool-polyester blends, whilst the cheapest are made entirely of polyester fabric.

This business suit (also known as the "sack suit" in [[North America]], commonly by [[Brooks Brothers]]) became the standard business daywear for all men who were not engaged in physical labor. The waistcoat (British) or [[vest]] (American) was worn regularly with the suit up to [[World War II]], but is rarely seen today, due to central heating in offices and the expense of construction. Until at least the early 1960s it was common to wear a hat.

In general, business suits are characterized by three styles and a fourth fusion style. English suits are noted for having a "touch fit" to the wearer's body shape and carefully made padded shoulders. Italian suits are often slimmer, with higher armholes and highly shaped to complement a slim physique. Traditional American suits have lightly padded shoulders and loose natural fit with minimal shaping. Since the 1960s, designer brands (especially Polo Ralph Lauren) have created fusion style that brings a more shaped European look to the natural American cut.

Suits in Britain were often made in [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], often with three pieces, and were worn outside the [[City of London]].  Tweed is made from uncombed wool, and, like all fabrics from the time, was thick and durable (18oz. was considered medium-weight in the Edwardian era).  A full tweed suit is less common today, with just tweed [[sports jacket]]s more often worn, but is still used generally as everyday wear by some, and for outdoor sports such as shooting and angling.  It is worn with appropriate accompanying clothes, much as any other suit; brown full brogues and wool ties are common items not worn with other types of suit.

==Definition==
Informal attire for men consists of a [[suit (clothes)|lounge suit]], made up of a [[jacket]] with matching [[trousers]]. The suit is typically dark-coloured (without a pattern or with a subtle one): gray, dark blue, brown, or black. The suit is worn with a long-sleeved [[dress shirt|shirt]], usually in white or light blue color, leather [[dress shoes]] in black or brown color and a conservative [[necktie]].&lt;ref name=VaTech-interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Informal attire is today considered a form of dress customarily appropriate for all formal settings, which do not explicitly require [[white tie]] or [[black tie]]. For instance, it is commonly worn to religious services and funerals, in government offices and schools. Some professions, like law or finance, may require it. At present, informal attire is the typical dress at daytime weddings in the [[United States]], serving as a replacement for the increasingly rare [[morning dress]].

As "dress clothes", the term is considered a [[secular]] version of "Sunday clothes" or "church clothes", which signifies clothes worn by some [[Christian]]s to [[church service]]s.

Because of its strong association with the business world, informal attire is also known as ''international standard business dress, business professional'' or ''business formal''.

[[File:People with suits 1.jpg|thumb|Man and woman in common business attire]]

In the United States, wearing a suit to work daily is often an indication of managerial or professional status. However, when on a [[job interview]] or attending business [[meeting]]s, many men who do not otherwise wear suits will dutifully wear them as a mark of respect and formality. Many how-to books for men recommend wearing a conservatively styled suit to an employment interview even when the man does not expect to ever wear a suit on the job.&lt;ref name=VaTech-interview&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.career.vt.edu/Interviewing/InterviewAppearance.html | title = Interview appearance and attire | work = Career services | publisher = Virginia Tech, Division of Student Affairs | date = 10 July 2013 | accessdate = 25 September 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929034740/http://www.career.vt.edu/Interviewing/InterviewAppearance.html | archive-date = 2013-09-29 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Internet businesses flourished and so did the relaxed dress standards enjoyed by unconventional [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] businesspeople. A new form of attire had arisen, [[business casual]], which consists of nice [[trousers]], often [[chinos]] or [[khakis]], and a [[polo shirt]] or short-sleeved shirt. Today this is acceptable and common attire at technically oriented business meetings and in semiprofessional settings, and is continuing to gain ground over traditional business attire.

The standard for women is also in flux. In the 1970s, women aspiring to managerial or professional status were advised to "dress for success" by wearing clothing that imitated the male business suit: jacket and matching [[skirt]], worn with a plain blouse and discreet accessories. The plain blouse is designated as a long sleeve button down shirt tucked properly into the skirt at the waist. Some women wore [[pantsuit]]s, substituting pants for the skirt, but in doing so, they risked the displeasure of many who felt that women should not wear pants.

Now even conservative [[Western world|Western]] workplaces are more accepting of pants on female employees.  However, they may still expect female employees to exhibit the formality of men's suits. Women in "creative" professions, such as advertising, web design, or fashion, can usually dress with more color and flair.

Male business attire is also nuanced. Choice of clothing and accessories proclaims social and financial status. An inexpensive [[ready-to-wear]] suit will lack the cachet of a [[bespoke]] suit fashioned by a famous [[tailor]]. Custom shirts, hand-made leather shoes, fine [[cuff link]]s and expensive [[watch]]es may indicate wealth, and in certain professions may effectively amount to a "dress code" (e.g., in [[investment bank]]ing).

Western business wear is standard in many workplaces around the globe, even in countries where the usual daily wear may be a distinctive national clothing.

Some non-Western business-people will wear national clothing nonetheless. A [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[sheikh]] may wear the traditional robes and headdress to an international conference; [[United Arab Emirates]] diplomats in particular are noted for attending conventions of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in full [[keffiyeh]] and [[thawb]]. Diplomats of the [[People's Republic of China]] are similarly noted for wearing the [[Mao suit]] to international events; [[India]]n leaders often wear [[Nehru jacket]]s, with [[Manmohan Singh]] wearing a suit-like combination including such a jacket with his [[Sikhism|Sikh]] [[turban]]. Wearing national clothing in such contexts can proclaim national pride, or just extremely high status which allows the wearer to defy convention. Sometimes an element of the national attire such as a [[hat]] is combined with a Western business suit; for instance, [[Yasser Arafat]] was noted for wearing the aforementioned kaffiyeh with a Western-style [[military uniform]], a derivative of the suit.

The [[aloha shirt]], while considered casual attire in the mainland United States, is considered acceptable business wear in [[Hawaii]], where it is well-suited to that state's warm and humid climate. Similarly, ''Kariyushi style'' attire is encouraged in Japan, especially southern locales of Japan, to allow more comfort in the workplace, and to encourage dress that conforms with [[Cool Biz campaign|Cool Biz]] guidelines. Akihiko Higa, a researcher of Kaiho Soken who has worked on a Kariyushi style project for an Okinawan clothing manufacturer, said, “It (the [[Kariyushi shirt]]) is easy-to-wear and highly functional for wearing either in an office situation or in a resort."

==Governance==
The Members of the Panel are representative of bodies professionally involved in the securities markets and in the field of takeovers: the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies|Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies – Ireland]], the [[Law Society of Ireland]], the Irish Association of Investment Managers, Irish Clearing House Limited (nominated by the [[Irish Banking Federation]] and the [[Irish Stock Exchange|Irish Stock Exchange plc]]. Each of these bodies appoints a Director to the Board of the Panel, and may also appoint alternate Directors. The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland appoints the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson to the Board, currently Denis McDonald [[Senior Counsel|S.C.]] (Chairperson) and Ann Fitzgerald (Deputy Chairperson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://irishtakeoverpanel.ie/about/the-panel/| work=Irish Takeover Panel| title=The Panel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No lay members are appointed, or representatives of consumer or other groups.

A '''joint venture''' ('''JV''') is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by [[shared ownership]], shared returns and [[economic risk|risks]], and shared governance. Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly  [[emerging market]]s; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roos|first1=Alexander|last2=Khanna|first2=Dinesh|last3=Verma|first3=Sharad|last4=Lang|first4=Nikolaus|last5=Dolya|first5=Alex|last6=Nath|first6=Gaurav|last7=Hammoud|first7=Tawfik|title=Getting More Value from Joint Ventures |publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/getting-more-value-joint-ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gerard Baynham of Water Street Partners, there has been a lot of negative press about joint ventures, but objective data indicate that they may actually outperform wholly owned and controlled affiliates. He writes, "A different narrative emerged from our recent analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) data, collected from more than 20,000 entities. According to the DOC data, foreign joint ventures of U.S. companies realized a 5.5 percent average return on assets (ROA), while those companies’ wholly owned and controlled affiliates (the vast majority of which are wholly owned) realized a slightly lower 5.2 percent ROA. The same story holds true for investments by foreign companies in the U.S., but the difference is more pronounced. U.S.-based joint ventures realized a 2.2 percent average ROA, while wholly owned and controlled affiliates in the U.S. only realized a 0.7 percent ROA."

Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the [[oil and gas industry]], are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a '''temporary partnership''' for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "'''''co-venturers'''''".

The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.

Some major joint ventures include [[MillerCoors]], [[Sony Ericsson]], [[Vevo]], [[Hulu]], [[Penske Truck Leasing]], and [[Owens-Corning]] - and in the past, [[Dow Corning]].

== Legal definition ==
In [[European law]], the term "joint venture" (or '''joint undertaking''') is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of [[company law]]. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated '' "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" ''or'' "entreprise commune".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/joint_ventures.htm |title=Joint ventures in Lebanese and European law |publisher=Mallat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126172750/http://mallat.com/articles/joint_ventures.htm |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company incorporation==
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

* Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
* Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
* Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
* Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the [[Memorandum of Association]]. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/meta/5/5f/Wikimedia_UK_-_Memorandum_of_Association.pdf|format=PDF|title=Memorandum of Association of Wiki Educational Resources Limited|website=Upload.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Articles of Association]], it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.

The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+
pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of [[ordinary resolution]]s, [[special resolution]]s and the holding of [[Extraordinary General Meeting]]s to bring the directors' decision to bear.

A [[Certificate of Incorporation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/articles-of-incorporation/ |title=Articles of Incorporation Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Articles of Incorporation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://managementhelp.org/legal/articles.htm |title=Legal Information for U.S. Organizations (Businesses and Nonprofits) |publisher=Managementhelp.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208155223/http://managementhelp.org/legal/articles.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.

By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

* that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
* the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
* it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
* it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.

==Shareholders' agreement==
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a [[Memorandum of Understanding]]. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a [[shareholders' agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportsindia.org.in/righttoinformation/SHA_DIAL.pdf |title=Shareholders Agreement|website=Airportsindia.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows.  There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.

Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

* Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the [[Intellectual Property Rights|IPR]] of one partner and, say, the real estate of the other
* the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
* The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
* management decisions - whether the board manages or a ''founder''
* transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
* [[dividend policy]] - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
* winding up - the conditions, notice to members
* confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
* [[first right of refusal]] - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.

The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the [[board of directors]]; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/[[proxy voting|proxy]]); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.

Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place [[proxy vote]] of the Founder at board meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf |title=Ukpga_20060046_en|website=Opsi.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.

== Dissolution ==
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

* Aims of original venture met
* Aims of original venture not met
* Either or both parties develop new goals
* Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
* Time agreed for joint venture has expired
* Legal or financial issues
* Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
* One party acquires the other

=== China ===

According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com/data/data.htm |title=China statistics, China data, China facts and figures |publisher=Chinatoday.com |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/investment/36752.htm |title=Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures |publisher=China.org.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus of the law has improved since then.

Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.

Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment.
Those five categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.

==== Equity joint ventures ====

The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability.  Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.

The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence. These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report.

*  between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
*  between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
*  more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.

The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.

==== Cooperative joint ventures ==== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[CJV]] and [[CJVs]] link here. Maybe others. --&gt;

Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs){{citation needed|date=November 2017}} are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures.  Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.

The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.

The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.

Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

*A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
*The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, ''not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution''. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
*It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
*A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.&lt;ref name="chinabusinessreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabusinessreview.com/cooperative-joint-ventures/ |title=Cooperative Joint Ventures - CBR Jan-Feb 2005 |publisher=Chinabusinessreview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
*Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.

With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start.  A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.

There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.

The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a [[feasibility study]] outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} (submissions by the Chinese partner).

==== Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs) ====

{{Main article|Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise}}

There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.

To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.

The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.

WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.

WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Flora|title=WFOE Guide|url=http://shanghai-attorney.com/index.php?page=11|work=shanghai-attorney.com|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.

An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its [[know-how]] but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

==== Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)====

These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the number of shares purchased by each partner.

The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.  Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B"  shares.

Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.

"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.

==== Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) ====

Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.

The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV

=== India ===
JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

* The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
* Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
*  Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit)  are allowed&lt;ref name="xebecindia.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xebecindia.in/business/incBusiness.html |title=Business in India |publisher=Xebecindia.in |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.

Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.

The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&amp;A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&amp;As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.&lt;ref name="ifri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifri.org |title=Home-Page - Institut français des relations internationales |publisher=IFRI |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.

It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts.  Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majmudarindia.com/pdf/Joint%20ventures%20in%20India.pdf|format=PDF|title=JOINT VENTURES IN INDIA|website=Majmudarindia.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
In [[Ukraine]] most of joint ventures are operated in the form of [[Limited liability company law|Limited liability company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/registration-of-a-limited-liability-company-llc/|title=LLC legislation in Ukraine.|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=En.clc.co.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign [[investor]]s is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/cooperation-agreement-joint-venture-in-ukraine/|title=Formation of Joint venture in Ukraine|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=En.clc.co.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of [[oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] production.

'''Lord Edward FitzGerald''' (15 October 1763 – 4 June 1798) was an Irish aristocrat and [[revolutionary]] who died of wounds received while [[resisting arrest]] on a charge of treason.

==Early years==
FitzGerald, the fifth son of the [[James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster|1st Duke of Leinster]] and the [[Lady Emily Lennox]] the daughter of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]], was born at [[Carton House]], near [[Dublin]]. In 1773 his father died and his mother soon afterwards married [[William Ogilvie (Ardglass)|William Ogilvie]], who superintended FitzGerald's education.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=443}} He spent most of his childhood in [[Frescati House]] at [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]] in Dublin where he was tutored by Ogilvie in a manner chiefly directed to the acquisition of knowledge that would fit him for a military career.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/LordEdwardFitzGerald.php Webb, Alfred. "Lord Edward Fitzgerald", ''A  Compendium of Irish Biography'', M.H. Gill &amp; Son, Dublin, 1878]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American War of Independence==
FitzGerald joined the [[British Army]] in 1779 and he was Aide-de-camp on the staff of [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Rawdon]] in the [[southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern theatre of the American Revolutionary War]]. He was seriously wounded at the [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]] on 8 September 1781, his life being saved by an escaped slave named Tony Small (nicknamed "Faithful Tony", see [[Black Loyalist]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=443}}  FitzGerald commissioned a portrait of Tony Small by John Roberts in 1786. Lord Edward freed Small and employed him to the end of his life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=443}}{{sfn|Tillyard|1998|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}}}}&lt;ref&gt;portrait "[http://www.jimandellen.org/ellen/TonySmallJohnRoberts.jpg Tony Small]" (1786) by John Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGerald was evacuated from [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] in 1782 when the British forces abandoned the city.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Webb surmises that the success of the American colonists in fighting against regular troops, led him in later years to the conviction that his countrymen in Ireland could cope with them with a similar result.&lt;ref name=Webb/&gt;

==Post-war military career==
In 1783 FitzGerald visited the West Indies before returning to Ireland, where his brother, the [[William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster|2nd Duke of Leinster]], had procured Edward's election to the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] as a Member for [[Athy (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Athy]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=443}} a seat he held until 1790.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In Parliament he acted with the small Opposition [[Irish Patriot Party]] group led by [[Henry Grattan]], but took no prominent part in debate. In the spring of 1786 he took the then unusual step for a young nobleman of entering the Military College, Woolwich, after which he made a tour through Spain in 1787. Dejected by unrequited love for his cousin Georgina Lennox (who later married the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|3rd Earl Bathurst]]), he sailed for [[New Brunswick]] to join the 54th Regiment with the rank of Major.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=443–444}}

==Explorer in the New World==
In April 1789, guided by compass, he traversed the country with a brother officer, from [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]] to [[Quebec]], falling in with Indians by the way, with whom he fraternized. He accomplished the journey of 175 miles in twenty-six days, and established a shorter practicable route than that hitherto followed.&lt;ref name=Webb/&gt;

In a subsequent expedition he was formally adopted at [[Detroit]] by the Bear clan of the [[Mohawk people|Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk)]] with the name "Eghnidal" by [[Colonel Guy Johnson and Karonghyontye (Captain David Hill)|Karonghyontye (Captain David Hill)]], and made his way down the [[Mississippi]] to [[New Orleans]], whence he returned to England.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lifedeathoflorde01mooriala/lifedeathoflorde01mooriala_djvu.txt Moore, Thomas. "Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald: In Two Volumes", Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, &amp; Green, London, 1831]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

==Enters politics==
Finding that his brother had procured his election for the County of [[Kildare County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kildare]] (a seat he held  from 1790 to 1798{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}), and desiring to maintain political independence, Lord Edward refused the command of an expedition against [[Cadiz]] offered him by [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]], and devoted himself for the next few years to the pleasures of society and to his parliamentary duties. He was on terms of intimacy with his first cousin [[Charles James Fox|Charles Fox]], with [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] and other leading [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]. According to [[Thomas Moore]], Lord Edward FitzGerald was the only one of the numerous suitors of Sheridan's first wife, [[Elizabeth Ann Linley|Elizabeth]] whose attentions were received with favour; and it is certain that, whatever may have been its limits, a warm mutual affection subsisted between the two.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}} She conceived a child by him, a baby girl who was born on 30 March 1792.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{citation |first=Suzanne |last=Aspden |title=Linley [Sheridan], Elizabeth Ann (1754–1792) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online, May 2009 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25364 |accessdate=6 August 2017 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marries on the Continent==
His Whig connections, together with his transatlantic experiences, predisposed Fitzgerald to sympathize with the doctrines of the [[French Revolution]], which he embraced enthusiastically when he visited Paris in October 1792. He lodged with [[Thomas Paine]] and listened to the debates in the Convention. At a convivial gathering on the 18 November, he supported a toast to "the speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}} and gave proof of his zeal by expressly repudiating his own title, a performance for which he was dismissed from the army.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

While in Paris, FitzGerald became enamoured of a young girl whom he chanced to see at the theatre, and who is said to have had a striking likeness to Elizabeth Sheridan. Procuring an introduction he discovered her to be a protégée of [[Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis]] (Madame de Sillery), [[Governess to the Children of France]]. The parentage of the girl, whose name was [[Lady Edward FitzGerald|Pamela]] (1773–1831), is uncertain; but although there is some evidence to support the story of Madame de Genlis that Pamela was born in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] of parents called Sims, the common belief that she was the daughter of Madame de Genlis herself by [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (to whose children she was then acting as governess), was probably well founded. On 27 December 1792, FitzGerald and Pamela were married at [[Tournai]], one of the witnesses being [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], afterwards King of the French;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Perilous Crown: France Between Revolutions, 1814-1848 |last=Price |first=Munro |coauthors= |year=2008 |isbn=0330426389 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1793 the couple reached Dublin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

==Return to Ireland==
[[File:Lord Edward Fitzgerald by Hugh Douglas Hamilton.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Edward FitzGerald by [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]], 1796. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]

Ireland was by then seething with dissent which was finding a focus in the increasingly popular and revolutionary [[Society of the United Irishmen]], which had been forced underground by the outbreak of war between France and Britain in 1793. Lord Edward FitzGerald, fresh from the gallery of the Convention in [[Paris]], returned to his seat in the Irish Parliament and immediately sprang to their defence. Within a week of his return he was ordered into custody and required to apologise at the bar of the House of Commons for violently denouncing in the House a Government proclamation which [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]] had approved. However, it was not until 1796 that he joined the [[United Irishmen]], who by now had given up as hopeless the path of constitutional reform and whose aim, after the recall of [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam|Lord FitzWilliam]] in 1795, was nothing less than the establishment of an independent Irish republic.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

==Revolutionary activities==
In May 1796 [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] was in [[Paris]] endeavouring to obtain French assistance for an insurrection in Ireland. In the same month, FitzGerald and his friend [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]] proceeded to Hamburg, where they opened negotiations with the Directory through Reinhard, French minister to the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]], meeting Pamela at Devonshire House on her way through London with her husband, had told her that "all was known" about his plans, and advised her to persuade him not to go abroad.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}} Also, in Hamburg Lord Edward met with [[Johan Anders Jägerhorn]] (or baron de Spurila, as he called himself), a Finnish Swede who had advocated Finnish autonomy and now acted as an intermediary between Lord Edward and the French.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;!--the previous citation was wrong there is no mention of this sentence in EB1911 vol. 10 p. 444--&gt;

The proceedings of the conspirators at [[Hamburg]] were made known to the government in [[London]] by an informer, [[Samuel Turner (informer)|Samuel Turner]]. Pamela was entrusted with all her husband's secrets and took an active part in furthering his designs. She appears to have fully deserved the confidence placed in her, though there is reason to suppose that at times she counselled prudence. The result of the [[Hamburg]] negotiations was [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]]'s abortive expedition to [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

In September 1797 the Government learnt from the informer [[Leonard McNally]] that Lord Edward was among those directing the conspiracy of the [[United Irishmen]], which was now quickly maturing. He was specially concerned with the military organisation, in which he held the post of colonel of the [[Kildare]] regiment and head of the military committee. He had papers showing that men were ready to rise. They possessed some arms, but the supply was insufficient, and the leaders were hoping for a French invasion to make good the deficiency and to give support to a popular uprising. But French help proving dilatory and uncertain, the rebel leaders in Ireland were divided in opinion as to the expediency of taking the field without waiting for foreign aid. Lord Edward was among the advocates of the bolder course and there is some evidence that he favoured a project for the massacre of the Irish peers while in procession to the House of Lords for the trial of Lord Kingston in May 1798.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

==Net tightens==
It was probably abhorrence of such measures that converted Thomas Reynolds from a conspirator to an informer; at all events, by him and several others the authorities were kept posted in what was going on, though lack of evidence produced in court delayed the arrest of the ringleaders. But on the 12 March 1798 Reynolds' information led to the seizure of a number of conspirators at the house of [[Oliver Bond]]. Lord Edward FitzGerald, warned by Reynolds, was not among them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

As a fellow member of the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class, the Government were anxious to make an exception for FitzGerald, avoiding the embarrassing and dangerous consequences of his subversive activities. They communicated their willingness to spare him from the normal fate meted out to traitors. The Lord Chancellor, [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Lord Clare]], said to a member of his family, "For God's sake get this young man out of the country; the ports shall be thrown open, and no hindrance whatever offered".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

FitzGerald however refused to desert others who could not escape, and whom he had himself led into danger. On 30 March the government proclamation of [[martial law]] authorising the military to act as they saw fit to crush the [[United Irishmen]] led to a campaign of vicious brutality in several parts of the country. This forced the United Irish executive to bring forward plans for the rising, with or without French aid.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

==Arrest and death==
[[File:The Arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald by George Cruikshank.jpg|thumbnail|400px|right|''Arrest of Lord Edward FitzGerald'' ([[George Cruikshank]])]]
Lord Edward FitzGerald's social position made him the most important United Irish leader still at liberty. On 9 May a reward of £1,000 was offered by [[Dublin Castle]] for his apprehension. Since the arrests at Bond's, FitzGerald had been in hiding, but had twice visited his [[Lady Pamela FitzGerald|wife]] in disguise and was himself visited by his stepfather Ogilvie and his friend [[William Lawless]]; he generally observed less caution than his situation required. Meanwhile, the date for the rising was finally fixed for 23 May and FitzGerald awaited the day hiding in a house in Thomas Street, Dublin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}}

FitzGerald's hiding place was disclosed by a Catholic barrister and [[informant|informer]] named [[Francis Magan]] and on 18 May &lt;!--Major Swan and a Mr. Ryan proceeded to Murphy's house with Major Sirr--&gt; Major [[Henry Charles Sirr (soldier)|Henry Sirr]] led a military party to the house where Lord Edward was in bed suffering from a fever. Alerted by the commotion, he jumped out of bed and, ignoring the pleas of the arresting officers Captain William Bellingham Swan (later assistant town Major of Dublin) and Captain Daniel Frederick Ryan to surrender peacefully, FitzGerald stabbed Swan and mortally wounded Ryan with a dagger in a desperate attempt to escape.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}} The weapon used by Lord Edward to defend himself was later stolen from Major Swan's house by Emma Lucretia Dobbin the daughter of Rev. William Dobbin and Catherine Coote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]]|volume=41 |year=1911 |pages=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was only secured after Major Sirr shot him in the shoulder.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=444}} The scabbard reputedly used by Lord Edward Fitzgerald at his arrest in 1798 is held at [[Limerick Museum]]. 
 
He was conveyed to [[Newgate Prison, Dublin|New Prison, Dublin]] where he was denied proper medical treatment. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} After a brief detention in [[Dublin Castle]], he was taken to Newgate. Inflammation set into his wound. His wife, whom the government probably had enough evidence to convict of treason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeill|first1=Ronald John|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1911|page=445|edition=1911|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Fitzgerald,_Lord_Edward|accessdate=3 March 2018|chapter=Fitzgerald, Lord Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; fled the country before he died without seeing him again, but his brother Henry and his aunt [[Lady Louisa Conolly]] were allowed to see him in his last moments. At the age of 34 he died as the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] raged outside on 4 June 1798. He was buried the next day in the cemetery of [[St Werburgh's Church, Dublin]]. An [[Bill of attainder|Act of Attainder]] confiscating his property was passed as 38 Geo. 3 c. 77, but was eventually repealed in 1819.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=444–445}}{{sfn|Alger|1889|p=111}}

==Character assessment==
Shortly after his death, Fitzgerald's sister, Lady Lucy FitzGerald, authored the following statement regarding her brother's fidelity to Ireland:
{{quote|Irishmen, Countrymen, it is Edward FitzGerald's sister who addresses you: it is a woman but that woman is his sister: she would therefore die for you as he did. I don't mean to remind you of what he did for you. 'Twas no more than his duty. Without ambition he resigned every blessing this world could afford to be of use to you, to his Countrymen whom he loved better than himself, but in this he did no more than his duty; he was a [[List of ethnic slurs#P|Paddy]] and no more; he desired no other title than this.{{sfn|Bourke|2002|p=59}}}}

Fitzgerald was of small stature and handsome features. In the opinion of the anonymous writer of his biography in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica eleventh edition]] (1911) Fitzgerald's character and career have been made the subject of eulogies much beyond their merits.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}}

The same writer claims:

{{quote|He had, indeed, a winning personality, and a warm, affectionate and generous nature, which made him greatly beloved by his family and friends; he was humorous, light-hearted, sympathetic, adventurous. But he was entirely without the weightier qualities requisite for such a part as he undertook to play in public affairs. Hotheaded and impulsive, he lacked judgement. He was as conspicuously deficient in the statesmanship as he was in the oratorical genius of such men as Flood, Plunket or Grattan. One of his associates in conspiracy described him as 'weak and not fit to command a sergeant's guard, but very zealous'.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}} Reinhard, who considered Arthur O'Connor 'a far abler man', accurately read the character of Fitzgerald as that of a young man "incapable of falsehood or perfidy, frank, energetic, and likely to be a useful and devoted instrument; but with no experience or extraordinary talent, and entirely unfit to be chief of a great party or leader in a difficult enterprise.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}}}}

This opinion is not that held in Ireland, where Fitzgerald is remembered as brave and sweet-natured, a clever planner, and a tragic loss. His funeral is described:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/new-light-on-lord-edward-fitzgerald/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Keen to avoid any display of the enormous popular feeling towards Lord Edward, Castlereagh ensured that the funeral took place in secret at 2am and that the body was not allowed to return to Kildare. On its way to St Werburgh’s in the shadow of the Castle, the funeral was frequently stopped and searched by parties of soldiers. Even after the lead coffin was laid in the vault at dead of night, the mourners were obliged to stay in the church until passes could be procured}}

==Family==
FitzGerald and Pamela  had a son, Edward Fox FitzGerald (10 October 1794 - 25 January 1863), who married on 6 November 1827 to Jane Paul (died 2 November 1891), and two daughters, Pamela FitzGerald (1795/1796 - 25 November 1869), married on 21 November 1820 [[Sir Guy Campbell, 1st Baronet]] (died 26 January 1849), and Lucy Louisa FitzGerald (1798 - September 1826), married on 5 September 1825 [[Captain (naval)|Capt.]] [[George Francis Lyon]] (died 8 October 1832).{{sfn|Copland-Griffiths|1908|p=264}}

==Sporting Associations==
The County Roscommon GAA club Tulsk Lord Edward's is named after Fitzgerald. The Geraldines P. Moran GAA club in Cabinteely in Dublin is also named after him.

'''mTropolis''' (pronounced "metropolis") was an [[open-architecture]] multimedia programming application aimed at enabling rapid development of [[multimedia]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823023742/http://www.cbd-hq.com/articles/2000/000501gh_mtropolis.asp mTropolis, the Greatest CBD Tool that Never Was] by Glen Hunter, Mojo Productions Inc. (2000, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by mFactory (pronounced "em-factory") and introduced in 1995. It introduced [[object-oriented]] concepts such as reusable objects, modifiers and behaviors into the multimedia authoring space dominated by [[Macromedia]]'s Director software. mTropolis was bought in 1997 by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]], which moved development from [[Burlingame, California]] to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and then [[End-of-life (product)|cancelled the product]] one year later. Despite efforts by its fervent users to attempt to save their investment and beloved tool, negotiations and even a possible purchase offer never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsay |first=Greg |title=The software that refused to die |url=http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |accessdate=2016-06-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000503164742/http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |archivedate=May 3, 2000|publisher=[[salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

mTropolis (pronounced "metropolis") competed in the [[Interactive media|interactive]] multimedia product space dominated in the 1990s by [[Adobe Director|Macromedia Director]]. The software's maker, mFactory (pronounced "em-factory"), founded in 1992, variously positioned mTropolis as an alternative and as an adjunct to Director.

mTropolis was bought by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] in 1997. The use of behaviors in mTropolis spurred [[Macromedia]] on to introduce behaviors in Director 6.0.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was there when Seery, Shepherd, meself and probably Greggy went over to the Mtrop user meetings.  We straight out stole [behaviors] from  
them.

- ''Alex Zavatone (ex Macromedia) on the Direct-L Mailing List, Tue, 9 Sep 2008''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While multimedia CD-ROM authoring has largely been rendered irrelevant by online content distribution, mTropolis remains an interesting study in application design, and held a loyal following for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Paradigm==

The development environment was very different from the other tools around at the time - [[Apple Computer]]'s [[HyperCard]] and others had a card based metaphor, and [[Macromedia Director]] had a film metaphor (the content area is called The Stage, the time line The Score, an assets library named The Cast, etc.). In mTropolis there were sections, subsections, and scenes. Assets would be placed onto the scene, and then combinations of behaviors and modifiers would be dragged onto the assets.

Powerful interaction and animation could be created by making different modifiers send messages to each other, allowing a user to create something impressive fairly quickly, without any typing. There was a simple programming language, accessed via a Miniscript modifier, but most of the programming was achieved by attaching standard behaviors and modifiers, and making selections within the modifier pop-up menus.

==Technical Issues==

According to [[Starship Titanic]] author [[Douglas Adams]], his team had originally selected mTropolis 1.0 for its development platform but it had to be abandoned for unspecified technical insufficiencies in favor of an in-house tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Douglas | title = Why isn't Starship Titanic on the Macintosh? | url=http://www.starshiptitanic.com/game/mac.html | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miniscript Limitations===

One criticism of the tool was that the integrated programming language, Miniscript, was lacking key features necessary for common tasks. Because mTropolis was conceived around a [[visual programming language|visual programming]] metaphor, mFactory engineers intentionally omitted [[control flow|control constructs]] such as [[conditional loop]]s. To remedy such limitations, the third-party developer AX Logic produced the commercially-available Alien Studio modifier as a drop-in replacement for Miniscript.

===File Format===

The advent in version 1.1 of the mTropolis browser plug-in for [[Netscape Navigator]], dubbed ''mPire,'' exposed a core architectural shortcoming. The binary file format was not cross-platform; in order to make a mTropolis element available for embedding on a web page, the author was required to save a Macintosh version and a separate Windows version. Hence the web server had to store redundant copies of the same content, consuming disk space and necessitating the use of loader pages to serve the file appropriate for the end user's operating system.

===Macintosh-Only Authoring===

While playback engines existed for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, the mTropolis authoring system itself only ran on the Mac.

==Release history==
===mTropolis 1.0===

January 1995: Released at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld San Francisco]]. Retail price $4,495.

===mTropolis 1.1===

May 1996: Added support for [[QuickTime VR]] 1.0. Retail price $1,195.

October 1996: mFactory releases beta 1 of the mPire browser plug-in.

===mTropolis 2.0===

March 1997: mFactory announces pre-order sales availability for version 2.0, due to ship in "the second half of May." Retail price $995.

May 1997: Quark, Inc. purchases mFactory.

March 1998: Quark announces that v2.0 would be furnished free-of-charge to registered mTropolis v1 customers, but that the product will not be made available for general purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Landwehr | first = Rebecca | title = mFactory shut down by Quark | url=http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/1998/03/30/story5.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | date=1998-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles Created with mTropolis==

Due to the way the mTropolis Player was separate from developer content, by viewing the files, it is easy to tell if a title was developed with mTropolis. A few [[CD-ROM]]s were created using mTropolis, including the [[BAFTA]] award winning [[MindGym]], [[Scott Kim]]'s [[Obsidian (1997 video game)|Obsidian]], A Sharp's [[King of Dragon Pass]], the [[Muppets]] Treasure Island, Voyager's Fun With Architecture and The Magic World of [[Beatrix Potter]].

'''''{{lang|la|Magna Carta Libertatum}}''''' ([[Medieval Latin]] for "the Great Charter of the Liberties"), commonly called '''{{lang|la|Magna Carta}}''' (also ''Magna Charta''; "Great Charter"),{{Efn|The document's Latin name is spelled either ''Magna Carta'' or ''Magna Charta'', (the pronunciation is the same) and, in English, with or without the definite article "the".  Latin does not have a definite article equivalent to "the". The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recommends usage without the definite article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/112237?redirectedFrom=Magna+Carta|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spelling ''Charta'' originates in the 18th century, as a restoration of [[classical Latin]] ''[[:wikt:charta|charta]]'' for the [[Medieval Latin]] spelling ''carta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis|Du Cange]] s.v. [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/charta#CHARTA1 1 carta]&lt;/ref&gt; While "Charta" remains an acceptable variant spelling it never became prevalent in English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195142365|page=541|url=https://books.google.com/?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA541#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} "The usual—and the better—form is ''Magna Carta''. [...] ''Magna Carta'' does not take a definite article".
''Magna Charta'' is the recommended spelling in German-language literature. ([http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Magna_Charta Duden online])&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[charter]] of [[rights]] agreed to by [[John, King of England|King John of England]] at [[Runnymede]], near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], on 15 June 1215.{{Efn|Within this article, dates before 14 September 1752 are in the Julian calendar. Later dates are in the Gregorian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, however, the date would have been 22 June 1215.}} First drafted by the [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop of Canterbury]] to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel [[baron]]s, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on [[Feudalism|feudal]] payments to [[the Crown]], to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by [[Pope Innocent III]], leading to the [[First Barons' War]]. After John's death, the regency government of his young son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause.  At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace [[Treaty of Lambeth|treaty agreed at Lambeth]], where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller [[Charter of the Forest]] which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's [[Statutory law|statute law]].

The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the [[Anglo-Saxons]], that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]] had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as ''[[habeas corpus]]''. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir [[Edward Coke]] used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the [[divine right of kings]] propounded by the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchs. Both [[James VI and I|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the [[English Civil War]] of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.

The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and the formation of the [[United States Constitution|American Constitution]] in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.{{Efn|The United States (US) Constitution was written in 1787, went into effect in 1788, after ratification by nine of the 13 states, and the US Federal government started operation in 1789.}} Research by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. Magna Carta still forms an important symbol of liberty today, often cited by politicians and campaigners, and is held in great respect by the British and American legal communities, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] describing it as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; should be "of all time", of course, but this is the quotation in the book --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=268}}

In the 21st century, four [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the original 1215 charter remain in existence, two at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. There are also a handful of the subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The original charters were written on [[parchment]] sheets using [[quill]] pens, in [[Scribal abbreviation|heavily abbreviated]] [[medieval Latin]], which was the convention for legal documents at that time. Each was sealed with the royal [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] (made of [[beeswax]] and [[resin]] [[sealing wax]]): very few of the seals have survived. Although scholars refer to the 63 numbered "clauses" of Magna Carta, this is a modern system of numbering, introduced by Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759; the original charter formed a single, long unbroken text. The four original 1215 charters were displayed together at the British Library for one day, 3 February 2015, to mark the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.

====Background====
{{Main article|John, King of England}}
[[File:King John from De Rege Johanne.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An illuminated picture of King John riding a white horse and accompanied by four hounds. The King is chasing a stag, and several rabbits can be seen at the bottom of the picture.|King [[John, King of England|John]] on a [[Deer hunting|stag hunt]]]]
Magna Carta originated as an unsuccessful attempt to achieve peace between royalist and rebel factions in 1215, as part of the events leading to the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War]]. England was ruled by King [[John, King of England|John]], the third of the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin kings]]. Although the kingdom had a robust administrative system, the nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=8}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} John and his predecessors had ruled using the principle of ''vis et voluntas'', or "force and will", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} Many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, with the counsel of the leading members of the realm, but there was no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}}

John had lost most of his ancestral lands in France to King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] in 1204 and had struggled to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to fight a war which ended in expensive failure in 1214.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=7}} Following the defeat of his allies at the [[Battle of Bouvines]], John had to sue for peace and pay compensation.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=168}} John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=139}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=181}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=6–7}} A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}

The rebels took an oath that they would "stand fast for the liberty of the church and the realm", and demanded that the King confirm the [[Charter of Liberties]] that had been declared by King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in the previous century, and which was perceived by the barons to protect their rights.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=256–58}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|pp=131–32}} The rebel leadership was unimpressive by the standards of the time, even disreputable, but were united by their hatred of John;{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=130}} [[Robert FitzWalter]], later elected leader of the rebel barons, claimed publicly that John had attempted to rape his daughter,{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=104}} and was implicated in a plot to assassinate John in 1212.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=165}}

[[File:Innozenz3.jpg|thumb|A contemporaneous mural of [[Pope Innocent III]]]]
{{anchor|Unknown Charter of Liberties}}&lt;!--[[Unknown Charter of Liberties]] redirects here--&gt;John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms, and sponsored discussions in [[Oxford]] between his agents and the rebels during the spring.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} Both sides appealed to [[Pope Innocent III]] for assistance in the dispute.{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} During the negotiations, the rebellious barons produced an initial document, which historians have termed "the Unknown Charter of Liberties", which drew on Henry I's Charter of Liberties for much of its language; seven articles from that document later appeared in the "Articles of the Barons" and the subsequent charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=115}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=471–72}}{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=59–60}}

It was John's hope that the Pope would give him valuable legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared himself to be a papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=179}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a [[crusades|crusader]], a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=233}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=258–59}}

Letters backing John arrived from the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had organised into a military faction. They congregated at [[Northampton]] in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on [[London]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], and [[Exeter]].{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=174, 179–80}} John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}} The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, but this was not attractive to the rebels.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=112}} [[Stephen Langton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

====Great Charter of 1215====
[[File:Article-barons-add-ms-4838.jpg|thumb|upright|The Articles of the Barons, 1215, held by the [[British Library]]]]
John met the rebel leaders at [[Runnymede]], a [[water-meadow]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], on 10 June 1215. Runnymede was a traditional place for assemblies, but it was also located on neutral ground between the royal fortress of [[Windsor Castle]] and the rebel base at [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]], and offered both sides the security of a rendezvous where they were unlikely to find themselves at a military disadvantage.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}{{sfn|Holt|2015|p=219}} Here the rebels presented John with their draft demands for reform, the 'Articles of the Barons'.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} Stephen Langton's pragmatic efforts at mediation over the next ten days turned these incomplete demands into a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; a few years later, this agreement was renamed Magna Carta, meaning "Great Charter".{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=180, 182}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} By 15 June, general agreement had been made on a text, and on 19 June, the rebels renewed their oaths of loyalty to John and copies of the charter were formally issued.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

Although, as the historian [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] has noted, the charter "wasted no time on political theory", it went beyond simply addressing individual baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and, most importantly, limitations on taxation and other feudal payments to the Crown, with certain forms of feudal taxation requiring baronial consent.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=184–85}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}} It focused on the rights of free men—in particular the barons{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} - however, the rights of serfs were included in articles 16, 20, and 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-english-translation
|title=Magna Carta|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Runnymede Charter of Liberties did not apply to [[Chester]], which at the time was a [[Earl of Chester|separate feudal domain]]. [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Earl Ranulf]] granted his own [[Magna Carta of Chester]].{{sfn|Hewit|1929|p=9}} Some of its articles were similar to the Runnymede Charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=379–80}}}} Its style and content reflected Henry I's Charter of Liberties, as well as a wider body of legal traditions, including the royal charters issued to towns, the operations of the Church and baronial courts and European charters such as the Statute of Pamiers.{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=293–94}}

Under what historians later labelled "clause 61", or the "security clause", a council of 25 barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}} If John did not conform to the charter within 40 days of being notified of a transgression by the council, the 25 barons were empowered by clause 61 to seize John's castles and lands until, in their judgement, amends had been made.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}} Men were to be compelled to swear an oath to assist the council in controlling the King, but once redress had been made for any breaches, the King would continue to rule as before. In one sense this was not unprecedented; other kings had previously conceded the right of individual resistance to their subjects if the King did not uphold his obligations. Magna Carta was however novel in that it set up a formally recognised means of collectively coercing the King.{{sfn|Goodman|1995|pp=260–61}} The historian [[W. L. Warren|Wilfred Warren]] argues that it was almost inevitable that the clause would result in civil war, as it "was crude in its methods and disturbing in its implications".{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239–40}} The barons were trying to force John to keep to the charter, but clause 61 was so heavily weighted against the King that this version of the charter could not survive.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}}

John and the rebel barons did not trust each other, and neither side seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=479}} The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=189–91}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=262}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239, 242}} Disputes began to emerge between the royalist faction and those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated .{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}

Clause 61 of Magna Carta contained a commitment from John that he would "seek to obtain nothing from anyone, in our own person or through someone else, whereby any of these grants or liberties may be revoked or diminished".{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=13}}&lt;ref name="All clauses"/&gt; Despite this, the King appealed to Pope Innocent for help in July, arguing that the charter compromised the Pope's rights as John's feudal lord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190–91}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} As part of the June peace deal, the barons were supposed to surrender London by 15 August, but this they refused to do.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}} Meanwhile, instructions from the Pope arrived in August, written before the peace accord, with the result that papal commissioners excommunicated the rebel barons and suspended Langton from office in early September.{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=244–45}} Once aware of the charter, the Pope responded in detail: in a letter dated 24 August and arriving in late September, he declared the charter to be "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust" since John had been "forced to accept" it, and accordingly the charter was "null, and void of all validity for ever"; under threat of excommunication, the King was not to observe the charter, nor the barons try to enforce it.{{sfn|Rothwell|1975|pp=324–26}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=245–46}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}}

By then, violence had broken out between the two sides; less than three months after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=1}}{{sfn|Crouch|1996|p=114}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], for help, offering him the English throne.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=264–67}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{efn|Louis' claim to the English throne, described as "debatable" by the historian David Carpenter, derived from his wife, [[Blanche of Castile]], who was the granddaughter of King [[Henry II of England]]. Louis argued that since John had been legitimately deposed, the barons could then legally appoint him king over the claims of John's son Henry.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}}} The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October 1216, leaving the nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|1990|pp=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Charter of 1216====
Although the Charter of 1215 was a failure as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new government of the young Henry III as a way of drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], one of the most famous knights in England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=14–15}} William knighted the boy, and Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri]], the [[papal legate]] to England, then oversaw his coronation at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 28 October.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=189}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

The young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels.{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=1}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=1}} He had substantial support though from Guala, who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=259–60}} Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, during which Henry gave [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=260}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} [[Pope Honorius III]] declared that Henry was the Pope's [[vassal]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]], and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and thereby entitled to special protection from Rome.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}

The war was not going well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=301}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country.{{sfn|Aurell|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=21–22, 24–25}}{{sfn|Powicke|1963|p=5}} The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=25}}

====Great Charter of 1217====
{{see also|First Barons' War|Charter of the Forest|English land law}}
[[File:Forest-charter-1225-C13550-78.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of the Forest, 1217, held by the British Library]]
In February 1217, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=27}} In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was the equivalent of a religious crusade.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=28–29}} This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=127–28}} Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Battle of Lincoln]] in May.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=36–40}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=216}}

Meanwhile, support for Louis' campaign was diminishing in France, and he concluded that the war in England was lost.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}} He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of [[excommunication]] would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=41–42}} The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}}

In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces, hoping for the arrival of reinforcements from France.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}} When the expected fleet did arrive in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations, and the factions came to agreement on the final [[Treaty of Lambeth]], also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit; it included a promise, however, that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, referring back to the Charter of 1216.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=41, 44–45}} Louis left England as agreed and joined the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}}

A [[Magnum Concilium|great council]] was called in October and November to take stock of the post-war situation; this council is thought to have formulated and issued the Charter of 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=60}} The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added to protect the rights of the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=60–61}} There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue; complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} A complementary charter, the [[Charter of the Forest]], was created, pardoning existing forest offences, imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} To distinguish the two charters, the term ''magna carta libertatum'', "the great charter of liberties", was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.{{sfn|White|1915|pp=472–75}}{{sfn|White|1917|pp=545–55}}

====Great Charter of 1225====
[[File:Magna Carta (1225 version with seal).jpg|thumb|upright|The 1225 version of Magna Carta issued by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], held in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]]]
Magna Carta became increasingly embedded into English political life during Henry III's [[Minor (law)|minority]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=402}} As the King grew older, his government slowly began to recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=333–35, 382–83}} Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the [[Court (royal)|royal court]], when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the charters protected the new arrangements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=295–96}}{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=6}} This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and [[William Brewer (justice)|William Brewer]] over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=296–97}} On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=297}}

Two years later, the question of Henry's commitment to the charters re-emerged, when Louis VIII of France invaded Henry's remaining provinces in France, [[Poitou]] and [[Gascony]].{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=176}}{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=20}} Henry's army in Poitou was under-resourced, and the province quickly fell.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=371–73}} It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=374–75}} In early 1225, a great council approved a tax of £40,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=376, 378}}{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=176–77}} In exchange for agreeing to support Henry, the barons demanded that the King reissue Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=379}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}} The content was almost identical to the 1217 versions, but in the new versions, the King declared that the charters were issued of his own "spontaneous and free will" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than the previous versions.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=383}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}

The barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=2–3, 383, 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=174}}

Henry placed a symbolic emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} He generally acted within the terms of the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=3}} The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=26, 29, 37, 43}} The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}} Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

In 1258, a group of barons seized power from Henry in a ''[[coup d'état]]'', citing the need to strictly enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the [[Provisions of Oxford]].{{sfn|Davis|2013|pp=195–97}} The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to [[Louis IX of France]] in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=104}}

Louis came down firmly in favour of Henry, but the French arbitration failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons refused to accept the verdict. England slipped back into the [[Second Barons' War]], which was won by Henry's son, [[Edward I of England|the Lord Edward]]. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=224}} In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the [[Statute of Marlborough]], which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=163}}

====Great Charter of 1297: statute====
[[File:Magna Carta (1297 version with seal, owned by David M Rubenstein).png|thumb|upright|1297 version of the Great Charter, on display in the [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] reissued the Charters of 1225 in 1297 in return for a new tax.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} It is this version which remains in [[statute]] today, although with most articles now repealed.&lt;ref name=natarch&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=The National Archive|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{anchor|Confirmatio}}

The ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' (Confirmation of Charters) was issued in [[Norman language|Norman French]] by Edward I in 1297.{{sfn|Edwards|1943}} Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, and they had armed themselves against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/cartarum.html|title=Confirmatio Cartarum|accessdate=30 November 2007|publisher=britannia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobles had sought to add another document, the ''De Tallagio'', to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the ''Confirmatio'', confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent,{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=434}}

A passage mandates that copies shall be distributed in "cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two times by the year",{{sfn|Cobbett|Howell|Howell|Jardine|1810|p=980}} hence the permanent installation of a copy in [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/magna-carta|publisher=Salisbury Cathedral|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Confirmation's second article, it is confirmed that

With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an additional document was granted, the ''Articuli super Cartas'' (The Articles upon the Charters).{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=62}} It was composed of 17 articles and sought in part to deal with the problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the [[sheriff]] of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.{{sfn|Fritze|Robison|2002|pp=34–35}}

[[Pope Clement V]] continued the papal policy of supporting monarchs (who ruled by divine grace) against any claims in Magna Carta which challenged the King's rights, and annulled the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' in 1305. Edward I interpreted Clement V's [[papal bull]] annulling the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' as effectively applying to the ''Articuli super Cartas'', although the latter was not specifically mentioned.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|pp=547–48}} In 1306 Edward I took the opportunity given by the Pope's backing to reassert forest law over large areas which had been "disafforested". Both Edward and the Pope were accused by some contemporary chroniclers of "perjury", and it was suggested by Robert McNair Scott that [[Robert the Bruce]] refused to make peace with Edward I's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1312 with the justification: "How shall the king of England keep faith with me, since he does not observe the sworn promises made to his liege men..."{{sfn|Menache|2003|pp=253–55}}{{sfn|Scott|2014}}

====Magna Carta's influence on English medieval law====
The Great Charter was referred to in legal cases throughout the medieval period. For example, in 1226, the knights of [[Lincolnshire]] argued that their local sheriff was changing customary practice regarding the local courts, "contrary to their liberty which they ought to have by the charter of the lord king".{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=44–45}} In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to bring a case against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=45–46}}

In addition, medieval cases referred to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation.{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=56}} Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=56–57}}

===14th–15th centuries===
[[File:Magna charta cum statutis angliae p1.jpg|upright|thumb|''Magna carta cum statutis angliae'' (Great Charter with English Statutes), early 14th-century]]
During the reign of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] six measures, later known as the ''Six Statutes'', were passed between 1331 and 1369. They sought to clarify certain parts of the Charters. In particular the third statute, in 1354, redefined clause 29, with "free man" becoming "no man, of whatever [[Estates of the realm|estate]] or condition he may be", and introduced the phrase "[[Due process|due process of law]]" for "lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=123}}

Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was reconfirmed 32 times according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], and possibly as many as 45 times.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, as in the previous century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch.{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=800th anniversary of Magna Carta|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media/1910459/gs%201945b%20-%20background%20note%20from%20mpa.pdf|publisher=Church of England General Synod|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.britroyals.com/magnacarta.htm|publisher=Royal Family History|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ben|title=The Origins of the Magna Carta|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Origins-of-the-Magna-Carta/|publisher=Historic UK|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta ceased to occupy a central role in English political life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=132}} The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=133}}

===16th century===
[[File:Magna Carta confirmed by Henry III.jpg|thumb|A version of the Charter of 1217, produced between 1437 and c. 1450]]
During the 16th century, the interpretation of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–87}} [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] took power at the end of the turbulent [[Wars of the Roses]], followed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–86}}

Tudor historians rediscovered the [[Barnwell chronicler]], who was more favourable to King John than other 13th-century texts, and, as historian Ralph Turner describes, they "viewed King John in a positive light as a hero struggling against the papacy", showing "little sympathy for the Great Charter or the rebel barons".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=138}} Pro-Catholic demonstrations during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|1536 uprising]] cited Magna Carta, accusing the King of not giving it sufficient respect.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}

The first mechanically printed edition of Magna Carta was probably the ''Magna Carta cum aliis Antiquis Statutis'' of 1508 by [[Richard Pynson]], although the early printed versions of the 16th century incorrectly attributed the origins of Magna Carta to Henry III and 1225, rather than to John and 1215, and accordingly worked from the later text.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|p=146}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=324}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=187}} An abridged English-language edition was published by [[John Rastell]] in 1527.
[[Thomas Berthelet]], Pynson's successor as the royal printer during 1530–1547,
printed an edition of the text along with other "ancient statutes" in 1531 and 1540.&lt;ref&gt;

revised edition by Thomas Marshe (1556), ''Magna Carta et cetera antiqua statuta nunc nouiter per diuersa exemplaria examinata et summa diligentia castigata et correcta cui adiecta est noua tabula valde necessaria.'' .&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1534, [[George Ferrers]] published the first unabridged English-language edition of Magna Carta, dividing the Charter into 37 numbered clauses.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=147–49}}

At the end of the 16th century, there was an upsurge in antiquarian interest in England.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}} This work concluded that there was a set of ancient English customs and laws, temporarily overthrown by the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]], which had then been recovered in 1215 and recorded in Magna Carta, which in turn gave authority to important 16th century legal principles.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} Modern historians note that although this narrative was fundamentally incorrect—many refer to it as a "[[Political myth|myth]]"—it took on great importance among the legal historians of the time.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{efn|Among the historians to have discussed the "myth" of Magna Carta and the ancient English constitution are Claire Breay, Geoffrey Hindley, [[J. C. Holt|James Holt]], [[J. G. A. Pocock|John Pocock]], Danny Danziger, and John Gillingham.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=183}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=124}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=9}}}}

The antiquarian [[William Lambarde]], for example, published what he believed were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing the origins of the 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting the dates of many documents concerned.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}} [[Francis Bacon]] argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes.{{sfn|Eele|2013|p=20}} Antiquarians [[Robert Beale (diplomat)|Robert Beale]], [[James Morice]], and [[Richard Cosin]] argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=216–30}} Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament [[Arthur Hall (English politician)|Arthur Hall]], faced sanctions.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=154}}{{sfn|Wright|1919|p=72}}

===17th–18th centuries===

====Political tensions====
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jurist]] [[Edward Coke]] made extensive political use of Magna Carta.]]
In the early 17th century, Magna Carta became increasingly important as a political document in arguments over the authority of the English monarchy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}} [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]], and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}

Magna Carta, it was argued, recognised and protected the liberty of individual Englishmen, made the King subject to the common law of the land, formed the origin of the trial by jury system, and acknowledged the ancient origins of Parliament: because of Magna Carta and this [[ancient constitution]], an English monarch was unable to alter these long-standing English customs.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=300}}{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=148}} Although the arguments based on Magna Carta were historically inaccurate, they nonetheless carried symbolic power, as the charter had immense significance during this period; antiquarians such as Sir [[Henry Spelman]] described it as "the most majestic and a sacrosanct anchor to English Liberties".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}

Sir Edward Coke was a leader in using Magna Carta as a political tool during this period. Still working from the 1225 version of the text—the first printed copy of the 1215 charter only emerged in 1610—Coke spoke and wrote about Magna Carta repeatedly.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} His work was challenged at the time by [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], and modern historians such as Ralph Turner and Claire Breay have critiqued Coke as "misconstruing" the original charter "anachronistically and uncritically", and taking a "very selective" approach to his analysis.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=148}} More sympathetically, [[J. C. Holt]] noted that the history of the charters had already become "distorted" by the time Coke was carrying out his work.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=20–21}}

[[File:John Lilburne.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Lilburne]] criticised Magna Carta as an inadequate definition of English liberties.]]
In 1621, a bill was presented to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer [[John Selden]] argued during [[Darnell's Case]] in 1627 that the right of ''habeas corpus'' was backed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=156}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}} Coke supported the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=189–90}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=157}} The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=280–81}} Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta in any way that would reduce his independence as King.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=41}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=190}}

England descended into [[English Civil War|civil war]] in the 1640s, resulting in Charles I's execution in 1649. Under the [[Commonwealth of England|republic]] that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=271}} An anti-[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] pamphlet published in 1660, ''The English devil'', said that the nation had been "compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be  cut off by him; nothing but a word and a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay his hand on his sword and cry Magna Farta".{{sfn|Woolwrych|2003|p=95}} In a 2005 speech the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], repeated the claim that Cromwell had referred to Magna Carta as "Magna Farta".&lt;ref name=woolfspeech/&gt;

The radical groups that flourished during this period held differing opinions of Magna Carta. The [[Levellers]] rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an "anti-Normanism" viewpoint.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=127}} [[John Lilburne]], for example, argued that Magna Carta contained only some of the freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the [[Norman yoke]].{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=279}} The Leveller [[Richard Overton (Leveller)|Richard Overton]] described the charter as "a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage".{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=226}} Both saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=281–82}} [[Gerrard Winstanley]], the leader of the more extreme [[Diggers]], stated "the best lawes that England hath, [viz., the Magna Carta] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one sort of people to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them."{{sfn|Hill|2006|pp=111–22}}{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|p=85}}

====Glorious Revolution====
[[File:Magna Carta - John Pine engraving 1733.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1733 engraving of the Charter of 1215 by [[John Pine]]]]
The first attempt at a proper [[historiography]] was undertaken by [[Robert Brady (writer)|Robert Brady]],{{sfn|Pocock|1987|pp=182–228}} who refuted the supposed antiquity of Parliament and belief in the immutable continuity of the law. Brady realised that the liberties of the Charter were limited and argued that the liberties were the grant of the King. By putting Magna Carta in historical context, he cast doubt on its contemporary political relevance;{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=165}} his historical understanding did not survive the [[Glorious Revolution]], which, according to the historian [[J. G. A. Pocock]], "marked a setback for the course of English historiography."{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=228}}

According to the [[Whig interpretation of history]], the Glorious Revolution was an example of the reclaiming of ancient liberties. Reinforced with [[John Locke|Lockean]] concepts, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] believed England's constitution to be a [[social contract]], based on documents such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]].{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=169–70}}  The ''English Liberties'' (1680, in later versions often ''British Liberties'') by the Whig propagandist [[Henry Care]] (d. 1688) was a cheap polemical book that was influential and much-reprinted, in the American colonies as well as Britain, and made Magna Carta central to the history and the contemporary legitimacy of its subject.{{sfn|Breay|Harrison|2015|pp=110–11, 134}}

Ideas about the nature of law in general were beginning to change. In 1716, the [[Septennial Act 1716|Septennial Act]] was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Act]] (1694) (enacted less than a quarter of a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

It also greatly extended the powers of Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] was replaced by [[Parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]]. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be challenged by the likes of [[Granville Sharp]]. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited [[slavery]].{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

Sir [[William Blackstone]] published a critical edition of the 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}} In 1763, Member of Parliament [[John Wilkes]] was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, ''No. 45, 23 April 1763''; he cited Magna Carta continually.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=207}} [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden#John Wilkes MP|Lord Camden]] denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodrich|first1=Chauncey A.|title=The Speeches of Lord Chatham|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat09.htm|publisher=Classic Persuasion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine]], in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'', would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights on the grounds that they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Irvine of Lairg 'The Spirit of Magna Carta Continues to Resonate in Modern Law'|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070809/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in the Thirteen Colonies and the United States====

When English colonists left for the New World, they brought royal charters that established the colonies. The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay Company]] charter, for example, stated that the colonists would "have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brink|first1=Robert J.|title=History on display: one lawyer's musings on Magna Carta|journal=Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly|date=18 August 2014|url=http://masslawyersweekly.com/reprints/history-on-display-one-lawyers-musings-on-the-magna-carta/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Virginia Company|Virginia Charter]] of 1606, which was largely drafted by Sir Edward Coke, stated that the colonists would have the same "liberties, franchises and immunities" as people born in England.{{sfn|Howard|2008|p=28}} The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] contained similarities to clause 29 of Magna Carta; when drafting it, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] viewed Magna Carta as the chief embodiment of English common law.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=194}} The other colonies would follow their example. In 1638, [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] sought to recognise Magna Carta as part of the law of the province, but the request was denied by Charles I.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=195}}

In 1687, [[William Penn]] published ''The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: being the birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England'', which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil.

The development of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which retained an adherence to [[English common law]], but it directly affected the relationship between Britain and the colonies.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|pp=183–84}} When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not so much for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta and Its American Legacy|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/legacy.html|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the [[United States Constitution]] became the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], recalling the manner in which Magna Carta had come to be regarded as fundamental law.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"/&gt; The Constitution's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantees that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", a phrase that was derived from Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magna Carta|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Constitution included a similar writ in the [[Denied powers|Suspension Clause]], Article 1, Section 9: "The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habeas Corpus|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/habeas+corpus|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these proclaim that no person may be imprisoned or detained without evidence that he or she committed a crime. The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] states that "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." The writers of the U.S. Constitution wished to ensure that the rights they already held, such as those that they believed were provided by Magna Carta, would be preserved unless explicitly curtailed.{{sfn|Stimson|2004|p=124}}{{sfn|Black|1999|p=10}}

===19th–21st centuries===

====Interpretation====
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 226 - John Signs the Great Charter.jpg|thumb|A romanticised 19th-century recreation of King John signing Magna Carta]]
Initially, the Whig interpretation of Magna Carta and its role in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian [[William Stubbs]]'s ''Constitutional History of England'', published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}} Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}}

This view of Magna Carta began to recede. The late-Victorian jurist and historian [[Frederic William Maitland]] provided an alternative academic history in 1899, which began to return Magna Carta to its historical roots.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} In 1904, [[Edward Jenks]] published an article entitled "The Myth of Magna Carta", which undermined the previously accepted view of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Galef|1998|pp=78–79}} Historians such as [[Albert Pollard]] agreed with Jenks in concluding that Edward Coke had largely "invented" the myth of Magna Carta in the 17th century; these historians argued that the 1215 charter had not referred to liberty for the people at large, but rather to the protection of baronial rights.{{sfn|Pollard|1912|pp=31–32}}

This view also became popular in wider circles, and in 1930 [[Sellar and Yeatman]] published their parody on English history, ''[[1066 and All That]]'', in which they  mocked the supposed importance of Magna Carta and its promises of universal liberty: "Magna Charter was therefore the chief cause of Democracy in England, and thus a ''Good Thing'' for everyone (except the Common People)".{{sfn|Barnes|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=283}}

In many literary representations of the medieval past, however, Magna Carta remained a foundation of English national identity. Some authors used the medieval roots of the document as an argument to preserve the social status quo, while others pointed to Magna Carta to challenge perceived economic injustices.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} The [[Baronial Order of Magna Charta]] was formed in 1898 to promote the ancient principles and values felt to be displayed in Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnacharta.com/|title=Home|publisher=The Baronial Order of Magna Charta|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal profession in England and the United States continued to hold Magna Carta in high esteem; they were instrumental in forming the Magna Carta Society in 1922 to protect the meadows at Runnymede from development in the 1920s, and in 1957, the [[American Bar Association]] erected the [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"/&gt;{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=167}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=2–3}} The prominent lawyer [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] described Magna Carta in 1956 as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; see note above --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}

====Repeal of articles and constitutional influence====
Radicals such as Sir [[Francis Burdett]] believed that Magna Carta could not be repealed,{{sfn|Burdett|1810|p=41}} but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (9 [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Geo. 4]] c. 31 s. 1)&lt;!-- ie section 1 of the 31st statute issued in the 9th year of George IV --&gt;&lt;!-- "nor will We not" in clause 29 is correctly quoted from this source --&gt;,&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt; was the first time a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105004655/http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 November 2014|publisher=Segamore Institute|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]], and in modern [[Northern Ireland]] and also in the modern [[Republic of Ireland]] by the [[Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872]].&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt;

Many later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand,{{sfn|Clark|2000}} Canada{{sfn|Kennedy|1922|p=228}} (except [[Quebec]]), and formerly the [[Union of South Africa]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], reflected the influence of Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's effects can be seen in the laws of other states that evolved from the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Drew|2004|pp=pxvi–pxxiii}}

====Modern legacy====
[[File:ABA-wyrdlight-815935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede, designed by Sir [[Edward Maufe]] and erected by the [[American Bar Association]] in 1957. The memorial stands in the meadow known historically as Long Mede: it is likely that the actual site of the sealing of Magna Carta lay further east, towards [[Egham]] and [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]].{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}]]

Magna Carta continues to have a powerful iconic status in British society, being cited by politicians and lawyers in support of constitutional positions.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} Its perceived guarantee of trial by jury and other civil liberties, for example, led to [[Tony Benn]]'s reference to the debate in 2008 over whether to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects could be [[Remand (detention)|held without charge]] from 28 to 42 days as "the day Magna Carta was repealed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/so-will-the-revolution-start-in-haltemprice-and-howden-846938.html|title=So will the revolution start in Haltemprice and Howden?|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rarely invoked in court in the modern era, in 2012 the [[Occupy London]] protestors attempted to use Magna Carta in resisting their eviction from [[St. Paul's Churchyard]] by the [[City of London]]. In his judgment the [[Master of the Rolls]] gave this short shrift, noting somewhat drily that although clause 29 was considered by many the foundation of the rule of law in England, he did not consider it directly relevant to the case, and the two other surviving clauses actually concerned the rights of the Church and the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=David Allen|url=http://blogs.ft.com/david-allen-green/2014/06/16/the-myth-of-magna-carta/|title=The myth of Magna Carta|registration=yes|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=21 January 2015|authorlink=David Allen Green|work=Financial Times|quote=The sarcasm of the Master of the Rolls was plain|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/160.html|title=The Mayor Commonalty and Citizens of London v Samede|date=22 February 2012|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta carries little legal weight in modern Britain, as most of its clauses have been repealed and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that the survival of the 1215 charter in national life is a "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=2}} The historian W. L. Warren has observed that "many who knew little and cared less about the content of the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, and with good cause, for it meant more than it said".{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=240}}

It also remains a topic of great interest to historians; [[Natalie Fryde]] characterised the charter as "one of the holiest of cows in English medieval history", with the debates over its interpretation and meaning unlikely to end.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}} In many ways still a "sacred text", Magna Carta is generally considered part of the [[uncodified constitution]] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|of the United Kingdom]]; in a 2005 speech, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], described it as the "first of a series of instruments that now are recognised as having a special constitutional status".{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=21}}&lt;ref name=woolfspeech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnacarta800th.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Precedent_Recent_Constitutional_Change.pdf|title=Magna Carta: a precedent for recent constitutional change|work=Judiciary of England and Wales Speeches|date=15 June 2005|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta was reprinted in [[New Zealand]] in 1881 as one of the Imperial Acts in force there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/imp_act_1881/mc25ei84/ |title= Magna Carta (25 Ed I) |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clause 29 of the document remains in force as part of New Zealand law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1297/0029/latest/whole.html#DLM10926|title=Magna Carta 1297 No 29 (as at 03 September 2007), Imperial Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document also continues to be honoured in the United States as an antecedent of the [[United States Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name=ChartersOfFreedom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_q_and_a.html|title=United States Constitution Q + A|work=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the UK lent one of four surviving originals of the 1215 Magna Carta to the United States for their bicentennial celebrations and also donated an ornate display case for it. The original was returned after one year, but a replica and the case are still on display in the [[United States Capitol]] Crypt in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta Replica and Display|url=http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/other/magna-carta-replica-and-display|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Physical format===
Numerous copies, known as [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]], were made of the various charters, and many of them still survive.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=37}} The documents were written in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin in clear handwriting, using [[quill]] pens on sheets of [[parchment]] made from sheep skin, approximately {{convert|15|by|20|in}} across.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} They were sealed with the royal great seal by an official called the spigurnel, equipped with a special seal press, using beeswax and resin.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} There were no signatures on the charter of 1215, and the barons present did not attach their own [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] to it.{{sfn|Browning|1898|p=50}} The charters were not numbered or divided into paragraphs or separate clauses at the time; the numbering system used today was introduced by the jurist Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}}

===Exemplifications===

====1215 exemplifications====
[[File:Magna-carta-1225-C6257-03.jpg|thumb|upright|1225 charter, held in the British Library, with the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal great seal]] attached]]
At least thirteen original copies of the charter of 1215 were issued by the royal chancery during that year, seven in the first tranche distributed on 24 June and another six later; they were sent to county sheriffs and bishops, who were probably charged for the privilege.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–35}} Slight variations exist between the surviving copies, and there was probably no single "master copy".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=34}} Of these documents, only four survive, all held in England: two now at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=35}} Each of these versions is slightly different in size and text, and each is considered by historians to be equally authoritative.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–36}}

The two 1215 charters held by the British Library, known as ''Cotton MS. Augustus II.106'' and ''Cotton Charter XIII.31a'', were acquired by the antiquarian [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]] in the 17th century.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=35–36}} One of these had been found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=36}} The other was found in [[Dover Castle]] in 1630 by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]. The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the [[Cinque Ports]] in 1215.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=65}} (In 2015 it was announced that [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] had found the Dering copy to be identical to a transcription made in the 1290s from [[Canterbury Cathedral]]'s copy of 1215, and so he suggests that the Dering copy's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|title=Canterbury's Magna Carta rediscovered in time for 800th anniversary|publisher=Canterbury Christ Church University|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123005702/http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|title=Remarkable discovery says copy of Magna Carta in British Library was 'Canterbury charter'|publisher=kentnews|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010037/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) This copy was damaged in the [[Cotton library#The Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. The parchment was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed, and an engraved [[facsimile]] of the charter was made by [[John Pine]] in 1733.

===Clauses===
[[File:John penny.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the "heads" side of a silver King John penny|upright|A [[silver]] King John [[penny]]; much of Magna Carta concerned how royal revenues were raised]]
Most of the 1215 charter and later versions sought to govern the feudal rights of the Crown over the barons.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, the rights of the King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. [[Feudal relief]] was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} [[Scutage]] was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown  often used the cash to pay for mercenaries.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=16–17}} The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

The English judicial system had altered considerably over the previous century, with the royal judges playing a larger role in delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, and the role of the Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} In the United States, for example, the [[Supreme Court of California]] interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John of England (John Lackland).jpg|thumb|upright|left|King John holding a church, painted c. 1250–59 by [[Matthew Paris]]]]
[[Royal forest]]s were economically important in medieval England and were both protected and exploited by the Crown, supplying the King with hunting grounds, raw materials, and money.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=29–30}} They were subject to special royal jurisdiction and the resulting forest law was, according to the historian Richard Huscroft, "harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will".{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}} The size of the forests had expanded under the Angevin kings, an unpopular development.{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=29}}

The 1215 charter had several clauses relating to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably did not address the forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}} Neither Magna Carta nor the subsequent Charter of the Forest proved entirely satisfactory as a way of managing the political tensions arising in the operation of the royal forests.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

Some of the clauses addressed wider economic issues. The concerns of the barons over the treatment of their debts to Jewish moneylenders, who occupied a special position in medieval England and were by tradition under the King's protection, were addressed by clauses 10 and 11.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=353, 474}} The charter concluded this section with the phrase "debts owing to other than Jews shall be dealt with likewise", so it is debatable to what extent the Jews were being singled out by these clauses.{{sfn|Hillaby|2013|p=23}} Some issues were relatively specific, such as clause 33 which ordered the removal of all [[fishing weir]]s—an important and growing source of revenue at the time—from England's rivers.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

The role of the English Church had been a matter for great debate in the years prior to the 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=190}} After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=121}}

[[Investiture Controversy|These changes]] brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}} As described above, John had come to a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

====Clauses remaining in English law====
Only three clauses of Magna Carta still remain on statute in England and Wales.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} These clauses concern 1) the freedom of the English Church, 2) the "ancient liberties" of the City of London (clause 13 in the 1215 charter, clause 9 in the 1297 statute), and 3) a right to due legal process (clauses 39 and 40 in the 1215 charter, clause 29 in the 1297 statute).{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} In detail, these clauses (using the numbering system from the 1297 statute) state that:

{{quotation|
* I. FIRST, We have granted to God, and by this our present Charter have confirmed, for Us and our Heirs for ever, that the Church of England shall be free, and shall have all her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable. We have granted also, and given to all the Freemen of our Realm, for Us and our Heirs for ever, these Liberties under-written, to have and to hold to them and their Heirs, of Us and our Heirs for ever.
* IX. THE [[City of London]] shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have. Moreover We will and grant, that all other Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and the Barons of the [[Cinque Ports|Five Ports]], as with all other Ports, shall have all their Liberties and free Customs.
* XXIX. NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the [[Law of the land]]. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.&lt;ref name=UKStatute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |title=(Magna Carta) (1297) (c. 9) |work=UK Statute Law Database |accessdate=2 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905014018/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |archivedate=5 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Navtej Singh Johar {{Abbr|&amp;|and}} {{Abbr|Ors.|Others}} versus Union of India {{Abbr|thr.|through}} Secretary Ministry of Law and Justice''''' is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of India]] in 2018 that decriminalised all consensual sex among adults in private, including homosexual sex.&lt;ref name="SCI2018-09-06-conclusion01a"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Navtej Singh Johar &amp; Ors. v. Union of India thr. Secretary Ministry of Law and Justice|court=[[Supreme Court of India]]|pinpoint=W. P. (Crl.)

In view of the aforesaid findings, it is declared that insofar as Section 377 criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults (i.e. persons above the age of 18 years who are competent to consent) in private, is violative of Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. It is, however, clarified that such consent must be free consent, which is completely voluntary in nature, and devoid of any duress or coercion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court was asked to determine the constitutionality of [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]], a [[British Raj|colonial-era]] law which among others criminalised homosexual acts as an "unnatural offence". On 6 September 2018, the court unanimously declared the law unconstitutional "in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/indian-supreme-court-decriminalises-homosexuality|title=Campaigners celebrate as India decriminalises homosexuality|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2018-09-06|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of Section 377 relating to sex with [[Minor (law)|minors]], [[Sexual consent|non-consensual]] sexual acts such as [[rape]], and [[bestiality]] remain in force.&lt;ref name=pundir&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pundir |first1=Pallavi |title=I Am What I Am.

==Background==
On 27 April 2016, five people from the [[LGBT]] community filed a new [[writ]] [[petition]] in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]]. The petitioners claimed that the issues which they raised in their petition were varied and diverse from those raised in the pending curative petition in the 2013 ''[[Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation|Koushal v. Naz]]'' case, in which the Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of Section 377. The ''Naz'' case was earlier referred to a five-judge bench in order to decide whether the curative petition could be accepted for consideration. The petitioners were dancer [[Navtej Johar|Navtej Singh Johar]], journalist Sunil Mehra, chef [[Ritu Dalmia]], hoteliers [[Aman Nath]] and Keshav Suri, and businesswoman [[Ayesha Kapur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/section-377-verdict-live-updates-supreme-court-decriminalisation-of-homosexuality-5342203/?#liveblogstart|title=Gay sex decriminalised: History owes apology to LGBT community and kin, says Supreme Court|date=September 6, 2018|work=[[The Indian Express]]|access-date=September 6, 2018|publisher=[[Indian Express Group]]|others=Express Web Desk|publication-place=[[New Delhi]]|oclc=70274541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it happened to be the first case where the petitioners had argued that they had all been directly aggrieved because of Section 377 alleging it to be a direct violation of [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legallyindia.com/supreme-court/read-the-wonderful-new-377-challenge-by-5-out-and-proud-celebrities-that-ll-hit-sc-today-20160628-7762|title=Read the wonderful new 377 challenge by 5 out-and-proud celebrities that'll hit SC today|last=Ganz|first=Kian|website=Legallyindia.com|language=en-gb|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://orinam.net/377/navtej-johar-vs-uoi-petition/|title=Navtej Singh Johar &amp; ors. vs. UoI: Supreme Court petition 29 June 2016 – Orinam Section 377|date=29 June 2016|work=Orinam Section 377|access-date=15 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey conducted by the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] and [[Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung]], only 25% of Indian youth approved of a homosexual relationship in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indian-youth-is-a-strange-mix-of-conservative-and-liberal-attitudes/articleshow/58319013.cms|title=Indian youth is a strange mix of conservative and liberal attitudes: Survey|last=Harikrishnan|first=Charmy|date=2017-04-23|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2018, the court delivered its verdict, declaring portions of the law relating to consensual sexual acts between adults unconstitutional in a unanimous decision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45429664|title=Historic India ruling legalises gay sex|date=6 September 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=6 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gettleman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/world/asia/india-gay-sex-377.html|title=India Strikes Down Colonial-Era Law Against Gay Sex|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|date=6 September 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=6 September 2018|last2=Schultz|first2=Kai|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision overturns the 2013 ruling in ''Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz Foundation'' in which the court upheld the law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/indien-homosexualitaet-legal-1.4118910|title=Homosexualität ist in Indien nicht mehr strafbar|last=|first=|date=6 September 2018|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=6 September 2018|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other portions of Section 377 relating to sex with [[Minor (law)|minors]], [[Sexual consent|non-consensual]] sexual acts, and [[bestiality]] remain in force.&lt;ref name=pundir/&gt;

The court found that the criminalisation of sexual acts between consenting adults violated the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India#Right to Equality|right to equality]] guaranteed by the [[Constitution of India]]. While reading the judgment, Chief Justice Misra pronounced that the court found that "[c]riminalising carnal intercourse" to be "irrational, arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The court ruled that [[LGBT]] people in India are entitled to all constitutional rights, including the liberties protected by the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Navtej Singh Johar &amp; Ors. v. Union of India thr. Secretary Ministry of Law and Justice|court=[[Supreme Court of India]]|pinpoint=W. P. (Crl.)

While the statute criminalises all [[anal sex]] and [[oral sex]], including between opposite-sex couples, it has largely affected same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, the verdict was hailed as a landmark decision for [[LGBT rights in India]], with campaigners waiting outside the court cheering after the verdict was pronounced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;!--== Excerpts ==
[[Chief Justice of India]], [[Dipak Misra]], quoted [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in his judgement: "I am what I am, so take me as I am."&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt; Justice [[Indu Malhotra]] wrote, "History owes an apology to the members of this community and their families, for the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries."&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt; Justice [[Rohinton Fali Nariman|R. F. Nariman]] cited the poem "The Love that Dare not Speak its Name" and the [[Indian Psychiatric Society]] stating [[homosexuality]] is not a psychiatric disorder. Justice [[Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud|D. Y.  Chandrachud]] quoted Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]], Jr.'s quote, "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice and A Letter from a Birmingham Jail. The judgement also stated it would help in combatting HIV and could prove a balm for the mental health of LGBT people.&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt; The judgements cited case law from India, South Africa, the United States, Canada, the European Court of Justice, the UK, the Netherlands, Australia, the Philippines, the European Court of Human Rights, Ireland, Cyprus, Israel, Trinidad and Tobago, the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], Colombia, Belize, Hong Kong, Nepal, and Italy.&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt;

"LGBT individuals living under the threats of conformity grounded in cultural morality have been denied a basic human existence. They have been stereotyped and prejudiced. Constitutional morality requires this Court not to turn a blind eye to their right to an equal participation of citizenship and an equal enjoyment of living.  Constitutional morality requires that this Court must act as a counter majoritarian institution which discharges the responsibility of protecting constitutionally entrenched rights, regardless of what the majority may believe. Constitutional morality must turn into a habit of citizens. By respecting the dignity of LGBT individuals, this Court is only fulfilling the foundational promises of our Constitution."&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt; "A hundred and fifty eight years is too long a period for the LGBT community to suffer the indignities of denial. That it has taken sixty eight years even after the advent of the Constitution is a sobering reminder of the unfinished task which lies ahead. It is also a time to invoke the transformative power of the Constitution."&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt;

"The ability of a society to acknowledge the injustices which it has perpetuated is a mark of its evolution. In the process of remedying wrongs under a regime of constitutional remedies, recrimination gives way to restitution, diatribes pave the way for dialogue and healing replaces the hate of a community. For those who have been oppressed, justice under a regime committed to human freedom, has the power to transform lives. In addressing the causes of oppression and injustice, society transforms itself."&lt;ref name="excerpt2"/&gt;

=== Actionable parts ===
We hold and declare that:

# Section 377 of the Penal Code, in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex, is unconstitutional
# Members of the LGBT community are entitled, as all other citizens, to the full range of constitutional rights including the liberties protected by the Constitution; 
# The choice of whom to partner, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies and the right not to be subjected to discriminatory behaviour are intrinsic to the constitutional protection of sexual orientation
# Members of the LGBT community are entitled to the benefit of an equal citizenship, without discrimination, and to the equal protection of law
# The decision in ''[[Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz Foundation]]'' stands overruled&lt;ref name="excerpt2" /&gt;--&gt;

The [[Government of India]], decided to abstain from the hearings and had left the matter to the "[w]isdom of the [c]ourt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/section-377-supreme-court-hearing-centre-defers-to-wisdom-of-court-menaka-guruswamy-says-ipc-section-violates-article-15-4713811.html|title=Section 377 Supreme Court hearing: Centre defers to 'wisdom of court'; Menaka Guruswamy says IPC section violates Article 15|website=Firstpost.com|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest constituent party of the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]], a right-wing [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] coalition, currently having a majority in the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People), the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), was one of the few parties which officially stayed silent on the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/06/section-377-bjp-has-nothing-to-say-about-supreme-courts-verdict-legalizing-gay-sex_a_23518802/|title=Section 377: BJP Has Nothing To Say About Supreme Court's Historic Verdict Legalizing Gay Sex|date=2018-09-06|work=HuffPost India|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-mum-sc-verdict-section-377-691575.html|title=BJP mum on SC verdict on Section 377|date=2018-09-07|work=Deccan Herald|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several party members did express their personal opinions on the subject, including the BJP spokesperson [[G.

Narasimha Rao]], who said that any decision on the matter "takes in sync with the jurisprudential developments on gay rights the world over would be welcome".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-parties-welcome-sc-ruling-on-homosexuality/article22397791.ece|title=Ruling and Opposition parties on the same side against Section 377|date=2018-01-08|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-10|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Subramanian Swamy]], a [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of the States) [[Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha|member]] of the BJP, attacked the decision, questioning if the court will legalise sexual intercourse with animals in the name of personal liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/Swamy39/status/1037615997656555520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1037615997656555520%7Ctwgr%5E373939313b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/section-377-verdict-rss-says-same-sex-relations-against-nature-subramanian-swamy-milli-gazette-take-more-assertive-stand-5129801.html|title=Subramanian Swamy on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of the view that the decision could be overruled "[i]f it leads to excesses, including paedophilia, gay bars, increase in HIV cases, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/section-377-verdict-rss-says-same-sex-relations-against-nature-subramanian-swamy-milli-gazette-take-more-assertive-stand-5129801.html|title='Step towards self-destruction': Far-right comes out against Supreme Court's Section 377 verdict|website=Firstpost.com|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Narendra Modi]], has a record of saying relatively little about LGBT rights compared to other socio-political issues, and refused to comment on the same.&lt;ref name="Gettleman" /&gt;

The right-wing organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] conveyed its agreement with the court's verdict as it didn't believe homosexuality was a crime, but did label the orientation as "unnatural".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/homosexuality-not-a-crime-but-unnatural-rss/articleshow/65703402.cms|title=Homosexuality not a crime, but unnatural: RSS|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the BJP's coalition partner, the [[Shiv Sena]] had supported legalisation, with its member and a [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|member of parliament]] in [[Lok Sabha]] for [[Mumbai South (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mumbai South]], [[Arvind Sawant|Arvind Sawant Ganpat]] saying, "They have the right to live the way they want. What can we say on it."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

The largest [[Official Opposition (India)|opposition party]] in India, the [[Indian National Congress]] of the [[United Progressive Alliance]], issued a statement welcoming the ruling. The organisation remarked that the judgement should bring about "the beginning of a more equal and inclusive society".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was in contrast to its previous objection in the same case in 2009 when it was in government during the initial Naz Foundation case, stating that gay sex was 'immoral' and that it cannot be decriminalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/gay-sex-is-immoral-and-cant-be-decriminalised-govt-tells-hc/613434|title=Gay sex is immoral and can't be decriminalised, Govt tells HC|website=Outlookindia.com|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overseas===
In terms of [[non-governmental organisation]]s, the group [[Human Rights Watch]] welcomed what happened, with its South Asia director labelling the judgement as "hugely significant".&lt;ref name="Gettleman" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] also praised the ruling.&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/india-supreme-courts-decriminalising-gay-sex-represents-new-era-equality|title=India decriminalises gay sex|website=Amnesty.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] welcomed the judgement, hoping that it will be the first step towards guaranteeing the full range of fundamental rights to [[LGBTI]] persons.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.one.un.org/un-news/united-nations-india-welcomes-supreme-court-judgment-striking-section-377/|title=United Nations in India welcomes Supreme Court judgment on Section 377|work=UN India|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global News]] suggested that similar colonial laws in South Asia, modelled on India's Section 377, could be declared unconstitutional following this verdict. The agency stated that the ruling "emboldened activists in neighbouring countries".&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt; In terms of [[LGBT rights in Sri Lanka]], a similar law in that nation, which has not been enforced in decades, was declared unenforceable by its Supreme Court and is effectively dormant. However, differences in how constitutional matters are handled mean that the law cannot be removed without the consent of the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/SL-committed-to-non-discrimination-based-on-sexual-orientation-Nerin-Pulle-140616.html|title=SL committed to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation: Nerin Pulle|website=Dailymirror.lk|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt; Global News also noted that the nations of Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan face problems with LGBT people suffering from public discrimination, outside of the context of laws restricting homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/4430721/india-gay-sex-supreme-court-pakistan-bangladesh/|title=India legalized homosexuality, but many of its neighbours haven’t|work=Global News|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Chesterman]], dean of the [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]], congratulated India on the verdict in a [[Facebook]] post. In response to Chesterman's post, Singaporean diplomat [[Tommy Koh]] wrote on [[Facebook]] that Singaporean LGBT activists should take the opportunity to overturn [[Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|Section 377A of the Penal Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 September 2018|title=Inspired by India, veteran Singapore diplomat calls for gays to challenge sex ban|url=https://www.nst.com.my/world/2018/09/409289/inspired-india-veteran-singapore-diplomat-calls-gays-challenge-sex-ban|work=[[Reuters]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913040115/https://www.nst.com.my/world/2018/09/409289/inspired-india-veteran-singapore-diplomat-calls-gays-challenge-sex-ban|archive-date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position supported by Chief of Government Communications [[Janadas Devan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">The ''' New Man ''' is a [[utopia]]n concept that involves the creation of a new ideal human being or [[citizen]] replacing un-ideal human beings or citizens. The meaning of a New Man has widely varied and various alternatives have been suggested by a variety of religions and political ideologies, including [[Christianity]], [[communism]], [[classical liberalism]], [[fascism]], and [[utopian socialism]].

==Philosophical and religious versions==

===Christian New Man===
The doctrines of [[Paul the Apostle]] speak of [[Adam]] both as the fallen "Old Adam" and a "New Adam" as referring collectively to the fallen Old Man of humanity and a resurrected "New Man" (Ephesians 2:15, The Holy Bible) following [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung Hoon Kim, Chŏng-hun Kim. ''The significance of clothing imagery in the Pauline Corpus''. New York, New York, USA: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004. Pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzschean ''Übermensch''===
Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of an ''[[Übermensch]]'' ("Overman") was that of a New Man who would be a leader by example to humanity through an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[will to power]] that was [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and [[Irrationalism|irrationalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Stralen. ''Choices and conflict: essays on literature and existentialism''. Pp. Brussels, Belgium: Peter Lang, 2005. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche developed the concept in response to his view of the [[herd mentality]] of and inherent [[nihilism]] of Christianity, and the void in existential meaning that is realized with the [[death of God]]. The Übermensch emerges as the new meaning of the Earth, a norm-repudiating individual who overcomes himself and is the master in control of his impulses and passions.

==Political versions==

===Liberal New Man===
[[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Godwin]] believed that the spread of liberalism in [[France]] and the [[United States]] constituted the birth of a New Man and a new era.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopian Socialist New Man===
[[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]] such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] saw a future [[Golden Age]] led by a New Man who would reconstruct society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist New Man===
{{see also|New Soviet man}}
[[Marxism]], though heavily critical of [[utopianism]], postulates the development of a New Man and New Woman in a [[communist society]] following the values of a non-essential nature of the state and the importance of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated]] work for the affirmation of a person's humanity. Marxism does not see the New Man/Woman as a goal or prerequisite for achieving full communism, but rather as a product of the social conditions of pure communism. [[Che Guevara]]'s essay "Socialism and man in [[Cuba]]" and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' are two examples of the 'new man' archetype in socialist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm|title=Socialism and man in Cuba|first=Che|last=Guevara|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist New Man===

===Transhumanist New Man===
[[Transhumanism]] welcomes the creation of a literal ''new man'' by enhancements through cybernetics and other "human enhancements", and look to the [[Transhumanism#Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity|singularity]] as that point in time when the new man arrives, his birthday if you will.

An advisory '''referendum''' on accepting the institutions of the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}} was held in the [[Serbs|Serb]]-dominated regions of [[North Kosovo]] on 14 and 15 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/99-74-kosovo-serbs-say-no-to-pristina|title=Northern Serbs Vote 'No' to Kosovo|last=Barlovac|first=Bojana|author2=Aliu Fatmir|publisher=Balkan Insight|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was held in [[Zubin Potok]], [[Zvečan]] and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] on both days, while [[Leposavić]] voted on 15 February. The voting ran from 7:00 to 19:00 on both days.&lt;ref name="B92"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=12&amp;nav_id=78763 |title=Northern Kosovo ready for referendum |publisher=B 92 |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214024134/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=12&amp;nav_id=78763# |archive-date=2012-02-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 February is also symbolically [[Serbia]]'s [[Statehood Day (Serbia)|Statehood Day]]. The result saw 99.74% of voters reject the writ of the Republic of Kosovo's institutions. The poll was rejected by the governments of both Serbia and Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbs reject Kosovo Albanian rule in referendum|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17058122|accessdate=10 August 2014|agency=BBC|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Though [[North Kosovo]], as part of the [[Assembly of the Community of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]], adheres to the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244]], it opposed the unilateral [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] (the [[Kosovo Serb enclaves]] are under the de facto jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fatmir Aliu |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/snc-kosovo-s-north-remains-serbia |title=North Kosovo Leader Demands Right to Join Serbia |publisher=Balkan Insight |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the institutions of the [[Republic of Serbia]], though this is disputed by the Kosovan Assembly). The referendum was announced on December 25, 2011, by Kosovska Mitrovica Mayor [[Krstimir Pantić]], to ascertain local opinion about the writ of the Republic of Kosovo's institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=77984# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723023125/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=77984# |archive-date=2012-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[European Union]] and [[Serbia]] are against the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/commission-deplores-serbs-northern-kosovo-referendum-news-510772 |title=Commission deplores Serb's Northern Kosovo referendum |newspaper=EurActiv |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g0EKJO3FvOEI072TL6r_q0dmn18w?docId=CNG.2f6aef10791fbe30fc095a843402452e.6d1 |first=Tanja |last=Vujisic |title=Kosovo Serbs defy Belgrade, EU with referendum |publisher=AFP |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovan Serbs feared that Serbia opposed the referendum in order to win support for [[Accession of Serbia to the European Union|accession to the EU]], part of a condition is to resolve the Kosovo dispute. The notion was however rejected by Serbian President [[Boris Tadic]] and the Minister of State for Kosovo [[Oliver Ivanovic]]. The [[parliament of Kosovo]] passed a motion declaring the referendum invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-serbs-referendum-continues-through-its-second-day|title=Kosovo Serb Referendum Goes Into Second Day|last=Ristic|first=Marija|date=February 15, 2012|publisher=Balkan Insight|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Foreign Ministry of Albania]] expressed concern about holding a referendum organised by the Serbian parallel structures and that they claimed was inspired by Belgrade. It said that the referendum was not legal and would have no judicial effect, it would also allegedly not serve the interest of ethnic communities to socially, economically and politically integrate within Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7970%3Areagim-i-ministrise-se-puneve-te-jashtme-per-mbajtjen-e-referendumit-ne-veri-te-kosoves&amp;catid=112%3Alajme&amp;lang=en |title=Ministria e Punëve të Jashtme |website=Mfa.gov.al |date= |accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan Ivanovic, the president of the [[Serbian National Council of Kosovo and Metohija|Serbian National Council of North Kosovo]], criticised Serbia proper for having failed in its Kosovo policy while sticking by the decision to democratically demonstrate the view of the Serbs of north Kosovo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===North Kosovo barricades===
{{main article|North Kosovo crisis}}

The [[Republic of Kosovo]] sought to impose its customs officials in the administrative border crossings with Serbia. Kosovar Serbs, seeking the removal of Republic of Kosovo customs officials, sought to erect roadblocks to make travel difficult for KFOR troops in the area that sought to maintain civil order.

==Question==
{{quotation|Do you accept the institutions of the so-called Republic of Kosovo?&lt;ref name="B92"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{lang-sr|Да ли прихватате институције такозване Републике Косово?}} }}

==Election==
The referendum was held in four municipalities with a [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbian majority]] in the north of Kosovo, with 35,500 eligible voters. Some of the voting papers were also in the Albanian language.

There were 82 voting stations:&lt;ref name="B92"/&gt; 13 in Kosovska Mitrovica, 11 in Zvečan, 25 in Zubin Potok, and 33 in Leposavić.

According to Ljuba Radović, referendum commission's spokesman, there currently was no information on whether ethnic Albanians will take part in the referendum, though three villages (Žaža, Boljetin and Lipa) in the Zvečan municipality, which are of a Kosovar Albanian majority, have said that they will not take part.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Paternalism''' is action limiting a person's or group's liberty or autonomy which is intended to promote their own good.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Gerald, "Paternalism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffrin, Seana. 2000. "Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation". ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 29(3): 205–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

The word paternalism is from the Latin ''pater'' "father" via the adjective ''paternus'' "fatherly", which in Medieval Latin became ''paternalis''. Some, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: "It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood."&lt;ref name=Mill1859&gt;Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) "On Liberty", published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Joel. 1986. ''Harm to Self''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Soft and hard===
Soft Paternalism is the view that paternalism is justified only if an action to be committed is involuntary. [[John Stuart Mill]] gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. We can't tell the person the bridge is damaged as he doesn't speak your language. According to Soft paternalism would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so we could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then we should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes we are entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#Intr |title=Paternalism |author=Gerald Dworkin |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure and impure===
Pure paternalism is paternalism where the person(s) having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Moral and welfare===
Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well being of a person(s) even if their welfare wouldn't improve. For example, it would be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering prostitution is morally corrupting.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

== Criteria for effective paternalism ==
[[Thomas Pogge]] argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World poverty and human rights|date=2008|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4143-0|edition=2nd|url=http://thomaspogge.com/paternalism/|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds. 
*The criteria should be minimally intrusive.
*The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs.
*The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations.{{elucidate|date=March 2015}}

==Opponents==
{{See also|Social engineering (political science)|Nanny state}}
In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argues (against [[Robert Filmer]]) that political and paternal power cannot be identified.

[[John Stuart Mill]] opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In ''On Liberty'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.&lt;ref name=Mill1859/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal [[autonomy]].

==In society==

In the southern [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of [[slavery]]. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses' protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved's counterpart in the factory-based north.&lt;ref&gt;Erin R. Mulligan, “Paternalism and the Southern Hierarchy: How Slaves Defined Antebellum Southern Women,” Armstrong Undergraduate ''Journal of History'' 2, no. 2, August 2012 [https://www.armstrong.edu/history-journal/history-journal-paternalism-and-the-southern-hierarchy-how-slavery-defined]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this conclusion, often the whites would manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.edu/historia/Cole.pdf|title=The Excuse of Paternalism in the Antebellum South: Ideology or Practice?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternalism was also used against [[Women's Suffrage]], with opponents of women's suffrage saying that granting women the right to vote would make their lives harder and separate them from their families.

'''''People Just Do Nothing''''' is a British television [[mockumentary]] sitcom, created and performed by Allan Mustafa, Steve Stamp, [[Asim Chaudhry]] and Hugo Chegwin. The programme follows the lives of MC Grindah and DJ Beats, who run '''Kurupt FM''', a [[pirate radio]] station broadcasting [[UK garage]] and [[drum and bass]] from [[Brentford]] in west London. The first series was released on [[BBC Three]] in July 2014, with the fifth and final series airing on [[BBC Two]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/tv/people-just-do-nothing-series-five/355383|title=One of the funniest TV shows of recent years has been renewed for a final season|date=1 May 2018|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the show won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award and [[Royal Television Society]] award for Best Scripted Comedy.&lt;ref name=nme&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/tv/bafta-tv-awards-2017-full-winners-list-2072034 BAFTA TV Awards 2017: Full winners' list]. NME.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rts/&gt; The four main actors have also formed a musical act that tours in character as "Kurupt FM".

==Premise==
''People Just do Nothing'' is a [[mockumentary]], in which the characters give interviews to the camera and are taped in a loose, documentary fashion. An off-screen interviewer is occasionally heard. The "documentary" follows the fortunes of "Kurupt FM", a [[pirate radio]] station broadcasting [[UK Garage]] from a flat in [[Brentford]], west London. The main characters are MC Grindah, DJ Beats, DJ Steves, and their entrepreneurial manager, Chabuddy G. The show follows their personal lives, with a strong focus on their relationships with their respective female partners such as Miche and Roche.

All of the characters have an inflated sense of their own talent and success; Steve Stamp, who portrays Steves, said "A lot of talented people don’t have enough confidence, but then there’s a lot of stupid people with no talent who have loads of confidence ... All our characters are super confident; they’re just not good at what they do."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The characters fail to recognise their lowly status, with Grindah regularly making comments like "We're going global, but you will very much have to be in the Brentford area to hear us."&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The show plays off of their stupidity; Rachel Aroesti of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has said, "Every character is really, quite comfortingly, dense, and their inability to read scenarios correctly is the source of nearly all the comedy."&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt; The show was summarised by Jamie Clifton of ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' as:
{{quote|You don't need to know anything about garage to get it; the humour is in the hopelessness. Most of the principal characters are completely deluded in some way – Chabuddy, who believes his wife loves him, when she clearly does not. Or Grindah, who claims to reign over all MCs from a pirate station that only broadcasts five miles into London. You laugh at their failures, but it's a weird kind of [[schadenfreude]] because every character is so endearing you want them to succeed, not relentlessly embarrass themselves in front of a TV crew.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;}}

==Cast and characters==
* '''Allan Mustafa''' as '''Anthony "MC Grindah" Zagrafos''', the [[Emceeing|MC]] and founder/leader of the [[radio station]]. 
* '''Hugo Chegwin''' as '''Kevin "DJ Beats" Bates''', the principal [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. Beats is a loyal friend of Grindah, but is sometimes mistreated by him.
* '''[[Asim Chaudhry]]''' as '''Chabuddy G/Charlie''', a failed local entrepreneur. Enthusiastic and ambitious but severely deluded, his hare-brained ideas usually bring chaos to the group.
* '''Steve Stamp''' as '''Steven "Steves" Green''', a dim-witted habitual drug user and the runt of the litter at Kurupt FM. His grandmother originally owns the flat from which the station broadcasts.
* '''Lily Brazier''' as '''Michelle Louise "Miche" Zagrafos (née Coleman)''', Grindah's girlfriend and, later, wife. She works at a hair salon, and idly dreams of becoming a famous model.
* '''Olivia Jasmine Edwards''' as '''Angel''', Miche's young daughter.  Grindah accepts Angel as his daughter, but it is implied she was fathered by Decoy. Portrayed by Licia Hedlund-Green in the pilot.
* '''Daniel Sylvester Woolford''' as '''Decoy''', a friend of Grindah and Beats and also a DJ at the radio station. It is implied that Decoy is the biological father of Miche's daughter Angel.
* '''[[Ruth Bratt]]''' as '''Roche''', Beats' girlfriend, a security guard at a local cash and carry. Roche loves Beats but is averse to the radio station, and to Grindah.
* '''George Keywood''' as '''Craig''', Roche's son from a former marriage, a lazy teenager who spends most of his time at home playing [[Call of Duty]].
* '''Maria Louis''' as '''Aldona''', Chabuddy's unloving wife from Poland (series 1 – 2). Portrayed by Magda Rogoz in the pilot.
* '''[[Victoria Alcock]]''' as '''Carol''', Miche's mum.

===Conception===

The four main actors were friends for years before they began making the show. They were brought together through Hugo Chegwin; he had known Steve Stamp since childhood, became friends with Asim Chaudhry at college, and met Allan Mustafa through a mutual friend. They all had experience [[DJ]]ing or [[MC]]ing on [[pirate radio]] in their youth, and no ambition to be actors. Mustafa said, "I rapped at the time, but we never really ended up making music. We just watched ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' a lot and smoked weed."&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; In the late 2000s, Chegwin and Stamp had a "fake garage crew" on a real station called KuruptFM. Chegwin and Mustafa began creating characters and filming them, and were further inspired when they watched the BBC documentary series ''[[Tower Block Dreams]]'', about London's [[underground music]] scene, and found the participants amusing. MC Grindah was based on a pirate radio boss from the series. Stamp and Chaudhry became involved, and the foursome began improvising material and putting it on [[YouTube]] under the name "Wasteman TV".&lt;ref name=vice&gt;{{cite web|title=We Visited the Set of 'People Just Do Nothing' Series Three|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/kw97jn/people-just-do-nothing-set-visit-interview-kurupt-fm|website=Vice|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; 

The YouTube videos were seen by producer Jon Petrie, who worked with [[Ash Atalla]] – a former producer for ''The Office'' – at [[Roughcut TV]].  Petrie later explained, "It wasn't fully-formed, but the more you watched it, the more you could see there was proper detail to the characters. I had no idea about [[UK Garage|garage]], really, but I just loved them as comic creations." Atalla arranged to produce a pilot episode for [[BBC Three]], released in August 2012. The pilot was the most shared video on [[iPlayer]] that month, and the BBC ordered a full series.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;

Many journalists have commented that the show is heavily influenced by ''The Office''. David Renshaw has said, "At times, Grindah’s delusion in relation to his own success, talent and likeability is a mortifying dance away from full [[David Brent]]."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Chabuddy G has been described as "an Asian [[Del Boy]]", of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; The actors have named their primary influences as ''The Office'', ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'', [[Alan Partridge]], [[Ali G]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Mike Leigh]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

===Writing and filming===

Writing credits go to Allan Mustafa and Steve Stamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘People Just Do Nothing’: 11 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Kurupt FM|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/people-just-do-nothing-kurupt-fm-bbc-three-series_uk_5992fe19e4b08a2472775ec2|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the cast are given freedom to improvise their dialogue and sometimes film scenes spontaneously.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; By the third series, Mustafa estimated that material was "70/30 percent improvised". Chaudhry explained, "When you've been doing a character for six years, you can just snap into it – you know how they'd react in any situation", adding that he is continuously inspired by his father, "because he's like a real Chabuddy G, just not as ridiculous".&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; The dialogue is often heavy with [[London slang#Modern influences|21st century London slang]]. Much of the filming took place at Chesterton Court on the [[South Acton, London|South Acton]] housing estate, before it was demolished.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; Series three was shot in [[Peckham]], south-east London.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; All locations are based on the Haverfield Estate in Brentford, where Chegwin and Stamps grew up.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/people-just-do-nothing-how-bbc3s-latest-comedy-started-with-a-series-ofyoutube-webisodes-10386171.html|title=People Just Do Nothing: How BBC3's latest comedy started with a series|author=John Hind|date=13 July 2015|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===

''People Just do Nothing'' has received positive reviews. After the release of the first series, Alex Fletcher of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' called it "the best British comedy in years", and lamented that few people were aware of its "comedic genius". He added, "it packs in more genuine belly laughs in one episode than most recent sitcoms have done in their full lifetime, and [has] nailed that quintessential British sense of humour where we're able to laugh at our own humiliating inadequacies ...  it feels like it belongs in the company of modern comedy greats such as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' and ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''."&lt;ref name=ds&gt;{{cite web|title=People Just Do Nothing: The best British comedy in years is on iPlayer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a583701/people-just-do-nothing-the-best-british-comedy-in-years-is-on-iplayer/|website=Digital Spy|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard O'Donovan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the pilot episode four stars out of five, and said, "Entertaining, and absolutely of its time, ''People Just Do Nothing'' certainly serves up some good laughs and I look forward to the next three parts."&lt;ref name=tgraph&gt;{{cite web|title=People Just Do Nothing, BBC iPlayer, review: 'impressive'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10828816/People-Just-Do-Nothing-BBC-iPlayer-review-impressive.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second series, David Renshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said it was "a welcome return from the gang", and commented "Despite its larger-than-life characters, ''People Just Do Nothing''’s success lies in its believability ... You get the feeling that if you drove out to Brentford you might actually run in to them." He especially praised the comedy provided by DJ Steves and Chabuddy G.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|title=Farcical, larger than life – and totally believable: have you been watching People Just Do Nothing? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/12/have-you-been-watching-people-just-do-nothing|website=The Guardian|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Aroesti, also of ''The Guardian'', said "the episode where Grindah panics after taking [[ecstasy (drug)|a pill]] at his club night has good claim to be the comic highlight of 2015".&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite web|title=Bare jokes: how People Just Do Nothing made sitcoms funny again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/22/how-people-just-do-nothing-made-sitcoms-funny-again|website=The Guardian|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aroesti gave the third series a highly positive review: "In an age of bleak comedy that barely makes you snigger, one show has been keeping up the lost art of making people laugh – the hilarious, half-witted pirate radio mockumentary." She added, "[the show] is not an old-fashioned sitcom by any stretch – it’s understated, meta and set in a niche subculture – but it is truly traditional in its comedy: beats are hit and joke quotas filled, scene in, scene out." She appreciated that the series also "decided to go for the dramatic jugular. The final episode of this series offered fans a precious opportunity to laugh and cry at exactly the same time ... By making you care about the characters (even the monstrosity that is MC Grindah – a David Brent with malicious intent), viewers will now have two reasons for tuning in."&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt;

==Kurupt FM live==
The four main actors, along with "Decoy" and "Fantasy", tour nightclubs and music venues as "Kurupt FM", where they appear in character. They have also played music festivals including [[Glastonbury festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Reading and Leeds]]. Mustafa said in 2016, "We all wanted to be musicians when we were younger. So now, in a way, it's like we're living out what we didn't get to do, playing all these festivals. We get two sick jobs: we get to film and we get to fuck around on stage and be headliners." Stamp added, "And because we're in character, we can sort of get away with whatever. Like my shit mixing; it's because I'm Steves, not because I'm a shit DJ." On-stage guests have included [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] artists [[Stormzy]] and [[Big Narstie]].&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;

'''Protective laws''' were [[Coming into force|enacted]] to protect [[Woman|women]] from certain hazards or difficulties of paid work. These [[law]]s had the effect of reducing the employment available to women, saving it for men. These were enacted in many [[United States|U.S.]] jurisdictions and some were in effect until the mid or late 20th century. The [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] case ''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'' set a [[precedent]] to use [[Sex differences in humans|sex differences]] as a basis for separate legislation.&lt;ref name="baron"/&gt;

The name is not a formal one, but is a widely used colloquial term, as was the term ''protective legislation''.&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present'' (N.Y.; Modern Library, 1st ed. 2010 ({{ISBN|978-0-679-64314-2}})), p. 197 (''protective legislation'' as term).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=all}}

== Range of laws ==
Over a thousand laws affected work hours, wages, occupational choice, mandatory seating, homework, and rights to do business and make contracts.&lt;ref name="JaneGrant-Confession-pp688690"&gt;Grant, Jane, ''Confession of a Feminist'', in ''[[The American Mercury]]'', vol. LVII, no. 240, December , 1943, pp. 684–691, esp. pp. 688–690.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, various laws required a [[history of the minimum wage|minimum wage]] for women and children&lt;ref name="GreedLustGender-p276andn37"&gt;Folbre, Nancy, ''Greed, Lust and Gender: A History of Economic Ideas'' (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-923842-2}})), p. 276 &amp; n. 37 (author prof. economics, Univ. of Mass. Amherst).&lt;/ref&gt; (criticized because women allegedly did not need the money, the [[minimum wage]] was opposed for men and ruled unlawful in 1923)&lt;ref name="GreedLustGender-p276andn37" /&gt; and forbade or regulated lifting heavy loads, working at night or for long hours, or tending [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197"&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise'', ''op. cit.'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; and required some safety and breaks from work for rest, lunch, and bathroom use.&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise'', ''op. cit.'', p. 197 &amp; n. 51, citing Cobble, Dorothy Sue, ''The Other Women's Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America'' (Princeton, N.J., 2004), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on long hours often denied the possibility of earning overtime pay.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt; Some of the laws were irrelevant to work but were intended to protect women's ability to become mothers and not be subject to sexual issues often categorized as moral issues.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt;

== Rationale for passage ==
Protection of women was a rationale for the enactment of the laws. Women were considered more vulnerable than men in factories and sweatshops, and one supporter of the laws was the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|Amalgamated Clothing Workers]], a labor organization, which supported the laws for nonmembers of unions.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt; Some supporters in unions and women's organizations, concerned that courts in the 1950s would oppose pro-labor legislation generally, wanted to preserve whatever such laws were already in place.&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise'', ''op. cit.'', p. 197 n. 52, citing Peterson, ''The Kennedy Commission'', in Tinker, Irene, ed., ''Women in Washington: Advocates for Public Policy'' (Beverly Hills, Calif., 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, however, the year the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution passed the Congress and was proposed to the states for ratification, unions supported the ERA and considered female-only protective laws as against women's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise'', ''op. cit.'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rationale was put forth by an organization which, in 1836, adopted a resolution that said, "Whereas, Labor is a physical and moral injury to women and a ''competitive menace to men'', we recommend legislation to restrict women in industry."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jane, ''Confession of a Feminist'', in ''[[The American Mercury]]'', vol. LVII, no. 240, December , 1943, pp. 684–691, esp. pp. 688–690 (quotations per p. 689 (italics in Jane Grant's article)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum wage was supported except for men because of "widespread agreement that the labor market did not function effectively where women and the family were concerned"&lt;ref name="GreedLustGender-p276"&gt;Folbre, Nancy, ''Greed, Lust and Gender'', ''op. cit.'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; and among feminists because women needed to support their own dependents.&lt;ref name="GreedLustGender-p276" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
They were criticized on several grounds.
* They failed to require protection from the hazards or difficulties for all workers who needed those protections.
* They denied jobs to women who did not need the protections at all, or who needed the jobs more than the protections and could make that choice.
* Many denied jobs rather than required changes, either at the workplaces or elsewhere, that would have reduced any reason for protection.
* Few, if any, of these laws applied to women's unpaid work at home or with families, which could be more hazardous or difficult than some of the restricted employments.
* While some women may have advocated for such laws, many were put into effect when women did not have [[Suffrage|the vote]] or the right to hold electoral office,&lt;ref name="JaneGrant-Confession-pp688690" /&gt; so the people ultimately responsible for legislating them were almost exclusively [[Man|men]], and they were responding to voters who were men.
* The laws disincentivized employers from hiring women.

Protective labor laws were criticized because they excluded women from prestigious, well-paid male-dominated occupations and confined women's work to the home, thus reinforcing [[Separate Spheres]] ideology and the [[Cult of Domesticity]].&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baron | first1=Ava | title= Protective Labor Legislation and the Cult of Domesticity| journal=[[Journal of Family Issues]] | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=25&amp;ndash;38 | year=1981 | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | doi=10.1177/0192513X8100200103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opponent of these laws was the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), which, at the time, led support for the Equal Rights Amendment. The NWP opposed the laws as interfering with women's right to make contracts and as preventing them from offering their full capabilities at work, objecting, for example, to a 20-pound limit on lifting, if a woman wanted that job and could lift the weight.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt;

== Modernity ==
Eventually, most or all were amended, [[repeal]]ed, ruled unconstitutional (i.e., in violation of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and thus invalid), or not enforced anymore because they singled women out for unequal treatment. (Laws in the U.S. may not be enforced if they are unconstitutional or otherwise unauthorized in law.) Had the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the Constitution been enacted in the 1970s–1980s, it was believed these laws would have been invalidated by the amendment and subsequent litigation&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt; and, as a result, most liberal organizations opposed the Amendment.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt; The laws had been supported by social feminists for decades previously.&lt;ref name="FeministPromise-p197" /&gt;

Some of the laws have been replaced by laws that apply to both genders, such as the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]].

An argument for protective laws still sometimes arises, as with debates over the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military's]] continuing legal ban on women in certain combat positions, when it is [[Women in the military#Contemporary debate|argued that the ban should remain in effect]] because women might be killed or raped.

== Worldwide ==
Nations other than the U.S., in modern times, may have laws with comparable intent or effect and that constrain employment of women or of other groups of adults defined by characteristics at birth, although the laws may not be called by the same name.

In [[Egypt]], in c. the 1920s, the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]] advocated for protective legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Badran, Margot, ''Feminism in Islam: Secular and Religious Convergences'' (Oxford, Eng.: Oneworld, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-85168-556-1}})), p. 124 (author sr. fellow, Ctr. for Muslim Christian Understanding, Georgetown Univ., U.S., &amp; fellow, Woodrow Wilson International Ctr. for Scholars, Washington, D.C.).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revenue stamps of Northern Ireland''' refer to the various [[revenue stamp|revenue or fiscal stamps]], whether adhesive, [[impressed duty stamp|directly embossed]] or otherwise, which were issued by and used in [[Northern Ireland]], a constituent country of the [[United Kingdom]]. From 1774, various [[revenue stamps of Ireland]] were used throughout both Northern and Southern Ireland, while [[revenue stamps of the United Kingdom]] were also used to pay for some taxes and fees.

Upon the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921, separate revenue stamps began to be issued for both Northern Ireland and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]]. The latter were withdrawn soon afterwards upon the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]], but the former continued to issue revenue stamps until the late 20th century. The need for separate issues for Northern Ireland came about since taxes raised there were meant to remain in the country. Most Northern Irish revenue stamps were [[Revenue stamps of the United Kingdom#Key types|British key types]] with appropriate inscriptions, but there were a number of different issues as well.

==Key types==
[[File:1948 Northern Ireland dog licence stamp.jpg|thumb|1/- Dog Licence Registration stamp, overprinted on a [[George V]] Petty Sessions key type]]

The vast majority of Northern Ireland revenue stamps were [[Revenue stamps of the United Kingdom#Key types|British key types]] additionally inscribed ''NORTHERN IRELAND''. In 1921, stamps were issued for Bankruptcy, Civil Service, Companies Registration, Contract Note, County Courts, Estate Duty, Foreign Bill, Judicature, Land Commission, Land Registry, Official Arbitration, Petty Sessions (including overprints for Dog Licence) and Registration of Deeds.&lt;ref name="barefoot139–146"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=139–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the 1921 issues depicted the reigning monarch, King [[George V]], but some Contract Note and Petty Sessions stamps depicting King [[Edward VII]] were also issued, since they were printed on older stocks.&lt;ref name="barefoot139–146"/&gt; 

Later issues depicted the then-current monarch, King [[George VI]] and later Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. Until 1950, Registration of Deeds stamps simply inscribed ''IRELAND'' were still being issued, but these were only valid in Northern Ireland. Upon decimalization in 1971, stamps were issued for Bankruptcy, Contract Note, County Court, Dog Licence, Judicature Fee, Land Registry, Petty Sessions and Registration of Deeds. These were withdrawn gradually, for example Dog Licence stamps were discontinued in 1983.&lt;ref name="barefoot139–146"/&gt;

==Other issues==
Apart from key types, Northern Ireland also issued overprints on a few British or Irish issues. In the 1920s, overprints were produced on British [[Excise stamp]]s&lt;ref name="revrevd-excise"/&gt; and Foreign Bill key types, as well as on Irish Dog Licence stamps depicting the [[Irish wolfhound]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, many National Insurance stamps of Great Britain were also overprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of excise stamps depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]] were also issued in around the 1930s. These were the only adhesive revenues which had a distinctive design specifically used for Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="revrevd-excise"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McClellan |first1=Andrew |title=Great Britain and Ireland Excise Revenue |url=https://www.revrevd.com/gb-and-ireland-excise.html |website=Revenue Reverend |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zoILUiHD |archivedate=30 May 2018 |date=2016–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[impressed duty stamp]]s were used in Northern Ireland, including both general-duty issues and those for specific purposes. Many of these bore both symbols typical of impressed stamps of the United Kingdom such as the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor Crown]], along with exclusively Irish symbols such as the [[shamrock]]. Some issues depicted the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] or the Red Hand of Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23886">In politics, the '''"revolving door"''' is a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators, on one hand, and members of the industries affected by the legislation and regulation, on the other.&lt;ref group=note&gt;It also includes the movement of government personnel into [[lobbying]] firms working for these industries, and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to refer to the constant switching and ousting of political leaders from offices such as the [[Prime Minister]] of [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]

In some cases, the roles are performed in sequence, but in certain circumstances they may be performed at the same time. Political analysts claim that an unhealthy relationship can develop between the [[private sector]] and government, based on the granting of reciprocated privileges to the detriment of the nation, and can lead to [[regulatory capture]].

==Overview==
[[File:Revolving doors of Grafton Capital Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|The metaphor of a ''revolving door'' has been used to describe people switching jobs, from working as lawmakers, to being lobbyists, and vice versa.]]
Governments hire industry professionals for their private sector experience, their influence within corporations that the government is attempting to regulate or do business with, and in order to gain political support (donations and endorsements) from private firms.

Industry, in turn, hires people out of government positions to gain personal access to government officials, seek favorable legislation/regulation and government contracts in exchange for high-paying employment offers, and get inside information on what is going on in government.

The [[lobbying]] industry is especially affected by the revolving door concept, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials. This industrial climate is attractive for ex-government officials. It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for the lobbying firms and government projects and contracts in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Timothy J.

==Jurisdictions==
Regulation relating to this phenomenon and the related issues of [[lobbying]] and the funding of political parties varies considerably around the world. Here are details for a few sample jurisdictions:-

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], this is of significant public debate as many state leaders have become private consultants for corporations. There is no legislation against doing so.

===European Union===

According to a report by [[Transparency International]] - EU Office, which analysed the career paths of 485 former Members of the [[European Parliament]] and 27 former European Commissioners, the revolving door phenomenon is present at the EU level as well. The report ''Access All Areas''&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International EU (2017) ''Access All Areas''. Available at http://transparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Access-all-areas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; finds that 30% of the 161 MEPs who left politics for other employment were employed by organisations which were registered on the EU Transparency Register at the start of 2017. At the same time, the report found that 15 out of 27 Commissioners who finished their service in 2014 entered employment with organisations on the EU lobby register after the end of their 18-month cooling-off period. The report also notes that the regulatory framework surrounding the revolving door phenomenon in the [[European Union]] could be improved by a stronger ethics framework, notably an independent ethics body which would decide which professional activities are subject to a conflict of interest. 

=== France===
A law in the penal code of [[France]] governing public officials who move between the public and private sectors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006418525&amp;dateTexte=20090329 "Article 432-13 du code pénal"] Légifrance, service public de la diffusion du droit. Retrieved March 6, 2011 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires a three-year wait between working in the government and taking a job in the private sector.

=== Hong Kong ===
The appointment of [[Leung Chin-man]] as executive director of [[New World China Land]] in 2008 led to [[Leung Chin-man appointment controversy|much controversy]]. Leung was previously a senior civil servant and [[administrative service|administrative officer]] in charge of lands. His appointment as an executive director of a subsidiary of [[New World Development|a land developer]] led to allegations of collusion of interests and delayed interests. He resigned after two weeks, and the territory's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] had, for years, an inquiry into the matter.

===Japan===
&lt;!---this subsection was merged from [[amakudari]] article which now redirects here---&gt;
{{Nihongo|Amakudari|天下り|amakudari|"descent from heaven"}} is the institutionalized practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice was increasingly viewed as corrupt and a drag on unfastening the ties between private sector and state which prevent economic and political reforms.

In April 2007, a law to phase out amakudari prohibits ministries from attempting to place bureaucrats in industry with implementation in 2009. However, the law also removed a two-year ban that prevented retiring officials from taking jobs with companies with which they had official dealings during the five years before retirement.

====Definition====
The term's literal meaning, "descent from heaven," refers to the descent of the [[Shinto]] gods from heaven to earth; the modern usage employs it as a metaphor, where "heaven" refers to the upper echelons of the civil service, the civil servants are the deities, and the earth is the private-sector corporations
In amakudari, senior civil servants retire to join organizations linked with or under the jurisdiction of their ministries or agencies when they reach mandatory retirement age, usually between 50 and 60 in the public service. The former officials may collude with their former colleagues to help their new employers secure government contracts, avoid regulatory inspections and generally secure preferential treatment from the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "'Amakudari' landed 646 as pension fund execs", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 March 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amakudari may also be a reward for preferential treatment provided by officials to their new employers during their term in the civil service. Some government organisations are said to be expressly maintained for the purpose of hiring retiring bureaucrats and paying them high salaries at taxpayers' expense.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070414a3.html Amakudari crackdown called toothless, poll ploy], ''Japan Times'', 14 April 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the strictest meaning of amakudari, bureaucrats retire into private companies. In other forms bureaucrats move into government corporations (yokosuberi or 'sideslip'), are granted successive public and private sector appointments (wataridori or 'migratory bird') or may become politicians, including becoming [[Diet of Japan|members of parliament]] (seikai tenshin).&lt;ref name="japanesestudies.org.uk"&gt;Richard A. Colignon and Chikako Usui (2003) ''[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Cardwell.html Amakudari: The Hidden Fabric of Japan's Economy]'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-4083-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have identified amakudari as a central feature of Japan's political and economic structure. The practice is thought to bind private and public sector in a tight embrace and prevent political and economic change.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Enigma of Japanese Power]]'', [[Karel van Wolferen]], 1989, {{ISBN|0-679-72802-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Amakudari is widespread in many branches of the Japanese government but is currently subject to government efforts to regulate the practice. Pressure to reduce amakudari retirement to corporations may be leading to an increase in bureaucrats retiring to other public sector organisations instead.

Amakudari was a minor issue before [[World War II]] since government officials could be outplaced to a large number of industrial organization that were nationalized. However, reforms during the [[Occupation of Japan]] eliminated most of these nationalized organizations resulting in a need to outplace individuals to the private sector. Such outplacement is inevitable in a personnel system where traditional [[Confucian]] values prevent one who entered the organization at the same time as another to become his subordinate

A 1990 study suggested that amakudari retirements to large companies by bureaucrats from prominent ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, had peaked in 1985 but that the practice was on the increase by bureaucrats from other types of government organisations such as the National Tax Agency.&lt;ref name="japanesestudies.org.uk" /&gt; As a result, the percentage of former bureaucrats on the boards of private-sector listed companies had remained stable at 2%.

A series of scandals in the mid-1990s focused the media spotlight on amakudari. In the 1994 general contracting (''zenekon'') scandal, corruption was uncovered among bureaucrats associated with building contractors, leading to the jailing of high-ranking politician [[Shin Kanemaru]] for tax evasion. In the mortgage scandal of 1996, Japanese housing lenders went on a lending spree and racked up bad debts worth 6 trillion yen ($65.7 billion) sparking a financial crisis. The industry was supposed to be regulated by the Ministry of Finance, but the presence of its former officials in top jobs at the lenders is thought to have deflected oversight.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Otsuma, Ken Ellis, Todd Zaun, Andrew Morse, and Norie Kuboyama [http://www.jpri.org/publications/critiques/critique_III_2.html "Japan's Housing Lenders' Crisis"], Japan Policy Research Institute, JPRI Critique Vol. III No. 2: February 1996. Accessed 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until the next decade that Japanese prime ministers responded with policies to limit amakudari, although it is unclear whether these policies are having any effect. In July 2002, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] ordered that strict ''amakudari'' be ended, because of its association with corruption between business and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200207/23/eng20020723_100198.shtml "Japanese Government to Review 'Amakudari' Practice"], ''People's Daily'', July 23, 2002. Accessed 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Koizumi's successor, Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] enacted new rules as part of a policy pledge to completely eradicate amakudari in 2007, but his reforms were criticised as toothless (see below) and a campaign ploy for Upper House elections in July 2007.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707260104.html Editorial:Constitutional revision], ''Asahi Shimbun'', 26 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

While policy has focused on limiting amakudari to private companies, the number of bureaucrats retiring to jobs at other government organisations (''yokosuberi'' or "sideslip") has surged reaching 27,882 appointments in 2006 up 5,789 on the previous year. These organisations, numbering 4,576, received 98 percent of the expenses for state projects without being subject to the bidding processes faced by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200703310086.htm l5,789 more 'amakudari' positions filled], ''Asahi Shimbun'', 31 March 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 50 years ending in 2010, 68 high-level government bureaucrats have taken jobs with electricity suppliers after retirement from their government positions. In 2011, 13 retired government bureaucrats were employed in senior positions in Japanese electric utilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110504a1.html Utilities got 68 ex-bureaucrats via 'amakudari']", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 May 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
Amakudari is subject to rules which were revised in April 2007 in response to corruption scandals. Under the new rules, ministries are instructed to slowly stop helping bureaucrats land new jobs over three years starting in 2009. Instead, a job center to be set up by the end of 2008 would take on the role, and government agencies and ministries will be prohibited from brokering new jobs for retirees.

However, the law removed a two-year ban that prevented retiring officials from taking jobs with companies with which they had official dealings during the five years before retirement, which may increase amakudari. It also left considerable loopholes, including not placing restrictions on ''watari'' in which retired bureaucrats move from one organization to another. Bureaucrats could retire to a job at another government agency, and then switch jobs to a private company later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707240089.html Editorial: Civil service reform], ''Asahi Shimbun'', 24 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that the government could better prevent Amakudari by raising the retirement age for bureaucrats above 50.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp" /&gt;

In October 2006, 339 public entities were violating the guidelines concerning amakudari, a figure 38 times higher than the number for the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707170517.html 339 entities violate 'amakudari' rules], ''Asahi Shimbun'', 17 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declined to 166 by July 2007.

====Impact====
As well as scandals, the effects of amakudari have been documented by a sizable body of research.

Some studies find that amakudari promotes more risky business activities. A 2001 study found that banks with amakudari employees were found to behave ''less'' prudently the more retired civil servants they employed (measured by the capital-asset ratio, an indicator of the prudential behaviour of banks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://swopec.hhs.se/eijswp/abs/eijswp0136.htm Effect of Amakudari on Bank Performance in the Post-Bubble Period], Kenji Suzuki, Scandinavian Working Papers in Economics, No 136, 1 November 2001, retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies find that companies with amakudari employees are subjected to less oversight by public agencies. Around 70 percent of public contracts awarded to organisations that employed hired retired bureaucrats through amakudari were given without a bidding process in 2005. The contracts were worth a total 233 billion yen. By contrast 18 percent of private companies that didn't have ex-bureaucrats on the payroll got contracts without bidding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200706250076.html Firms with amakudari ties win government projects with no bids], ''Asahi Shimbun'', 25 June 2007, retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
There is no major legislation against revolving door practices in [[New Zealand]], but some ''ad hoc'' provisions exist in relation to certain industries. For example, a scandal in which MP [[Taito Phillip Field]] was jailed for corruption in relation to improper use of his government position to benefit from helping people with immigration applications was influential in the creation of a restraint of trade clause in the Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007. The Act prohibits Ministers of Immigration, Associate Ministers of Immigration and immigration officials from becoming a licensed immigration adviser for one year after leaving government employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0015/latest/DLM407316 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140225/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0015/latest/DLM407316 |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Lobbying in the United Kingdom}}
The movement of senior civil servants and government ministers into business roles is overseen by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA), but it is not a statutory body and has only advisory powers. The Channel Four Dispatches programme 'Cabs for Hire', broadcast in early 2010, which showed several sitting [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|members of Parliament]] and former ministers offering their influence and contacts in an effort to get lobbying jobs, has generated renewed concern about this issue. A Transparency International UK report on the subject, published in May 2011, called for ACOBA to be replaced by a statutory body with greater powers to regulate the post-public employment of former ministers and crown servants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org.uk/publications/140-cabs-for-hire-fixing-the-revolving-door-between-government-and-business/download 'Cabs for Hire?

Retrieved 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It also argued that the committee should be more representative of society.

"Under current law, government officials who make contracting decisions must either wait a year before joining a military contractor or, if they want to switch immediately, must start in an affiliate or division unrelated to their government work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">A '''settlement conference''' is a meeting between opposing sides of a [[lawsuit]] at which the parties attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of their dispute without having to proceed to a [[trial (law)|trial]]. Such a conference may be initiated through either party, usually by the conveyance of a [[settlement offer]]; or it may be ordered by the [[court]] as a precedent (preliminary step) to holding a trial. Each party, the [[plaintiff]] and the [[defendant]], is usually represented at the ''settlement conference'' by their own [[counsel]] or [[Lawyer|attorney]]. Conferences are frequently conducted by a judge or other neutral party, in the form of a [[mediation]].

==Case conference==
In many courts in the [[common law]] system, a '''case conference''' may be used to settle a case.

In some courts, the rules require that before certain types of motions or petitions will be heard by the judge, the lawyers must "meet and confer" to try to resolve the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/meet+and+confer Legal dictionary article on "Meet and confer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreclosure Pre-foreclosure Settlement Conferences==
On December 1, 2008, the New York State Unified Court System began sending notices to borrowers in default who have high cost mortgages, whose mortgages were being foreclosed prior to September 1, 2008, offering voluntary settlement conferences. Borrowers with high cost mortgages whose mortgages entered or are entering into foreclosure from September 2008 on, will be required to attend a mandatory settlement conference prior to foreclosure proceedings. High cost loans are considered to have excessive fees, risk-based sub-prime percentage rates, negative amortizing payment options, and other features which may or may not be considered predatory lending practices.

On December 15, 2009, [[Governor David Paterson]] signed into law an expanded version of the mandatory settlement conference legislation. Section 3408 of the [[Civil Practice Law and Rules|Civil Practice Law and Rules of New York]] now provides that the court shall hold a mandatory settlement conference for all loans for one to four family homes within sixty days following the date proof of service is filed with the county clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/hetpinf6.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217234434/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/hetpinf6.htm |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law also provides that both the defendant homeowner and the plaintiff lender negotiate in good faith during their mandated settlement conference. The plaintiff lender is required to have a representative or attorney appear at the settlement conference with the authority to fully negotiate and settle the matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1724&amp;context=plr&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreclosure proceedings are effectively stopped until the referee or judicial hearing officer (JHO) in the settlement conference determines that the settlement conferences are concluded, either because the parties have successfully modified the home loan or obtained some other foreclosure alternative or the referee has determined that one of the parties has not satisfied its requirements under the law. Settlement conferences do not produce formal dispositions but may facilitate loan modifications and stop foreclosure. The referee or JHO will make a recommendation to the judge overseeing the foreclosure proceedings once the settlement conference is concluded.

'''''Sherbert v. Verner''''', 374 U.S. 398 (1963), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] required the government to demonstrate both a compelling interest and that the law in question was narrowly tailored before it denied unemployment compensation to someone who was fired because her job requirements substantially conflicted with her religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Sherbert v. Verner|374|398|1963}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case established the ''Sherbert'' Test, requiring demonstration of such a compelling interest and narrow tailoring in all Free Exercise cases in which a religious person was substantially burdened by a law. The conditions are the key components of what is usually called [[strict scrutiny]].

In 1990, the Supreme Court decided that the Sherbert Test, as a judicial constitutional analysis tool, was too broad when applied to all laws. With respect to religiously-neutral, generally-applicable laws that incidentally burden religious exercise, the Sherbert Test was eliminated in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Employment Division v. Smith|link=|volume=494|page=872|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For laws that discriminate along religious/secular lines or neutral laws that are enforced in a discriminatory way, the components of the Sherbert Test are still appropriate constitutional tools for courts to use.

In response to the 1990 ''Smith'' decision, Congress created an enhanced version of the Sherbert Test as a statutory, rather than constitutional, right in the federal [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993. Its provisions were designed to apply broadly to all laws and regulations, both federal and state. Although Congress replaced the "narrowly tailored" constitutional requirement with a "least restrictive means" statutory requirement, the enhanced test is still referred to as the Sherbert Test.

However, the Supreme Court held in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' that the law was unconstitutional because its enhanced Sherbert Test, as a purported change in constitutional rights, could not be enforced against the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=City of Boerne v. Flores|link=|volume=521|page=507|pin=|year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It impermissibly interfered with the judiciary's sole power to interpret the Constitution. However, the ruling did not necessarily limit its effect on interpretation of federal statutes.

In 2000, Congress passed the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA) that applied only to federal laws  Both laws contain the same language for an even further enhanced Sherbert Test, one that broadens the definition of substantial religious burden.

The Supreme Court has since relied on the statutory Sherbert Test to decide several prominent cases, including ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby]]'', {{Ussc|573|___|2014|el=no}}, and ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal]],'' 546 U.S. 418 (2006).

==Background of the case==
Adell Sherbert, a member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], worked as a textile-mill operator. Two years after her conversion to that faith, her employer switched from a five-day to a six-day workweek, including Saturdays. Since according to her belief, God in Exodus 20:8-11 forbade working on Saturdays (seventh day is the [[Sabbath in Christianity#Seventh-day (Saturday) Sabbatarianism|Sabbath]]), she refused to work that day and was fired. Sherbert could not find any other work and applied for unemployment compensation. Her claim was denied, even though the state's ineligibility provisions exempted anyone, whether religious or not, "for good cause."  The Employment Security Commission's decision was affirmed by a state trial court and the South Carolina Supreme Court.

==The court's decision==
The Supreme Court in a 7-2 decision reversed the Commission and the lower courts, finding that, as applied, the government's denial of Sherbert's claim was an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of her religion. The majority opinion effectively created the ''Sherbert'' Test, determining whether government action runs afoul of the Free Exercise Clause.

===Brennan's majority opinion===
Brennan, writing for the majority, stated that denial of Sherbert's unemployment claim represented a substantial burden upon her. Even if that burden took the form of denial of a privilege to unemployment compensation, instead of violating compensation she was entitled to by right, it still effectively impeded her free exercise of her religion. As Brennan wrote, "to condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties." Brennan dismissed the claim that his decision violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] by establishing the Seventh-day Adventist religion. Finally, the majority opinion did not consider the [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] argument, since it had already ruled in Sherbert's favor on First Amendment grounds.

===Douglas and Stewart's concurring opinions===
Douglas wrote separately to explain that the issue was not the degree of injury to Sherbert, but South Carolina's denial of unemployment on the basis of her beliefs. The issue was not individual action, but government action, and under what basis government could deny someone benefits.

Stewart concurred in the result, but not in the majority's reasoning. He did not dismiss the Establishment Clause issue as the majority did. Instead, he identified as a "double-barreled dilemma" between Free Exercise Clause protection of Sherbert's actions and — as it had been interpreted, wrongly in his view, by the court — Establishment Clause prohibition of such protection. He also disagreed with the majority's claim that a cited precedent, ''[[Braunfeld v. Brown]]'', was distinguishable from ''Sherbert''.

===Harlan's dissenting opinion===
Harlan, in a characteristically formalist reading of the relevant law, argued that the Commission denied Sherbert unemployment based on the same reason they might any secular claimant, that she was not "available for work" because of a private decision she had made.  More centrally, he rejected the majority opinion, arguing that the Free Exercise Clause only required neutrality toward religion in this case, which would not include exempting Sherbert, though the Constitution would permit a legislature to create such an exemption.

==The ''Sherbert'' Test==
In ''Sherbert'', the Court set out a three-prong test for courts to use in determining whether the government has violated an individual's constitutionally-protected right to the free exercise of religion.

#The first prong investigates whether government has burdened the individual's free exercise of religion. If government confronts an individual with a choice that pressures the individual to forego a religious practice, whether by imposing a penalty or withholding a benefit, then the government has burdened the individual's free exercise of religion.
#However, under this test not all burdens placed on religious exercise are constitutionally prohibited. If the first prong is passed, the government may still constitutionally impose the burden on the individual's free exercise if the government can show
#*it possesses some [[compelling state interest]] that justifies the infringement (the compelling interest prong); and
#*no alternative form of regulation can avoid the infringement and still achieve the state's end (the [[narrow tailoring]] prong).

==Limiting of the ''Sherbert'' Test==
The Supreme Court sharply curtailed the ''Sherbert'' Test in the 1980s, culminating in the 1990 landmark case ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]''. In ''Smith'', the court held that free exercise exemptions were not required from generally applicable laws. In response to the ''Smith'' decision, Congress passed the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] of 1993 (RFRA) to reinstate the ''Sherbert'' Test as a statutory right. RFRA purported to restore strict scrutiny analysis to all free exercise cases in which the plaintiff proves a substantial burden on the free exercise of his or her religion. However, four years later, the court struck down RFRA as applied to Constitutional interpretation. In ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]],'' 521 U.S. 507 (1997), the court found that RFRA, as applied to the states, exceeded Congress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But the ruling did not necessarily limit RFRA's effect on interpretation of federal statutes. Using a parliamentary procedure known as ''[[unanimous consent]]'', both the House and the Senate re-enacted RFRA's provisions in 2000, in conjunction with adding a similar statutory test to the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA).

Without addressing RFRA's constitutionality, the Supreme Court has held, in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal|Gonzales v. UDV]],'' 546 U.S. 418 (2006), that RFRA applies to other federal statutes. In ''UDV'', the court applied the statutory ''Sherbert'' Test created by RFRA and found that the conduct in question—use of a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug in a religious ritual—was protected under the First Amendment.

[[File:337-338 High Holborn, Staple Inn 01.jpg|thumb|Staple Inn in 2014]]

'''Staple Inn''' is a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] building on the south side of [[High Holborn]] street in the [[City of London]], [[London]], [[England]]. Located near [[Chancery Lane tube station]], it is used as the London venue for meetings of the [[Institute and Faculty of Actuaries]], and is the last surviving [[Inn of Chancery]]. It was designated a grade I [[listed building]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-454473-1-4-holborn-bars-greater-london-authorit#.V78pynh4WrU 1-4, Holborn Bars, City of London], British Listed Buildings, accessed 25 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:St Giles &amp; Holborn Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|left|A map showing the boundaries of the Inn in 1870.]]
[[File:Staple Inn. ILN 1886.jpg|thumb|Staple Inn in 1886]]

It was originally attached to [[Gray's Inn]], which is one of the four [[Inns of Court]]. The Inns of Chancery fell into decay in the 19th century. All of them were dissolved, and most were demolished. Staple Inn is the only one which survives largely intact. It was an [[extra-parochial area]] until 1858 and then a civil parish. It became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] in 1900 and was abolished in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10052658 |title=Staple Inn ExP/CP through time &amp;#124; Census tables with data for the Parish-level Unit |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staple Inn 20130413 063.jpg|thumb|Staple Inn inner courtyard]]

On 1 April 1994 boundary changes meant that the Inn was transferred from the [[London Borough of Camden]] to the City of London (and the [[Wards of the City of London|City ward]] of [[Farringdon Without]]).

It was the model for the fictitious [[Inn of Court]] "Bacon's Inn" in [[Arthur Moore (author)|Arthur Moore]]'s 1904 novel 'Archers of the Long Bow'. The ancient switch-tailed double pump referred to was replaced in 1937 by a mock single pump, to mark the site.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures of both pumps are available at spitalfieldslife.com/2012/01/10/the-pumps-of-old-london/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wool staple===
Staple Inn dates from 1585. The building was once [[The staple|the wool staple]], where wool was weighed and taxed. It survived the [[Great Fire of London]], was extensively damaged by a [[Nazi German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[aerial bomb]] in 1944 but was subsequently restored. It has a distinctive [[timber framing|timber-framed]] façade, [[cruck]] roof and an internal courtyard.

The historic interiors include a [[great hall]], used by the [[Institute and Faculty of Actuaries]]. The ground floor street frontage is let to shops and restaurants, required to use plainer [[signage]] than they do on less sensitive buildings. This building will be familiar with those that smoke "Old Holborn" tobacco, as formerly it featured on tins and pouches of this product; this logo is no longer in use.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54525">[[File:States_with_Stop_and_Identify_Laws.png|thumb|right|220px|States (colored red) in which Stop and Identify statutes were in effect as of February 20, 2013.]]

'''"Stop and identify" statutes''' are [[statutory law]]s in the United States that authorize police&lt;ref&gt;Although ''police'' and ''police officer'' are used throughout this article, most "stop and identify" laws use the term ''[[peace officer]]'' (or sometimes ''[[law enforcement officer]]''). In general, peace officers are state civil officers charged with preserving the public peace and granted the authority to do so.  Peace officers normally include police officers, sheriffs and sheriffs' deputies, marshals, constables, and often many other persons; those included vary among the states.
&lt;/ref&gt; to legally obtain the identification of someone whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime. If there is no [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, an individual is not required to provide identification, even in "Stop and ID" states.

The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] and requires any [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to be judicially sanctioned and supported by [[probable cause]]. ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}} established that it is constitutionally permissible for police to temporarily detain a person based on an articulable reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, and to conduct a [[Frisking|patdown]] for weapons based on a reasonable belief that the person is armed.  The question whether it is constitutionally permissible for the police to demand that a detainee provide his or her name was considered by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'', {{ussc|542|177|2004}}, which held that the name disclosure did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The ''Hiibel'' case also held that, because Hiibel had no reasonable belief that his name would be used to incriminate him, the name disclosure did not violate the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination; however, the Court left open the possibility that Fifth Amendment right might apply in situations where there ''was'' a reasonable belief that giving a name could be incriminating.&lt;ref&gt;
In upholding Hiibel's conviction, the Court noted,
:In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him.... As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer's business. {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 190}}
But the Court did leave open the possibility of different circumstances:
:Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow. We need not resolve those questions here. {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 191}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Court accepted the Nevada supreme court interpretation of the Nevada statute that a detained person could satisfy the Nevada law by simply stating his name.
The Court did not rule on whether particular identification cards could be required, though it did mention one state law requiring "credible and reliable" identification had been struck down for vagueness.&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada'', [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] stated,
:Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise.  The statute in ''Kolender'' had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer "credible and reliable" identification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted NRS §171.123(3) to require only that a suspect disclose his name. {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 184–185}}
Justice Kennedy continued,
:As we understand it, the statute does not require a suspect to give the officer a drivers license or any other document. Provided that the suspect either states his name or communicates it to the officer by other means—a choice, we assume, that the suspect may make—the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs. {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 185}}
Writing for the Nevada Supreme Court in ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.'', Chief Justice Young said,
:The suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely to state his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists. {{nowrap|— 118 Nev. 868 at 875}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police–citizen encounters ==

In the United States, interactions between [[police]] and citizens fall into three general categories: consensual ("contact" or "conversation"), detention (often called a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]], after ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}), or [[arrest]]. "Stop and identify" laws pertain to detentions.

Different obligations apply to drivers of motor vehicles, who generally are required by state vehicle codes to present a driver's license to police upon request.

=== Consensual ===

At any time, police may approach a person and ask questions. The objective may simply be a friendly conversation; however, the police also may suspect involvement in a crime, but lack "specific and articulable facts"&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]] stated,
:And in justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. {{nowrap|— 392 U.S. at 21}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
that would justify a detention or arrest, and hope to obtain these facts from the questioning. The person approached is not required to identify himself or answer any other questions, and may leave at any time.&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''Florida v. Royer'' {{ussc|460|491|1983}}, [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated,
:The person approached, however, need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. {{nowrap|— 460 U.S. at 497–498}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Police are not usually required to tell a person that he is free to decline to answer questions and go about his business;&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated,
:Our conclusion that no seizure occurred is not affected by the fact that the respondent was not expressly told by the agents that she was free to decline to cooperate with their inquiry, for the voluntariness of her responses does not depend upon her having been so informed. {{nowrap|— 446 U.S. at 555}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
however, a person can usually determine whether the interaction is consensual by asking, "Am I free to go?"&lt;ref&gt;
The [[ACLU]] publication ''Know Your Rights When Encountering Law Enforcement'' states,
:You can say, "I do not want to talk to you" and walk away calmly. Or, if you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can ask if you are free to go. If the answer is yes, you can consider just walking away. Do not run from the officer. If the officer says you are not under arrest, but you are not free to go, then you are being detained.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
If the encounter is consensual, a person approached need not actually leave to terminate the encounter, but may simply ignore police. In ''Michigan v. Chesternut'', {{ussc|486|567|1988}}, [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] explained the Court's holding that Chesternut had not been detained, stating that the police conduct "would not have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business." {{nowrap|— 486 U.S. at 569}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasonable suspicion ===

A person is detained when circumstances are such that a reasonable person would believe he is not free to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated:
:We conclude that a person has been "seized" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. {{nowrap|— 446 U.S. at 554}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Police may briefly detain a person if they have [[reasonable suspicion]] that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  Many state laws explicitly grant this authority. In ''Terry v. Ohio'', the U.S. Supreme Court established that police may conduct a limited search for weapons (known as a "[[frisking|frisk]]") if they reasonably suspect that the person to be detained may be armed and dangerous.

Police may question a person detained in a [[Terry stop]], but in general, the detainee is not required to answer.&lt;ref&gt;
In a concurring opinion in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated that a person detained can be questioned but is "not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest." This opinion, in turn, was cited in many later cases, including ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, many states have "stop and identify" laws that explicitly require a person detained under the conditions of ''Terry'' to identify himself to police, and in some cases, provide additional information.

Before ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'', it was unresolved whether a detainee could be arrested and prosecuted for refusing to disclose his name. Authority on this issue was split among the federal circuit courts of appeal,&lt;ref&gt;
In describing the split authority among the federal appellate court circuits in [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nv&amp;vol=118NevAdvOpNo88&amp;invol=2 ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.''], the Nevada Supreme Court stated:
:In ''Oliver v. Woods'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[209 F.3d 1179, 1190 (10th Cir. 2000)]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Utah statute that requires individuals to produce identification to an officer during an investigatory  stop.  However, in ''Carey v. Nevada  Gaming Control Board'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[279 F.3d 873, 881 (9th Cir. 2002)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that NRS 171.123(3) violates the Fourth Amendment because "&amp;nbsp;'the serious intrusion on personal security outweighs the mere possibility that identification [might] provide a link leading to arrest.'&amp;nbsp;"
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the U.S. Supreme Court twice expressly refused to address the question.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.'', the Nevada Supreme Court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address the issue of identification in
''[[Brown v. Texas]]'',  {{ussc|443|47|1979}}, at 53 n.3 ("We need not decide whether an individual may be  punished for refusing to identify himself in the context of a lawful  investigatory stop which satisfies Fourth Amendment requirements."); and ''[[Kolender v. Lawson]]'', {{ussc|461|352|1983}}, 361&amp;ndash;62 n.10 (holding that a California  statute was unconstitutional on vagueness grounds, but refusing to  consider whether the statute violated the Fourth Amendment).
&lt;/ref&gt;
In '' Hiibel'', the Court held, in a 5–4 decision, that a Nevada "stop and identify" law did not violate the [[United States Constitution]]. The Court opinion implied that a detainee was not required to produce written identification, but could satisfy the requirement merely by stating his name. Some "stop and identify" laws do not require that a detainee identify himself, but allow refusal to do so to be considered along with other factors in determining whether there is probable cause to arrest. In some states, providing a false name is an offense.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;!-- referenced by note in Arrest, below --&gt;
Texas does not require a detainee to identify himself unless he has been lawfully arrested, but does make it a crime to provide a false name. Texas Penal Code [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.38.htm#38.02 §&amp;nbsp;38.02] reads, in relevant part,
:(b)  A person commits an offense if he intentionally gives a false or fictitious name, residence address, or date of birth to a peace officer who has:
::(1)  lawfully arrested the person;
::(2)  lawfully detained the person;  or
::(3)  requested the information from a person that the peace officer has good cause to believe is a witness to a criminal offense.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2011, the Supreme Court has not addressed the validity of requirements that a detainee provide information other than his name, however some states such as Arizona have specifically codified that a detained person is not required to provide any information aside from their full name.

=== Arrest ===
{{Main|Arrest}}

A [[Remand (detention)|detention]] requires only that police have [[reasonable suspicion]] that a person is involved in [[criminal activity]]. However, to make an arrest, an officer must have [[probable cause]] to believe that the person has committed a crime. Some states require police to inform the person of the intent to make the arrest and the cause for the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;
California Penal Code § 841, states, in relevant part,
:The person making the arrest must inform the person to be arrested of the intention to arrest him, of the cause of the arrest, and the authority to make it .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
But it is not always obvious when a detention becomes an arrest. After making an arrest, police may search a person, his or her belongings, and his or her immediate surroundings.

Whether an arrested person must identify himself may depend on the [[jurisdiction]] in which the arrest occurs. If a person is under arrest and police wish to question him, they are required to inform the person of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth-Amendment]] right to remain silent by giving a [[Miranda warning]]. However, ''Miranda'' does not apply to biographical data necessary to complete booking.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', {{ussc|496|582|1990}}, the Court cited the Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12 quoting ''United States v. Horton'', 873 F.2d 180, 181, n. 2 &lt;nowiki&gt;[CA8 1989]&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
:the questions fall within a "routine booking question" exception which exempts from ''Miranda'' coverage questions to secure the "'biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services.'" {{nowrap|— 496 U.S. at 601–602}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
The Fifth Amendment prohibits only communication that is testimonial, incriminating, and compelled; see ''United States v. Hubbell'', {{ussc|530|27|2000}}, at 34&amp;ndash;38. ''Hiibel'' held that, in the circumstances of the case, a person's name is not incriminating, and consequently is not protected by the Fifth-Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. {{nowrap|— 530 U.S. at 34–38}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is not clear whether a "stop and identify" law could compel giving one's name after being arrested, although some states have laws that specifically require an arrested person to give his name and other biographical information,&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;!-- references note in Detention, above --&gt;
Texas Penal Code, Title 8, [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.38.htm#38.02 §38.02(a)], reads
:A person commits an offense if he intentionally refuses to give his name, residence address, or date of birth to a peace officer who has lawfully arrested the person and requested the information.
Giving false information is a related, and usually more serious offense (under Subsection [b], noted above), and applies to detainees as well as arrestees.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and some state courts&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Quiroga'' (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 961, the Court held that refusal to disclose one's identity following a felony arrest constituted obstructing an officer:
:These statutory provisions lead to the conclusion that a refusal to disclose personal identification following arrest for a misdemeanor or infraction cannot constitute a violation of [California] Penal Code section 148.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Section 148 can reasonably be construed as applying to nondisclosure of identity following arrest for felonies, but not minor offenses, if this exception applies to the provisions cited above dealing with arrests for minor offenses. {{nowrap|— 16 Cal.App.4th 961, 970}}
Similar refusal following arrest for a misdemeanor or infraction did not violate the statute because the Legislature had "established other ways of dealing with such nondisclosure".
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Burkes v. State'' (Fla. 2d DCA  1998), Case No. 97-00552, the Court, in affirming the appellant's conviction for violation of § 843.02, Florida Statutes, "Resisting officer without violence to his or her person", stated:
:The most compelling argument we discern for answering this question in the affirmative is that the right to remain silent means just that and has no exceptions. We, nevertheless, conclude that after an individual has been lawfully arrested, he must provide his name or otherwise identify himself when asked by law enforcement officers.
&lt;/ref&gt;
have held that refusal to give one's name constitutes obstructing a public officer. As a practical matter, an arrested person who refused to give his name would have little chance of obtaining a prompt release.

States not listed do not have a requirement to show Identification to law enforcement officers. Some states listed have "Stop and ID" laws which may or may not require someone to identify themselves during an investigative detention.

While Wisconsin statutes allow law enforcement officers to "demand" ID, there is no statutory requirement to provide them ID nor is there a penalty for refusing to, hence Wisconsin is not a must ID state. ''[https://www.leagle.com/decision/1995532194wis2d3381517 Henes v. Morrissey]'', 194 Wis.2d 338, 353-54 (1995).  Annotations for Wisconsin §968.24, however, state "The principles of ''Terry'' permit a state to require a suspect to disclose his or her name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop and allow imposing criminal penalties for failing to do so", citing ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'' as authority.
Hiibel held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during police investigations did not violate the Fourth Amendment if the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held in Henes v. Morrissey that "A crime is made up of two parts: proscribed conduct and a prescribed penalty. "The former without the latter is no crime. ...  In this case no statute penalizes a refusal to identify oneself to a law enforcement officer, and no penalty is set forth in the statute for refusing to identify oneself. This statute is part of Chapter 968 entitled "Commencement of Criminal Proceedings. By its very terms sec. 968.24 empowers a law enforcement officer to stop and question "in the vicinity where the person was stopped." The statute does not authorize a law enforcement officer to make an arrest." Additionally  Henes v. Morrissey held that a detained person not providing their name isn't on its own a violation of 946.41 Resisting or obstructing officer as the act of not identifying ones self
isn't a false statement with intent to mislead the officer in the performance of his or her duty.

Neither is Illinois, since the Illinois Second District Appellate Court Decision in ''People v. Fernandez'', 2011 IL App (2d) 100473, which specifically states that section 107-14 is found in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, not the Criminal Code of 1961, and governs the conduct of police officers. The fact remains that there is no corresponding duty in the Criminal Code of 1961 for a suspect to identify himself
or herself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in ''Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada'', 542 U.S. 177, 181 (2004), a Nevada statute (Nev. Rev. Stat. § 171.123 (2003)) specifically required that a person subjected to a ''Terry'' stop "shall identify himself." The Supreme Court held that the statute was constitutional.

As of February 2011, there is no U.S. federal law requiring that an individual identify himself during a ''Terry'' stop, but ''Hiibel'' held that states may enact such laws, provided the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement,&lt;ref&gt;
The ''Hiibel'' Court held, "The principles of ''Terry'' permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop." {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 24 states have done so.&lt;ref&gt;The opinion in ''Hiibel'' included a list of 21 states with "stop and identify" laws.
For some reason, the Indiana law was not included in the list; the Arizona and Ohio laws have been enacted since ''Hiibel'' was decided. The Texas law only applies to arrested persons.&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion in ''Hiibel'' implied that persons detained by police in jurisdictions with constitutional&lt;ref&gt;"Constitutional" means that the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. See ''Hiibel''.&lt;/ref&gt; "stop and identify" laws listed are obligated to identify themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Writing for the Court in ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, "the source of the legal obligation [to identify oneself] arises from Nevada state law". {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. at 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that persons detained in other jurisdictions are not.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, "In other States, a suspect may decline to identify himself without penalty.″ {{nowrap|— 542 U.S.  at 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The issue may not be that simple, however, for several reasons:
* The wording of "stop and identify" laws varies considerably from state to state.
* Noncompliance with  a "stop and identify" law that does not explicitly impose a penalty may constitute violation of another law, such as one to the effect of "resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer".
* State courts have made varying interpretations of both "stop and identify" and "obstructing" laws.

=== Variations in "stop and identify" laws ===

* Four states' laws (Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, and Nevada) explicitly impose an obligation to provide identifying information.
* Fifteen states grant police authority to ask questions, with varying wording, but do not explicitly impose an obligation to respond:
:* In Montana, police "may request" identifying information;
:* In Ohio, identifying information may be required "when requested"; an obligation exists only when the police suspect a person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a criminal offense, is witness to a violent felony offense, or is witness to an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violent felony offense;
:* In 12 states (Alabama, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin), police "may demand" identifying information. Of note, though, in New Hampshire for example (RSA 594:2), statutory language authorizing a 'demand' for identity does not establish a legal requirement to provide documentation of identity (ID), or even a requirement to respond in the first place. Further, a law enforcement officer is authorized to make such 'demand' only of individuals for "whom he has reason to suspect is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime."
* Identifying information varies, but typically includes
:* Name, address, and an explanation of the person's actions;
:* In some cases it also includes the person's intended destination, the person's date of birth (Indiana and Ohio), or written identification if available (Colorado). Ohio does not require the person's intended destination. Ohio requires only name, address, or date of birth. Date of birth is NOT required if the age of the person is an element to the crime (such as underage drinking, curfew violation, etc...) that the person is reasonably suspected of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29|title=Lawriter - ORC - 2921.29 Failure to disclose personal information.|publisher=State of Ohio Codes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana requires either name, address, and date of birth, or driver's license, if on the person's possession, and only applies if the person was stopped for an infraction or ordinance violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2016/ic/titles/034/articles/028/chapters/005/#section-3.5|title=Indiana Code 2016 - Indiana General Assembly, 2016 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Arizona law, apparently written specifically to codify the holding in ''Hiibel'', requires a person's "true full name".
:* Nevada law, which requires a person to "identify himself or herself", apparently requires only that the person state his or her name.
:* Texas law requires a person to provide their name, residence address and date of birth if lawfully arrested and asked by police. (A detained person or witness of a crime is not required to provide any identifying information, however it is a crime for a detained person or witness to give a false name.)
* In four states (Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Rhode Island), failure to identify oneself is one factor to be considered in a decision to arrest.  In all but Rhode Island, the consideration arises in the context of [[loitering]] or prowling. 
* Seven states (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, and Vermont) explicitly impose a criminal penalty for noncompliance with the obligation to identify oneself.

As of February 2011, the validity of a law requiring that a person detained provide anything more than stating his or her name has not come before the U.S. Supreme Court.

=== Interaction with other laws ===

In states whose "stop and identify laws" do not directly impose penalties, a lawful arrest must be for violation of some other law, such as one to the effect of "resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer".
For example, the Nevada "stop and identify" law challenged in ''Hiibel'' did not impose a penalty on a person who refused to comply, but the Justice Court of Union Township, Nevada, determined that Hiibels refusal to identify himself&lt;ref&gt;
The opinion noted that Hiibel was asked to provide identification, which the Court understood as a request to produce a driver's license or some other form of written identification, 11 different times; however, it did not indicate that Hiibel was ever asked simply to identify himself.
&lt;/ref&gt;
constituted a violation of Nevada "obstructing" law.&lt;ref&gt;
NRS §199.280 provides a penalty for a person who "willfully resists, delays or obstructs a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office"
&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar conclusion regarding the interaction between Utah "stop and identify" and "obstructing" laws was reached in ''Oliver v. Woods'' (10th Cir. 2000).

=== Interpretation by courts ===

"Stop and identify" laws in different states that appear to be nearly identical may be different in effect because of interpretations by state courts. For example, California "stop and identify" law, Penal Code §647(e) had wording&lt;ref&gt;California stop-and-identify law in Penal Code §647(e) was repealed several years after 1983 and the sub-sections re-lettered, so the current Penal Code §647(e) is what used to be Penal Code §647(f). Also, do not confuse Penal Code §647(e) with Penal Code §647e.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(voided in ''Kolender v. Lawson''), read, in relevant part,
:Every person who commits any of the following acts is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor:&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. (e) who loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business and who refuses to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do, if the surrounding circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification.
&lt;/ref&gt;
similar to the Nevada law upheld in ''Hiibel'', but a California appellate court, in ''People v. Solomon''  (1973), 33 Cal.App.3d 429 construed the law to require "credible and reliable" identification that carries a "reasonable assurance" of its authenticity. Using this construction, the U.S. Supreme Court held the law to be void for vagueness in ''[[Kolender v. Lawson]]'', {{ussc|461|352|1983}}.&lt;ref&gt;
In voiding California Penal Code §647(e) in ''Kolender v. Lawson'', [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]], writing for the Court, noted that
:Section 647(e), as presently drafted and as construed by the state courts, contains no standard for determining what a suspect has to do in order to satisfy the requirement to provide a "credible and reliable" identification. As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute. {{nowrap|— 461 U.S. at 358}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some courts have recognized a distinction authorizing police to demand identifying information and specifically imposing an obligation of a suspect to respond.&lt;ref&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''People v. Love'', 318 Ill.App.3d 534 (2000), rev'd on other grounds, ''People v. Love'', No. 90806 (2002), Justice O'Brien stated,
:The State next argues that the officer's order was a justifiable means of compelling defendant to state her name pursuant to section 107-14, which provides that an officer making a ''Terry'' stop may "demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions." 725 ILCS 5/107-14 (West 1992). However, while section 107-14 states that an officer may "demand" the defendant's name, it does not provide that the officer may compel a response. Further, the United States Supreme Court has stated in the context of a ''Terry'' stop: "[T]he officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. ''But the detainee is not obliged to respond''." (Emphasis added.) ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420, 438, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, 334, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 3150 (1984).
Noting ''Berkemer v. McCarty'' (and Justice White's concurring opinion in ''Terry'' that ''Berkemer'' quoted), the ''Hiibel'' Court stated, "We do not read these statements as controlling" (542 U.S. at 187), so ''Love'' is probably weakened to the extent that it relies on ''Berkemer''.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other courts have apparently interpreted ''demand'' to impose an obligation on the detainee to comply.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''Cady v. Sheahan'' (7th Cir. 2006), the Court stated,
:In ''Hiibel'', the Supreme Court held that states are permitted to statutorily authorize the demand for identification during a ''Terry'' stop, and to require compliance with such demand. 542 U.S. at 188, 124 S.Ct. 2451. Cady's identity was relevant to the purpose of the stop and the officers did not exceed the scope of the stop by requesting identification. [footnotes omitted]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Wording and interpretation by state courts of "obstructing" laws also varies; for example, New York "obstructing" law&lt;ref&gt;
New Yorks "obstructing" law, NY Consolidated Laws Penal (PEN) §195.05, reads, in relevant part,
:A person is guilty of obstructing governmental administration when he intentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function, or prevents or attempts to prevent a public servant from performing an official function, by means of intimidation, physical force or interference, or by means of any independently unlawful act
&lt;/ref&gt;
apparently requires physical rather than simply verbal obstruction;&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Offen'', 408 N.Y.S.2d 914, 96 Misc.2d 147 (1978), Judge Hertz stated,
:An essential element of the crime of obstructing governmental administration, to be charged in an information, must be an act of either (1) intimidation or (2) physical force or interference or (3) an independently unlawful act.
:Plainly, ignoring an officer's request for identification is not a crime, nor does that act supply any such element. Though it is clear that such conduct risks pursuit and arrest, no crime has been charged here. {{nowrap|— 96 Misc.2d at 150}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
See [http://cryptome.org/rnc-rights.htm  When Do You Have to Give Your Name at the RNC Protests?] under [[#External links|External links]] for an analysis of New York "stop and identify" and "obstructing" laws  by Just Cause Law Collective lawyer [[Katya Komisaruk]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
likewise, a violation of the Colorado "obstructing" law appears to require use or threat of use of physical force. However, the Colorado Supreme Court held in [http://www.courts.state.co.us/supct/opinions/2004/04SC362.pdf ''Dempsey v. People'', No. 04SC362 (2005)] ([[PDF]]) that refusing to provide identification was an element in the "totality of the circumstances" that could constitute obstructing an officer, even when actual physical interference was not employed.&lt;ref&gt;
Colorado "obstructing" law, Colorado Revised Statutes §18-8-104(1), reads, in relevant part,
:A person commits obstructing a peace officer .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. when by using or threatening to use violence, force, physical interference, or an obstacle, such person knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the enforcement of the penal law or the preservation of the peace by a peace officer, acting under color of his or her official authority.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Utah "obstructing" law does not require a physical act, but merely a failure to follow a "lawful order .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. necessary to effect the .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. detention";&lt;ref&gt;
Utah "obstructing" law, Utah Code §76-8-305, reads as follows:
:Interference with arresting officer.
:A person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor if he has knowledge, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have knowledge, that a peace officer is seeking to effect a lawful arrest or detention of that person or another and interferes with the arrest or detention by:
::(1) use of force or any weapon;
::(2) the arrested person's refusal to perform any act required by lawful order:
:::(a) necessary to effect the arrest or detention; and
:::(b) made by a peace officer involved in the arrest or detention; or
::(3) the arrested person's or another person's refusal to refrain from performing any act that would impede the arrest or detention.
&lt;/ref&gt;
a divided court in ''Oliver v. Woods'' concluded that failure to present identification constituted a violation of that law.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''Oliver v. Woods'', 209 F.3d 1179 (10th Cir. 2000), [[Wade Brorby|Judge Brorby]] stated,
:Section 76-8-305 does not require the use of force; mere refusal to perform any act required by a lawful order necessary to effect the detention is sufficient to constitute a violation of § 76-8-305. Moreover, an individual who merely refuses to refrain from performing any act that would impede the arrest or detention violates this section.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Thus, Officer Woods gave a lawful order when he told Mr. Oliver to present identification and to remain in the parking lot while he conducted the investigation. By refusing to present identification, Mr. Oliver refused to perform an act required by lawful order, necessary to effect the detention.
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not universally agreed that, absent a "stop and identify law", there is no obligation for a detainee to identify himself. For example, as the U.S. Supreme Court noted in ''Hiibel'', California "stop and identify" statute was voided in ''Kolender v. Lawson''. But in ''People v. Long'',&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Long'' (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 77, Justice Agliano wrote,
:The voluntary display of identification is a routine experience for most of us. Measured against the obvious and substantial need for police recording the identity of a person suspected of having committed a crime, we find reasonable the minimal intrusion involved here in requiring the production of identification. In addition, defendant's oral statement of his name was suspect when he insisted he had no identification while appearing to carry a wallet and, in addition, he seemed intoxicated. {{nowrap|— 189 Cal.App.3d at 88}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
decided four years after ''Kolender'', a California appellate court found no constitutional impropriety in a police officer's demand for written identification from a detainee. The issue before the ''Long'' court was a request for suppression of evidence uncovered in a search of the defendant's wallet, so the issue of refusal to present identification was not directly addressed; however, the author of the ''Long'' opinion had apparently concluded in a 1980 case that failure to identify oneself did not provide a basis for arrest.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''In re Gregory S.'' (1980), 112 Cal.App.3d 764, Justice Agliano wrote
:We find no authority to support the court's legal conclusion that a person who merely refuses to identify himself or to answer questions in a context similar to that before us thereby violates Penal Code section 148 or otherwise furnishes ground for arrest.

:The Legislature has required citizen self-identification in prescribed situations. Vehicle Code section 40302 calls for the production of a driver's license or identification upon arrest for a violation of that code; Vehicle Code section 12951 requires production of a driver's license by the driver of a motor vehicle upon the request of an officer. Penal Code section 647, subdivision (e) imposes a duty to identify oneself when such person loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business, and the surrounding circumstances reasonably indicate that the public safety demands identification. Section 647, subdivision (e) was held valid in ''People v. Solomon'' (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 429 [108 Cal.Rptr. 867], in which strong consideration was given to the legislatively declared governmental purpose to be served by identification when the conditions described in the statute exist. (Id, at p. 436; see also ''California v. Byers'' (1971) 402 U.S. 424 [29 L.Ed.2d 9, 91 S.Ct. 1535].) None of the statutory conditions requiring identification existed in this case. {{nowrap|— 112 Cal.App.3d at 779}}

Note: Penal Code 647, subdivision (e) was voided by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Kolender v. Lawson'' (1983).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonetheless, some cite ''Long'' in maintaining that refusal to present written identification constitutes obstructing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;
 Shortly after ''Hiibel'' was decided, the [[Alameda County (California)]] [http://le.alcoda.org/ District Attorney's Office] provided a [http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Hiibel.pdf case analysis] (PDF)
maintaining that refusal to identify oneself and provide written identification (if available)  constitutes a violation of Penal Code §148(a)(1), resisting, delaying, or obstructing an officer.  The topic is further discussed in the [http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/2010_editions 2010 edition] 
of ''[http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/ Point of View]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Others disagree, and maintain that persons detained by police in California cannot be compelled to identify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;
The [http://ag.ca.gov/publications/index.php ''California Peace Officers Legal Sourcebook''] ("CPOLS"; written by the office of the [[California Attorney General]]) maintains that failure to identify oneself does not constitute a violation of [[California Penal Code]] §148(a)(1), resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer:
:Unlike Nevada and other states, California does ''not'' have a statute mandating that a detainee identify himself, and that obligation cannot be read into Penal Code section 148. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.  ''Hiibel'' does not provide a means of ''arresting'' someone for failing or refusing to identify himself. (Revision 176, 9/15/2014, p.&amp;nbsp;2.14a; page last revised 1/10)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some courts, e.g., ''State v. Flynn'' (Wis. 1979)&lt;ref&gt;
In ''State v. Flynn'' (1979) 92 Wis.2d 427 [285  N.W.2d 710, 718], cert. den. 449 U.S. 846, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the ''Terry'' limitation of a search "to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer." (392 U.S. at 29) was limited to the specific circumstances of ''Terry''. [[Bruce F. Beilfuss|Chief Justice Beilfuss]] wrote,
:It is clear from the language itself that the court's holding in ''Terry'' was limited to the precise situation before it. The court did not say that the sole justification for any search on less than probable cause is the protection of the police officer and others, but that that was the sole justification of the search in the situation then before it. The situation before us is significantly different.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and ''People v. Loudermilk'' (Calif. 1987)&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Loudermilk'' (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 996, Justice Low stated,
:Neither case [''Kolender v. Lawson'' or ''Brown v. Texas''] could be interpreted to prevent a police officer from demanding that a ''Terry'' suspect produce proof of identification. Further, nothing in those or other cases cited by defendant prevents an officer from seizing a wallet found during a lawful patdown search after that suspect has lied to the officer that he had no identification. {{nowrap|— 195 Cal.App.3d at 1003}}
Justice Low noted the similarity to ''Flynn'', and continued,
:We must emphasize that we do not hold that a suspect may be detained and searched merely because he either refused to identify himself or refused to produce proof of identification. Nor do we hold that each time an officer conducts a Terry stop he may immediately conduct a search for identification. The rule we announce does not provide officers with unfettered discretion and does not open citizens to harassment. {{nowrap|— 195 Cal.App.3d at 1004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
have held that police may perform a search for written identification if a suspect refuses to provide it;
a later California decision, ''People v. Garcia'' (2006) strongly disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Garcia'' (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 782, Justice Yegan, noting ''State v. Flynn'' (Wis. 1979) and ''State v. Wilcox'' (N.J. 1981), stated,
:We need not look to other jurisdictions to decide this case. We would have to indulge in legal legerdemain to justify a patdown search for identification. In fact, it would require a rewriting of ''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra,'' which we could not and would not undertake even if we were so inclined. Here, the record is devoid of any concern that appellant was armed and dangerous. The sole reason for the patdown was to gather evidence of identification.
:A fair reading of ''Terry v. Ohio'', and its reference to the lower court opinion in ''State v. Terry'' show that the "frisk" allowable upon a proper showing was "&amp;nbsp;'.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. only a "frisk" for a dangerous weapon. It by no means authorizes a search for contraband, evidentiary material, or anything else in the absence of reasonable grounds to arrest. Such a search is controlled by requirements of the Fourth Amendment, and probable cause is essential.'&amp;nbsp;" (''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra'', 392 U.S. at p. 16, fn. 12 [20 L. Ed. 2d at p. 903, fn. 12.) Our own Supreme Court has unanimously so held. (''People v. Lawler''   (1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 161 [pat-down search "only" for weapons].) If ''stare decisis'' means anything (and it does) and if the word ''only'' means ''only'' (and it does), the trial court was required to grant this suppression motion as a matter of law. (''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'' (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450.) {{nowrap|— 145 Cal.App.4th at 788}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Utah v. Strieff]]'' (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an officer's stop of Edward Strieff and his demand for identification from Strieff was unlawful under Utah state law, but that the evidence collected pursuant to the stop was admissible due to the determination that Strieff was subject to a pre-existing arrest warrant. Therefore, the pre-existing warrant "attenuated" the unlawful stop-and-identify.

=== Recommendations of legal-aid organizations ===

Some legal organizations, such as the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the [[ACLU]] of Northern California,
recommend to either remain silent or to identify oneself whether or not a jurisdiction has a "stop and identify" law:
:And in any state, police do not always follow the law, and refusing to give your name may make them suspicious and lead to your arrest, so use your judgment. If you fear that your name may be incriminating, you can claim the right to remain silent, and if you are arrested, this may help you later. Giving a false name could be a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlgsf.org/resources/kyr_english.pdf |format=pdf |title=Know Your Rights!

Bay Area Chapter; ACLU of Northern California; American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent pamphlet, the ACLU of Northern California elaborated on this further, recommending that a person detained by police should:

:.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. give your name and the information on your drivers' license. If you don't, you may be arrested, even though the arrest may be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/know-your-rights/your-rights-and-police|title=Your Rights and the Police

== Other countries ==
{{main|List of national identity card policies by country}}
Many countries allow police to demand identification and arrest people who do not carry any (or refuse to produce so). Normally these countries provide all residents with [[Identity document|national identity cards]], which have the identity information the police would want to know, including citizenship. Foreign visitors need to have their passport available to show at all times. In some cases national identity cards from certain other countries are accepted.

For example, in [[Portugal]] it is compulsory to carry the state ID card at all times. This card named [[Cartão de Cidadão]] - Citizen Card is an electronic card which includes biometric information, id number, social security number, fiscal information, place of birth, etc. Police can only ask for the ID card in public or a place open to public and only if there is a reasonable suspicion the person committed a crime. A certified copy of the ID card can be presented in such situations. If a citizen does not carry the ID card or its certified copy, the police will escort the person to the police department to remain detained until clear identification can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direitosedeveres.pt/q/vida-pessoal-e-familiar/identidade/um-cidadao-traz-habitualmente-consigo-apenas-uma-fotocopia-do-cartao-de-cidadao-ou-do-bilhete-de-identidade-se-a-|title=Um cidadão traz habitualmente consigo apenas uma fotocópia do cartão de cidadão ou do bilhete de identidade. Se a autoridade lhe exigir a identificação, pode estar descansado? - Direitos e Deveres dos Cidadãos|first=VIEW. (info@view.pt -|last=www.view.pt)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, police generally have no power to demand identification unless they have a statutory power to do so. For example, these countries have laws that require those driving to produce their licence (or state their name, address, etc) when stopped by police. Police may also require people to identify themselves if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they have committed a crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0072/latest/whole.html#DLM1351201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://svan.ca/police-rights/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Svalbard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|v|ɑː|l|b|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svalbard – definition of Svalbard in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/svalbard|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=17 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918085239/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/svalbard|archivedate=18 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-no|ˈsʋɑ(ː)lbɑːɾ}}; prior to 1925 known by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name '''Spitsbergen''') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[archipelago]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the [[North Pole]]. The islands of the group range from [[74th parallel north|74°]] to [[81st parallel north|81° north]] latitude, and from [[10th meridian east|10°]] to [[35th meridian east|35° east]] longitude. The largest island is [[Spitsbergen]], followed by [[Nordaustlandet]] and [[Edgeøya]]. Administratively, the archipelago is not part of any [[Counties of Norway|Norwegian county]], but forms an [[unincorporated area]] administered by a [[Governor of Svalbard|governor]] appointed by the Norwegian government. Since 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, [[Longyearbyen]], has had an [[Longyearbyen Community Council|elected local government]], somewhat similar to [[List of municipalities of Norway|mainland municipalities]]. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of [[Barentsburg]], the research station of [[Ny-Ålesund]], and the mining outpost of [[Sveagruva]]. Ny-Ålesund is the northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population. Other settlements are farther north, but are populated only by rotating groups of researchers.

The islands were first taken into use as a [[whaling]] base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. [[Coal mining]] started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 recognizes Norwegian [[sovereignty]], and the 1925 [[Svalbard Act]] made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a [[free economic zone]] and a [[demilitarized zone]]. The Norwegian [[Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani|Store Norske]] and the Russian [[Arktikugol]] remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the [[University Centre in Svalbard]] (UNIS) and the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead [[snowmobile]]s, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. [[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]] serves as the main gateway.

The archipelago features an [[climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]], although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude. The [[flora of Svalbard|flora]] take advantage of the long period of [[midnight sun]] to compensate for the [[polar night]]. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features [[polar bear]]s, [[reindeer]], the [[Arctic fox]], and certain [[marine mammal]]s. [[List of national parks of Norway|Seven national parks]] and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the [[archipelago]] is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains and [[fjord]]s.

[[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] are collectively assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "SJ". Both areas are administered by Norway, though they are separated by a distance of over {{convert|950|km|nmi|abbr=off}} and have very different administrative structures.

Since Svalbard is located north of the [[Arctic Circle]] it experiences [[midnight sun]] in summer and [[polar night]] in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;Torkilsen (1984): 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Longyearbyen]], midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February.&lt;ref name=npi /&gt; In winter, the combination of [[full moon]] and reflective snow can give additional light.&lt;ref name=sun /&gt;

[[Glacier|Glacial ice]] covers {{convert|36502|km2|abbr=on}} or 60% of Svalbard; 30% is barren rock while 10% is vegetated.&lt;ref name=u3&gt;Umbreit (2005): 3&lt;/ref&gt; The largest glacier is [[Austfonna]] ({{convert|8412|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) on Nordaustlandet, followed by [[Olav V Land]] and [[Vestfonna]].

[[Kvitøya]] is 99.3% covered by glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The landforms of Svalbard were created through [[Quaternary glaciation|repeated ice ages]], when glaciers cut the former plateau into [[fjord]]s, valleys and mountains.&lt;ref name=u4&gt;Umbreit (2005): 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest peak is [[Newtontoppen]] ({{convert|1717|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), followed by [[Perriertoppen]] ({{convert|1712|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Ceresfjellet]] ({{convert|1675|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Chadwickryggen]] ({{convert|1640|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Galileotoppen]] ({{convert|1637|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

== Sports ==

[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Svalbard.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Svalbard}}

=== Dutch discovery, exploration, and mapping of a 'terra nullius' ===

{{See also|:Category:Dutch Republic in the Age of Discovery|l1=Dutch Republic in the Age of Discovery|Willem Barentsz|Northeast Passage|Arctic exploration|Terra nullius}}

[[File:Barentsz arctic map.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spitsbergen]] and Svalbard during the [[:Category:Dutch Republic in the Age of Discovery|Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery]] (c. 1590s–1720s). Portion of 1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]]. Spitsbergen, here mapped for the first time, is indicated as "Het Nieuwe Land" (Dutch for "the New Land"), center-left. This is a typical map from the [[History of cartography|Golden Age of Dutch cartography]].]]
[[File:Arctic.svg|thumb|right|180px|In the [[Age of Discovery]] (Age of Exploration), the Dutch were the first (non-natives) to [[List of Dutch inventions and discoveries#Explorations|explore]] and map many unknown isolated areas of the world, including the Svalbard [[archipelago]] and [[Jan Mayen#Jan Mayen during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery|Jan Mayen]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].]]
[[Norsemen]] possibly discovered Svalbard as early as the 12th century. There are traditional Norse accounts of a land known as Svalbarð—literally "cold shores"—although this might have referred to [[Jan Mayen]], or a part of eastern [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=t2526&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 46&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought both Svalbard and Greenland were connected to Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 26&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago might in that period have been used for fishing and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutchman [[Willem Barentsz]] made the first discovery of the archipelago in 1596, when he sighted its coast while searching for the [[Northern Sea Route]].&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 30. Arlov (1996): 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Spitsbergen'' originated with Barentsz, who described the "pointed mountains" he saw on the west coast of the main island, [[Spitsbergen]] although his 1599 map of the Arctic labels the island as ''Het Nieuwe Land'' ("The New Land"). Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago, and consequently the name ''Spitsbergen'' long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf ''In Search of Het Behouden Huys: A Survey of the Remains of the House of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya'', LOUWRENS HACQUEBORD, p. 250] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327084815/http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}.

The first known landing on the island dates to 1604, when an English ship landed at Bjørnøya and started hunting [[walrus]]; annual expeditions soon followed, and Spitsbergen became a base for hunting the [[bowhead whale]] from 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 62&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lawless nature of the area, English, Danish, Dutch, and French companies and authorities tried to use force to keep out other countries' fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th–18th centuries ===

Speeck (1634), which represented the Danish station in Copenhagen Bay (Kobbefjorden).]]
[[Smeerenburg]] was one of the first settlements, established by the Dutch in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 37&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started to [[overwintering|overwinter]]. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 39&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 17th century, [[Russians|Russian]] hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 40&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
After the [[Anglo-Russian War]] in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 44&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast [[Sámi|Sámi people]] from the [[Hammerfest]] region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Carlheim-Gyllensköld (1900), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left,&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 47&lt;/ref&gt; but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 50&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
==== Svalbard Treaty and Norwegian sovereignty ====
{{Main|Svalbard Treaty}}
By the 1890s, Svalbard had become a destination for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were being used as a base for [[Arctic exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 239&lt;/ref&gt; The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in [[Adventfjorden]] and started the first all-year operations.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 249&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Longyearbyen, by American interests, started in 1908;&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 261&lt;/ref&gt; and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying American interests.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 273&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions to establish the sovereignty of the archipelago commenced in the 1910s,&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 288&lt;/ref&gt; but were interrupted by [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 294&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 1920, following the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the [[Svalbard Treaty]] was signed, granting full sovereignty to Norway. However, all signatory countries were granted non-discriminatory rights to fishing, hunting and mineral resources.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 305–306&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty took effect on 14 August 1925, at the same time as the [[Svalbard Act]] regulated the archipelago and the first [[Governor of Svalbard|governor]], [[Johannes Gerckens Bassøe]], took office.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 319&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago has traditionally been known as Spitsbergen, and the main island as West Spitsbergen. From the 1920s, Norway renamed the archipelago Svalbard, and the main island became Spitsbergen.&lt;ref&gt;Umbriet (2005): XI–XII&lt;/ref&gt; Kvitøya, Kong Karls Land, Hopen and Bjørnøya were not regarded as part of the Spitsbergen archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miljo.npolar.no/placenames/pages/detaile.asp?placeNameID=813614P |title=Place names of Svalbard |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606113449/http://miljo.npolar.no/placenames/pages/detaile.asp?placeNameID=813614P |archivedate=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russians have traditionally called the archipelago Grumant ({{lang|ru|Грумант}}).&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 51&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] retained the name Spitsbergen ({{lang|ru|Шпицберген}}) to support undocumented claims that Russians were the first to discover the island.&lt;ref&gt;Fløgstad (2007): 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Italian explorer [[Umberto Nobile]] and the crew of the airship ''Italia'' crashed on the icepack off the coast of [[Foynøya|Foyn Island]]. The subsequent rescue attempts were covered extensively in the press and Svalbard received short-lived fame as a result.

==== Second World War ====

[[File:Demolition of wireless station at Spitzbergen, Operation Gauntlet, 1941 (22418716705).jpg|left|thumb|Demolition of the wireless station during Operation Gauntlet in 1941]]
In 1941, after [[Operation Gauntlet]], all Norwegian and Soviet settlements on Svalbard were evacuated,&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 397&lt;/ref&gt; and a German presence was established with a meteorological outpost,&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 400&lt;/ref&gt; although a small Norwegian garrison was kept on Spitsbergen. The German [[Operation Zitronella]] took this garrison by force in 1943, and at the same time destroying the settlements at Longyearbyen and Barentsburg.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1944, together with the supply ship ''[[Carl J. Busch]]'', the submarine {{GS|U-307||2}} transported the men of [[Operation Haudegen]] to Svalbard. Operation Haudegen (i.e., swashbuckler) was the name of a German operation during the [[Second World War]] to establish meteorological stations on Svalbard.

The station was active from 9 September 1944 to 4 September 1945. It lost radio contact in May 1945, and the soldiers were capable of asking for support only in August 1945. On 4 September 1945, the soldiers were picked up by a Norwegian seal hunting vessel and surrendered to its captain. This group of men were the last German troops to surrender after the Second World War. After the war, the Soviet Union proposed common Norwegian and Soviet administration and military defence of Svalbard. This was rejected in 1947 by Norway, which two years later joined [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union retained high civilian activity on Svalbard, in part to ensure that the archipelago was not used by NATO.&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 407–408&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-war ====
[[File:Kulltaubane.jpg|right|thumb|Abandoned [[aerial tramway]] previously used for transporting coal]]
After the war, Norway re-established operations at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund,&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 206&lt;/ref&gt; while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg, [[Pyramiden]] and [[Grumant]].&lt;ref name=t202&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 202&lt;/ref&gt; The mine at Ny-Ålesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people while it was in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963. The [[Kings Bay Affair]], caused by the 1962 accident killing 21 workers, forced [[Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet]] to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9318238|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103103405/http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9318238|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 November 2006|title=Kings Bay|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9318239|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109115607/http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9318239|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 November 2006|title=Kings Bay-saken|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964, Ny-Ålesund became a research outpost, and a facility for the [[European Space Research Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1996): 412&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum test drilling was started in 1963 and continued until 1984, but no commercially viable fields were found.&lt;ref&gt;Torkildsen (1984): 261&lt;/ref&gt; From 1960, regular charter flights were made from the mainland to a field at [[Hotellneset]];&lt;ref&gt;Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 163&lt;/ref&gt; in 1975, Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened, allowing year-round services.&lt;ref&gt;Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995):162–164&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union retained about two-thirds of the population on the islands (with a third being Norwegians) with the archipelago's population slightly under 4,000.&lt;ref name=t202 /&gt; Russian activity has diminished considerably since then, falling from 2,500 to 450 people from 1990 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/00/20/nos_svalbard_en/nos_d330_en/tab/045.html |title=Persons in settlements 1 January. 1990–2005 |publisher=[[Statistics Norway]] |accessdate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114020929/http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/00/20/nos_svalbard_en/nos_d330_en/tab/045.html |archivedate=14 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demographics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/00/20/nos_svalbard_en/nos_d330_en/tab/049.html |title=Non-Norwegian population in Longyearbyen, by nationality.

[[File:BarentsburgFromDock.JPG|thumb|The dock house in [[Barentsburg]]]]
In 2016, Svalbard had a population of 2,667, of which 423 were Russian and Ukrainian, 10 Polish and 322 non-Norwegians living in Norwegian settlements.&lt;ref name="islandsize" /&gt; The largest non-Norwegian groups in Longyearbyen in 2005 were from Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Germany.&lt;ref name=demographics /&gt;

[[Longyearbyen]] is the largest settlement on the archipelago, the seat of the governor and the only town to be incorporated.

[[Ny-Ålesund]] is a permanent settlement based entirely around research. Formerly a mining town, it is still a [[company town]] operated by the Norwegian state-owned [[Kings Bay (company)|Kings Bay]]. While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work.&lt;ref name=chp10 /&gt; Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsbay.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=29 |title=Ny-Ålesund |publisher=[[Kings Bay (company)|Kings Bay]] |accessdate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310235351/http://www.kingsbay.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=29 |archivedate=10 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]] has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both outposts can also house temporary research staff.&lt;ref name=chp10 /&gt; Poland operates the [[Polish Polar Station]] at [[Hornsund]], with ten permanent residents.&lt;ref name=chp10 /&gt;

[[Barentsburg]] is the only permanently inhabited Russian settlement after [[Pyramiden]] was abandoned in 1998. It is a company town: all facilities are owned by Arktikugol, which operates a coal mine. In addition to the mining facilities, Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop, catering for tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen.&lt;ref name=chp10 /&gt; The village features facilities such as a school, library, sports center, community center, swimming pool, farm and greenhouse. Pyramiden features similar facilities; both are built in typical post-World War II Soviet architectural and planning style and contain the world's two most northerly [[list of statues of Lenin|Lenin statues]] and other [[socialist realism]] artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Umbreit (2005): 194–203&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, a handful of workers are stationed in the largely abandoned Pyramiden to maintain the infrastructure and run the hotel, which has been re-opened for tourists.

=== Religion ===
Most of the population is affiliated with the [[Church of Norway]]. Catholics on the archipelago are pastorally served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the [[Norwegian Antarctic Territory]], a part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a [[dependent territory|dependency]]. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower [[income tax]] than mainland Norway, and there is no [[value added tax]]. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a [[demilitarized zone]], as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the [[Norwegian Coast Guard]] as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.&lt;ref name=treaty /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Svalbard Treaty |publisher=[[Governor of Svalbard]] |url=http://www.sysselmannen.no/hovedEnkel.aspx?m=45301 |accessdate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723003932/http://www.sysselmannen.no/hovedEnkel.aspx?m=45301 |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--All content is sourced in the first, secondary source, with the primary sources provided for the convenience of the reader--&gt;

In September 2010 a treaty was made between Russia and Norway fixing the boundary between the Svalbard archipelago and the [[Novaya Zemlya archipelago]]. Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute. The agreement takes into account the relative positions of the archipelagos, rather than being based simply on northward extension of the continental border of Norway and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/world/europe/16russia.html "Russia and Norway Agree on Boundary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211175859/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/world/europe/16russia.html |date=11 December 2016 }} article by Andrew E.

The three main industries on Svalbard are [[coal mining]], [[tourism]], and [[research]]. In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK&amp;nbsp;2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK&amp;nbsp;317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK&amp;nbsp;142 million (16,098,404 USD)&lt;ref name=naering /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Currency Converter – MSN Money|url = http://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/currencyconverter/fi-NOK-USD?ocid=INSFICU10|website = www.msn.com|access-date = 19 January 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127151941/http://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/currencyconverter/fi-NOK-USD?ocid=INSFICU10|archivedate = 27 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK&amp;nbsp;494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland.&lt;ref name=focus /&gt; Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.&lt;ref name=residence /&gt;

Since the resettlement of Svalbard in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. [[Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani]], a subsidiary of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry]], operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks.&lt;ref name=naering /&gt; In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/18/norway-highnorth-idUSL5E7MI1GK20111118 |title=Norway mobilises for oil push into Arctic |last1=Gibbs |first1=Walter |last2=Koranyi |first2=Balazs |publisher=Reuters |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202014739/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/18/norway-highnorth-idUSL5E7MI1GK20111118 |archivedate=2 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of income for the area was, until 2015, visiting cruise ships. The Norwegian government became concerned about large numbers of cruise ship passengers suddenly landing at small settlements such as Ny-Ålesund, which is conveniently close to the barren-yet-picturesque [[Magdalenefjorden|Magdalena Fjord]]. With the increasing size of the larger ships, up to 2000 people can potentially appear in a community that normally numbers less than 40.

{{Main|Transport in Svalbard}}
[[File:Longyear01.jpg|thumb|[[Snowmobile]]s are an important mode of transport in Svalbard, such as here at Longyearbyen.]]

Within Longyearbyen, Barentsburg, and Ny-Ålesund, there are road systems, but they do not connect with each other. [[Off-road]] motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg ({{convert|45|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and Pyramiden ({{convert|100|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is possible by snowmobile in winter, or by ship all year round. All settlements have ports and Longyearbyen has a bus system.&lt;ref&gt;Umbriet (1997): 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]], located {{convert|3|km|0}} from Longyearbyen, is the only airport offering air transport off the archipelago. [[Scandinavian Airlines]] has daily scheduled services to [[Tromsø]] and [[Oslo]]. Low-cost carrier [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] also has a service between Oslo and Svalbard, operating three or four times a week; there are also irregular charter services to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Direkteruter |publisher=[[Avinor]] |url=http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/svalbard/direkteruter |language=Norwegian |accessdate=9 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302033736/http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/svalbard/direkteruter |archivedate=2 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnair]] announced commencement of service from Helsinki, operating three times a week starting 1 June 2016 and lasting until 27 August 2016, but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route, citing the 1978 bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finnair opens twelve new scheduled routes and increases frequencies for summer 2016 |publisher=[[Finnair]] |url=http://www.finnairgroup.com/mediaen/mediaen_7.html?Id=xml_1959049.html |accessdate=2 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208164319/http://www.finnairgroup.com/mediaen/mediaen_7.html?Id=xml_1959049.html |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebarentsobserver.com/industry/2016/03/finnair-denied-route-longyearbyen|title=Finnair denied route to Longyearbyen|work=thebarentsobserver.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804041859/http://thebarentsobserver.com/industry/2016/03/finnair-denied-route-longyearbyen|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icepeople.net/2016/03/30/finnair-grounded-norway-refuses-to-allow-direct-flights-between-helsinki-and-svalbard-citing-1978-agreement/|title=Finnair grounded: Norway refuses to allow direct flights between Helsinki and Svalbard, citing 1978 agreement – icepeople|website=icepeople.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017170841/http://icepeople.net/2016/03/30/finnair-grounded-norway-refuses-to-allow-direct-flights-between-helsinki-and-svalbard-citing-1978-agreement/|archivedate=17 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lufttransport]] provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to [[Ny-Ålesund Airport]] and [[Svea Airport]] for Kings Bay and Store Norske; these flights are in general not available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charterflygning |publisher=[[Lufttransport]] |url=http://www.lufttransport.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=65 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=9 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719150354/http://www.lufttransport.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=65 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[heliport]]s in Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and helicopters are frequently used by the governor and to a lesser extent the mining company Arktikugol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/2008-2009/stmeld-nr-22-2008-2009-/11.html?id=555023 |title=St.meld. nr. 22 (2008–2009): Svalbard |publisher=[[Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |chapter=11 Sjø og luft – transport, sikkerhet, redning og beredskap |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BHPRZEI?url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/2008-2009/stmeld-nr-22-2008-2009-/11.html?id=555023 |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==

{{Main|Climate of Svalbard}}

[[File:Spitzbergen-2 hg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spitsbergen]] during August]]
The climate of Svalbard is dominated by its high latitude, with the average summer temperature at {{convert|4|to|6|C|0}} and January averages at {{convert|−16|to|−12|C|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.met.no/observasjoner/svalbard/normaler_for_kommune_2111.html?kommuner |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717125106/http://retro.met.no/observasjoner/svalbard/normaler_for_kommune_2111.html?kommuner |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2012 |title=Temperaturnormaler for Spitsbergen i perioden 1961–1990 |publisher=[[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]] |accessdate=24 March 2010 |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Spitsbergen Current]], the northernmost branch of the [[North Atlantic Current]] system, moderates Svalbard's temperatures, particularly during winter. Winter temperatures in Svalbard are up to {{convert|2|C-change|0}} higher than those at similar latitudes in Russia and Canada. The warm Atlantic water keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year. The interior fjord areas and valleys, sheltered by the mountains, have larger temperature differences than the coast, giving about {{convert|2|C-change|0}} warmer summer temperatures and {{convert|3|C-change|0}} colder winter temperatures. On the south of Spitsbergen, the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west. During winter, the temperature difference between south and north is typically {{convert|5|C-change|0}}, and about {{convert|3|C-change|0}} in summer. [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] has average temperatures even higher than the rest of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;Torkilsen (1984): 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Svalbard is where cold polar air from the north and mild, wet sea air from the south meet, creating low pressure, changeable weather and strong winds, particularly in winter; in January, a strong breeze is registered 17% of the time at [[Isfjord Radio]], but only 1% of the time in July. In summer, particularly away from land,{{clarify|date=March 2014}} fog is common, with visibility under {{convert|1|km|1}} registered 20% of the time in July and 1% of the time in January, at Hopen and Bjørnøya.&lt;ref name=t101 /&gt; Precipitation is frequent, but falls in small quantities, typically less than {{convert|400|mm}} per year in western Spitsbergen. More rain falls on the uninhabited east side, where there can be more than {{convert|1000|mm}}.&lt;ref name=t101 /&gt;

2016 was the warmest year on record at Svalbard Airport, with a remarkable mean temperature of {{convert|0.0|C}}, {{convert|7.5|C-change}} above the 1961–90 average, and more comparable to a location at the arctic circle. The coldest temperature of the year was as high as {{convert|-18|C}}, warmer than the mean minimum in a normal January, February or March. There was also the same number of days with rain falling as snow falling, when there are normally more than twice as many snow days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tutiempo.net/climate/2016/ws-10080.html|title=Climate Svalbard Lufthavn (Year 2016) – Climate data (10080)|first=Tutiempo Network,|last=S.L.|work=tutiempo.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108094116/http://en.tutiempo.net/climate/2016/ws-10080.html|archivedate=8 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty species of bird are found on Svalbard, most of which are migratory. The [[Barents Sea]] is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million individuals during late summer. The most common are [[little auk]], [[northern fulmar]], [[thick-billed murre]] and [[black-legged kittiwake]]. Sixteen species are on the [[IUCN Red List]]. Particularly Bjørnøya, [[Storfjorden, Svalbard|Storfjorden]], [[Nordvest-Spitsbergen Land National Park|Nordvest-Spitsbergen]] and Hopen are important [[breeding ground]] for seabirds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8011">'''''Sweden v. Yamaguchi''''', otherwise known as ''in the matter of [[Marianne Wilson]]'', or ''in the matter of [[Mary Ann Vaughn]]'', is a highly complex decision in international [[family law]] which touches on questions in law still unresolved over fifty years later.  The formal name of the action was ''Israel Karl-Gustav Eugene Lagerfelt v. Yamaguchi Masakatsu and Yamaguchi Hideko'', or ''Case of Demand for Delivery of an Infant'', No. Wa-154, 1956 Yokohama District Court (Yokohama Chiho-saiban-sho), initiated February 22, 1956. On December 5, 1956, it held that the defendants should deliver the infant to the plaintiff. The appeal was dismissed by [[Tokyo High Court]] (No. Ne-2824) on July 9, 1958.

== Case ==
The case was brought by Consul Baron [[Karl-Gustav Lagerfelt]] on behalf of the King of Sweden as petitioner for guardianship of Mary Ann Vaughn, the daughter of a Swedish national in Japan, against the Yamaguchi family, ''de facto'' custodians of the eight-year-old child, to answer the questions of custody, guardianship and citizenship of Mary Ann Vaughn, also known as Marianne Wilson.

The case was decided in Yokohama District Court in 1956, and sustained upon appeal by defendants to the Tokyo High Court in 1958.  Defendants declined appeal to the [[Japanese Supreme Court]], and custody was granted to the Swedish Crown.  Mary Ann Vaughn, to be thenceforth known as Marianne Wilson, was granted Swedish citizenship and remained in the custody of the Swedish [[Ambassador]]s to Japan Tage Grönfall and later Frederick Almquist in Tokyo.

== Parental history ==
Mary Ann Vaughn was born the only child of James A. Vaughn (b. May 7, 1925) and Vivienne Joy Wilson (b. November 2, 1929), in [[Bluff Hospital]] in [[Yokohama]], Japan on April 17, 1949.  Her father was a US national employed under contract with the United States Military Administration of [[Occupied Japan]].  Her mother was a Swedish National, of three generations of Swedish citizens resident in Japan.  She was descended from  [[John Wilson (Captain)]] and [[Sophia Wilson]], née Naka [[Yamazaki (family)|Yamazaki]] (great-grandparents) through their youngest son Professor John Wilson (grandfather).

== Birth ==
Due to the sensitive nature of Vaughn's employment, the US Military Administration declined to allow Vaughn to marry under civil law at the [[US Embassy in Tokyo]]. Vaughn and Vivienne Wilson were married under religious ceremony in Yokohama, Japan on 8 May 1948.

The [[Department of State]] declined Vaughn's request to allow his wife to immigrate to the United States, due to the absence of a licit civil license.  During this time, Japan was under US Law as [[Occupied Japan]].  In addition, Japan had traditionally ignored the marriages of foreigners.  As foreigners had no licit [[koseki]], or Japanese family record, there was no method for registration of foreigner marriages within Japan.  As Vaughn was a civilian employee of the United States, his marriage did not come under the terms of permissible [[immigration]] stipulated for US Military Service Personnel who married foreign women (see [[War-bride]]).  Due to the absence of recognized civil marriage, James and Vivienne allegedly suffered harassment by US and Japanese authorities.

Upon learning that his wife was pregnant, Vaughn returned to the United States to seek permission for immigration of his pregnant wife. He received assistance from [[Patrick McCarran]], senator from Nevada, who sponsored private legislation permitting the immigration of Vivienne Joy Wilson to the United States for the purpose of legitimizing their marriage; and recognizing his daughter, Mary Ann Vaughn, who had been born in Yokohama during the interim, as his natural-born daughter.  Private legislation was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law on 5 August 1950. ''(81st Congress 2nd Session, v.64 part 2, Chapter 596, [[Act of Congress|Private Law]] 722, For the relief of Vivienne Joy Wilson and minor daughter Mary Ann Vaughn)''

However, Vivienne had been weakened by the privations of World War II, and contracted [[tuberculosis]] during James Vaughn's absence, during which Mary Ann was cared for by a nanny, Fumi.  She died on 5 August 1950, the very day of passage of private legislation permitting her to immigrate to the United States.

== Early life ==
After the death of her mother, Mary Ann Vaughn was placed under the guardianship of Professor John Wilson, with nanny Fumi Kaneko (later Fumi Yamaguchi) in custodial care.  Due to the privations of the postwar period, John Wilson sailed to Sweden with his wife and children in 1952.  Mary Ann was to accompany them, but due to an outbreak of whooping cough, she was to sail on the next ship.  However, Yamaguchi absconded with Mary Ann, and Yamaguchi destroyed the child's records, raising her under claim of an abandoned American orphan in the slums of Yokohama.

John Wilson continued to search for Mary Ann, and with the intervention of the [[AJCAJAO]] ([[American Joint Committee for Assisting Japanese-American Orphans]]), the [[Red Cross]] of Sweden and the [[International Red Cross]], found and identified her in Yokohama in 1955.  The AJCAJAO identified her residency with Masakatsu Yamaguchi and wife in Yokohama.  The Consul of the Royal Swedish Legation attempted to negotiate a custody settlement with the Yamaguchi family, but was unsuccessful.  The Crown then brought suit on behalf of Wilson for custody.

According to Fumi Kaneko (reading from her interview in Asahi Shinbun and Shukan Shincho), the baby was entrusted to her by Vivian at her death bed.  There was no mention of a search for the baby; instead Fumi Kaneko said she was the one who approached Swedish Embassy to recognize Mary Ann before she entered into grade school.

== Public notoriety ==
The case developed intense national publicity in Japan, with a great national sympathy towards the Yamaguchi family, to remain as custodian, with publication in the [[Kanagawa Shimbun]], [[Asahi Shimbun]] and Shukan Shincho Japanese [[periodicals]], especially in the [[shukanshi]], confrontational weekly magazines.  The case attracted considerable attention from the Japanese [[Leftist]]s, and became a focus of anti-American [[nationalism]] in Japan after World War II.  The United States government abjured involvement in the case, not offering to enter as participant or ''amicus'' in the hearing.

== Subsequent history ==
Mary Ann, now known as Marianne Wilson, remained in the custody of the Swedish Ambassador to Japan,  and attended the ASIJ, the [[American School in Japan]] in [[Chōfu, Tokyo]] [http://www.asij.ac.jp/ ASIJ], graduating in the 1960s.  She continued to visit the Yamaguchi family throughout their lifetime.  She retained her Swedish citizenship, and relocated to Sweden, working for the [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] for a time, before returning to Japan to settle as a permanent resident Swedish citizen in Japan.  She is married with one son, and lives in [[Tokyo]].  She remains in close contact with the John Wilson family of Sweden.

'''''Thibaudeau v Canada''''', [1995] 2 SCR 627 was one of a trilogy of equality rights cases published by a divided Supreme Court of Canada in the spring of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;The other two being ''[[Miron v Trudel]]'', [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418; ''[[Egan v Canada]]'', [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that the provisions of the ''Income Tax Act'' requiring an ex-wife to include among her taxable income amounts received from ex-husband as alimony for maintenance of children is not a violation of the ex-wife's equality rights under [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.

The '''Treaty of Petrópolis''', signed on November 11, 1903 in the Brazilian Imperial city of [[Petrópolis]], near [[Rio de Janeiro]], ended tensions between [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]] over the then-Bolivian territory of Acre (today the [[Acre (state)|Acre state]]),&lt;ref name="Freitas Dutra"/&gt; a desirable territory during the contemporary [[rubber boom]].&lt;ref name="Freitas Dutra"&gt;{{harvnb|Freitas Dutra|2005|pp=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty, drafted by Brazilian foreign affairs minister [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guerra|1955|pp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave Brazil the territory of Acre (191,000&amp;nbsp;km²), in exchange for over 3,000&amp;nbsp;km² of Brazilian territory between the [[Abunâ river|Abunâ]] and [[Madeira river|Madeira]] rivers, a monetary payment of two million British pounds, paid in two installments, and a pledge of a rail-link between the Bolivian city of [[Riberalta]] and the Brazilian city of [[Porto Velho]], which would bypass the [[rapids]] on the Madeira. 

The rail line was called the [[Madeira-Mamoré Railroad|Madeira-Mamoré Railway]]. It was supposed to go as far as Riberalta, on the Rio Beni, above that river's rapids, but had to stop short at Guajará-Mirim. This was actually the third such attempt. In the 1870s, during the rubber boom, the American George Church was defeated twice by the heat, the difficulty of the terrain and appalling loss of life from fever. The contract for the Madeira-Mamoré railway required by the treaty was won by another American, [[Percival Farquhar]]. Construction began in August 1907 and was completed on July 15, 1912.&lt;ref name=HV&gt;Revista História Viva, nº 14, pg 30-41. "Dossiê Madeira-Mamoré". Editora Duetto. [[São Paulo]]. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The project cost US$33 million. At least 3,600 men died building the 367&amp;nbsp;km of track Guajaramirin-Station (popular estimates say that each one hundred sleepers cost one human life). The Madeira-Mamoré railway had about a year of full operation before the combination of the collapse of rubber prices, the opening of a railway from Bolivia to the Pacific via Chile and of the Panama Canal rendered it uneconomical. It was kept in operation until 1972. 

The [[BR-364]] road eventual subsumed the route as railway bridges were taken over, leaving what remained of the track to enthusiasts to salvage what they could.

'''''United States v. Hamilton''''', 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 17 (1795), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which a defendant committed on a charge of [[treason]] was released on [[bail]], despite having been imprisoned upon a [[warrant of committal]] by a [[United States district court|district court]] judge.&lt;ref&gt;''Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the several courts of the United States, and of Pennsylvania: held at the seat of the federal government'', Volume 3 (Banks Law Pub. Co., 1905), pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] stated that "upon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where the punishment may be death, in which cases it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a district court, who shall exercise their discretion therein, regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence, and of the evidence, and the usages of law."&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States'', sess. i, chap. 20, {{USStat|1|73}} (1789), sec. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily, habeas corpus was used to release prisoners held by the judgment of the executive, but not for those who commitment had been authorized by a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Constitutional History of Habeas Corpus | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Duker, William | year=1980 | location=Wesport, Conn. | pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's attorney argued that the district court judge did not hold a hearing before issuing a warrant for his commitment to jail and that the affidavits alleging treasonous activity were weak, while the government urged that the Judiciary Act did not give the Supreme Court the jurisdiction to review the district court's decision unless there was new information or misconduct. The Supreme Court set bail, but without addressing either attorney's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''The United States v. Hamilton'', {{ussc|3|17|1795|Dall.|3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ventura Corporate Towers''' is an office building in the [[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|Centro]] neighbourhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, fronting the avenue between Chile and Lavradio, the street in front of the [[Rio de Janeiro Cathedral]]. It was built by Camargo Correa in partnership with [[Tishman Speyer]], who together invested 500,000,000 reais. Designed by [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] Associates, the building has achieved [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification, by presenting streamlined and intelligent use of water.
