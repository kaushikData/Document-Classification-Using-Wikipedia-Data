      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3529">In [[mathematics]], '''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence''', sometimes called '''right-left equivalence''', is an [[equivalence relation]] between [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]].

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be two [[manifold]]s, and let &lt;math&gt;f, g : (M,x) \to (N,y)&lt;/math&gt; be two smooth [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]]. We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-equivalent if there exist [[diffeomorphism]] germs &lt;math&gt;\phi : (M,x) \to (M,x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi : (N,y) \to (N,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi \circ f = g \circ \phi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, two [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]] are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-equivalent if one can be taken onto the other by a [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] change of co-ordinates in the source (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) and the target (i.e. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;).

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M_x,N_y)&lt;/math&gt; denote the space of smooth [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]] &lt;math&gt;(M,x) \to (N,y).&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\mbox{diff}(M_x)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[diffeomorphism]] germs &lt;math&gt;(M,x) \to (M,x)&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{diff}(N_y)&lt;/math&gt; be the group of [[diffeomorphism]] germs &lt;math&gt;(N,y) \to (N,y).&lt;/math&gt; The group &lt;math&gt; G := \mbox{diff}(M_x) \times \mbox{diff}(N_y)&lt;/math&gt; acts on &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M_x,N_y)&lt;/math&gt; in the natural way: &lt;math&gt; (\phi,\psi) \cdot f = \psi^{-1} \circ f \circ \phi.&lt;/math&gt; Under this action we see that the [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]] &lt;math&gt;f, g : (M,x) \to (N,y)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-equivalent if, and only if, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; lies in the [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt; g \in \mbox{orb}_G(f)&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa).

A map germ is called stable if its [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] under the [[Group action|action]] of &lt;math&gt; G := \mbox{diff}(M_x) \times \mbox{diff}(N_y)&lt;/math&gt; is [[open set|open]] relative to the [[Whitney topology]]. Since &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M_x,N_y)&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite dimensional space [[metric topology]] is no longer trivial. [[Whitney topology]] compares the differences in successive derivatives and gives a notion of proximity within the infinite dimensional space. A base for the [[open set]]s of the [[topology]] in question is given by taking &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-jets for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and taking [[open set|open]] [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]]s in the ordinary Euclidean sense. [[Open set]]s in the [[topology]] are then [[Union (set theory)|union]]s of
these base sets.

Consider the [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of some [[germ (mathematics)|map germ]] &lt;math&gt;orb_G(f).&lt;/math&gt; The [[germ (mathematics)|map germ]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called simple if there are only finitely many other [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s in a [[neighbourhood]] of each of its points. [[Vladimir Arnold]] has shown that the only simple [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] [[germ (mathematics)|map germs]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,0) \to (\mathbb{R},0)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1 \le n \le 3&lt;/math&gt; are the infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;), the infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;D_{4+k}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;E_6,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_7,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_8.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Betweenness''' is an [[algorithmic problem]] in [[order theory]] about ordering a collection of items subject to constraints that some items must be placed between others.&lt;ref name="cs98"&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 4
 | year = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown to be [[NP-complete]] by {{harvtxt|Opatrný|1979}}.&lt;ref name="o79"/&gt;

==Problem statement==
The input to a betweenness problem is a collection of [[ordered triple]]s of items. The items listed in these triples should be placed into a [[total order]], with the property that for each of the given triples, the middle item in the triple appears in the output somewhere between the other two items. The items of each triple are not required to be consecutive in the output.&lt;ref name="cs98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="o79"/&gt;

==Examples==
As an example, the collection of input triples
:(2,1,3), (3,4,5), (1,4,5), (2,4,1), (5,2,3)
is satisfied by the output ordering
:3, 1, 4, 2, 5
but not by
:3, 1, 2, 4, 5.
In the first of these output orderings, for all five of the input triples, the middle item of the triple appears between the other two items 
However, for the second output ordering, item 4 is not between items 1 and 2, contradicting the requirement given by the triple (2,4,1).

If an input contains two triples like (1,2,3) and (2,3,1) with the same three items but a different choice of the middle item, then there is no valid solution. However, there are more complicated ways of forming a set of triples with no valid solution, that do not contain such a pair of contradictory triples.

==Complexity==
{{harvtxt|Opatrný|1979}} showed that the [[Decision problem|decision version]] of the betweenness problem (in which an algorithm must decide whether or not there exists a valid solution) is [[NP-complete]] in two ways, by a [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from [[3-satisfiability]] and also by a different reduction from [[hypergraph]] [[graph coloring|2-coloring]].&lt;ref name="o79"&gt;{{citation

 | mr = 522973
 | pages = 111–114
 | title = Total ordering problem
 | volume = 8
 | year = 1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can easily be solved when all unordered triples of items are represented by an ordered triple of the input, by choosing one of the two items that are not between any others to be the start of the ordering and then using the triples involving this item to compare the relative positions of each pair of remaining items.

The related problem of finding an ordering that maximizes the number of satisfied triples is [[SNP (complexity)|MAXSNP-hard]], implying that it is impossible to achieve an [[approximation ratio]] arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;1 in [[polynomial time]] unless [[P = NP]].&lt;ref name="cs98"/&gt; It remains hard to solve or approximate even for dense instances that include an ordered triple for each possible unordered triple of items.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 1117–1129
 | title = Hardness of fully dense problems
 | volume = 205
 | year = 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The minimum version of the problem restricted to the tournaments was proven to have polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;One can achieve an approximation ratio of 1/3 (in expectation) by ordering the items randomly, and this simple strategy gives the best possible polynomial-time approximation if the [[unique games conjecture]] is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 40

In [[parameterized complexity]], the problem of satisfying as many constraints as possible from a set ''C'' of constraints is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] when parameterized by the difference ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;|''C''|/3 between the solution quality ''q'' found by the parameterized algorithm and the |''C''|/3 quality guaranteed in expectation by a random ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = Betweenness parameterized above tight lower bound
 | volume = 76
 | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not guaranteed to succeed, a [[greedy heuristic]] can find solutions to many instances of the betweenness problem arising in practice.&lt;ref name="sksl97"/&gt;

==Applications==
One application of betweenness arises in [[bioinformatics]], as part of the process of [[gene mapping]]. Certain types of genetic experiments can be used to determine the ordering of triples of genetic markers, but do not distinguish a genetic sequence from its reversal, so the information yielded from such an experiment determines only which one out of three markers is the middle one. The betweenness problem is an abstraction of the problem of assembling a collection of markers into a single sequence given experimental data of this type.&lt;ref name="cs98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sksl97"/&gt;

The betweenness problem has also been used to model theories of [[probability]], [[causality]], and [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''''Bijaganita'''''  was Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II]]'s treatise on [[algebra]]. It is the second volume of his main work ''[[Siddhānta Shiromani]],'' [[Sanskrit]] for "Crown of treatises,"{{sfn|Plofker|2009|p=71}} alongside ''[[Lilāvati]]'', ''Grahaganita'' and ''Golādhyāya''.{{sfn|Poulose|1991|p=79}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1238540/bija-ganita Bijaganita] [[Britannica.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The book is divided into six parts, mainly indeterminate equations, quadratic equations, simple equations, surds. The contents are:

* Introduction
* On Simple Equations
* On Quadratic Equations
* On Equations involving indeterminate Questions of the 1st Degree
* On Equations involving indeterminate Questions of the 2nd Degree
* On Equations involving Rectangles

In Bijaganita Bhāskara II refined [[Jayadeva]]'s way of generalization of Brahmagupta's approach to solving indeterminate quadratic equations, including Pell's equation which is known as [[chakravala method]] or cyclic method. Bijaganita is the first text to recognize that a positive number has two square roots

==Translations==
The translations or editions of the Bijaganita into English include:
* 1817. [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]], [https://archive.org/stream/algebrawitharith00brahuoft ''Algebra, with Arithmetic and mensuration, from the Sanscrit of Brahmegupta and Bháscara'']

In [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], a '''([[finitary]]) Boolean function''' (or switching function) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''B'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''B''', where '''B'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1} is a ''[[Boolean domain]]'' and ''k'' is a non-negative integer called the [[arity]] of the function.  In the case where ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the "function" is essentially a constant element of '''B'''.

Every ''k''-ary Boolean function can be expressed as a [[propositional formula]] in ''k'' variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and two propositional formulas are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] if and only if they express the same Boolean function. There are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''k''-ary functions for every&amp;nbsp;''k''.

==Boolean functions in applications==
A function that can be utilized to evaluate any Boolean output in relation to its Boolean input by logical type of calculations. Such functions play a basic role in questions of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] as well as the design of circuits and chips for [[digital computer]]s. The properties of Boolean functions play a critical role in [[cryptography]], particularly in the design of [[symmetric key algorithm]]s (see [[substitution box]]).

Boolean functions are often represented by sentences in [[propositional logic]], and sometimes as multivariate [[polynomial]]s over [[finite field|GF]](2), but more efficient representations are [[binary decision diagram]]s (BDD), [[negation normal form]]s, and [[propositional directed acyclic graph]]s (PDAG).

In [[cooperative game]] theory, monotone Boolean functions are called '''simple games''' (voting games); this notion is applied to solve problems in [[social choice theory]].

In [[statistics]], '''bootstrapping''' is any test or metric that relies on [[Sampling (statistics)#Replacement of selected units|random sampling with replacement]]. Bootstrapping allows assigning measures of accuracy (defined in terms of bias, variance, [[confidence interval]]s, prediction error or some other such measure) to sample estimates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Efron |first1= B. |authorlink1=Bradley Efron |last2= Tibshirani |first2= R. |authorlink2=Robert Tibshirani|title = An Introduction to the Bootstrap|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton, FL |year = 1993|isbn = 0-412-04231-2}} [http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/bootstrap.funs software] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712124533/http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/bootstrap.funs |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Thoughts on the Bootstrap - Bradley Efron, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.&lt;ref name= Varian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Bootstrap Methods." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BootstrapMethods.html&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, it falls in the broader class of [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]] methods.

Bootstrapping is the practice of estimating properties of an [[estimator]] (such as its [[variance]]) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. One standard choice for an approximating distribution is the [[empirical distribution function]] of the observed data. In the case where a set of observations can be assumed to be from an [[independent and identically distributed]] population, this can be implemented by constructing a number of  [[Resampling (statistics)|resamples]] with replacement, of the observed dataset (and of equal size to the observed dataset).

It may also be used for constructing [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]]. It is often used as an alternative to [[statistical inference]] based on the assumption of a parametric model when that assumption is in doubt, or where parametric inference is impossible or requires complicated formulas for the calculation of [[standard error]]s.

== Approach ==
The basic idea of bootstrapping is that inference about a population from sample data (sample → population) can be modelled by ''resampling'' the sample data and performing inference about a sample from resampled data (resampled → sample). As the population is unknown, the true error in a sample statistic against its population value is unknown. In bootstrap-resamples, the 'population' is in fact the sample, and this is known; hence the quality of inference of the 'true' sample from resampled data (resampled → sample) is measurable.

More formally, the bootstrap works by treating inference of the true probability distribution J, given the original data, as being analogous to inference of the empirical distribution Ĵ, given the resampled data. The accuracy of inferences regarding Ĵ using the resampled data can be assessed because we know Ĵ. If Ĵ is a reasonable approximation to J, then the quality of inference on J can in turn be inferred.

As an example, assume we are interested in the average (or [[mean]]) height of people worldwide.  We cannot measure all the people in the global population, so instead we sample only a tiny part of it, and measure that.  Assume the sample is of size N; that is, we measure the heights of N individuals.  From that single sample, only one estimate of the mean can be obtained.  In order to reason about the population, we need some sense of the [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] of the mean that we have computed. The simplest bootstrap method involves taking the original data set of N heights, and, using a computer, sampling from it to form a new sample (called a 'resample' or bootstrap sample) that is also of size N.  The bootstrap sample is taken from the original by using [[Simple random sample|sampling with replacement]] (e.g. we might 'resample' 5 times from [1,2,3,4,5] and get [2,5,4,4,1]), so, assuming N is sufficiently large, for all practical purposes there is virtually zero probability that it will be identical to the original "real" sample.  This process is repeated a large number of times (typically 1,000 or 10,000 times), and for each of these bootstrap samples we compute its mean (each of these are called bootstrap estimates).  We now can create a histogram of bootstrap means.  This histogram provides an estimate of the shape of the distribution of the sample mean from which we can answer questions about how much the mean varies across samples.  (The method here, described for the mean, can be applied to almost any other [[statistic]] or [[estimator]].)

== Discussion ==

{{no footnotes|section|date=June 2012}}

=== Advantages ===
A great advantage of bootstrap is its simplicity. It is a straightforward way to derive estimates of [[standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] and [[confidence intervals]] for complex estimators of complex parameters of the distribution, such as percentile points, proportions, odds ratio, and correlation coefficients. Bootstrap is also an appropriate way to control and check the stability of the results.  Although for most problems it is impossible to know the true confidence interval, bootstrap is asymptotically more accurate than the standard intervals obtained using sample variance and assumptions of normality.&lt;ref name=DiCiccio1996&gt;DiCiccio TJ, Efron B (1996) Bootstrap confidence intervals (with
Discussion). Statistical Science 11: 189-228&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
Although bootstrapping is (under some conditions) asymptotically [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]], it does not provide general finite-sample guarantees.  The apparent simplicity may conceal the fact that important assumptions are being made when undertaking the bootstrap analysis (e.g. independence of samples) where these would be more formally stated in other approaches.

=== Recommendations ===

The number of bootstrap samples recommended in literature has increased as available computing power has increased. If the results may have substantial real-world consequences, then one should use as many samples as is reasonable, given available computing power and time. Increasing the number of samples cannot increase the amount of information in the original data; it can only reduce the effects of random sampling errors which can arise from a bootstrap procedure itself. Moreover, there is evidence that numbers of samples greater than 100 lead to negligible improvements in the estimation of standard errors.&lt;ref&gt;Goodhue, D.L., Lewis, W., &amp; Thompson, R. (2012). Does PLS have advantages for small sample size or non-normal data? MIS Quarterly, 36(3), 981-1001.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the original developer of the bootstrapping method, even setting the number of samples at 50 is likely to lead to fairly good standard error estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Efron, B., Rogosa, D., &amp; Tibshirani, R. (2004). Resampling methods of estimation. In N.J. Smelser, &amp; P.B. Baltes (Eds.). International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences (pp. 13216-13220). New York, NY: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adèr et al. recommend the bootstrap procedure for the following situations:&lt;ref name=Ader/&gt;

:*When the theoretical distribution of a statistic of interest is complicated or unknown. Since the bootstrapping procedure is distribution-independent it provides an indirect method to assess the properties of the distribution underlying the sample and the parameters of interest that are derived from this distribution.

:*When the [[sample size]] is insufficient for straightforward statistical inference. If the underlying distribution is well-known, bootstrapping provides a way to account for the distortions caused by the specific sample that may not be fully representative of the population.

:* When [[statistical power|power calculations]] have to be performed, and a small pilot sample is available. Most power and sample size calculations are heavily dependent on the standard deviation of the statistic of interest. If the estimate used is incorrect, the required sample size will also be wrong. One method to get an impression of the variation of the statistic is to use a small pilot sample and perform bootstrapping on it to get impression of the variance.

However, Athreya has shown&lt;ref&gt;[https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1176350371 Bootstrap of the mean in the infinite variance case Athreya, K.B. ''Ann Stats'' vol 15 (2) 1987 724-731]&lt;/ref&gt; that if one performs a naive bootstrap on the sample mean when the underlying population lacks a finite variance (for example, a [[power law distribution]]), then the bootstrap distribution will not converge to the same limit as the sample mean. As a result, confidence intervals on the basis of a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] of the bootstrap could be misleading. Athreya states that "Unless one is reasonably sure that the underlying distribution is not [[Heavy-tailed distribution|heavy tailed]], one should hesitate to use the naive bootstrap".

== Types of bootstrap scheme ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=June 2012}}

In univariate problems, it is usually acceptable to resample the individual observations with replacement ("case resampling" below) unlike [[Resampling (statistics)#Subsampling|subsampling]], in which resampling is without replacement and is valid under much weaker conditions compared to the bootstrap. In small samples, a parametric bootstrap approach might be preferred. For other problems, a ''smooth bootstrap'' will likely be preferred.

For regression problems, various other alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;Efron B., R. J. Tibshirani, An introduction to the bootstrap, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case resampling ===
Bootstrap is generally useful for estimating the distribution of a statistic (e.g. mean, variance) without using normal theory (e.g. z-statistic, t-statistic). Bootstrap comes in handy when there is no analytical form or normal theory to help estimate the distribution of the statistics of interest, since bootstrap methods can apply to most random quantities, e.g., the ratio of variance and mean. There are at least two ways of performing case resampling.

# The Monte Carlo algorithm for case resampling is quite simple. First, we resample the data with replacement, and the size of the resample must be equal to the size of the original data set. Then the statistic of interest is computed from the resample from the first step. We repeat this routine many times to get a more precise estimate of the Bootstrap distribution of the statistic.
# The 'exact' version for case resampling is similar, but we exhaustively enumerate every possible resample of the data set. This can be computationally expensive as there are a total of &lt;math&gt;\binom {2n-1}n&lt;/math&gt; different resamples, where ''n'' is the size of the data set.

==== Estimating the distribution of sample mean ====
Consider a coin-flipping experiment. We flip the coin and record whether it lands heads or tails. Let {{nowrap|''X {{=}} x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} be 10 observations from the experiment. {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}} if the i th flip lands heads, and 0 otherwise. From normal theory, we can use [[Student's t-statistic|t-statistic]]  to estimate the distribution of the sample mean, &lt;math&gt; \bar{x} = \frac{1}{10} (x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{10})&lt;/math&gt;.

Instead, we use bootstrap, specifically case resampling, to derive the distribution of &lt;math&gt; \bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;. We first resample the data to obtain a ''bootstrap resample''. An example of the first resample might look like this {{nowrap|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Note that there are some duplicates since a bootstrap resample comes from sampling with replacement from the data. Note also that the number of data points in a bootstrap resample is equal to the number of data points in our original observations. Then we compute the mean of this resample and obtain the first ''bootstrap mean'': ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*. We repeat this process to obtain the second resample ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* and compute the second bootstrap mean ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*. If we repeat this 100 times, then we have ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, …, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;*.  This represents an ''empirical bootstrap distribution'' of sample mean. From this empirical distribution, one can derive a ''bootstrap confidence interval'' for the purpose of hypothesis testing.

==== Regression ====

In regression problems, ''case resampling'' refers to the simple scheme of resampling individual cases - often rows of a [[data set]]. For regression problems, so long as the data set is fairly large, this simple scheme is often acceptable. However, the method is open to criticism{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

In regression problems, the [[explanatory variable]]s are often fixed, or at least observed with more control than the response variable. Also, the range of the explanatory variables defines the information available from them. Therefore, to resample cases means that each bootstrap sample will lose some information. As such, alternative bootstrap procedures should be considered.

=== Bayesian bootstrap ===
Bootstrapping can be interpreted in a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] framework using a scheme that creates new datasets through reweighting the initial data. Given a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data points, the weighting assigned to data point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a new dataset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^J&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;w^J_i = x^J_i - x^J_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^J&lt;/math&gt; is a low-to-high ordered list of &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed random numbers on &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, preceded by 0 and succeeded by 1. The distributions of a parameter inferred from considering many such datasets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^J&lt;/math&gt; are then interpretable as [[posterior distribution]]s on that parameter.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. B. (1981). "The Bayesian bootstrap". ''[[Annals of Statistics]]'', 9, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smooth bootstrap ===
Under this scheme, a small amount of (usually normally distributed) zero-centered random noise is added onto each resampled observation. This is equivalent to sampling from a [[kernel density]] estimate of the data.

=== Parametric bootstrap ===
In this case a parametric model is fitted to the data, often by [[maximum likelihood]], and samples of [[random number generation|random numbers]] are drawn from this fitted model. Usually the sample drawn has the same sample size as the original data. Then the quantity, or estimate, of interest is calculated from these data. This sampling process is repeated many times as for other bootstrap methods. The use of a parametric model at the sampling stage of the bootstrap methodology leads to procedures which are different from those obtained by applying basic statistical theory to inference for the same model.

=== Resampling residuals ===
Another approach to bootstrapping in regression problems is to resample [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]]s. The method proceeds as follows.

# Fit the model and retain the fitted values &lt;math&gt;\hat y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the residuals &lt;math&gt;\hat{\epsilon}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i, (i = 1,\dots, n)&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each pair, (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), in which ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the (possibly multivariate) explanatory variable, add a randomly resampled residual, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\epsilon}_j&lt;/math&gt;, to the fitted value &lt;math&gt;\hat y_i&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, create synthetic response variables &lt;math&gt;y^*_i = \hat{y_i} + \hat{\epsilon}_j&lt;/math&gt; where ''j'' is selected randomly from the list (1, …, ''n'') for every ''i''.
# Refit the model using the fictitious response variables &lt;math&gt;y^*_i&lt;/math&gt;, and retain the quantities of interest (often the parameters, &lt;math&gt;\hat\mu^*_i&lt;/math&gt;, estimated from the synthetic &lt;math&gt;y^*_i&lt;/math&gt;).
# Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times.

This scheme has the advantage that it retains the information in the explanatory variables. However, a question arises as to which residuals to resample. Raw residuals are one option; another is [[studentized residuals]] (in linear regression). Although there are arguments in favour of using studentized residuals; in practice, it often makes little difference, and it is easy to compare the results of both schemes.

=== Gaussian process regression bootstrap ===
When data are temporally correlated, straightforward bootstrapping destroys the inherent correlations. This method uses Gaussian process regression to fit a probabilistic model from which replicates may then be drawn. [[Gaussian processes]] are methods from Bayesian [[non-parametric statistics]] but are here used to construct a parametric bootstrap approach,  which implicitly allows the time-dependence of the data to be taken into account.

=== Wild bootstrap ===
The Wild bootstrap, proposed originally by Wu (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Jackknife, bootstrap and other resampling methods in regression analysis (with discussions) | author=Wu, C.F.J. | journal=Annals of Statistics | year=1986 | volume=14 | pages=1261–1350 | doi=10.1214/aos/1176350142}}&lt;/ref&gt; is suited when the model exhibits [[heteroskedasticity]]. The idea is, like the residual bootstrap, to leave the regressors at their sample value, but to resample the response variable based on the residuals values. That is, for each replicate, one computes a new &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; based on

:&lt;math&gt;y^*_i = \hat{y}_i + \hat{\epsilon}_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;

so the residuals are randomly multiplied by a random variable &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; with mean 0 and variance 1. This method assumes that the 'true' residual distribution is symmetric and can offer advantages over simple residual sampling for smaller sample sizes. Different forms are used for the random variable &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, such as

:*The [[standard normal distribution]]

:*A distribution suggested by Mammen (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bootstrap and wild bootstrap for high dimensional linear models | author=Mammen, E. | journal=Annals of Statistics |date=Mar 1993 | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=255–285 | doi=10.1214/aos/1176349025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; v_i = \left\{\begin{matrix}
-(\sqrt{5} -1)/2 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } (\sqrt{5} +1)/(2\sqrt{5}) \\
(\sqrt{5} +1)/2 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } (\sqrt{5} -1)/(2\sqrt{5})
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;.

:::Approximately, Mammen's distribution is:

:::&lt;math&gt; v_i = \left\{\begin{matrix}
-0.6180 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } 0.7286 \\
1.6180 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } 0.2764
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

:*Or the simpler distribution, linked to the [[Rademacher distribution]]:

::&lt;math&gt; v_i = \left\{\begin{matrix}
-1 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } 1/2 \\
1 &amp; \mbox {with prob. } 1/2
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Block bootstrap ===

The block bootstrap is used when the data, or the errors in a model, are correlated. In this case, a simple case or residual resampling will fail, as it is not able to replicate the correlation in the data. The block bootstrap tries to replicate the correlation by resampling instead blocks of data. The block bootstrap has been used mainly with data correlated in time (i.e. time series) but can also be used with data correlated in space, or among groups (so-called cluster data).

==== Time series: Simple block bootstrap ====
In the (simple) block bootstrap, the variable of interest is split into non-overlapping blocks.

==== Time series: Moving block bootstrap ====

In the moving block bootstrap, introduced by Künsch (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Künsch |first=H. R. |year=1989 |title=The Jackknife and the Bootstrap for General Stationary Observations |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=1217–1241 |doi=10.1214/aos/1176347265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; data is split into n-b+1 overlapping blocks of length b: Observation 1 to b will be block 1, observation 2 to b+1 will be block 2 etc. Then from these n-b+1 blocks, n/b blocks will be drawn at random with replacement. Then aligning these n/b blocks in the order they were picked, will give the bootstrap observations.

This bootstrap works with dependent data, however, the bootstrapped observations will not be stationary anymore by construction. But, it was shown that varying randomly the block length can avoid this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Politis |first=D. N. |last2=Romano |first2=J. P. |year=1994 |title=The Stationary Bootstrap |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=89 |issue=428 |pages=1303–1313 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1994.10476870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is known as the ''stationary bootstrap.'' Other related modifications of the moving block bootstrap are the ''Markovian bootstrap'' and a stationary bootstrap method that matches subsequent blocks based on standard deviation matching.

==== Cluster data: block bootstrap ====
Cluster data describes data where many observations per unit are observed. This could be observing many firms in many states, or observing students in many classes. In such cases, the correlation structure is simplified, and one does usually make the assumption that data is correlated within a group/cluster, but independent between groups/clusters. The structure of the block bootstrap is easily obtained (where the block just corresponds to the group), and usually only the groups are resampled, while the observations within the groups are left unchanged. [[A. Colin Cameron|Cameron]] et al. (2008) discusses this for clustered errors in linear regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cameron |first=A. C. |first2=J. B. |last2=Gelbach |first3=D. L. |last3=Miller |year=2008 |title=Bootstrap-based improvements for inference with clustered errors |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=414–427 |doi=10.1162/rest.90.3.414  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of statistic ==

The bootstrap distribution of a point estimator of a population parameter has been used to produce a bootstrapped [[confidence interval]] for the parameter's true value, if the parameter can be written as a [[U statistic#statistical functional|function of the population's distribution]].

[[Population parameter]]s are estimated with many [[point estimator]]s. Popular families of point-estimators include [[UMVU|mean-unbiased minimum-variance estimator]]s, [[median-unbiased estimator]]s, [[Bayesian estimator]]s (for example, the [[posterior distribution]]'s [[Bayesian estimator#Posterior mode|mode]], [[Bayesian estimator#Posterior median|median]], [[Bayesian estimator#Posterior mean|mean]]), and [[maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimator]]s.

A Bayesian point estimator and a maximum-likelihood estimator have good performance when the sample size is infinite, according to [[asymptotic theory]]. For practical problems with finite samples, other estimators may be preferable. Asymptotic theory suggests techniques that often improve the performance of bootstrapped estimators; the bootstrapping of a maximum-likelihood estimator may often be improved using transformations related to [[pivotal quantity|pivotal quantities]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bootstrap methods and their application |last1=Davison|first1=A.

== Deriving confidence intervals from the bootstrap distribution ==

The bootstrap distribution of a parameter-estimator has been used to calculate [[confidence intervals]] for its population-parameter.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Bias, asymmetry, and confidence intervals ===
*'''Bias''': The bootstrap distribution and the sample may disagree systematically, in which case  [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] may occur.
*:If the bootstrap distribution of an estimator is symmetric, then percentile confidence-interval are often used; such intervals are appropriate especially for median-unbiased estimators of minimum risk (with respect to an [[absolute value|absolute]] [[loss function]]).  Bias in the bootstrap distribution will lead to bias in the confidence-interval.
*:Otherwise, if the bootstrap distribution is non-symmetric, then percentile confidence-intervals are often inappropriate.

=== Methods for bootstrap confidence intervals ===
There are several methods for constructing confidence intervals from the bootstrap distribution of a [[real number|real]] parameter:
*'''Basic Bootstrap''', which generates a '''pivotal confidence interval'''. The basic bootstrap is the simplest scheme to construct the confidence interval: one simply takes the empirical quantiles from the bootstrap distribution of the parameter (see Davison and Hinkley 1997, equ. 5.6 p.&amp;nbsp;194):
:&lt;math&gt; (2\hat\theta -\theta^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)},2\hat\theta -\theta^{*}_{(\alpha/2)})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \theta^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha/2 &lt;/math&gt; [[percentile]] of the bootstrapped coefficients &lt;math&gt; \theta^{*} &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Percentile Bootstrap'''. The percentile bootstrap proceeds in a similar way to the basic bootstrap, using percentiles of the bootstrap distribution, but with a different formula (note the inversion of the left and right quantiles!):

:&lt;math&gt; (\theta^{*}_{(\alpha/2)},\theta^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \theta^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha/2 &lt;/math&gt; [[percentile]] of the bootstrapped coefficients &lt;math&gt; \theta^{*} &lt;/math&gt;.
See Davison and Hinkley (1997, equ. 5.18 p.&amp;nbsp;203) and Efron and Tibshirani (1993, equ 13.5 p.&amp;nbsp;171).
This method can be applied to any statistic. It will work well in cases where the bootstrap distribution is symmetrical and centered on the observed statistic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where the sample statistic is median-unbiased and has maximum concentration (or minimum risk with respect to an absolute value loss function).  In other cases, the percentile bootstrap can be too narrow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} When working with small sample sizes (i.e., less than 50), the percentile confidence intervals for (for example) the [[variance]] statistic will be too narrow. So that with a sample of 20 points, 90% confidence interval will include the true variance only 78% of the time.&lt;ref name="DAEE"&gt;{{cite book |title=Design and Analysis of Ecological Experiments |last1=Scheiner|first1=S.|authorlink1=Sam Scheiner|year=1998 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn= 0412035618|mr=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some give a general warning against using the percentile bootstrap in favour of the basic bootstrap; according to Rice, "Although this direct equation of quantiles of the bootstrap sampling distribution with confidence limits may seem initially appealing, it’s rationale is somewhat obscure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=John|title=Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis|page=272|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orloff|first1=Jeremy|last2=Bloom|first2=Jonathan|title=Bootstrap confidence intervals|url=https://math.mit.edu/~dav/05.dir/class24-prep-a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Studentization|Studentized]] Bootstrap'''. The studentized bootstrap, also called bootstrap-t,  works similarly as the usual confidence interval, but replaces the quantiles from the normal or student approximation by the quantiles from the bootstrap distribution of the [[Student's t-test]] (see Davison and Hinkley 1997, equ. 5.7 p.&amp;nbsp;194 and Efron and Tibshirani 1993 equ 12.22, p.&amp;nbsp;160):

:&lt;math&gt; (\theta - t^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)}\cdot \hat{se}_{\theta},\theta-t^{*}_{(\alpha/2)}\cdot \hat{se}_{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; t^{*}_{(1-\alpha/2)} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha/2 &lt;/math&gt; [[percentile]] of the bootstrapped [[Student's t-test]] &lt;math&gt; t^{*}=(\hat{\theta}^{*}-\hat{\theta})/\hat{se}_{\hat{\theta}^*} &lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\hat{se}_{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; is the estimated standard error of the coefficient in the original model.

The studentized test enjoys optimal properties as the statistic that is bootstrapped is [[Pivotal quantity|pivotal]] (i.e. it does not depend on [[nuisance parameter]]s as the t-test follows asymptotically a N(0,1) distribution), unlike the percentile bootstrap.

=== Bootstrap hypothesis testing ===
Efron and Tibshirani&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggest the following algorithm for comparing the means of two independent samples:
Let &lt;math&gt; x_1, ..., x_n &lt;/math&gt; be a random sample from distribution F with mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; y_1, ..., y_m &lt;/math&gt; be another, independent random sample from distribution G with mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{y}&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y^2&lt;/math&gt;

# Calculate the test statistic &lt;math&gt; t = \frac{\bar{x}-\bar{y}}{\sqrt{\sigma_x^2/n + \sigma_y^2/m}} &lt;/math&gt;
#Create two new datasets &lt;math&gt; x_i^' = x_i - \bar{x} + \bar{z} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y_i^' = y_i - \bar{y} + \bar{z} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean of the combined sample.
# Draw a random sample (&lt;math&gt; x_i^* &lt;/math&gt;) of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with replacement from &lt;math&gt; x_i^' &lt;/math&gt; and another random sample (&lt;math&gt; y_i^* &lt;/math&gt;) of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; with replacement from &lt;math&gt; y_i^' &lt;/math&gt;.
# Calculate the test statistic &lt;math&gt; t^* = \frac{\bar{x^*}-\bar{y^*}}{\sqrt{\sigma_x^{*2}/n + \sigma_y^{*2}/m}} &lt;/math&gt;
#Repeat 3 and 4 &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; times (e.g. &lt;math&gt;B=1000&lt;/math&gt;) to collect &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; values of the test statistic.
# Estimate the p-value as &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{\# \{t^* \geq t\}}{B} &lt;/math&gt;




== Example applications ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=June 2012}}

=== Smoothed bootstrap ===
In 1878, [[Simon Newcomb]] took observations on the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/ Data from examples in ''Bayesian Data Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The data set contains two [[outlier]]s, which greatly influence the [[sample mean]].  (Note that the sample mean need not be a [[consistent estimator]] for any [[population mean]], because no mean need exist for a [[heavy-tailed distribution]].) A well-defined and  [[robust statistics|robust statistic]] for central tendency is the sample median, which is consistent and [[median-unbiased estimator|median-unbiased]] for the population median.

The bootstrap distribution for Newcomb's data appears below. A convolution method of regularization reduces the discreteness of the bootstrap distribution by adding a small amount of ''N''(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) random noise to each bootstrap sample. A conventional choice is  &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 1/\sqrt n&lt;/math&gt; for sample size ''n''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Histograms of the bootstrap distribution and the smooth bootstrap distribution appear below. The bootstrap distribution of the sample-median has only a small number of values. The smoothed bootstrap distribution has a richer [[support (measure theory)|support]].

[[File:MedianHists.png]]

In this example, the bootstrapped 95% (percentile) confidence-interval for the population median is (26, 28.5), which is close to the interval for  (25.98, 28.46) for the smoothed bootstrap.

== Relation to other approaches to inference ==

=== Relationship to other resampling methods ===
The bootstrap is distinguished from:
* the [[Jackknife resampling|jackknife]] procedure, used to estimate biases of sample statistics and to estimate variances, and
* [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]], in which the parameters (e.g., regression weights, factor loadings) that are estimated in one subsample are applied to another subsample.

For more details see [[resampling (statistics)#Bootstrap|bootstrap resampling]].

[[Bootstrap aggregating]] (bagging) is a [[meta-algorithm]] based on averaging the results of multiple bootstrap samples.

=== U-statistics ===
{{Main|U-statistic}}
In situations where an obvious statistic can be devised to measure a required characteristic using only a small number, ''r'', of data items, a corresponding statistic based on the entire sample can be formulated. Given an ''r''-sample statistic, one can create an ''n''-sample statistic by something similar to bootstrapping (taking the average of the statistic over all subsamples of size ''r''). This procedure is known to have certain good properties and the result is a [[U-statistic]]. The [[sample mean]] and [[sample variance]] are of this form, for ''r''=1 and ''r''=2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7202">In mathematics, the '''Cartan–Hadamard theorem''' is a statement in [[Riemannian geometry]] concerning the structure of complete [[Riemannian manifold]]s of non-positive [[sectional curvature]]. The theorem states that the [[universal cover]] of such a manifold is [[diffeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] via the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] at any point. It was first proved by [[Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt]] for [[surface (topology)|surface]]s in 1881, and independently by [[Jacques Hadamard]] in 1898.  [[Élie Cartan]] generalized the theorem to Riemannian manifolds in 1928 ({{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}; {{harvnb|do Carmo|1992}}; {{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1969}}). The theorem was further generalized to a wide class of [[metric space]]s by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]] in 1987; detailed proofs were published by {{harvtxt|Ballmann|1990}} for metric spaces of non-positive curvature and by {{harvtxt|Alexander|Bishop|1990}} for general locally convex metric spaces.

== Riemannian geometry ==
The Cartan–Hadamard theorem in conventional Riemannian geometry asserts that the [[universal covering space]] of a [[connected space|connected]] [[complete metric space|complete]] [[Riemannian manifold]] of non-positive [[sectional curvature]] is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In fact, for complete manifolds on non-positive curvature the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] based at any point of the manifold is a covering map.

The theorem holds also for [[Hilbert manifold]]s in the sense that the exponential map of a non-positively curved geodesically complete connected manifold is a covering map ({{harvnb|McAlpin|1965}}; {{harvnb|Lang|1991|loc=IX, §3}}). Completeness here is understood in the sense that the exponential map is defined on the whole [[tangent space]] of a point.

== Metric geometry ==
In [[metric geometry]], the Cartan–Hadamard theorem is the statement that the universal cover of a [[connectedness|connected]] non-positively curved complete metric space ''X'' is a [[Hadamard space]]. In particular, if ''X'' is [[simply connected]] then it is a geodesic space in the sense that any two points are connected by a unique minimizing geodesic, and hence [[contractible]].

A metric space ''X'' is said to be non-positively curved if every point ''p'' has a neighborhood ''U'' in which any two points are joined by a [[geodesic]], and for any point ''z'' in ''U'' and constant speed geodesic γ in ''U'', one has

: &lt;math&gt; d(z,\gamma(1/2))^2 \le \frac{1}{2}d(z,\gamma(0))^2 + \frac{1}{2}d(z,\gamma(1))^2 - \frac{1}{4}d(\gamma(0),\gamma(1))^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality may be usefully thought of in terms of a geodesic triangle Δ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''γ(0)γ(1).  The left-hand side is the square distance from the vertex ''z'' to the midpoint of the opposite side.  The right-hand side represents the square distance from the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side in a Euclidean triangle having the same side lengths as Δ.  This condition, called the [[CAT(k) space|CAT(0) condition]] is an abstract form of [[Toponogov's theorem|Toponogov's triangle comparison theorem]].

=== Generalization to locally convex spaces ===
The assumption of non-positive curvature can be weakened {{harv|Alexander|Bishop|1990}}, although with a correspondingly weaker conclusion.  Call a metric space ''X'' convex if, for any two constant speed minimizing geodesics ''a''(''t'') and ''b''(''t''), the function
:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto d(a(t),b(t))&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[convex function]] of ''t''.  A metric space is then locally convex if every point has a neighborhood that is convex in this sense.  The Cartan–Hadamard theorem for locally convex spaces states:

* If ''X'' is a locally convex complete connected metric space, then the universal cover of ''X'' is a convex geodesic space with respect to the [[intrinsic metric|induced length metric]] ''d''.

In particular, the universal covering of such a space is contractible. The convexity of the distance function along a pair of geodesics is a well-known consequence of non-positive curvature of a metric space, but it is not equivalent {{harv|Ballmann|1990}}.

== Significance ==
The Cartan–Hadamard theorem provides an example of a local-to-global correspondence in Riemannian and metric geometry: namely, a local condition (non-positive curvature) and a global condition (simple-connectedness) together imply a strong global property (contractibility); or in the Riemannian case, diffeomorphism with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

The metric form of the theorem demonstrates that a non-positively curved polyhedral cell complex is [[aspherical space|aspherical]]. This fact is of crucial importance for modern [[geometric group theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">In [[probability theory]], the '''Chung–Erdős inequality''' provides a lower bound on the probability that one out of many (possibly dependent) events occurs. The lower bound is expressed in terms of the probabilities for pairs of events.

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;A_1,\ldots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; be events. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\Pr[A_i]&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Then

}{

'''Conjunction introduction''' (often abbreviated simply as '''conjunction''' and also called '''and introduction''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=346–51 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. The rule makes it possible to introduce a [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] into a [[Formal proof|logical proof]]. It is the [[inference]] that if the [[proposition]] ''p'' is true, and proposition ''q'' is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions ''p and q'' is true. For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside". The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P,Q}{\therefore P \land Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, a "&lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''conjunction introduction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;P, Q \vdash P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] meaning that &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are each on lines of a proof in some [[formal system|logical system]];

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

[[File:Network Community Structure.svg|thumb|This graph becomes disconnected when the right-most node in the gray area on the left is removed]]
[[File:Sample-graph.jpg|thumb|This graph becomes disconnected when the dashed edge is removed.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''connectivity''' is one of the basic concepts of [[graph theory]]: it asks for the [[minimum]] number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes from each other.&lt;ref name="diestel"/&gt; It is closely related to the theory of [[flow network|network flow]] problems. The connectivity of a graph is an important measure of its resilience as a network.

==Connected graph==
[[File:UndirectedDegrees.svg|thumb|With vertex 0, this graph is disconnected. The rest of the graph is connected.]]
A graph is '''connected''' when there is a path between every pair of vertices. In a connected graph, there are no '''unreachable''' vertices. A graph that is not connected is '''disconnected'''. A graph G is said to be '''disconnected''' if there exist two nodes in G such that no path in G has those nodes as endpoints.&lt;br&gt;
A graph with just one vertex is connected. An [[Null graph|edgeless]] graph with two or more vertices is disconnected.

==Definitions of components, cuts and connectivity==
In an [[undirected graph]] {{mvar|G}}, two ''[[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]'' {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are called connected if {{mvar|G}} contains a [[Path (graph theory)|path]] from {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}}. Otherwise, they are called ''disconnected''. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length {{math|1}}, i.e. by a single edge, the vertices are called ''adjacent''. A [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.

A ''[[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]'' is a maximal connected subgraph of {{mvar|G}}. Each vertex belongs to exactly one connected component, as does each edge.

A [[directed graph]] is called ''weakly connected'' if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph. It is connected if it contains a directed path from {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}} or a directed path from {{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|u}} for every pair of vertices {{mvar|u, v}}. It is ''strongly connected'', ''diconnected'', or simply ''strong'' if it contains a directed path from {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}} and a directed path from {{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|u}} for every pair of vertices {{mvar|u, v}}. The ''[[strongly connected component|strong components]]'' are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs.

A ''[[Cut (graph theory)|cut]]'', ''vertex cut'', or ''separating set'' of a connected graph {{mvar|G}} is a set of vertices whose removal renders {{mvar|G}} disconnected. The ''connectivity'' or ''[[K-vertex-connected graph|vertex connectivity]]'' {{math|''κ''(''G'')}} (where {{mvar|G}} is not a [[complete graph]]) is the size of a minimal vertex cut. A graph is called ''{{mvar|k}}-connected'' or ''{{mvar|k}}-vertex-connected'' if its vertex connectivity is {{mvar|k}} or greater.

More precisely, any graph {{mvar|G}} (complete or not) is said to be ''{{mvar|k}}-connected'' if it contains at least {{math|''k''+1}} vertices, but does not contain a set of {{math|''k'' − 1}} vertices whose removal disconnects the graph; and {{math|''κ''(''G'')}} is defined as the largest {{mvar|k}} such that {{mvar|G}} is {{mvar|k}}-connected. In particular, a [[complete graph]] with {{mvar|n}} vertices, denoted {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has no vertex cuts at all, but {{math|''κ''(''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n'' − 1}}. A ''vertex cut'' for two vertices {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} is a set of vertices whose removal from the graph disconnects {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}. The ''local connectivity'' {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'')}} is the size of a smallest vertex cut separating {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}. Local connectivity is symmetric for undirected graphs; that is, {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'') {{=}} ''κ''(''v'', ''u'')}}.  Moreover, except for complete graphs, {{math|''κ''(''G'')}} equals the minimum of {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'')}} over all nonadjacent pairs of vertices {{mvar|u, v}}.

{{math|2}}-connectivity is also called ''[[biconnected graph|biconnectivity]]'' and {{math|3}}-connectivity is also called ''triconnectivity''. A graph {{mvar|G}} which is connected but not {{math|2}}-connected is sometimes called ''separable''.

Analogous concepts can be defined for edges. In the simple case in which cutting a single, specific edge would disconnect the graph, that edge is called a ''[[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]]''. More generally, an edge cut of {{mvar|G}} is a set of edges whose removal renders the graph disconnected. The ''[[edge-connectivity]]'' {{math|''λ''(''G'')}} is the size of a smallest edge cut, and the local edge-connectivity {{math|''λ''(''u'', ''v'')}} of two vertices {{mvar|u, v}} is the size of a smallest edge cut disconnecting {{mvar|u}} from {{mvar|v}}. Again, local edge-connectivity is symmetric. A graph is called ''{{mvar|k}}-edge-connected'' if its edge connectivity is {{mvar|k}} or greater.

A graph is said to be ''maximally connected'' if its connectivity equals its minimum degree. A graph is said to be ''maximally edge-connected'' if its edge-connectivity equals its minimum degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Super- and hyper-connectivity===
A graph is said to be ''super-connected'' or ''super-κ'' if every minimum vertex cut isolates a vertex. A graph is said to be ''hyper-connected'' or ''hyper-κ'' if the deletion of each minimum vertex cut creates exactly two components, one of which is an isolated vertex. A graph is ''semi-hyper-connected'' or ''semi-hyper-κ'' if any minimum vertex cut separates the graph into exactly two components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Qinghai|last2=Zhang|first2=Zhao|date=2010-03-01|title=The existence and upper bound for two types of restricted connectivity|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235246832_The_existence_and_upper_bound_for_two_types_of_restricted_connectivity|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=158|pages=516–521|doi=10.1016/j.dam.2009.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cutset {{mvar|X}} of {{mvar|G}} is called a non-trivial cutset if {{mvar|X}} does not contain the neighborhood {{math|N(u)}} of any vertex {{math|u ∉ X}}. Then the ''superconnectivity'' κ1 of G is:
: κ1(G) = min{|X| : X is a non-trivial cutset}.

A non-trivial edge-cut and the ''edge-superconnectivity'' λ1(G) are defined analogously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balbuena|first=Camino|last2=Carmona|first2=Angeles|date=2001-10-01|title=On the connectivity and superconnectivity of bipartite digraphs and graphs|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.101.1458&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Ars Combinatorica|volume=61|pages=3–22|citeseerx=10.1.1.101.1458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Menger's theorem==
{{main article|Menger's theorem}}

One of the most important facts about connectivity in graphs is [[Menger's theorem]], which characterizes the connectivity and edge-connectivity of a graph in terms of the number of independent paths between vertices.

If {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are vertices of a graph {{mvar|G}}, then a collection of paths between {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} is called independent if no two of them share a vertex (other than {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} themselves). Similarly, the collection is edge-independent if no two paths in it share an edge. The number of mutually independent paths between {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} is written as {{math|''κ′''(''u'', ''v'')}}, and the number of mutually edge-independent paths between {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} is written as {{math|''λ′''(''u'', ''v'')}}.

Menger's theorem asserts that for distinct vertices ''u'',''v'', {{math|''λ''(''u'', ''v'')}} equals {{math|''λ′''(''u'', ''v'')}}, and if ''u'' is also not adjacent to ''v'' then {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'')}} equals {{math|''κ′''(''u'', ''v'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algorithmic Graph Theory| author=Gibbons, A.|year=1985|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algorithmic Aspects of Graph Connectivity|author1=Nagamochi, H. |author2=Ibaraki, T. | year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact is actually a special case of the [[max-flow min-cut theorem]].

==Computational aspects==
The problem of determining whether two vertices in a graph are connected can be solved efficiently using a [[search algorithm]], such as [[breadth-first search]].  More generally, it is easy to determine computationally whether a graph is connected (for example, by using a [[Disjoint-set data structure#Applications|disjoint-set data structure]]), or to count the number of connected components. A simple algorithm might be written in [[pseudo-code]] as follows:

#Begin at any arbitrary node of the graph, {{mvar|G}}
#Proceed from that node using either depth-first or breadth-first search, counting all nodes reached.
#Once the graph has been entirely traversed, if the number of nodes counted is equal to the number of nodes of {{mvar|G}}, the graph is connected; otherwise it is disconnected.

By Menger's theorem, for any two vertices {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} in a connected graph {{mvar|G}}, the numbers {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'')}} and {{math|''λ''(''u'', ''v'')}} can be determined efficiently using the [[Max flow min cut|max-flow min-cut]] algorithm.  The connectivity and edge-connectivity of {{mvar|G}} can then be computed as the minimum values of {{math|''κ''(''u'', ''v'')}} and {{math|''λ''(''u'', ''v'')}}, respectively.

In computational complexity theory, [[SL (complexity)|SL]] is the class of problems [[log-space reducible]] to the problem of determining whether two vertices in a graph are connected, which was proved to be equal to [[L (complexity)|L]] by [[Omer Reingold]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Omer|last=Reingold|authorlink=Omer Reingold|title=Undirected connectivity in log-space|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]]|year=2008|volume=55|issue=4|pages=Article 17, 24 pages| doi=10.1145/1391289.1391291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, undirected graph connectivity may be solved in {{math|O(log ''n'')}} space.

The problem of computing the probability that a [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] random graph is connected is called network reliability and the problem of computing whether two given vertices are connected the ST-reliability problem. Both of these are [[sharp-P|#P]]-hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Examples==
* The vertex- and edge-connectivities of a disconnected graph are both {{math|0}}.
* {{math|1}}-connectedness is equivalent to connectedness for graphs of at least 2 vertices.
* The [[complete graph]] on {{mvar|n}} vertices has edge-connectivity equal to {{math|''n'' − 1}}. Every other simple graph on {{mvar|n}} vertices has strictly smaller edge-connectivity.
* In a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], the local edge-connectivity between every pair of vertices is {{math|1}}.

== Bounds on connectivity ==
* The vertex-connectivity of a graph is less than or equal to its edge-connectivity. That is, {{math|''κ''(''G'') ≤ ''λ''(''G'')}}. Both are less than or equal to the [[Degree (graph theory)|minimum degree]] of the graph, since deleting all neighbors of a vertex of minimum degree will disconnect that vertex from the rest of the graph.&lt;ref name="diestel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diestel|first=R.|url=http://diestel-graph-theory.com/GrTh.html|title=Graph Theory, Electronic Edition|date=2005|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a [[vertex-transitive graph]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{mvar|d}}, we have: {{math|2(''d'' + 1)/3 ≤ ''κ''(''G'') ≤ ''λ''(''G'') {{=}} ''d''}}.&lt;ref name="GandR"&gt;{{cite book|title=Algebraic Graph Theory| last1=Godsil | first1=C. |author1-link=Chris Godsil| last2=Royle| first2=G.| author2-link=Gordon Royle|year=2001|publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a [[vertex-transitive graph]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|''d'' ≤ 4}}, or for any (undirected) minimal [[Cayley graph]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{mvar|d}}, or for any [[symmetric graph]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{mvar|d}}, both kinds of connectivity are equal: {{math|''κ''(''G'') {{=}} ''λ''(''G'') {{=}} ''d''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction|series=Technical Report TR-94-10|author=Babai, L.|authorlink=László Babai|year=1996|publisher=University of Chicago|url=http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611212234/http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}} Chapter 27 of ''The Handbook of Combinatorics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other properties ==
* Connectedness is preserved by [[graph homomorphism]]s.
* If {{mvar|G}} is connected then its [[line graph]] {{math|''L''(''G'')}} is also connected.
* A graph {{mvar|G}} is {{math|2}}-edge-connected [[if and only if]] it has an orientation that is strongly connected.
* [[Balinski's theorem]] states that the [[polytopal graph]] ({{math|1}}-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]]) of a {{mvar|k}}-dimensional convex [[polytope]] is a {{mvar|k}}-vertex-connected graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Balinski, M.

* According to a theorem of [[Gabriel Andrew Dirac|G. A. Dirac]], if a graph is {{mvar|k}}-connected for {{math|''k'' ≥ 2}}, then for every set of {{mvar|k}} vertices in the graph there is a cycle that passes through all the vertices in the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dirac | first = Gabriel Andrew | authorlink = Gabriel Andrew Dirac | journal = [[Mathematische Nachrichten]] | pages = 61–85 | title = In abstrakten Graphen vorhandene vollständige 4-Graphen und ihre Unterteilungen | volume = 22 | year = 1960 | mr = 0121311 | doi = 10.1002/mana.19600220107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flandrin | first1 = Evelyne | last2 = Li | first2 = Hao

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28019">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[algebra]], the''' ''n''th cyclotomic polynomial''', for any positive [[integer]] ''n'', is the unique [[irreducible polynomial]] with integer coefficients that is a [[divisor]] of &lt;math&gt;x^n-1&lt;/math&gt; and is not a divisor of &lt;math&gt;x^k-1&lt;/math&gt; for any {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; ''n''.}} Its [[root of a function|roots]] are all ''n''th [[primitive root of unity|primitive roots of unity]] 
&lt;math&gt;
e^{2i\pi\frac{k}{n}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k'' runs over the positive integers not greater than ''n'' and [[coprime integers|coprime]] to ''n''. In other words, the''' ''n''th cyclotomic polynomial''' is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_n(x) =
\prod_\stackrel{1\le k\le n}{\gcd(k,n)=1}
\left(x-e^{2i\pi\frac{k}{n}}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

It may also be defined as the [[monic polynomial]] with integer coefficients that is the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] over the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of the [[rational number]]s of any [[Root of unity#Definition|primitive ''n''th-root of unity]] (&lt;math&gt; e^{2i\pi/n} &lt;/math&gt; is an example of such a root).

An important relation linking cyclotomic polynomials and primitive roots of unity is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{d\mid n}\Phi_d(x) = x^n - 1,&lt;/math&gt;
showing that {{math|''x''}} is a root of &lt;math&gt;x^n - 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is a ''d''{{space|hair}}th primitive roots of unity for some ''d'' that divides ''n''.

==Examples==

If ''n'' is a [[prime number]], then 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{n-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''n'' = 2''p'' where ''p'' is an odd [[prime number]], then
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{2p}(x) = 1-x+x^2-\cdots+x^{p-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} (-x)^k.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n'' up to 30, the cyclotomic polynomials are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A013595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of the 105th cyclotomic polynomial is interesting because 105 is the lowest integer that is the product of three distinct odd prime numbers (3*5*7) and this polynomial is the first one that has a [[coefficient]] other than 1, 0, or −1:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Phi_{105}(x) &amp;= x^{48} + x^{47} + x^{46} - x^{43} - x^{42} - 2 x^{41} - x^{40} - x^{39} + x^{36} + x^{35} + x^{34} + x^{33} + x^{32} + x^{31} - x^{28} - x^{26} \\

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

===Fundamental tools===

The cyclotomic polynomials are monic polynomials with integer coefficients that are [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the field of the rational numbers. Except for ''n'' equal to 1 or 2, they are [[Reciprocal polynomial#Palindromic polynomial|palindromic]]s of even degree.

The degree of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words the number of ''n''th primitive roots of unity, is &lt;math&gt;\varphi (n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]].

The fact that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\varphi (n)&lt;/math&gt; in the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;\Z[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a nontrivial result due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Lang Algebra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the chosen definition, it is either the value of the degree or the irreducibility which is a nontrivial result. The case of prime ''n'' is easier to prove than the general case, thanks to [[Eisenstein's criterion#Cyclotomic polynomials|Eisenstein's criterion]].

A fundamental relation involving cyclotomic polynomials is 

:&lt;math&gt;x^n - 1 =\prod_{1\leqslant k\leqslant n} \left(x- e^{2i\pi\frac{k}{n}} \right)= \prod_{d \mid n} \prod_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n \atop \gcd(k, n) = d} \left(x- e^{2i\pi\frac{k}{n}} \right) =\prod_{d \mid n} \Phi_{\frac{n}{d}}(x) =  \prod_{d\mid n} \Phi_d(x).&lt;/math&gt;

which means that each ''n''-th root of unity is a primitive ''d''-th root of unity for a unique ''d'' dividing ''n''.

The [[Möbius inversion formula#Multiplicative notation|Möbius inversion formula]] allows the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; as an explicit rational fraction:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)=\prod_{d\mid n}(x^d-1)^{\mu \left (\frac{n}{d} \right )}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Möbius function]].

The [[Discrete Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of functions of the [[greatest common divisor]] together with the [[Möbius inversion formula]] gives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schramm |first=Wolfgang |title=Eine alternative Produktdarstellung für die Kreisteilungspolynome |journal=Elemente der Mathematik |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=137–143 |publisher=[[Swiss Mathematical Society]] |year=2015 |url=https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_abstract.php?issn=0013-6018&amp;vol=70&amp;iss=4&amp;rank=1 |accessdate=2015-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222122149/https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_abstract.php?issn=0013-6018&amp;vol=70&amp;iss=4&amp;rank=1 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)=\prod_{k=1}^n \left (x^{\gcd(k,n)}-1 \right )^{\cos \left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)} .&lt;/math&gt;

The cyclotomic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be computed by (exactly) dividing &lt;math&gt;x^n-1&lt;/math&gt; by the cyclotomic polynomials of the proper divisors of ''n'' previously computed recursively by the same method:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)=\frac{x^{n}-1}{\prod_{\stackrel{d|n}{{}_{d&lt;n}}}\Phi_{d}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

(Recall that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{1}(x)=x-1&lt;/math&gt;.)

This formula allows computation of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; on a computer for any ''n'', as soon as [[integer factorization]] and [[Euclidean division of polynomials|division of polynomials]] are available. Many [[computer algebra systems]] have a built in function to compute the cyclotomic polynomials. For example, this function is called by typing &lt;code&gt;cyclotomic_polynomial(n,x)&lt;/code&gt; in [[SageMath]], &lt;code&gt;numtheory[cyclotomic](n,x);&lt;/code&gt; in [[Maple (software)|Maple]], and &lt;code&gt;Cyclotomic[n,x]&lt;/code&gt; in [[Mathematica]].

===Easy cases for computation===
As noted above, if ''n'' is a prime number, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{n-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x^i.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' is an odd integer greater than one, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{2n}(x) = \Phi_n(-x).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, if ''n''=2''p'' is twice an odd prime, then (as noted above)

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = 1-x+x^2-\cdots+x^{p-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(-x)^i.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n''=''p&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[prime power]] (where ''p'' is prime), then

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = \Phi_p(x^{p^{m-1}}) =\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^{ip^{m-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''n''=''p&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;r'' with ''r'' relatively prime to ''p'', then 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = \Phi_{pr}(x^{p^{m-1}}).&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas may be applied repeatedly to get a simple expression for any cyclotomic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; in term of a cyclotomic polynomial of [[square-free number|square free]] index: If ''q'' is the product of the prime divisors of ''n'' (its [[Radical of an integer|radical]]), then&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Cox | first = David A. | authorlink = David A. Cox  | contribution = Exercise 12  | doi = 10.1002/9781118218457 | edition = 2nd  | isbn = 978-1-118-07205-9 | page = 237 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons  | title = Galois Theory | year = 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) = \Phi_q(x^{n/q}).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows to give formulas for the ''n''th cyclotomic polynomial when ''n'' has at most one odd prime factor: If ''p'' is an odd prime number, and ''h'' and ''k'' are positive integers, then: 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{2^h}(x) = x^{2^{h-1}}+1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{p^k}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^{ip^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{2^hp^k}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(-1)^ix^{i2^{h-1}p^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the other values of ''n'', the computation of the ''n''th cyclotomic polynomial is similarly reduced to that of  &lt;math&gt;\Phi_q(x),&lt;/math&gt; where ''q'' is the product of the distinct odd prime divisors of ''n''. To deal with this case, one has that, for ''p'' prime and not dividing ''n'',&lt;ref name="WolframCyclotomic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CyclotomicPolynomial.html | title=Cyclotomic Polynomial | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Weisstein, Eric W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{np}(x)=\Phi_{n}(x^p)/\Phi_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Integers appearing as coefficients===

The problem of bounding the magnitude of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials has been the object of a number of research papers.
 
If ''n'' has at most two distinct odd prime factors, then Migotti showed that the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; are all in the set {1, −1, 0}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algebra: A Graduate Course |first=Martin |last=Isaacs |page=310 |isbn=978-0-8218-4799-2 |publisher=AMS Bookstore |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cyclotomic polynomial for a product of three different odd prime factors is &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{105}(x);&lt;/math&gt; it has a coefficient −2 (see its expression [[#Examples|above]]). The converse is not true: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{231}(x)=\Phi_{3\times 7\times 11}(x)&lt;/math&gt; only has coefficients in {1, −1, 0}.

If ''n'' is a product of more different odd prime factors, the coefficients may increase to very high values. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{15015}(x) =\Phi_{3\times 5\times 7\times 11\times 13}(x)&lt;/math&gt; has coefficients running from −22 to 22, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{255255}(x)=\Phi_{3\times 5\times 7\times 11\times 13\times 17}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the smallest ''n'' with 6 different odd primes, has coefficients up to ±532.

Let ''A''(''n'') denote the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of Φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is known that for any positive ''k'', the number of ''n'' up to ''x'' with ''A''(''n'') &gt; ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is at least ''c''(''k'')⋅''x'' for a positive ''c''(''k'') depending on ''k'' and ''x'' sufficiently large.  In the opposite direction, for any function ψ(''n'') tending to infinity with ''n'' we have ''A''(''n'') bounded above by ''n''&lt;sup&gt;ψ(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; for almost all ''n''.&lt;ref name=Mei2008&gt;Meier (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s formula===

Let ''n'' be odd, square-free, and greater than 3. Then:&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, Articles 356-357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riesel, pp. 315-316, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4\Phi_n(z) = A_n^2(z) - (-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}nz^2B_n^2(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where  both ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') and ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') have integer coefficients, ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n'')/2, and ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n'')/2 − 2. Furthermore, ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') is palindromic when its degree is even; if its degree is odd it is antipalindromic. Similarly, ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') is palindromic unless ''n'' is composite and ≡ 3 (mod 4), in which case it is antipalindromic.

The first few cases are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
4\Phi_5(z) &amp;=4(z^4+z^3+z^2+z+1)\\ 
&amp;= (2z^2+z+2)^2 - 5z^2  \\[6pt]
4\Phi_7(z) &amp;=4(z^6+z^5+z^4+z^3+z^2+z+1)\\ 
&amp;= (2z^3+z^2-z-2)^2+7z^2(z+1)^2 \\ [6pt]
4\Phi_{11}(z)
&amp;=4(z^{10}+z^9+z^8+z^7+z^6+z^5+z^4+z^3+z^2+z+1)\\ 
&amp;= (2z^5+z^4-2z^3+2z^2-z-2)^2+11z^2(z^3+1)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Édouard Lucas|Lucas]]'s formula===

Let ''n'' be odd, square-free and greater than 3. Then&lt;ref&gt;Riesel, pp. 309-315, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(z) = U_n^2(z) - (-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}nzV_n^2(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where  both ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') and ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') have integer coefficients, ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n'')/2, and ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n'')/2 − 1. This can also be written

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n \left ((-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}z \right ) = C_n^2(z) - nzD_n^2(z).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' is even, square-free and greater than 2 (this forces ''n''/2 to be odd),

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\frac{n}{2}} \left (-z^2 \right ) = \Phi_{2n}(z)= C_n^2(z) - nzD_n^2(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where both ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') and ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') have integer coefficients, ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n''), and ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has degree ''&amp;phi;''(''n'') − 1. ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') and ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') are both palindromic.

The first few cases are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Phi_3(-z) &amp;=\Phi_6(z) =z^2-z+1 \\
&amp;= (z+1)^2 - 3z \\[6pt]
\Phi_5(z) &amp;=z^4+z^3+z^2+z+1 \\
&amp;= (z^2+3z+1)^2 - 5z(z+1)^2 \\[6pt]
\Phi_{6/2}(-z^2) &amp;=\Phi_{12}(z)=z^4-z^2+1 \\
&amp;= (z^2+3z+1)^2 - 6z(z+1)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Cyclotomic polynomials over a finite field and over {{math|p}}-adic integers ==
{{see also|Finite field#Roots of unity}}
Over a [[finite field]] with a prime number {{math|''p''}} of elements, for any integer {{math|''n''}} that is not a multiple of {{math|''p''}}, the cyclotomic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; factorizes into &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi (n)}{d}&lt;/math&gt; irreducible polynomials of degree {{math|''d''}}, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi (n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]], and {{math|''d''}} is the [[multiplicative order]] of {{math|''p''}} modulo {{math|''n''}}. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible [[if and only if]] {{math|''p''}} is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo {{mvar|n}}]], that is, {{math|''p''}} does not divide {{math|''n''}}, and its multiplicative order modulo {{math|''n''}} is &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n),&lt;/math&gt; the degree of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

These results are also true over the [[p-adic integer|{{mvar|p}}-adic integers]], since [[Hensel's lemma]] allows lifting a factorization over the field with {{math|''p''}} of elements to a factorization over the {{math|p}}-adic integers.

==Polynomial values==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}

If {{math|''x''}} takes any real value, then &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for every {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}} (this follows from the fact that the roots of a cyclotomic polynomial are all non-real, for {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}).

For studying the values that a cyclotomic polynomial may take when {{math|''x''}} is given an integer value, it suffices to consider only the case {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}, as the cases {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} and  {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} are trivial (one has &lt;math&gt;\Phi_1(x)=x-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_2(x)=x+1&lt;/math&gt;). 

For {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(0) =1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(1) =1&lt;/math&gt; if {{math|''n''}} is not a [[prime power]],
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(1) =p&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n=p^k&lt;/math&gt; is a prime power with {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}.

The values that a cyclotomic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; may take for other integer values of {{math|''x''}} is strongly related with the [[multiplicative order]] modulo a prime number. 

More precisely, given a prime number {{math|''p''}} and an integer {{math|''b''}} coprime with {{math|''p''}}, the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}, is the smallest positive integer {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|''p''}} is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;x^n-1.&lt;/math&gt; For {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}}, the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}} is also the [[periodic function|shortest period]] of the representation of {{math|1/''p''}} in the [[numeral base]] {{math|''b''}} (see [[Unique prime]]; this explains the notation choice). 

The definition of the multiplicative order implies that, if {{math|''n''}} is the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|''p''}} is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b).&lt;/math&gt; The converse is not true, but one has the following.

If {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} is a positive integer and {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}} is an integer, then (see below for a proof)
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)=2^kgh,&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* {{math|''k''}} is a non-negative integer, always equal to 0 when {{math|''b''}} is even. (In fact, if {{math|''n''}} is neither 1 nor 2, then {{math|''k''}} is either 0 or 1. Besides, if {{math|''n''}} is not a [[power of 2]], then {{math|''k''}} is always equal to 0)
* {{math|''g''}} is 1 or the largest odd prime factor of {{math|''n''}}.
* {{math|''h''}} is odd, coprime with {{math|''n''}}, and its [[prime factor]]s are exactly the odd primes {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|''n''}} is the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}.

This implies that, if {{math|''p''}} is an odd prime divisor of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b),&lt;/math&gt; then either {{math|''n''}} is a divisor of {{math|''p'' − 1}} or {{math|''p''}} is a divisor of {{math|''n''}}. In the latter case &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; does not divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b).&lt;/math&gt;

[[Zsigmondy's theorem]] implies that the only cases where  {{math|1=''b'' &gt; 1}} and {{math|1=''h'' = 1}} are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Phi_1(2) &amp;=1 \\
\Phi_2 \left (2^k-1 \right ) &amp; =2^k &amp;&amp; k &gt;0 \\
\Phi_6(2) &amp;=3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

It follows from above factorization that the odd prime factors of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Phi_n(b)}{\gcd(n,\Phi_n(b))}&lt;/math&gt;

are exactly the odd primes {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|''n''}} is the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}. This fraction may be even only when {{math|''b''}} is odd. In this case, the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|2}} is always {{math|1}}.

There are many pairs {{math|(''n'', ''b'')}} with {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}} such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; is prime. In fact, [[Bunyakovsky conjecture]] implies that, for every {{math|''n''}}, there are infinitely many {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}} such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; is prime. See {{oeis|id=A085398}} for the list of the smallest {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}} such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; is prime (the smallest {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}} such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; is prime is about &lt;math&gt;\lambda \cdot \varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]]). See also {{oeis|id=A206864}} for the list of the smallest primes of the form &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; with {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}} and {{math|''b'' &gt; 1}}, and, more generally, {{oeis|id=A206942}}, for the smallest positive integers of this form.

If {{math|''p''}} is a prime divisor of multiplicity {{math|''m''}} in {{math|''n''}}, then &lt;math&gt;\Phi_p(x), \Phi_{p^2}(x), \cdots, \Phi_{p^m}(x)&lt;/math&gt; divide {{math|''P''(''x'')}}, and their values at {{math|1}} are {{math|''m''}} factors equal to {{math|''p''}} of &lt;math&gt;n=P(1).&lt;/math&gt; As {{math|''m''}} is the multiplicity of {{math|''p''}} in {{math|''n''}}, {{math|''p''}} cannot divide the value at {{math|1}} of the other factors of &lt;math&gt;P(x).&lt;/math&gt; Thus there is no prime that divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(1).&lt;/math&gt;

*''If'' {{math|''n''}} ''is the multiplicative order of'' {{math|''b''}} ''modulo'' {{math|''p''}}, ''then'' &lt;math&gt;p \mid \Phi_n(b).&lt;/math&gt; By definition, &lt;math&gt;p \mid b^n-1.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;p \nmid \Phi_n(b),&lt;/math&gt; then {{math|''p''}} would divide another factor &lt;math&gt;\Phi_k(b)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;b^n-1,&lt;/math&gt; and would thus divide &lt;math&gt;b^k-1,&lt;/math&gt; showing that, if there would be the case, {{math|''n''}} would not be the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}.

*''The other prime divisors of'' &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; ''are divisors of'' {{math|''n''}}. Let {{math|''p''}} be a prime divisor of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|''n''}} is not be the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}. If {{math|''k''}} is the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|''p''}} divides both &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_k(b).&lt;/math&gt; The [[resultant]] of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be written &lt;math&gt;P\Phi_k+Q\Phi_n,&lt;/math&gt; where {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} are polynomials. Thus {{math|''p''}} divides this resultant. As {{math|''k''}} divides {{math|''n''}}, and the resultant of two polynomials divides the [[discriminant]] of any common multiple of these polynomials, {{math|''p''}} divides also the discriminant &lt;math&gt;n^n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x^n-1.&lt;/math&gt; Thus {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''n''}}.

*{{math|''g''}} ''and'' {{math|''h''}} ''are coprime''. In other words, if {{math|''p''}} is a prime common divisor of {{math|''n''}} and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b),&lt;/math&gt; then {{math|''n''}} is not the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}. By [[Fermat's little theorem]], the multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} is a divisor of {{math|''p'' − 1}}, and thus smaller than {{math|''n''}}.

*{{math|''g''}} ''is square-free''. In other words, if  {{math|''p''}} is a prime common divisor of {{math|''n''}} and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; does not divide &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b).&lt;/math&gt; Let {{math|1=''n'' = ''pm''}}. It suffices to prove that &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; does not divides {{math|''S''(''b'')}} for some polynomial {{math|''S''(''x'')}}, which is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x).&lt;/math&gt; We take 
::&lt;math&gt;S(x)=\frac{x^n-1}{x^m-1} = 1 + x^m + x^{2m} + \cdots + x^{(p-1)m}.&lt;/math&gt; 
:The multiplicative order of {{math|''b''}} modulo {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|gcd(''n'', ''p'' − 1)}}, which is a divisor of {{math|1=''m'' = ''n''/''p''}}. Thus  {{math|1=''c'' = ''b&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}} is a multiple of {{math|''p''}}. Now, 
::&lt;math&gt;S(b) = \frac{(1+c)^p-1}{c} = p+ \binom{p}{2}c + \cdots + \binom{p}{p}c^{p-1}.&lt;/math&gt; 
:As {{math|''p''}} is prime and greater than 2, all the terms but the first one are multiples of &lt;math&gt;p^2.&lt;/math&gt; This proves that &lt;math&gt;p^2 \nmid \Phi_n(b).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

Using &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt;, one can give an elementary proof for the infinitude of [[prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 1 modulo ''n'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Shirali. ''Number Theory''. Orient Blackswan, 2004. p. 67. {{isbn|81-7371-454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a special case of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]].

Suppose &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k&lt;/math&gt; are a finite list of primes congruent to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;N = np_1p_2\cdots  p_k&lt;/math&gt; and consider &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(N)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be a prime factor of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(N)&lt;/math&gt; (to see that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(N) \neq \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; decompose it into linear factors and note that 1 is the closest root of unity to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). Since &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x) \equiv \pm 1 \bmod x,&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a new prime not in the list. We will show that &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 1 \bmod n.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be the order of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;q.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(N) \mid N^n - 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;N^n -1 \equiv 0 \bmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;m \mid n&lt;/math&gt;.  We will show that &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume for contradiction that &lt;math&gt;m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;. Since 

:&lt;math&gt;N^m - 1 \equiv \prod_{d \mid m} \Phi_d(N) \equiv 0 \bmod q&lt;/math&gt; 

we have 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_d(N) \equiv 0 \bmod q,&lt;/math&gt; 

for some &lt;math&gt;d &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a double root of 

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{d \mid n} \Phi_d(x) \equiv x^n -1 \bmod q.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; must be a root of the derivative so 

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{d(x^n -1)}{dx}\right|_N \equiv nN^{n-1} \equiv 0 \bmod q.&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;q \nmid N&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;q \nmid n.&lt;/math&gt; This is a contradiction so &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt;. The order of &lt;math&gt;N \bmod q,&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, must divide &lt;math&gt;q-1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 1 \bmod n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''David Eisenbud''' (born 8 April 1947 in [[New York City]]) is an [[Americans|American]] [[mathematician]].  He is a [[professor]] of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was Director of the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) from 1997 to 2007. He was reappointed to this office in 2013, and his term has been extended until July 31, 2022.

==Biography==
Eisenbud received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1970 from the [[University of Chicago]], where he was a student of [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and, unofficially, [[James Christopher Robson]].  He then taught at [[Brandeis University]] from 1970 to 1997, during which time he had visiting positions at [[Harvard University]], [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (IHÉS), [[University of Bonn]], and [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS).  He joined the staff at MSRI in 1997, and took a position at Berkeley at the same time.

From 2003 to 2005 Eisenbud was President of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eisenbud, David|title=Syzygies, degrees, and choices from a life in mathematics. Retiring Presidential Address|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] (N.S.)|volume=44|issue=3|year=2007|pages=331–359|mr=2318155|doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-07-01163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenbud's mathematical interests include [[commutative algebra|commutative]] and [[non-commutative algebra]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[topology]], and computational methods in these fields.  He has written over 150 papers and books with over 60 co-authors.  Notable contributions include the theory of matrix factorizations for maximal [[Cohen–Macaulay module]]s over [[hypersurface]] rings, the [[Eisenbud–Goto conjecture]] on degrees of generators of [[syzygy module]]s, and the [[Buchsbaum–Eisenbud criterion]] for [[exact sequence|exactness of a complex]]. He also proposed the [[Eisenbud–Evans conjecture]] which was later settled by the [[India]]n mathematician [[Neithalath Mohan Kumar]].&lt;ref name="IschebeckRao2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Friedrich Ischebeck|author2=Ravi A. Rao|title=Ideals and Reality: Projective Modules and Number of Generators of Ideals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P82xkbGioL8C&amp;pg=PA238|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=12 January 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-23032-8|pages=238–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has had 31 doctoral students, including [[Craig Huneke]], [[Mircea Mustaţă]], [[Irena Peeva]], and Gregory G. Smith (winner of the [[Aisenstadt Prize]] in 2007).

Eisenbud's hobbies are [[juggling]] (he has written two papers on the [[mathematics of juggling]]) and music. He has appeared in [[Brady Haran]]'s Numberphile web series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.numberphile.com/team/index.html|title=Numberphile – Videos about Numbers and Stuff|website=www.numberphile.com|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenbud was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/alphalist2016.pdf], retrieved 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 2010. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">In a [[cryptography|cryptographic]] [[digital signature]] or [[Message authentication code|MAC]] system, '''digital signature forgery''' is the ability to create a pair consisting of a message, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and a signature (or MAC), &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, that is valid for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; has not been signed in the past by the legitimate signer. There are three types of forgery: existential, selective, and universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Types==
Besides the following attacks, there is also a ''total break'': when adversary can compute the signer's private key and therefore forge any possible signature on any message.&lt;ref name=GoldwasserBellare&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldwasser|first1=Shafi|last2=Bellare|first2=Mihir|title=Lecture Notes on Cryptography. Summer course on cryptography|date=2008|page=170|url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/gb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential forgery (existential unforgeability, EUF)===
Existential forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of at least one message/signature pair, &lt;math&gt;(m, \sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; was not produced by the legitimate signer. The adversary need not have any control over &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; need not have any particular meaning; the message content is irrelevant &amp;mdash; as long as the pair, &lt;math&gt;(m, \sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, is valid, the adversary has succeeded in constructing an existential forgery.

Existential forgery is essentially the weakest adversarial goal, therefore the strongest schemes are those that are ''existentially unforgeable''.

====Signature of a product of two messages ====
Take an algorithm, like RSA, with the multiplicative property:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(m1) \cdot \sigma(m2) = \sigma (m1 \cdot m2)&lt;/math&gt;.

This property can be exploited sending a message &lt;math&gt;m' = m1 \cdot m2&lt;/math&gt; with a signature &lt;math&gt;\sigma(m') = \sigma (m1 \cdot m2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="damore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~damore/sicu/slide/slide2012/6.digital-signature.pdf|title=Digital signatures - DSA|date=April 2012|publisher=La Sapienza University of Rome|author=Fabrizio d'Amore|accessdate=July 27, 2018|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common defense to this attack is to hash the messages before signing them.&lt;ref name="damore"/&gt;

===Selective forgery (selective unforgeability, SUF)===
Selective forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of a message/signature pair &lt;math&gt;(m, \sigma)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; has been ''chosen'' by the challenger prior to the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Nigel P. Cryptography Made Simple. Springer. p. 217. {{ISBN|978-3-319-21935-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; may be chosen to have interesting mathematical properties with respect to the signature algorithm; however, in selective forgery, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; must be fixed before the start of the attack.

The ability to successfully conduct a selective forgery attack implies the ability to successfully conduct an existential forgery attack.

===Universal forgery (universal unforgeability, UUF)===
Universal forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of a valid signature, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, for ''any'' given message, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  An adversary capable of universal forgery is able to sign messages he chose himself (as in selective forgery), messages chosen at random, or even specific messages provided by an opponent.

In [[mathematics]], the notion of an ('''exact''') '''dimension function''' (also known as a '''gauge function''') is a tool in the study of [[fractal]]s and other subsets of [[metric space]]s. Dimension functions are a generalisation of the simple "[[diameter]] to the [[dimension]]" [[power law]] used in the construction of ''s''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]].

==Motivation: ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure==

{{main|Hausdorff dimension}}

Consider a metric space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') and a [[subset]] ''E'' of ''X''. Given a number ''s''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, the ''s''-dimensional '''Hausdorff measure''' of ''E'', denoted ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E''), is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu^{s} (E) = \lim_{\delta \to  0} \mu_{\delta}^{s} (E),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\delta}^{s} (E) = \inf \left\{ \left. \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} \mathrm{diam} (C_{i})^{s} \right| \mathrm{diam} (C_{i}) \leq \delta, \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} C_{i} \supseteq E \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') can be thought of as an approximation to the "true" ''s''-dimensional area/volume of ''E'' given by calculating the minimal ''s''-dimensional area/volume of a covering of ''E'' by sets of diameter at most ''δ''.

As a function of increasing ''s'', ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') is non-increasing. In fact, for all values of ''s'', except possibly one, ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') is either 0 or +∞; this exceptional value is called the '''Hausdorff dimension''' of ''E'', here denoted dim&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''E''). Intuitively speaking, ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ for ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;dim&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') for the same reason as the 1-dimensional linear [[length]] of a 2-dimensional [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] is +∞; likewise, ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;dim&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') for the same reason as the 3-dimensional [[volume]] of a disc in the Euclidean plane is zero.

The idea of a dimension function is to use different functions of diameter than just diam(''C'')&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''s'', and to look for the same property of the Hausdorff measure being finite and non-zero.

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a metric space and ''E''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X''. Let ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] be a one-way function with no provably correct connectivity in homotopically holomorphic manifolds. Define ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu^{h} (E) = \lim_{\delta \to  0} \mu_{\delta}^{h} (E),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\delta}^{h} (E) = \inf \left\{ \left. \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} h \left( \mathrm{diam} (C_{i}) \right) \right| \mathrm{diam} (C_{i}) \leq \delta, \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} C_{i} \supseteq E \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''h'' is called an ('''exact''') '''dimension function''' (or '''gauge function''') for ''E'' if ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') is finite and strictly positive. There are many conventions as to the properties that ''h'' should have: Rogers (1998), for example, requires that ''h'' should be [[monotone function|monotonically increasing]] for ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, strictly positive for ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and [[continuous function|continuous]] on the right for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.

Abelian structures can thus be proven to equivalency with the use of certain mathematical structures under the realm of Symplectic tangent bundles.
===Packing dimension===

[[Packing dimension]] is constructed in a very similar way to Hausdorff dimension, except that one "packs" ''E'' from inside with [[disjoint sets|pairwise disjoint]] balls of diameter at most ''δ''.  Just as before, one can consider functions ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] more general than ''h''(''δ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''δ''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; and call ''h'' an exact dimension function for ''E'' if the ''h''-packing measure of ''E'' is finite and strictly positive.

==Example==

[[Almost surely]], a sample path ''X'' of [[Brownian motion]] in the Euclidean plane has Hausdorff dimension equal to 2, but the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is zero. The exact dimension function ''h'' is given by the [[logarithm]]ic correction

:&lt;math&gt;h(r) = r^{2} \cdot \log \frac1{r} \cdot \log \log \log \frac1{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

I.e., with probability one, 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;+∞ for a Brownian path ''X'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  For Brownian motion in Euclidean ''n''-space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;3, the exact dimension function is

:&lt;math&gt;h(r) = r^{2} \cdot \log \log \frac1r.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11270">'''Direct linear transformation''' ('''DLT''') is an algorithm which solves a set of variables from a set of similarity relations:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} \propto \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; are known vectors, &lt;math&gt; \, \propto &lt;/math&gt; denotes equality up to an unknown scalar multiplication, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; is a matrix (or linear transformation) which contains the unknowns to be solved.

This type of relation appears frequently in [[projective geometry]].  Practical examples include the relation between 3D points in a scene and their projection onto the image plane of a [[Pinhole camera model|pinhole camera]], and [[Homography (computer vision)|homographies]].

== Introduction ==

An ordinary linear equation

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} = \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

can be solved, for example, by rewriting it as a matrix equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; where matrices &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; contain the vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; in their respective columns.  Given that there exists a unique solution, it is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T} \, (\mathbf{Y} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T})^{-1} .&lt;/math&gt;

Solutions can also be described in the case that the equations are over or under determined.

What makes the direct linear transformation problem distinct from the above standard case is the fact that the left and right sides of the defining equation can differ by an unknown multiplicative factor which is dependent on ''k''.  As a consequence, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; cannot be computed as in the standard case.  Instead, the similarity relations are rewritten as proper linear homogeneous equations which then can be solved by a standard method.  The combination of rewriting the similarity equations as homogeneous linear equations and solving them by standard methods is referred to as a '''direct linear transformation algorithm''' or '''DLT algorithm'''. DLT is attributed to Ivan Sutherland.

== Example ==

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{3} &lt;/math&gt; be two sets of known vectors and the problem is to find &lt;math&gt; 2 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{k} \, \mathbf{x}_{k} = \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{k} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; is the unknown scalar factor related to equation ''k''.

To get rid of the unknown scalars and obtain homogeneous equations, define the anti-symmetric matrix

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and multiply both sides of the equation with &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} &lt;/math&gt; from the left

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_{k} \, \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{x}_{k} = \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N .&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{x}_{k} = 0, &lt;/math&gt; the following homogeneous equations, which no longer contain the unknown scalars, are at hand

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N .&lt;/math&gt;

In order to solve &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; from this set of equations, consider the elements of the vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} = \begin{pmatrix} x_{1k} \\ x_{2k} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} = \begin{pmatrix} y_{1k} \\ y_{2k} \\ y_{3k} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and the above homogeneous equation becomes

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = a_{11} \, x_{2k} \, y_{1k} - a_{21} \, x_{1k} \, y_{1k} + a_{12} \, x_{2k} \, y_{2k} - a_{22} \, x_{1k} \, y_{2k} + a_{13} \, x_{2k} \, y_{3k} - a_{23} \, x_{1k} \, y_{3k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N. &lt;/math&gt;

This can also be written

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \mathbf{b}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; both are 6-dimensional vectors defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_{k} = \begin{pmatrix} x_{2k} \, y_{1k} \\ -x_{1k} \, y_{1k} \\ x_{2k} \, y_{2k} \\ -x_{1k} \, y_{2k} \\ x_{2k} \, y_{3k} \\ -x_{1k} \, y_{3k} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\ a_{21} \\ a_{12} \\ a_{22} \\ a_{13} \\ a_{23} \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This set of homogeneous equation can also be written in matrix form

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{B} \, \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; N \times 6 &lt;/math&gt; matrix which holds the vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; in its rows.  This means that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; lies in the [[null space]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; and can be determined, for example, by a [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; is a right singular vector of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a singular value that equals zero.  Once &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; has been determined, the elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; can be found by a simple rearrangement from a 6-dimensional vector to a &lt;math&gt; 2 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix.  Notice that the scaling of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; is not important (except that it must be non-zero) since the defining equations already allow for unknown scaling.

In practice the vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; may contain noise which means that the similarity equations are only approximately valid.  As a consequence, there may not be a vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; which solves the homogeneous equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{B} \, \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; exactly.  In these cases, a [[total least squares]] solution can be used by choosing &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; as a right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}. &lt;/math&gt;

== More general cases ==

The above example has &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{3} &lt;/math&gt;, but the general strategy for rewriting the similarity relations into homogeneous linear equations can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions for both &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k}. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{q} &lt;/math&gt; the previous expressions can still lead to an equation

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; now is &lt;math&gt; 2 \times q. &lt;/math&gt;  Each ''k'' provides one equation in the &lt;math&gt; 2q &lt;/math&gt; unknown elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; and together these equations can be written &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} \, \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; for the known &lt;math&gt; N \times 2 \, q &lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; and unknown ''2q''-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}. &lt;/math&gt;  This vector can be found in a similar way as before.

In the most general case &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{p} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{q} &lt;/math&gt;.  The main difference compared to previously is that the matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} &lt;/math&gt; now is &lt;math&gt; p \times p &lt;/math&gt; and anti-symmetric.  When &lt;math&gt; p &gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; the space of such matrices is no longer one-dimensional, it is of dimension

: &lt;math&gt; M = \frac{p\,(p-1)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This means that each value of ''k'' provides ''M'' homogeneous equations of the type

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \mathbf{x}_{k}^{T} \, \mathbf{H}_{m} \, \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \, m = 1, \ldots, M &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and for &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{m} &lt;/math&gt; is a ''M''-dimensional basis of the space of &lt;math&gt; p \times p &lt;/math&gt; anti-symmetric matrices.

=== Example ''p'' = 3 ===

In the case that ''p'' = 3 the following three matrices &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{m} &lt;/math&gt; can be chosen

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{2} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{3} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;

In this particular case, the homogeneous linear equations can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{0} = [\mathbf{x}_{k}]_{\times} \, \mathbf{A} \, \mathbf{y}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \, k = 1, \ldots, N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\mathbf{x}_{k}]_{\times} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|matrix representation of the vector cross product]].  Notice that this last equation is vector valued; the left hand side is the zero element in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{3} &lt;/math&gt;.

Each value of ''k'' provides three homogeneous linear equations in the unknown elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;.  However, since &lt;math&gt; [\mathbf{x}_{k}]_{\times} &lt;/math&gt; has rank = 2, at most two equations are linearly independent.  In practice, therefore, it is common to only use two of the three matrices &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{m} &lt;/math&gt;, for example, for ''m''=1, 2.  However, the linear dependency between the equations is dependent on &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;, which means that in unlucky cases it would have been better to choose, for example, ''m''=2,3.  As a consequence, if the number of equations is not a concern, it may be better to use all three equations when the matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; is constructed.

The linear dependence between the resulting homogeneous linear equations is a general concern for the case ''p'' &gt; 2 and has to be dealt with either by reducing the set of anti-symmetric matrices &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_{m} &lt;/math&gt; or by allowing &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; to become larger than necessary for determining &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}. &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18120">In [[computer science]], the '''double dabble''' [[algorithm]] is used to convert [[binary numbers]] into [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) notation.&lt;ref name="Gao_2012_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gao_2012_2"/&gt; It is also known as the '''[[shift-and-add algorithm|shift-and-add]]-3 algorithm''', and can be implemented using a small number of gates in computer hardware, but at the expense of high [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].&lt;ref name="Véstias_2010"/&gt;

==Algorithm==
The algorithm operates as follows:

Suppose the original number to be converted is stored in a [[processor register|register]] that is ''n''&amp;nbsp;bits wide. Reserve a scratch space wide enough to hold both the original number and its BCD representation; {{math|''n'' + 4×''ceil''(''n''/3)}} bits will be enough. It takes a maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;bits in binary to store each decimal digit.

Then partition the scratch space into BCD digits (on the left) and the original register (on the right). For example, if the original number to be converted is eight bits wide, the scratch space would be partitioned as follows:

 100s Tens Ones   Original
 0010 0100 0011   11110011

The diagram above shows the binary representation of 243&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in the original register, and the BCD representation of 243 on the left.

The scratch space is initialized to all zeros, and then the value to be converted is copied into the "original register" space on the right.

 0000 0000 0000   11110011

The algorithm then iterates ''n'' times. On each iteration, the entire scratch space is left-shifted one&amp;nbsp;bit. However, ''before'' the left-shift is done, any BCD digit which is greater than 4 is incremented by 3. The increment ensures that a value of 5, incremented and left-shifted, becomes 16, thus correctly "carrying" into the next BCD digit.

Essentially, the algorithm operates by doubling the BCD value on the left each iteration and adding either one or zero according to the original bit pattern. Shifting left accomplishes both tasks simultaneously. If any digit is five or above, three is added to ensure the value "carries" in base 10.

The double-dabble algorithm, performed on the value 243&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, looks like this:

 0000 0000 0000   11110011   Initialization
 0000 0000 0001   11100110   Shift
 0000 0000 0011   11001100   Shift
 0000 0000 0111   10011000   Shift
 0000 0000 1010   10011000   Add 3 to ONES, since it was 7
 0000 0001 0101   00110000   Shift
 0000 0001 1000   00110000   Add 3 to ONES, since it was 5
 0000 0011 0000   01100000   Shift
 0000 0110 0000   11000000   Shift
 0000 1001 0000   11000000   Add 3 to TENS, since it was 6
 0001 0010 0001   10000000   Shift
 0010 0100 0011   00000000   Shift
    2    4    3
        BCD

Now eight shifts have been performed, so the algorithm terminates. The BCD digits to the left of the "original register" space display the BCD encoding of the original value 243.

             BCD

Sixteen shifts have been performed, so the algorithm terminates. The BCD digits is: 6*10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 5*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2*10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4*10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 4*10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 65244.

==C implementation==
The double dabble algorithm might look like this when implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Notice that this implementation is designed to convert an "input register" of any width, by taking an array as its parameter and returning a [[malloc|dynamically allocated]] string. Also notice that this implementation does not store an explicit copy of the input register in its scratch space, as the description of the algorithm did; copying the input register into the scratch space was just a [[pedagogical]] device.

In the 1960s, the term '''double dabble''' was also used for a different mental algorithm, used by programmers to convert a binary number to decimal. It is performed by reading the binary number from left to right, doubling if the next bit is zero, and doubling and adding one if the next bit is one.&lt;ref name="Godse"/&gt; In the example above, 11110011, the thought process would be: "one, three, seven, fifteen, thirty, sixty, one hundred twenty-one, two hundred forty-three", the same result as that obtained above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7323">In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] '''ELEMENTARY''' of '''elementary recursive functions''' is the union of the classes

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \mathrm{ELEMENTARY} &amp; = \mathrm{EXP}\cup\mathrm{2EXP}\cup\mathrm{3EXP}\cup\cdots \\
                   &amp; = \mathrm{DTIME}(2^n)\cup\mathrm{DTIME}(2^{2^n})\cup
                         \mathrm{DTIME}(2^{2^{2^n}})\cup\cdots
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The name was coined by [[László Kalmár]], in the context of [[Computable function|recursive functions]] and [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]]; most problems in it are far from elementary. Some natural recursive problems lie outside ELEMENTARY, and are thus [[NONELEMENTARY]]. Most notably, there are [[primitive recursive]] problems that are not in ELEMENTARY. We know

:LOWER-ELEMENTARY ⊊ [[EXPTIME]] ⊊ ELEMENTARY ⊊ [[PR (complexity)|PR]] ⊊ [[R (complexity)|R]]

Whereas ELEMENTARY contains bounded applications of [[exponentiation]] (for example, &lt;math&gt;O(2^{2^n})&lt;/math&gt;), [[PR (complexity)|PR]] allows more general [[hyper operator]]s (for example, [[tetration]]) which are not contained in ELEMENTARY.

==Definition==

The definitions of elementary recursive functions are the same as for [[primitive recursive function]]s, except that primitive recursion is replaced by bounded summation and bounded product. All functions work over the natural numbers. The basic functions, all of them elementary recursive, are:

# '''Zero function'''.  Returns zero: ''f''(x) = 0.
# '''Successor function''': ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' + 1. Often this is denoted by ''S'', as in ''S''(''x''). Via repeated application of a successor function, one can achieve addition.
# '''Projection functions''': these are used for ignoring arguments. For example, ''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''a'' is a projection function.
# '''Subtraction function''': ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' − ''y'' if ''y'' &lt; ''x'', or 0 if ''y'' ≥ ''x''. This function is used to define conditionals and iteration.

From these basic functions, we can build other elementary recursive functions.

# '''Composition''': applying values from some elementary recursive function as an argument to another elementary recursive function. In ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''h''(''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)) is elementary recursive if ''h'' is elementary recursive and each ''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is elementary recursive.
# '''Bounded summation''': &lt;math&gt;f(m, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^mg(i, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is elementary recursive if ''g'' is elementary recursive.
# '''Bounded product''': &lt;math&gt;f(m, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \prod\limits_{i=0}^mg(i, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is elementary recursive if ''g'' is elementary recursive.

== Basis for ELEMENTARY ==

The class of elementary functions coincides with the closure with respect to composition of the projections and one of the following function sets: &lt;math&gt;\{ n+1, n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m, \lfloor n/m \rfloor, n^m \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ n+m, n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m, \lfloor n/m\rfloor, 2^n \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ n+m, n^2, n \,\bmod\, m, 2^n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \, \stackrel{.}{-} \, m = \max\{n-m, 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the subtraction function defined above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazzanti | first1 = S | year = 2002 | title = Plain Bases for Classes of Primitive Recursive Functions | url = | journal = Mathematical Logic Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 93–104 | doi=10.1002/1521-3870(200201)48:1&lt;93::aid-malq93&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Marchenkov, "Superpositions of elementary arithmetic functions", ''Journal of Applied and Industrial Mathematics'', September 2007, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 351-360, {{doi|10.1134/S1990478907030106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lower elementary recursive functions ==

''Lower elementary recursive'' functions follow the definitions as above, except that bounded product is disallowed. That is, a lower elementary recursive function must be a zero, successor, or projection function, a composition of other lower elementary recursive functions, or the bounded sum of another lower elementary recursive function.

Also known as Skolem elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;Th. Skolem, "Proof of some theorems on recursively enumerable sets", ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'', 1962, Volume 3, Number 2, pp 65-74, {{doi|10.1305/ndjfl/1093957149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volkov_skolem"&gt;S. A. Volkov, "On the class of Skolem elementary functions", ''Journal of Applied and Industrial Mathematics'', 2010, Volume 4, Issue 4, pp 588-599, {{doi|10.1134/S1990478910040149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas elementary recursive functions have potentially more than exponential growth, the lower elementary recursive functions have polynomial growth.

The class of lower elementary functions has a description in terms of composition of simple functions analogous to that we have for elementary functions.&lt;ref name="volkov_skolem" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Volkov |first=Sergey | year= 2016 |eprint=1611.04843 |title=Finite Bases with Respect to the Superposition in Classes of Elementary Recursive Functions [dissertation] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, a polynomial-bounded function is lower elementary if and only if it can be expressed using a composition of the following functions: projections, &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;nm&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\wedge m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/m \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, one exponential function (&lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n^m&lt;/math&gt;) with the following restriction on the structure of formulas: the formula can have no more than two floors with respect to an exponent (for example, &lt;math&gt;xy(z+1)&lt;/math&gt; has 1 floor, &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^{yz+x}+z^{x+1}&lt;/math&gt; has 2 floors, &lt;math&gt;2^{2^x}&lt;/math&gt; has 3 floors). Here &lt;math&gt;n\wedge m&lt;/math&gt; is a bitwise AND of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Descriptive characterization ==

In [[descriptive complexity]], ELEMENTARY is equal to the class of [[HO (complexity)|high order queries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Lauri Hella and José María Turull-Torres | title =Computing queries with higher-order logics | journal = [[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]] | volume = 355 | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | pages = 197–214   | issn =0304-3975 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142890.1142897 | doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that every language in the ELEMENTARY complexity class can be written as a high order formula that is true only for the elements on the language.  More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NTIME}(2^{2^{\cdots{2^{O(n)}}}}) = \exists{}\mathrm{HO}^i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; indicates a tower of {{mvar|i}} exponentiations and &lt;math&gt;\exists{}\mathrm{HO}^i&lt;/math&gt; is the class of queries that begin with existential quantifiers of {{mvar|i}}th order and then a formula of {{math|(''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}}th order.

'''Elementary algebra''' encompasses some of the basic concepts of [[algebra]], one of the main branches of [[mathematics]]. It is typically taught to [[secondary school]] students and builds on their understanding of [[arithmetic]]. Whereas arithmetic deals with specified numbers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Ellsworth Slaught|H.E. Slaught]] and N.J. Lennes, ''Elementary algebra'', Publ. Allyn and Bacon, 1915, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gLii_eO4dNsC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Elementary%20algebra%22%20letters&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 1] (republished by Forgotten Books)&lt;/ref&gt; algebra introduces quantities without fixed values, known as variables.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Hirsch, Arthur Goodman, ''Understanding Elementary Algebra With Geometry: A Course for College Students'', Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2005, {{ISBN|0534999727}}, 9780534999728, 654 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7hdK4RSub5cC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=what%20is%20algebra%20for&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=generalization&amp;f=false page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; This use of variables entails a use of algebraic notation and an understanding of the general rules of the [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]]s introduced in arithmetic.  Unlike [[abstract algebra]], elementary algebra is not concerned with [[algebraic structures]] outside the realm of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s.

The use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic [[equation]]s.

==Algebraic notation ==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
Algebraic notation describes the rules and conventions for writing [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]], as well as the terminology used for talking about parts of expressions. For example, the expression &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x^2 - 2xy + c&lt;/math&gt; has the following components:
&lt;center&gt;
[[File:algebraic equation notation.svg|256px]]&lt;br&gt;
1 : [[Exponent]] (power), 2 : [[Coefficient]], 3 : [[addend|term]], 4 : [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]], 5 : [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; : [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s
&lt;/center&gt;

A ''coefficient'' is a numerical value, or letter representing a numerical constant, that multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A ''term'' is an [[Addend#Notation and terminology|addend or a summand]], a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, ''Introductory Algebra: An Applied Approach'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2010, {{ISBN|1439046042}}, 9781439046043, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MPIWikTHVXQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=yG1m9DkIiH&amp;dq=coefficient%20algebra&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=coefficient%20&amp;f=false page 78]&lt;/ref&gt; Letters represent variables and constants. By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. &lt;math&gt;a, b, c&lt;/math&gt;) are typically used to represent [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) are used to represent [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Hosch (editor), ''The Britannica Guide to Algebra and Trigonometry'', Britannica Educational Publishing, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, {{ISBN|1615302190}}, 9781615302192, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ad0P0elU1_0C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=elementary%20algebra%20letters%20alphabet%20constants%20variables&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=letters&amp;f=false page 71]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually written in italics.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Gentle, ''Numerical Linear Algebra for Applications in Statistics'', Publisher: Springer, 1998, {{ISBN|0387985425}}, 9780387985428, 221 pages, [James E. Gentle page 183]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebraic operation]]s work in the same way as [[Arithmetic#Algebraic operations|arithmetic operation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Nelson Robinson, ''New elementary algebra: containing the rudiments of science for schools and academies'', Ivison, Phinney, Blakeman, &amp; Co., 1866, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKZXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Elementary%20algebra%20notation&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=Elementary%20algebra%20notation&amp;f=false page 7]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]] and [[exponentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ron Larson, Robert Hostetler, Bruce H. Edwards, ''Algebra And Trigonometry: A Graphing Approach'', Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2007, {{ISBN|061885195X}}, 9780618851959, 1114 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5iXVZHhkjAgC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;ots=iwrSrCrrOb&amp;dq=operations%20addition%2C%20subtraction%2C%20multiplication%2C%20division%20exponentiation.&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=operations%20addition,%20subtraction,%20multiplication,%20division%20exponentiation.&amp;f=false page 6]&lt;/ref&gt; and are applied to algebraic variables and terms.  Multiplication symbols are usually omitted, and implied when there is no space between two variables or terms, or when a [[coefficient]] is used. For example, &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3 \times x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;2 \times x \times y&lt;/math&gt; may be written &lt;math&gt;2xy&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Sin Kwai Meng, Chip Wai Lung, Ng Song Beng, "Algebraic notation", in ''Mathematics Matters Secondary 1 Express Textbook'', Publisher Panpac Education Pte Ltd, {{ISBN|9812738827}}, 9789812738820, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nL5ObMmDvPEC&amp;lpg=PR9-IA8&amp;ots=T_h6l40AE5&amp;dq=%22Algebraic%20notation%22%20multiplication%20omitted&amp;pg=PR9-IA8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Algebraic%20notation%22%20multiplication%20omitted&amp;f=false page 68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually terms with the highest power ([[Exponentiation|exponent]]), are written on the left, for example, &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written to the left of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. When a coefficient is one, it is usually omitted (e.g. &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;1x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;David Alan Herzog, ''Teach Yourself Visually Algebra'', Publisher John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|0470185597}}, 9780470185599, 304 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Igs6t_clf0oC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;ots=Excnhf1AgW&amp;dq=algebra%20coefficient%20one&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q=coefficient%20of%201&amp;f=false page 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise when the exponent (power) is one, (e.g. &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x^1&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;John C.

Kaufmann, Karen L. Schwitters, ''Algebra for College Students'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2010, {{ISBN|0538733543}}, 9780538733540, 803 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-AHtC0IYMhYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=kL8erjajyR&amp;dq=algebra%20exponents%20zero%20one&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q=exponents%20&amp;f=false page 222]&lt;/ref&gt; However &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;, being undefined, should not appear in an expression, and care should be taken in simplifying expressions in which variables may appear in exponents.

===Alternative notation===
Other types of notation are used in algebraic expressions when the required formatting is not available, or can not be implied, such as where only letters and symbols are available. For example, exponents are usually formatted using superscripts, e.g. &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;. In [[plain text]], and in the [[TeX]] mark-up language, the [[caret]] symbol "^" represents exponents, so &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written as "x^2".&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Bangia, ''Dictionary of Information Technology'', Publisher Laxmi Publications, Ltd., 2010, {{ISBN|9380298153}}, 9789380298153, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQa5I2sHPKEC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;ots=s6pWav1Z_D&amp;dq=%22plain%20text%22%20math%20caret%20exponent&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q=exponentiation%20caret&amp;f=false page 212]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Grätzer, ''First Steps in LaTeX'', Publisher Springer, 1999, {{ISBN|0817641327}}, 9780817641320, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLdg5ZdDKToC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=V9DFIaAAh0&amp;dq=tex%20math&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=subscripts%20and%20superscripts%20caret&amp;f=false page 17]&lt;/ref&gt; In programming languages such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

This is useful for several reasons.

#'''Variables may represent numbers whose values are not yet known'''. For example, if the temperature of the current day, C, is 20 degrees higher than the temperature of the previous day, P,  then the problem can be described algebraically as &lt;math&gt;C = P + 20&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Hirsch, Arthur Goodman, ''Understanding Elementary Algebra With Geometry: A Course for College Students'', Publisher: Cengage Learning, 2005, {{ISBN|0534999727}}, 9780534999728, 654 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jsT7kqZubvIC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;ots=EI4_yaKasG&amp;dq=%22elementary%20algebra%22%20variables%20unknown&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=%22elementary%20algebra%22%20variables%20unknown&amp;f=false page 48]&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Variables allow one to describe ''general'' problems,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Leff, ''College Algebra: Barron's Ez-101 Study Keys'', Publisher: Barron's Educational Series, 2005, {{ISBN|0764129147}}, 9780764129148, 230 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XesryURrNKAC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;ots=Ga44CTvNHI&amp;dq=algebra%20variables%20generalize&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=algebra%20variables%20generalize&amp;f=false page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; without specifying the values of the quantities that are involved.''' For example, it can be stated specifically that 5 minutes is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;60 \times 5 = 300&lt;/math&gt; seconds. A more general (algebraic) description may state that the number of seconds, &lt;math&gt;s = 60 \times m&lt;/math&gt;, where m is  the number of minutes.

#'''Variables allow one to describe some mathematical properties.''' For example, a basic property of addition is [[commutativity]] which states that the order of numbers being added together does not matter. Commutativity is stated algebraically as &lt;math&gt;(a + b) = (b + a)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P.

=== Evaluating expressions ===
{{Main|Expression (mathematics)}}
Algebraic expressions may be evaluated and simplified, based on the basic properties of arithmetic operations ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]] and [[exponentiation]]). For example,
*Added terms are simplified using coefficients. For example, &lt;math&gt;x + x + x&lt;/math&gt; can be simplified as &lt;math&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt; (where 3 is a numerical coefficient).
*Multiplied terms are simplified using exponents. For example, &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt; is represented as &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;
*Like terms are added together,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marx, ''Shortcut Algebra I: A Quick and Easy Way to Increase Your Algebra I Knowledge and Test Scores'', Publisher Kaplan Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|1419552880}}, 9781419552885, 288 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o9GYQjZ7ZwUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=pT-MpWMJty&amp;dq=algebra%20addition%20%22like%20terms%22&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=like%20terms&amp;f=false page 51]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3ab - x^2 + ab&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4ab&lt;/math&gt;, because the terms containing &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; are added together, and, the terms containing &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; are added together.
*Brackets can be "multiplied out", using [[Distributive property|the distributive property]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;x (2x + 3)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;(x \times 2x) + (x \times 3)&lt;/math&gt; which can be written as &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x&lt;/math&gt;
*Expressions can be factored. For example, &lt;math&gt;6x^5 + 3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, by dividing both terms by &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;3x^2 (2x^3 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equations ===
[[File:Pythagorean theorem - Ani.gif|thumb|Animation illustrating [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' rule]] for a right-angle triangle, which shows the algebraic relationship between the triangle's hypotenuse, and the other two sides.]]
{{Main|Equation}}
An equation states that two expressions are equal using the symbol for equality, &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; (the [[equals sign]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Clark, Cynthia Anfinson, ''Beginning Algebra: Connecting Concepts Through Applications'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2011, {{ISBN|0534419380}}, 9780534419387, 793 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wCzuRMC5048C&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;ots=UdyGuk1ihH&amp;dq=algebra%20equation%20%22two%20expressions%22&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=equation&amp;f=false page 134]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known equations describes Pythagoras' law relating the length of the sides of a [[right angle]] triangle:&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Tussy, R. David Gustafson, ''Elementary and Intermediate Algebra'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2012, {{ISBN|1111567689}}, 9781111567682, 1163 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xqio_Xn4t7oC&amp;lpg=PA493&amp;ots=pmzfzBO1KX&amp;dq=algebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&amp;pg=PA493#v=onepage&amp;q=algebra%20Pythagoras%20hypotenuse&amp;f=false page 493]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt;

This equation states that &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;, representing the square of the length of the side that is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), is equal to the sum (addition) of the squares of the other two sides whose lengths are represented by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

An equation is the claim that two expressions have the same value and are equal. Some equations are true for all values of the involved variables (such as &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;); such equations are called [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables, e.g. &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 1 = 8&lt;/math&gt; is true only for &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -3&lt;/math&gt;. The values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through [[equation solving]].

Another type of equation is an inequality. Inequalities are used to show that one side of the equation is greater, or less, than the other. The symbols used for this are: &lt;math&gt; a &gt; b &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; &gt; &lt;/math&gt; represents 'greater than', and &lt;math&gt; a &lt; b &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt; represents 'less than'. Just like standard equality equations, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. The only exception is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be flipped.

==== Properties of equality ====

By definition, equality is an [[equivalence relation]], meaning it has the properties (a) [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;b = b&lt;/math&gt;), (b) [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] (i.e. if &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;) (c) [[transitive relation|transitive]] (i.e. if &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Downing, ''Algebra the Easy Way'', Publisher Barron's Educational Series, 2003, {{ISBN|0764119729}}, 9780764119729, 392 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RiX-TJLiQv0C&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=BjArsBq8vc&amp;dq=algebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=algebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&amp;f=false page 20]&lt;/ref&gt; It also satisfies the important property that if two symbols are used for equal things, then one symbol can be substituted for the other in any true statement about the first and the statement will remain true. This implies the following properties:

* if &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = d&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a + c = b + d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac = bd&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a + c = b + c&lt;/math&gt;;
* more generally, for any function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(a) = f(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Properties of inequality ====

The relations ''less than'' &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt; and greater than &lt;math&gt; &gt; &lt;/math&gt; have the property of transitivity:&lt;ref&gt;Ron Larson, Robert Hostetler, ''Intermediate Algebra'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2008, {{ISBN|0618753524}}, 9780618753529, 857 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b3vqad8tbiAC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;ots=FF2OYYGNCV&amp;dq=algebra%20inequality%20properties&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q=algebra%20inequality%20properties&amp;f=false page 96]&lt;/ref&gt;

By reversing the inequation, &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; &gt; &lt;/math&gt; can be swapped,&lt;ref&gt;Chris Carter, ''Physics: Facts and Practice for A Level'', Publisher Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|019914768X}}, 9780199147687, 144 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ff9gxZPYafcC&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;ots=KQ5ufGdcHk&amp;dq=algebra%20inequality%20less%20greater%20exchange&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=turned%20around&amp;f=false page 50]&lt;/ref&gt; for example:
* &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;b &gt; a&lt;/math&gt;

=== Substitution ===
{{main|Substitution (algebra)}}
{{see also|Substitution (logic)}}

Substitution is replacing the terms in an expression to create a new expression. Substituting 3 for a in the expression a*5 makes a new expression 3*5 with meaning 15. Substituting the terms of a statement makes a new statement. When the original statement is true independent of the values of the terms, the statement created by substitutions is also true. Hence definitions can be made in symbolic terms and interpreted through substitution: if &lt;math&gt;a^2:=a*a&lt;/math&gt;, where := means "is defined to equal", substituting 3 for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; informs the reader of this statement that &lt;math&gt;3^2&lt;/math&gt; means 3*3=9. Often it's not known whether the statement is true independent of the values of the terms, and substitution allows one to derive restrictions on the possible values, or show what conditions the statement holds under. For example, taking the statement x+1=0, if x is substituted with 1, this imples 1+1=2=0, which is false, which implies that if x+1=0 then x can't be 1.

If ''x'' and ''y'' are [[integers]], [[rationals]], or [[real numbers]], then ''xy''=0 implies ''x''=0 or ''y''=0. Suppose ''abc''=0. Then, substituting ''a'' for ''x'' and ''bc'' for ''y'', we learn ''a''=0 or ''bc''=0. Then we can substitute again, letting ''x''=''b'' and ''y''=''c'', to show that if ''bc''=0 then ''b''=0 or ''c''=0. Therefore, if ''abc''=0, then ''a''=0 or (''b''=0 or ''c''=0), so ''abc''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0 or ''c''=0.

Consider if the original fact were stated as "''ab''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0." Then when we say "suppose ''abc''=0," we have a conflict of terms when we substitute. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if ''abc''=0 then ''a''=0 or ''b''=0 or ''c''=0 if instead of letting ''a''=''a'' and ''b''=''bc'' we substitute ''a'' for ''a'' and ''b'' for ''bc'' (and with ''bc''=0, substituting ''b'' for ''a'' and ''c'' for ''b''). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression ''a'' into the ''a'' term of the original equation, the ''a'' substituted does not refer to the ''a'' in the statement "''ab''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0."

== Solving algebraic equations ==
{{see also|Equation solving}}
[[File:Algebraproblem.jpg|thumb|A typical algebra problem.]]

The following sections lay out examples of some of the types of algebraic equations that may be encountered.

=== Linear equations with one variable ===
{{Main|Linear equation}}

Linear equations are so-called, because when they are plotted, they describe a straight line. The simplest equations to solve are [[linear equation]]s that have only one variable. They contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. As an example, consider:

:Problem in words: If you double the age of a child and add 4, the resulting answer is 12. How old is the child?

:Equivalent equation: &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 = 12&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; represent the child's age

To solve this kind of equation, the technique is add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.  Once the variable is isolated, the other side of the equation is the value of the variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=All the Math You'll Ever Need|author=Slavin, Steve|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1989|isbn=0-471-50636-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem and its solution are as follows:
{|
|-
| 1. Equation to solve:
| &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 = 12&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 2. Subtract 4 from both sides:
| &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 3. This simplifies to:
| &lt;math&gt;2x = 8&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 4. Divide both sides by 2:
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 5. This simplifies to the solution:
| &lt;math&gt;x = 4&lt;/math&gt;
|}
In words: the child is 4 years old.

The general form of a linear equation with one variable, can be written as: &lt;math&gt;ax+b=c&lt;/math&gt;

Following the same procedure (i.e. subtract &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both sides, and then divide by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;), the general solution is given by &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{c-b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear equations with two variables ===
[[File:Linear-equations-two-unknowns.svg|thumb|right|Two linear equations|Solving two linear equations with a unique solution at the point that they intersect.]]
A linear equation with two variables has many (i.e. an infinite number of) solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, ''The Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT 2/e''Publisher: Pearson Education India, 2010, {{ISBN|8131723666}}, 9788131723661, 599 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOnaFSKRSR0C&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;ots=K9A5d10dUc&amp;dq=linear%20equation%20%20two%20variables%20%20many%20solutions&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q=many%20solutions&amp;f=false page 195]&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

:Problem in words: A father is 22 years older than his son. How old are they?
:Equivalent equation: &lt;math&gt;y = x + 22&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the father's age, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the son's age.

This cannot be worked out by itself. If the son's age was made known, then there would no longer be two unknowns (variables), and the problem becomes a linear equation with just one variable, that can be solved as described above.

To solve a linear equation with two variables (unknowns), requires two related equations. For example, if it was also revealed that:
{|
|-
| Problem in words:
| In 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son.
|-
| Equivalent equation:
| &lt;math&gt;y + 10 = 2 \times (x + 10)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Subtract 10 from both sides:
| &lt;math&gt;y = 2 \times (x + 10) - 10&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Multiple out brackets:
| &lt;math&gt;y = 2x + 20 - 10&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify:
| &lt;math&gt;y = 2x + 10&lt;/math&gt;

Now there are two related linear equations, each with two unknowns, which enables the production of a linear equation with just one variable, by subtracting one from the other (called the elimination method):&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Y.

In other words, the son is aged 12, and since the father 22 years older, he must be 34. In 10 years time, the son will be 22, and the father will be twice his age, 44. This problem is illustrated on the associated plot of the equations.

A quadratic equation is one which includes a term with an exponent of 2, for example, &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jane Sterling, ''Algebra II For Dummies'', Publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006, {{ISBN|0471775819}}, 9780471775812, 384 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_0rTMuSpTY0C&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=J8_1q1Vkul&amp;dq=quadratic%20equations&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=quadratic%20equations&amp;f=false page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; and no term with higher exponent. The name derives from the Latin ''quadrus'', meaning square.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Irwin, ''The Mystery to a Solution: Poe, Borges, and the Analytic Detective Story'', Publisher JHU Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0801854660}}, 9780801854668, 512 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jsxTenuOQKgC&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;ots=T7p7Porq55&amp;dq=quadratic%20quadrus&amp;pg=PA372#v=onepage&amp;q=quadratic%20quadrus&amp;f=false page 372]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Sharma/khattar, ''The Pearson Guide To Objective Mathematics For Engineering Entrance Examinations, 3/E'', Publisher Pearson Education India, 2010, {{ISBN|8131723631}}, 9788131723630, 1248 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-f9x7-FlsC&amp;lpg=RA13-PA33&amp;ots=P-Dz70fXbv&amp;dq=quadratic%20equations%20%20ax2%20%2B%20bx%20%2B%20c%20%3D%200&amp;pg=RA13-PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 621]&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is not zero (if it were zero, then the equation would not be quadratic but linear). Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term &lt;math&gt;ax^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is known as the quadratic term.  Hence &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and so we may divide by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and rearrange the equation into the standard form

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + px + q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Solving this, by a process known as [[completing the square]], leads to the [[quadratic formula]]

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a},&lt;/math&gt;

where [[plus-minus sign|the symbol "±"]] indicates that both

: &lt;math&gt; x=\frac{-b + \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\quad\text{and}\quad x=\frac{-b - \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

are solutions of the quadratic equation.

Quadratic equations can also be solved using [[factorization]] (the reverse process of which is [[polynomial expansion|expansion]], but for two [[linear function|linear terms]] is sometimes denoted [[FOIL rule|foiling]]).  As an example of factoring:

: &lt;math&gt;x^{2} + 3x - 10 = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

which is the same thing as

: &lt;math&gt;(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the [[zero-product property]] that either &lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = -5&lt;/math&gt; are the solutions, since precisely one of the factors must be equal to [[zero]]. All quadratic equations will have two solutions in the [[complex number]] system, but need not have any in the [[real number]] system. For example,

: &lt;math&gt;x^{2} + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

has no real number solution since no real number squared equals −1.
Sometimes a quadratic equation has a root of [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] 2, such as:

: &lt;math&gt;(x + 1)^2 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

For this equation, −1 is a root of multiplicity 2. This means −1 appears two times, since the equation can be rewritten in factored form as

:&lt;math&gt;[x-(-1)][x-(-1)]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Complex numbers====

All quadratic equations have exactly two solutions in [[complex numbers]] (but they may be equal to each other), a category that includes [[real number]]s, [[imaginary number]]s, and sums of real and imaginary numbers. Complex numbers first arise in the teaching of quadratic equations and the quadratic formula. For example, the quadratic equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+x+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

has solutions

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}  \quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad x=\frac{-1-\sqrt{-3}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-3}&lt;/math&gt; is not any real number, both of these solutions for ''x'' are complex numbers.

=== Exponential and logarithmic equations ===
{{Main|Logarithm}}
[[File:Binary logarithm plot with ticks.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Graph showing a logarithm curves, which crosses the ''x''-axis where ''x'' is 1 and extend towards minus infinity along the ''y''-axis.|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of the logarithm to base 2 crosses the [[x axis|''x'' axis]] (horizontal axis) at 1 and passes through the points with [[coordinate]]s {{nowrap|(2, 1)}}, {{nowrap|(4, 2)}}, and {{nowrap|(8, 3)}}. For example, {{nowrap|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(8) {{=}} 3}}, because {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 8.}} The graph gets arbitrarily close to the ''y'' axis, but [[asymptotic|does not meet or intersect it]].]]

An exponential equation is one which has the form &lt;math&gt;a^x = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Aven Choo, ''LMAN OL Additional Maths Revision Guide 3'', Publisher Pearson Education South Asia, 2007, {{ISBN|9810600011}}, 9789810600013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NsBXDMrzcJIC&amp;lpg=RA2-PA29&amp;ots=WmZmHLaTey&amp;dq=%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20%3D%20b&amp;pg=RA2-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20exponential%20equation%20%22%20aX%20=%20b&amp;f=false page 105]&lt;/ref&gt; which has solution

: &lt;math&gt;X = \log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}&lt;/math&gt;

when &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Elementary algebraic techniques are used to rewrite a given equation in the above way before arriving at the solution. For example, if

: &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{x - 1} + 1 = 10&lt;/math&gt;

then, by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, and then dividing both sides by 3 we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;2^{x - 1} = 3&lt;/math&gt;

whence

: &lt;math&gt;x - 1 = \log_2 3&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;x = \log_2 3 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

A logarithmic equation is an equation of the form &lt;math&gt;log_a(x) = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, which has solution

: &lt;math&gt;X = a^b.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if

: &lt;math&gt;4\log_5(x - 3) - 2 = 6&lt;/math&gt;

then, by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, followed by dividing both sides by 4, we get

: &lt;math&gt;\log_5(x - 3) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

whence

: &lt;math&gt;x - 3 = 5^2 = 25&lt;/math&gt;

from which we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;x = 28.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Radical equations ===
[[File:Radical equation equivalence.svg|thumb|right|Radical equation showing two ways to represent the same expression. The triple bar means the equation is true for all values of ''x'']]
A radical equation is one that includes a radical sign, which includes [[square root]]s, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x},&lt;/math&gt;  [[cube root]]s, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[nth root|''n''th roots]], &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;. Recall that an ''n''th root can be rewritten in exponential format, so that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Combined with regular exponents (powers), then  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[2]{x^3}&lt;/math&gt; (the square root of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; cubed), can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{3}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Peterson, ''Technical Mathematics With Calculus'', Publisher Cengage Learning, 2003, {{ISBN|0766861899}}, 9780766861893, 1613 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PGuSDjHvircC&amp;lpg=PA525&amp;ots=NKrt__3KKE&amp;dq=%22%20radical%20equation%22&amp;pg=PA525#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20radical%20equation%22&amp;f=false page 525]&lt;/ref&gt; So a common form of a radical equation is &lt;math&gt; \sqrt[n]{x^m}=a&lt;/math&gt; (equivalent to &lt;math&gt; x^\frac{m}{n}=a&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[integer]]s.

|&lt;math&gt;x=\pm \sqrt[m]{a^n}&lt;/math&gt;
|no real solution
|}

For example, if:

: &lt;math&gt;(x + 5)^{2/3} = 4,&lt;/math&gt;

then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x + 5 &amp; = \pm (\sqrt{4})^3\\
x + 5 &amp; = \pm 8\\
x &amp;  = -5 \pm 8\\
x &amp; = 3,-13
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== System of linear equations ===
{{Main|System of linear equations}}

There are different methods to solve a system of linear equations with two variables.

==== Elimination method ====
[[File:Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for the equations &lt;math&gt;x - y = -1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3x + y = 9&lt;/math&gt; is the single point (2,&amp;nbsp;3).]]

An example of solving a system of linear equations is by using the elimination method:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}4x + 2y&amp;= 14 \\
2x - y&amp;= 1.\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying the terms in the second equation by 2:

: &lt;math&gt;4x + 2y = 14 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;4x - 2y = 2. &lt;/math&gt;

Adding the two equations together to get:

: &lt;math&gt;8x = 16 &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;x = 2. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the fact that &lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt; is known, it is then possible to deduce that &lt;math&gt;y = 3&lt;/math&gt;  by either of the original two equations (by using ''2'' instead of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ) The full solution to this problem is then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} x = 2 \\ y = 3. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; could have been solved before &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Substitution method ====

Another way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}4x + 2y &amp;= 14
\\ 2x - y &amp;= 1.\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be deduced by using one of the two equations. Using the second equation:

: &lt;math&gt;2x - y = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; from each side of the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}2x - 2x - y &amp; = 1 - 2x  \\
- y &amp; = 1 - 2x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and multiplying by −1:

: &lt;math&gt; y = 2x - 1. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; value in the first equation in the original system:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}4x + 2(2x - 1) &amp;= 14\\
4x + 4x - 2 &amp;= 14 \\
8x - 2 &amp;= 14 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''2'' on each side of the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}8x - 2 + 2 &amp;= 14 + 2 \\
8x &amp;= 16 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;x = 2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using this value in one of the equations, the same solution as in the previous method is obtained.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} x = 2 \\ y = 3. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; in this case as well, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; could have been solved before &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Other types of systems of linear equations ===

==== Inconsistent systems ====
[[File:Parallel Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations &lt;math&gt;3x + 2y = 6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3x + 2y = 12&lt;/math&gt; are parallel and cannot intersect, and is unsolvable.]]
[[File:Quadratic-linear-equations.svg|thumb|right|Plot of a quadratic equation (red) and a linear equation (blue) that do not intersect, and consequently for which there is no common solution.]]

In the above example, a solution exists. However, there are also systems of equations which do not have any solution. Such a system is called [[inconsistent system|inconsistent]]. An obvious example is

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\begin{align} x + y &amp;= 1 \\
0x + 0y &amp;= 2\,. \end{align} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

As 0≠2, the second equation in the system has no solution. Therefore, the system has no solution.
However, not all inconsistent systems are recognized at first sight. As an example, let us consider the system 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\begin{align}4x + 2y &amp;= 12 \\
-2x - y &amp;= -4\,. \end{align}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by 2 both sides of the second equation, and adding it to the first one results in
: &lt;math&gt;0x+0y = 4 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
which has clearly no solution.

==== Undetermined systems ====

There are also systems which have infinitely many solutions, in contrast to a system with a unique solution (meaning, a unique pair of values for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\begin{align}4x + 2y &amp; = 12 \\
-2x - y &amp; = -6 \end{align}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Isolating &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the second equation:

: &lt;math&gt;y = -2x + 6 &lt;/math&gt;

And using this value in the first equation in the system:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}4x + 2(-2x + 6) = 12 \\
4x - 4x + 12 = 12 \\
12 = 12 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The equality is true, but it does not provide a value for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, one can easily verify (by just filling in some values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) that for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a solution as long as &lt;math&gt;y = -2x + 6&lt;/math&gt;. There is an infinite number of solutions for this system.

==== Over- and underdetermined systems ====

Systems with more variables than the number of linear equations are called [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]]. Such a system, if it has any solutions, does not have a unique one but rather an infinitude of them. An example of such a system is

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\begin{align}x + 2y &amp; = 10\\
y - z  &amp; = 2 .\end{align}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

When trying to solve it, one is led to express some variables as functions of the other ones if any solutions exist, but cannot express ''all'' solutions [[Number|numerically]] because there are an infinite number of them if there are any.

A system with a greater number of equations than variables is called [[overdetermined system|overdetermined]]. If an overdetermined system has any solutions, necessarily some equations are [[linear combination]]s of the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18042">'''End-to-end encryption''' ('''E2EE''') is a system of [[digital communications|communication]] where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including [[telecommunications service providers|telecom providers]], [[Internet providers]], and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] needed to [[Encryption|decrypt]] the conversation.&lt;ref name="Wired Lexicon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hacker Lexicon: What Is End-to-End Encryption?|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/|journal=WIRED|accessdate=22 December 2015|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223002912/http://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/|archivedate=23 December 2015|df=|date=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In many messaging systems, including email and many chat networks, messages pass through intermediaries and are stored by a third party, from which they are retrieved by the recipient. Even if the messages are encrypted, they are typically only encrypted 'in transit',and are stored in ''decrypted'' form by the third party. This allows the third party to provide search and other features, or to scan for illegal and unacceptable content, but also means they can be read and misused by anyone who has access to the stored messages on the third party system, whether this is by design or via a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. This can be seen as a concern in many cases where privacy is very important, such as persons living under repressive governments, [[whistleblower|whistleblowing]], [[mass surveillance]], businesses whose reputation depends on its ability to protect third party data, negotiations and communications that are important enough to have a risk of targeted 'hacking', and where sensitive subjects such as [[health]], [[sexuality]] and information about minors are involved.

End-to-end encryption is intended to prevent  data being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender but the third party does not have a means to decrypt them, and stores them encrypted. The recipient retrieves the encrypted data and decrypts it themselves. 

Because no third parties can decipher the data being communicated or stored. For example, companies that use end-to-end encryption are unable to hand over texts of their customers' messages to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Jenna|title=Democratic Debate Spawns Fantasy Talk on Encryption|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/12/21/democratic-debate-spawns-fantasy-talk-on-encryption/|work=The Intercept|date=21 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223045636/https://theintercept.com/2015/12/21/democratic-debate-spawns-fantasy-talk-on-encryption/|archivedate=23 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key exchange==
In an E2EE system, encryption keys must only be known to the communicating parties. To achieve this goal, E2EE systems can encrypt data using a pre-arranged string of symbols, called a pre-[[shared secret]] ([[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]), or a one-time secret derived from such a pre-shared secret ([[DUKPT]]). They can also negotiate a secret key on the spot using [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman key exchange]] ([[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]]).&lt;ref name="WPES'07"&gt;{{cite book | author = Chris Alexander, Ian Avrum Goldberg | title = Improved User Authentication in Off-The-Record Messaging | journal = Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Workshop on Privacy in Electronic Society | date = February 2007 | pages = 41–47 | url = https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf | doi = 10.1145/1314333.1314340 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160227020756/http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-27 | df =  | isbn = 9781595938831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
As of 2016, typical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|client]]s and [[Server (computing)|server]]s, meaning that users have to trust the third parties who are running the servers with the original texts. End-to-end encryption is regarded as safer because it reduces the number of parties who might be able to interfere or break the encryption.&lt;ref name="ssdeef"&gt;{{cite web|title=End-to-End Encryption|url=https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/end-end-encryption|website=EFF Surveillance Self-Defence Guide|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305112131/https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/end-end-encryption|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of instant messaging, users may use a third-party client to implement an end-to-end encryption scheme over an otherwise non-E2EE protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to: Use OTR for Windows|url=https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-otr-windows|website=EEF Surveillance Self-Defence Guide|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120015142/https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-otr-windows|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-E2EE systems, such as [[Lavabit]] and [[Hushmail]], have described themselves as offering "end-to-end" encryption when they did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grauer|first1=Yael|title=Mr. Robot Uses ProtonMail, But It Still Isn’t Fully Secure|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/mr-robot-uses-protonmail-still-isnt-fully-secure/|website=WIRED|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013643/https://www.wired.com/2015/10/mr-robot-uses-protonmail-still-isnt-fully-secure/ |archivedate=2017-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems, such as [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] and [[Google Allo]], have been criticized for not having end-to-end encryption, which they offer, enabled by default.&lt;ref name="cpj-2016-05-31"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Telegram's security flaws may put Iran's journalists at risk|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/05/why-telegrams-security-flaws-may-put-irans-journal.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=23 September 2016|date=31 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819013449/https://cpj.org/blog/2016/05/why-telegrams-security-flaws-may-put-irans-journal.php|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hackett|first=Robert|url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/21/google-allo-privacy-2/|title=Here's Why Privacy Savants Are Blasting Google Allo|date=21 May 2016|website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=23 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910182246/http://fortune.com/2016/05/21/google-allo-privacy-2/|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some encrypted [[backup]] and [[file sharing]] services provide [[client-side encryption]]. The encryption they offer is here not referred to as end-to-end encryption, because the services are not meant for sharing messages between users. However, the term "end-to-end encryption" is often used as a synonym for client-side encryption.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Challenges ==

=== Man-in-the-middle attacks ===
End-to-end encryption ensures that data is transferred securely between endpoints. But, rather than try to break the encryption, an eavesdropper may impersonate a message recipient (during [[key exchange]] or by substituting his [[public key cryptography|public key]] for the recipient's), so that messages are encrypted with a key known to the attacker. After decrypting the message, the snoop can then encrypt it with a key that they share with the actual recipient, or their public key in case of asymmetric systems, and send the message on again to avoid detection. This is known as a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].&lt;ref name="Wired Lexicon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|last2=Ferguson|first2=Niels|last3=Kohno|first3=Tadayoshi|title=Cryptography engineering : design principles and practical applications|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Pub., inc.|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-0470474242|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Authentication ====

Most end-to-end encryption protocols include some form of endpoint [[Authentication cookie|authentication]] specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, one could rely on [[Certificate Authority Security Council|certification authorities]] or a [[web of trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is man-in-the-middle attack (MitM)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url=http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM|website=IoT Agenda|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105000628/http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM|archivedate=5 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative technique is to generate cryptographic hashes (fingerprints) based on the communicating users’ public keys or shared secret keys. The parties compare their [[Public key fingerprint|fingerprints]] using an outside (out-of-band) communication channel that guarantees integrity and authenticity of communication (but not necessarily secrecy), before starting their conversation. If the fingerprints match, there is in theory, no man in the middle.&lt;ref name="Wired Lexicon" /&gt; 

When displayed for human inspection, fingerprints are usually encoded into [[hexadecimal]] strings.  These strings are then formatted into groups of characters for readability. For example, a 128-bit MD5 fingerprint would be displayed as follows:

  43:51:43:a1:b5:fc:8b:b7:0a:3a:a9:b1:0f:66:73:a8

Some protocols display [[natural language]] representations of the hexadecimal blocks.&lt;ref name="pEp-whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pep.foundation/docs/pEp-whitepaper.pdf|title=pEp White Paper|format=PDF|publisher=pEp Foundation Council|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001160110/https://pep.foundation/docs/pEp-whitepaper.pdf|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the approach consists of a [[one-to-one mapping]] between fingerprint blocks and words, there is no loss in [[entropy]]. The protocol may choose to display words in the user's native (system) language.&lt;ref name="pEp-whitepaper"/&gt; This can, however, make cross-language comparisons prone to errors.&lt;ref name="Marlinspike-2016-04-05"/&gt; In order to improve [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], some protocols have chosen to display fingerprints as base 10 strings instead of hexadecimal or natural language strings.&lt;ref name="Budington-2016-04-07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marlinspike-2016-04-05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marlinspike|first1=Moxie|title=WhatsApp's Signal Protocol integration is now complete|url=https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/|publisher=Open Whisper Systems|accessdate=11 October 2016|date=5 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010101243/https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern messaging applications can also display fingerprints as [[QR code]]s that users can scan off each other's devices.&lt;ref name="Budington-2016-04-07"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Budington|first1=Bill|title=WhatsApp Rolls Out End-To-End Encryption to its Over One Billion Users|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/whatsapp-rolls-out-end-end-encryption-its-1bn-users|website=Deeplinks Blog|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=11 October 2016|date=7 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912010025/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/whatsapp-rolls-out-end-end-encryption-its-1bn-users|archivedate=12 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endpoint security ===
The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves. Each user's computer can still be hacked to steal his or her cryptographic key (to create a MITM attack) or simply read the recipients’ decrypted messages both in real time and from log files. Even the most perfectly encrypted communication pipe is only as secure as the mailbox on the other end.&lt;ref name="Wired Lexicon" /&gt; Major attempts to increase endpoint security have been to isolate key generation, storage and cryptographic operations to a smart card such as Google's Project Vault.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Bort, Matt Weinberger [http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-project-vault-for-secret-messages-2015-5?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T "Google's Project Vault is a tiny computer for sending secret messages"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808195058/http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-project-vault-for-secret-messages-2015-5?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T |date=2017-08-08 }}, ''[[Business Insider]]'', NYC May 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, since plaintext input and output are still visible to the host system, malware can monitor conversations in real time. A more robust approach is to isolate all sensitive data to a fully [[Air_gap_(networking)|air gapped]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;Whonix Wiki [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Air_Gapped_OpenPGP_Key "Air Gapped OpenPGP Key"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808194727/https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Air_Gapped_OpenPGP_Key |date=2017-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGP has been recommended by experts for this purpose: {{Quote|text=If I really had to trust my life to a piece of software, I would probably use something much less flashy — GnuPG, maybe, running on an isolated computer locked in a basement. |author=[[Matthew D.

=== Backdoors ===
A backdoor is usually a secret method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device, etc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eckersley|first1=Peter|last2=Portnoy|first2=Erica|title=Intel's Management Engine is a security hazard, and users need a way to disable it|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it|accessdate=7 March 2018|agency=www.eff.org.|date=8 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306011455/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it|archivedate=6 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Companies may also willingly or unwillingly introduce [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] to their software that help subvert key negotiation or bypass encryption altogether.

A '''segment''' of a system variable shows a homogenous status of system dynamics over a time period.  Here, a homogenous status of a variable is a state which can be described by a set of coefficients of a formula. For example, of  homogenous statuses, we can bring status of constant ('ON' of a switch) and linear (60 miles or 96&amp;nbsp;km per hour for speed). Mathematically, a segment is a function mapping from a set of times which can be defined by a real interval, to the set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; [[Event_Segment#References|[Zeigler76]]],[[Event_Segment#References|[ZPK00]]], [[Event_Segment#References|[Hwang13]]]. A '''trajectory''' of a system variable is a sequence of segments concatenated. We call a trajectory constant (respectively linear) if its concatenating segments are constant (respectively linear).

An '''event segment''' is a special class of the constant segment with a constraint in which the constant segment is either one of a timed event or a null-segment. The event segments are used to define [[Timed Event System]]s such as [[DEVS]], [[timed automaton|timed automata]], and [[timed petri nets]].

== Event segments ==

=== Time base ===
The ''time base'' of the concerning systems is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{T} &lt;/math&gt;, and defined

   &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{T}=[0,\infty) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
as the set of non-negative real numbers.

=== Event and null event ===
An ''event'' is a label that abstracts a change. Given an event set &lt;math&gt; Z&lt;/math&gt;, the ''null event'' denoted by &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \not \in Z&lt;/math&gt; stands for nothing change.

=== Timed event ===
A ''timed event'' is a pair &lt;math&gt; (t,z) &lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z \in Z &lt;/math&gt; denotes that an event &lt;math&gt; z \in Z&lt;/math&gt; occurs at time &lt;math&gt; t \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Null segment ===
The ''null segment'' over time interval &lt;math&gt; [t_l, t_u] \subset \mathbb{T} &lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{[t_l, t_u]}&lt;/math&gt; which means nothing in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; occurs over &lt;math&gt; [t_l, t_u]  &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Unit event segment ===
A ''unit event segment'' is either a [[Event Segment#Null event segment|null event segment]] or a [[Event Segment#Timed event|timed event]].

=== Concatenation ===
Given an event set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, ''concatenation'' of two [[Event Segment#Unit event segment|unit event segments]]  &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[t_1, t_2]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[t_3,
t_4]&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega\omega'&lt;/math&gt; whose time interval is &lt;math&gt;[t_1,
t_4]&lt;/math&gt;, and implies &lt;math&gt;t_2 = t_3&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Event trajectory ===
An ''event trajectory''
&lt;math&gt;(t_1,z_1)(t_2,z_2) \cdots (t_n,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; over an event set &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; and a time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_l, t_u] \subset \mathbb{T} &lt;/math&gt; is concatenation of [[Event Segment#Unit event segment|unit event segments]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{[t_l,t_1]},(t_1,z_1), \epsilon_{[t_1,t_2]},(t_2,z_2),\ldots, (t_n,z_n),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{[t_n,t_u]}&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;t_l\le t_1 \le t_2 \le \cdots \le t_{n-1} \le t_n \le t_u&lt;/math&gt;.

Mathematically, an event trajectory is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; a time period &lt;math&gt;[t_l,t_u] \subseteq \mathbb{T} &lt;/math&gt; to an event set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. So we can write it in a function form :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \omega:[t_l,t_u] \rightarrow Z^*  .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Timed language ==
The ''universal timed language'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{Z,[t_l, t_u]}&lt;/math&gt; over an event set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and a time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_l, t_u] \subset \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all event trajectories over &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[t_l,t_u]&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''timed language'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; over an event set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and a timed interval
&lt;math&gt;[t_l, t_u]&lt;/math&gt; is ''a set of event trajectories'' over &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[t_l,
t_u]&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;L
\subseteq \Omega_{Z, [t_l, t_u]}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Fei–Ranis model of economic growth''' is a dualism model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]] or [[welfare economics]] that has been developed by [[John C. H. Fei]] and [[Gustav Ranis]] and can be understood as an extension of the [[Dual Sector model|Lewis model]]. It is also known as the Surplus Labor model. It recognizes the presence of a [[dual economy]] comprising both the modern and the primitive sector and takes the economic situation of unemployment and underemployment of resources into account, unlike many other growth models that consider underdeveloped countries to be homogenous in nature.&lt;ref name="Economnics4Development Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economnics4Development Website|url=http://www.economics4development.com/surplus_labor_model.htm|work=Surplus Labor Model of Economic Development|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the primitive sector consists of the existing agricultural sector in the economy, and the modern sector is the rapidly emerging but small industrial sector.&lt;ref name="Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thirlwall|first=A.P|title=Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies|year=2006|location=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1-4039-9600-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the sectors co-exist in the economy, wherein lies the crux of the development problem. Development can be brought about only by a complete shift in the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial economy, such that there is augmentation of industrial output. This is done by transfer of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial one, showing that underdeveloped countries do not suffer from constraints of labor supply. At the same time, growth in the agricultural sector must not be negligible and its output should be sufficient to support the whole economy with food and raw materials. Like in the [[Harrod–Domar model]],  saving and investment become the driving forces when it comes to economic development of underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref name="Economnics4Development Website" /&gt;

== Basics of the model ==
[[File:Phases.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Depiction of Phase1, Phase2 and Phase3 of the dual economy model using average output.]]

One of the biggest drawbacks of the [[Dual Sector model|Lewis model]] was the undermining of the role of agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in [[Workforce productivity|productivity of labor]] should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei–Ranis dual economy model of three growth stages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt; They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural development&lt;ref name=Developmentafrique.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranis-Fei model vs. Lewis Model|url=http://developmentafrique.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/RANISFEI.pdf|work=Developmentafrique.com|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Phase 1 of the Fei–Ranis model, the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from disguised unemployment. Also, the [[marginal product of labor]] is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model.In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages.&lt;ref name="The Ranis-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Economic Review|jstor=1809172|work=The Ranis-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment | volume=53|pages=448–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the help of the figure on the left, we see that

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{Phase 1}: AL (\text{from figure}) = MP = 0 \text{ and }AB (\text{from figure}) = AP \,&lt;/math&gt;

According to Fei and Ranis, AD amount of labor (see figure) can be shifted from the agricultural sector without any fall in output. Hence, it represents [[Surplus labour|surplus labor]].

&lt;math&gt;\text{Phase2}: AP &gt; MP \,&lt;/math&gt;

After AD, MP begins to rise, and industrial labor rises from zero to a value equal to AD. AP of agricultural labor is shown by BYZ and we see that this curve falls downward after AD. This fall in AP can be attributed to the fact that as agricultural laborers shift to the industrial sector, the [[real wage]] of industrial laborers decreases due to shortage of food supply, since less laborers are now working in the food sector. The decrease in the [[real wage]] level decreases the level of profits, and the size of [[Economic surplus|surplus]] that could have been re-invested for more industrialization. However, as long as surplus exists, growth rate can still be increased without a fall in the rate of industrialization. This re-investment of surplus can be graphically visualized as the shifting of MP curve outwards. In Phase2 the level of disguised unemployment is given by AK.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt; This allows the agricultural sector to give up a part of its labor-force until

:: &lt;math&gt; MP = \text{Real wages} = AB = \text{Constant institutional wages (CIW)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Phase 3 begins from '''the point of commercialization''' which is at K in the Figure. This is the point where the economy becomes completely commercialized in the absence of disguised unemployment. The supply curve of labor in Phase 3 is steeper and both the sectors start bidding equally for labor.
:: &lt;math&gt; \text{Phase3}: \text{MP} &gt; \text{CIW} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of labor that is shifted and the time that this shifting takes depends upon:
# The growth of surplus generated within the agricultural sector, and the growth of industrial capital stock dependent on the growth of industrial profits;
# The nature of the industry's technical progress and its associated bias;
# Growth rate of population.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

So, the three fundamental ideas used in this model are:
# Agricultural growth and industrial growth are both equally important;
# Agricultural growth and industrial growth are balanced;
# Only if the rate at which labor is shifted from the agricultural to the industrial sector is greater than the rate of growth of population will the economy be able to lift itself up from the [[Malthusian trap|Malthusian population trap]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

This shifting of labor can take place by the landlords' investment activities and by the government's [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] measures. However, the cost of shifting labor in terms of both private and [[social cost]] may be high, for example transportation cost or the cost of carrying out construction of buildings. In addition to that, per capita agricultural consumption can increase, or there can exist a wide gap between the wages of the urban and the rural people. These three occurrences- high cost, high consumption and high gap in wages, are called as '''leakages''', and leakages prevent the creation of agricultural surplus. In fact, surplus generation might be prevented due to a [[Backward bending supply curve of labour|backward-sloping supply curve of labor]] as well, which happens when high income-levels are not consumed. This would mean that the [[Workforce productivity|productivity of laborers]] with rise in income will not rise. However, the case of [[Backward bending supply curve of labour|backward-sloping curves]] is mostly unpractical.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

== Connectivity between sectors ==
Fei and Ranis emphasized strongly on the industry-agriculture interdependency and said that a robust connectivity between the two would encourage and speedup development. If agricultural laborers look for industrial employment, and industrialists  employ more workers by use of larger capital good stock and labor-intensive technology, this connectivity can work between the industrial and agricultural sector. Also, if the surplus owner invests in that section of industrial sector that is close to soil and is in known surroundings, he will most probably choose that productivity out of which future savings can be channelized. They took the example of Japan's dualistic economy in the 19th century and said that connectivity between the two sectors of Japan was heightened due the presence of a decentralized rural industry which was often linked to urban production. According to them, economic progress is achieved in dualistic economies of underdeveloped countries through the work of a small number of entrepreneurs who have access to land and decision-making powers and use industrial capital and consumer goods for agricultural practices.

=== Agricultural sector ===
[[File:Land Labour Graph.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Land-Labor Production Function]]

In (A), land is measured on the vertical axis, and labor on the horizontal axis. Ou and Ov represent two ridge lines, and the production [[contour line]]s are depicted by M, M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The area enclosed by the ridge lines defines the region of factor substitutability, or the region where factors can easily be substituted. Let us understand the repercussions of this. If te amount of labor is the total labor in the agricultural sector, the intersection of the ridge line Ov with the production curve M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at point s renders M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; perfectly horizontal below Ov. The horizontal behavior of the production line implies that outside the region of factor substitutability, output stops and labor becomes redundant once land is fixed and labor is increased.&lt;ref name="Paper on Labor Surplus Economies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranis|first=Gustav|title=Paper on Labor Surplus Economies|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~granis/papers/cdp0900.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Ot is the total land in the agricultural sector, ts amount of labor can be employed without it becoming redundant, and es represents the redundant agricultural labor force. This led Fei and Ranis to develop the concept of '''Labor Utilization Ratio''', which they define as the units of labor that can be productively employed (without redundancy) per unit of land. In the left-side figure, labor utilization ratio
:: &lt;math&gt; R = \frac{ts}{Ot} &lt;/math&gt;
which is graphically equal to the inverted slope of the ridge line Ov.

Fei and Ranis also built the concept of ''' endowment ratio''', which is a measure of the relative availability of the two factors of production. In the figure, if Ot represents agricultural land and tE represents agricultural labor, then the endowment ratio is given by
:: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{tE}{Ot}&lt;/math&gt;
which is equal to the inverted slope of OE.
The actual point of endowment is given by E.

Finally, Fei and Ranis developed the concept of '''non-redundancy coefficient''' T which is measured by
:: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{ts}{te} &lt;/math&gt;

These three concepts helped them in formulating a relationship between T, R and S. If ::&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ts}{te},&lt;/math&gt;
then
:: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{ts/Ot}{te/Ot} = \frac{R}{S}, \text{ or }T = \frac{R}{S} \,&lt;/math&gt;
''This mathematical relation proves that the non-redundancy coefficient is directly proportional to labor utilization ratio and is inversely proportional to the endowment ratio.''

(B) displays the total physical productivity of labor (TPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) curve. The curve increases at a decreasing rate, as more units of labor are added to a fixed amount of land. At point ''N'', the curve shapes horizontally and this point N conforms to the point G in (C, which shows the [[Marginal product of labor|marginal productivity of labor]] (MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) curve, and with point s on the ridge line Ov in (A).

=== Industrial sector ===

[[File:Capital labour.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Capital-Labor Production Function]]

Like in the agricultural sector, Fei and Ranis assume constant returns to scale in the industrial sector. However, the main factors of production are capital and labor. In the graph (A) right hand side, the [[production function]]s have been plotted taking labor on the horizontal axis and capital on the vertical axis. The expansion path of the industrial sector is given by the line OA&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As capital increases from K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and labor increases from L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the industrial output represented by the production contour A&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases accordingly.

According to this model, the prime labor supply source of the industrial sector is the agricultural sector, due to redundancy in the agricultural labor force. (B) shows the labor supply curve for the industrial sector S. PP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the straight line part of the curve and is a measure of the redundant agricultural labor force on a graph with industrial labor force on the horizontal axis and output/[[real wage]] on the vertical axis. Due to the redundant agricultural labor force, the [[real wage]]s remain constant but once the curve starts sloping upwards from point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the upward sloping indicates that additional labor would be supplied only with a corresponding rise in the [[real wage]]s level.

MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curves corresponding to their respective capital and labor levels have been drawn as M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. When capital stock rises from K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Marginal product of labor|marginal physical productivity of labor]] rises from M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. When capital stock is K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve cuts the labor supply curve at equilibrium point Po. At this point, the total [[real wage]] income is W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and is represented by the shaded area POL&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. λ is the equilibrium profit and is represented by the shaded area qPP&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the laborers have extremely low income-levels, they barely save from that income and hence industrial profits (π&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) become the prime source of investment funds in the industrial sector.

:: &lt;math&gt;K_t=K_o + S_o + \Pi_o \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; gives the total supply of investment funds (given that rural savings are represented by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)

Total industrial activity rises due to increase in the total supply of investment funds, leading to increased industrial employment.

== Agricultural surplus ==
[[:wikt:Agricultural surplus|Agricultural surplus]] in general terms can be understood as the produce from agriculture which exceeds the needs of the society for which it is being produced, and may be exported or stored for future use.

=== Generation of agricultural surplus ===

[[File:Agricultural surplus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Agricultural surplus in the dual economy of Fei and Ranis]]

To understand the formation of agricultural surplus,we must refer to graph (B) of the agricultural sector. The figure on the left is a reproduced version of a section of the previous graph, with certain additions to better explain the concept of agricultural surplus.
We first derive the average physical productivity of the total agricultural labor force (APP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). Fei and Ranis hypothesize that it is equal to the [[real wage]] and this hypothesis is known as the constant institutional wage hypothesis. It is also equal in value to the ratio of total agricultural output to the total agricultural population.  Using this relation, we can obtain APP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MP/OP. This is graphically equal to the slope of line OM, and is represented by  the line WW in (C).

Observe point Y, somewhere to the left of P on the graph. If a section of the redundant agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the industrial sector, then the labor force remaining in the industrial sector is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the [[real income]] of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the industrial sector. This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of industrial sector by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it.

=== Agricultural surplus as wage fund ===

[[File:WageFund.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Integration of agricultural and industrial sectors to explain use of agricultural surplus as wage fund in a dual economy.]]

Agricultural surplus plays a major role as a wage fund. Its importance can be better explained with the help of the graph on the right, which is an integration of the industrial sector graph with an inverted agricultural sector graph, such that the origin of the agricultural sector falls on the upper-right corner. This inversion of the origin changes the way the graph is now perceived. While the labor force values are read from the left of 0, the output values are read vertically downwards from O. The sole reason for this inversion is for the sake of convenience. The point of commercialization as explained before (See Section on [[Fei–Ranis model of economic growth#Basics of the model|Basics of the model]]) is observed at point R, where the tangent to the line ORX runs parallel to OX.

Before a section of the redundant labor force is absorbed into the industrial sector, the entire labor OA is present in the agricultural sector. Once AG amount of labor force (say) is absorbed, it represented by OG' in the industrial sector, and the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is then OG. But how is the quantity of labor absorbed into the industrial sector determined? (A) shows the supply curve of labor SS' and several demand curves for labor df, d'f' and d"f". When the demand for labor is df, the intersection of the demand-supply curves gives the equilibrium employment point G'. Hence OG represents the amount of labor absorbed into the industrial sector. In that case, the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is OG. This OG amount of labor produces an output of GF, out of which GJ amount of labor is consumed by the agricultural sector and JF is the agricultural surplus for that level of employment. Simultaneously, the unproductive labor force from the agricultural sector turns productive once it is absorbed by the industrial sector, and produces an output of OG'Pd as shown in the graph, earning a total wage income of OG'PS.

The agricultural surplus JF created is needed for consumption by the same workers who left for the industrial sector. Hence, agriculture successfully provides not only the manpower for production activities elsewhere, but also the wage fund required for the process.

=== Significance of agriculture in the Fei–Ranis model ===
The Lewis model is criticised on the grounds that it neglects agriculture. Fei–Ranis model goes a step beyond and states that agriculture has a very major role to play in the expansion of the industrial sector. In fact, it says that the rate of growth of the industrial sector depends on the amount of total agricultural surplus and on the amount of profits that are earned in the industrial sector. So, larger the amount of surplus and the amount of surplus put into productive investment and larger the amount of industrial profits earned, the larger will be the rate of growth of the industrial economy. As the model focuses on the shifting of the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial sector, Fei and Ranis believe that the ideal shifting takes place when the investment funds from surplus and industrial profits are sufficiently large so as to purchase industrial capital goods like plants and machinery. These capital goods are needed for the creation of employment opportunities. Hence, the condition put by Fei and Ranis for a successful transformation is that

Rate of increase of capital stock &amp; rate of employment opportunities &gt; Rate of population growth

== The indispensability of labor reallocation ==

As an underdeveloped country goes through its development process, labor is reallocated from the agricultural to the industrial sector. More the rate of reallocation, faster is the growth of that economy. The economic rationale behind this idea of labor reallocation is that of faster economic development. The essence of labor reallocation lies in [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]], which states that the proportion of income being spent on food decreases with increase in the income-level of an individual, even if there is a rise in the actual expenditure on food. For example, if 90 per cent of the entire population of the concerned economy is involved in agriculture, that leaves just 10 per cent of the population in the industrial sector. As the productivity of agriculture increases, it becomes possible for just 35 per cent of population to maintain a satisfactory food supply for the rest of the population. As a result, the industrial sector now has 65 per cent of the population under it. This is extremely desirable for the economy, as the growth of industrial goods is subject to the rate of per capita income, while the growth of agricultural goods is subject only to the rate of population growth, and so a bigger labor supply to the industrial sector would be welcome under the given conditions. In fact, this labor reallocation becomes necessary with time since consumers begin to want more of industrial goods than agricultural goods in relative terms.

However, Fei and Ranis were quick to mention that the necessity of labor reallocation must be linked more to the need to produce more capital investment goods as opposed to the thought of industrial consumer goods following the discourse of [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]]. This is because the assumption that the demand for industrial goods is high seems unrealistic, since the [[real wage]] in the agricultural sector is extremely low and that hinders the demand for industrial goods. In addition to that, low and mostly constant wage rates will render the wage rates in the industrial sector low and constant. This implies that demand for industrial goods will not rise at a rate as suggested by the use of [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]].

Since the growth process will observes a slow-paced increase in the consumer purchasing power, the [[Dual economy|dualistic economies]] follow the path of '''natural austerity''', which is characterized by more demand and hence importance of capital good industries as compared to consumer good ones. However, investment in capital goods comes with a long gestation period, which drives the private entrepreneurs away. This suggests that in order to enable growth, the government must step in and play a major role, especially in the initial few stages of growth. Additionally, the government also works on the social and economic overheads by the construction of roads, railways, bridges, educational institutions, health care facilities and so on.

== Growth without development ==

[[File:Realwage laboremployment.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Graph showing growth without development]]

In the Fei-Ranis model, it is possible that as technological progress takes place and there is a shift to labor-saving production techniques, growth of the economy takes place with increase in profits but no economic development takes place. This can be explained well with the help of graph in this section.

The graph displays two MPL lines plotted with real wage and MPL on the vertical axis and employment of labor on the horizontal axis. OW denotes the subsistence wage level, which is the minimum wage level at which a worker (and his family) would survive. The line WW' running parallel to the X-axis is considered to be infinitely elastics since supply of labor is assumed to be unlimited at the subsistence-wage level. The square area OWEN represents the wage bill and DWE represents the surplus or the profits collected. This surplus or profit can increase if the MPL curve changes.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

If the MPL curve changes from MPL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to MPL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to a change in production technique, such that it becomes labor-saving or [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]], then the surplus or profit collected would increase. This increase can be seen by comparing DWE with D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WE since D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WE since is greater in area compared to DWE. However, there is no new point of equilibrium and as E continues to be the point of equilibrium,there is no increase in the level of labor employment, or in wages for that matter. Hence, labor employment continues as ON and wages as OW. The only change that accompanies the change in production technique is the one in surplus or profits.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

This makes for a good example of a process of growth without development, since growth takes place with increase in profits but development is at a standstill since employment and wages of laborers remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

== Reactions to the model ==

[[File:Food Leisure.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Food-Leisure Graph]]

'''Fei–Ranis model of economic growth''' has been criticized on '''multiple''' grounds, although if the model is accepted, then it will have a significant theoretical and policy implications on the underdeveloped countries' efforts towards development and on the persisting controversial statements regarding the balanced vs. unbalanced growth debate.&lt;ref name="On the Empirical Relevancy of the Rans-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment" /&gt;

* It has been asserted that Fei and Ranis did not have a clear understanding of the sluggish economic situation prevailing in the developing countries. If they had thoroughly scrutinized the existing nature and causes of it, they would have found that the existing agricultural backwardness was due to the institutional structure, primarily the system of [[feudalism]] that prevailed.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis say, "It has been argued that money is not a simple substitute for [[physical capital]] in an aggregate [[production function]]. There are reasons to believe that the relationship between money and [[physical capital]] could be complementary to one another at some stage of economic development, to the extent that credit policies could play an important part in easing bottlenecks on the growth of agriculture and industry." This indicates that in the process of development they neglect the role of money and prices. They fail to differ between wage labor and household labor, which is a significant distinction for evaluating prices of dualistic development in an underdeveloped economy.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis assume that MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero during the early phases of economic development, which has been criticized by Harry T.Oshima and some others on the grounds that MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of labor is zero only if the agricultural population is very large, and if it is very large, some of that labor will shift to cities in search of jobs. In the short run, this section of labor that has shifted to the cities remains unemployed, but over the long run it is either absorbed by the informal sector, or it returns to the villages and attempts to bring more marginal land into cultivation. They have also neglected seasonal unemployment, which occurs due to seasonal change in labor demand and is not permanent.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Misra, Puri|first=S.K, V.K|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=Himalaya Publishing House|location=Mumbai, India|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=270–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To understand this better, we refer to the graph in this section, which shows Food on the vertical axis and Leisure on the horizontal axis. OS represents the subsistence level of food consumption, or the minimum level of food consumed by agricultural labor that is necessary for their survival. I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; between the two commodities of food and leisure (of the agriculturists). The origin falls on G, such that OG represents maximum labor and labor input would be measured from the right to the left.
The [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] SAG falls from A, which indicates that more leisure is being used to same units of land. At A, the marginal transformation between food and leisure and MPL = 0 and the indifference curve I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is also tangent to the [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] at this point. This is the point of leisure satiation.

Consider a case where a laborer shifts from the agricultural to the industrial sector. In that case, the land left behind would be divided between the remaining laborers and as a result, the [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] would shift from SAG to RTG. Like at point A, MPL at point T would be 0 and APL would continue to be the same as that at A (assuming constant returns to scale). If we consider MPL = 0 as the point where agriculturalists live on the subsistence level, then the curve RTG must be flat at point T in order to maintain the same level of output. However, that would imply leisure satiation or leisure as an [[inferior good]], which are two extreme cases. It can be surmised then that under normal cases, the output would decline with shift of labor to industrial sector, although the per capita output would remain the same. This is because, a fall in the per capita output would mean fall in consumption in a way that it would be lesser than the subsistence level, and the level of labor input per head would either rise or fall.

Berry and Soligo in their 1968 paper have criticized this model for its MPL=0 assumption, and for the assumption that the transfer of labor from the agricultural sector leaves the output in that sector unchanged in Phase 1. They show that the output changes, and may fall under various [[land tenure]] systems, unless the following situations arise:&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Subrata|first=Ghatak|title=Introduction to Developmental Economics|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-09722-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Leisure falls under the [[inferior good]] category
2. Leisure satiation is present.
3. There is perfect substitutability between food and leisure, and the [[marginal rate of substitution]] is constant for all real income levels.

Now if MPL&gt;0 then leisure satiation option becomes invalid, and if MPL=0 then the option of food and leisure as perfect substitutes becomes invalid. Therefore, the only remaining viable option is leisure as an [[inferior good]].

* While mentioning the important role of high agricultural productivity and the creation of surplus for economic development, they have failed to mention the need for capital as well. Although it is important to create surplus, it is equally important to maintain it through technical progress, which is possible through [[capital accumulation]], but the Fei-Ranis model considers only labor and output as [[factors of production]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* The question of whether MPL = 0 is that of an empirical one. The underdeveloped countries mostly exhibit seasonality in food production, which suggests that especially during favorable climatic conditions, say that of harvesting or sowing, MPL would definitely be greater than zero.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis assume a close model and hence there is no presence of foreign trade in the economy, which is very unrealistic as food or raw materials can not be imported. If we take the example of Japan again, the country imported cheap farm products from other countries and this made better the country's terms of trade.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt; Later they relaxed the assumption and said that the presence of a foreign sector was allowed as long as it was a "facilitator" and not the main driving force.&lt;ref name="On the Empirical Relevancy of the Rans-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=J. Choo|first=Hakchung|title=American Economic Review|jstor=1811863|work=On the Empirical Relevancy of the Rans-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment|volume=61|pages=695–703}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reluctant expansionary growth in the industrial sector of underdeveloped countries can be attributed to the lagging growth in the productivity of subsistence agriculture. This suggests that increase in surplus becomes more important a determinant as compared to re-investment of surplus, an idea that was utilized by  Jorgenson in his 1961 model that centered around the necessity of surplus generation and surplus persistence.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* [[Economic stagnation|Stagnation]] has not been taken into consideration, and no distinction is made between labor through family and labor through wages. There is also no explanation of the process of self-sustained growth, or of the investment function. There is complete negligence of terms of trade between agriculture and industry, foreign exchange, money and price.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

{{About|the distribution introduced by Diaz and Teruel|the Tsallis q-Gaussian|q-Gaussian}}

In [[mathematical physics]] and [[probability]] and [[statistics]], the '''Gaussian ''q''-distribution''' is a family of [[probability distribution]]s that includes, as [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]s, the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] and the [[Normal distribution|normal (Gaussian) distribution]]. It was introduced by Diaz and Teruel,{{Clarify|reason=literature suggests that others originated this|date=August 2011}} is a [[q-analogue]] of the Gaussian or [[normal distribution]].

The distribution is symmetric about zero and is bounded, except for the limiting case of the normal distribution. The limiting uniform distribution is on the range -1 to +1.

==Definition==
[[Image:Gaussianq-density2.jpg|thumb|500px|The Gaussian q-density.]]

Let ''q'' be a [[real number]] in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1). The [[probability density function]] of the  Gaussian ''q''-distribution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;s_q(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if }  x &lt; -\nu  \\ \frac{1}{c(q)}E_{q^2}^{\frac{-q^2x^2}{[2]_q}}  &amp; \text{if } -\nu \leq x \leq \nu \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt;\nu. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \nu(q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c(q)=2(1-q)^{1/2}\sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m q^{m(m+1)}}{(1-q^{2m+1})(1-q^2)_{q^2}^m} .&lt;/math&gt;

The ''q''-analogue [''t'']&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; of the real number &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt; [t]_q=\frac{q^t-1}{q-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''q''-analogue of the [[exponential function]] is the [[q-exponential]], ''E''{{su|b=''q''|p=''x''}}, which is given by

: &lt;math&gt; E_q^{x}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j-1)/2}\frac{x^{j}}{[j]!}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''q''-analogue of the [[factorial]] is the [[q-factorial]], [''n'']&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;!, which is in turn given by

: &lt;math&gt; [n]_q!=[n]_q[n-1]_q\cdots [2]_q \, &lt;/math&gt;

for an integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 and [1]&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;! =&amp;nbsp;[0]&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;!&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

[[Image:CumulativeGaussianq-distribution2.jpg|thumb|500px|The Cumulative Gaussian q-distribution.]]

The [[cumulative distribution function]] of the Gaussian ''q''-distribution is given by

: &lt;math&gt;G_q(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; -\nu \\[12pt]
\displaystyle \frac{1}{c(q)}\int_{-\nu}^{x} E_{q^2}^{-q^2 t^2/[2]} \, d_qt &amp; \text{if }  -\nu \leq x \leq \nu \\[12pt]
1 &amp; \text{if } x&gt;\nu
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[integral|integration]] symbol denotes the [[Jackson integral]].

The function ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is given explicitly by

: &lt;math&gt;G_q(x)= \begin{cases}  0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; -\nu, \\
\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1-q}{c(q)} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{q^{n(n+1)}(q-1)^n}{(1-q^{2n+1})(1-q^2)_{q^2}^{n}}x^{2n+1} &amp;  \text{if } -\nu \leq x \leq \nu \\
1 &amp; \text{if}\ x &gt; \nu
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;(a+b)_q^n=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(a+q^ib) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Moments==
The [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of the Gaussian ''q''-distribution are given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c(q)}\int_{-\nu}^\nu E_{q^2}^{-q^2 x^2/[2]} \, x^{2n} \, d_qx =[2n-1]!! ,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c(q)}\int_{-\nu}^\nu E_{q^{2}}^{-q^2 x^2/[2]} \, x^{2n+1} \, d_qx=0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol [2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;nowiki&gt;!!&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the ''q''-analogue of the [[double factorial]] given by

: &lt;math&gt; [2n-1][2n-3]\cdots[1]= [2n-1]!!. \, &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6017">'''The Geometry Center''' was a [[mathematics]] research and education center at the [[University of Minnesota]]. It was established by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the late 1980s and closed in 1998. The focus of the Center's work was the use of [[computer graphics]] and [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] for research and education in [[pure mathematics]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=ripams/&gt;

The Center's founding director was [[Albert Marden|Al Marden]].  Richard McGehee directed the Center during its final years. The Center's governing board was chaired by [[David P. Dobkin]].&lt;ref name=ripams&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathmedia/archive/09-2002-media.html#geomcenter "Post-mortem on the Geometry Center" ''Math in the Media'' (AMS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomview==
Much of the work done at the Center was for the development of ''Geomview'', a three-dimensional [[interactive geometry software|interactive geometry program]]. This focused on mathematical visualization with options to allow [[hyperbolic space]] to be visualised. It was originally written for [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations, and has been ported to run on [[Linux]] systems; it is available for installation in most Linux distributions through the package management system. ''Geomview'' can run under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] using [[Cygwin]] and under [[Mac OS X]].  Geomview has a web site at {{URL|http://www.geomview.org}}.

Geomview is built on the Object Oriented Graphics Library (OOGL). The displayed scene and the attributes of the objects in it may be manipulated by the graphical command language (GCL) of Geomview. Geomview may be set as a default 3-D viewer for [[Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1115?page=0,1&amp;quicktabs_1=0 "Geomview], ''[[Linux Journal]]'', March 1, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomview source is available at {{URL|http://www.sourceforge.net}}, which also has a required Motif download.  For Mac OS X users, {{URL|http://www.macports.org/}} provides a direct route to download and compile geomview.

==Videos==
''Geomview'' was used in the construction of several mathematical movies including:
*''Not Knot'', exploring hyperbolic space rendering of [[knot theory|knot]] complements. [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/video/NotKnot/]
*''Outside In'', an award-winning movie about [[sphere eversion]]. [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/outreach/oi/]
*''The shape of space'', exploring possible three dimensional spaces. [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/video/sos/]

==Other software==
Other programs developed at the Center included:
*''[[WebEQ]]'', a [[web browser]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] allowing mathematical equations to be viewed and edited. [http://www.geomtech.com/portfolio]
*''Kali'', to explore plane [[symmetry group]]s. [http://geometrygames.org/Kali/index.html]

The '''Gompertz–Makeham law'''
states that the human death rate is the sum of an age-independent component (the Makeham term, named after [[William Makeham]])&lt;ref name="Makeham1860"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makeham|first=W. M.|authorlink=|date=|year=1860|title=On the Law of Mortality and the Construction of Annuity Tables|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-41134925|journal=J. Inst. Actuaries and Assur. Mag.|volume=8|issue=|pages=301–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an age-dependent component (the [[Gompertz function]], named after [[Benjamin Gompertz]]),&lt;ref name="Gompertz1825"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gompertz |first=B. |authorlink= |year=1825 |title=On the Nature of the Function Expressive of the Law of Human Mortality, and on a New Mode of Determining the Value of Life Contingencies |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=115 |issue= |pages=513–585 |id= |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-55920 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1825.0026}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which [[exponential growth|increases exponentially]] with age.&lt;ref name="Leonid"&gt;Leonid A. Gavrilov &amp; Natalia S. Gavrilova (1991) The Biology of Life Span: A Quantitative Approach. New York: Harwood Academic Publisher, {{ISBN|3-7186-4983-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a protected environment where external causes of death are rare (laboratory conditions, low mortality countries, etc.), the age-independent mortality component is often negligible. In this case the formula simplifies to a Gompertz law of mortality. In 1825, Benjamin Gompertz proposed an exponential increase in death rates with age.

The Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality describes the age dynamics of human mortality rather accurately in the age window from about 30 to 80 years of age. At more advanced ages, some studies have found that death rates increase more slowly – a phenomenon known as the [[late-life mortality deceleration]]&lt;ref name="Leonid" /&gt; – but more recent studies disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavrilov|first1=Leonid A.|last2=Gavrilova|first2=Natalia S.|title=Mortality Measurement at Advanced Ages: A Study of the Social Security Administration Death Master File|journal=North American Actuarial Journal|date=2011|pages=432–447|url=http://longevity-science.org/pdf/Mortality-NAAJ-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the human [[mortality rate]] before the 1950s was mostly due to a decrease in the age-independent (Makeham) mortality component, while the age-dependent (Gompertz) mortality component was surprisingly stable.&lt;ref name="Leonid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilov |first=L.

The [[hazard function]] for the Gompertz-Makeham distribution is most often characterised as &lt;math&gt;h(x)=\alpha e^{\beta x} + \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. The empirical magnitude of the beta-parameter is about .085, implying a doubling of mortality every .69/.085 = 8 years (Denmark, 2006).

The [[quantile function]] can be expressed in a closed-form expressions using the [[Lambert W function]]:&lt;ref name="Jodra2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jodrá |first=P. |authorlink= |year=2009 |title=A closed-form expression for the quantile function of the Gompertz–Makeham distribution |journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation |volume=79 |issue= 10|pages=3069–3075 |id= |url= |doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2009.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gompertz law is the same as a [[Fisher–Tippett distribution]] for the negative of age, restricted to negative values for the [[random variable]] (positive values for age).

In [[mathematics]], especially in the fields of [[universal algebra]] and [[graph theory]], a '''graph algebra''' is a way of giving a [[directed graph]] an [[algebraic structure]].  It was introduced in {{harv|McNulty|Shallon|1983}}, and has seen many uses in the field of universal algebra since then.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;D=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be a directed [[graph (data structure)|graph]], and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; an element not in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The graph algebra associated with &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;V \cup \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with multiplication defined by the rules
* &lt;math&gt;xy = x&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V,(x,y)\in E&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;xy = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V\cup \{0\},(x,y)\notin E&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==

This notion has made it possible to use the methods of graph theory in universal algebra and several other directions of discrete mathematics and computer science. Graph algebras have been used, for example, in constructions concerning dualities {{harv|Davey|Idziak|Lampe|McNulty|2000}}, [[equational theory|equational theories]] {{harv|Pöschel|1989}}, [[flatness (systems theory)|flatness]] {{harv|Delić|2001}}, [[groupoid (algebra)|groupoid]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s {{harv|Lee|1991}}, [[topology|topologies]] {{harv|Lee|1988}}, [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] {{harv|Oates-Williams|1984}}, [[finite state automata]] {{harv|Kelarev|Miller|Sokratova|2005}}, [[finite state machine]]s {{harv|Kelarev &amp; Sokratova|2003}}, 
tree languages and [[tree automata]] {{harv|Kelarev|Sokratova|2001}} etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">In [[geometry]], '''Hessenberg varieties''', first studied by Filippo De Mari, [[Claudio Procesi]], and Mark A. Shayman, are a family of [[subvarieties]] of the full [[flag variety]] which are defined by a Hessenberg function ''h'' and a linear transformation&amp;nbsp;''X''.  The study of Hessenberg varieties was first motivated by questions in [[numerical analysis]] in relation to algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the linear operator&amp;nbsp;''X''.  Later work by [[T. A. Springer]], Dale Peterson, [[Bertram Kostant]], among others, found connections with [[combinatorics]], [[representation theory]] and [[cohomology]].

== Definitions ==
A ''Hessenberg function'' is a map 

:&lt;math&gt;h :\{1,2, \ldots,n \} \rightarrow \{1,2, \ldots,n \}&lt;/math&gt; 

such that 

:&lt;math&gt; h(i+1) \geq \text{max }(i,h(i))&lt;/math&gt;

for each ''i''. For example, the function that takes the sends the numbers 1 to 5 (in order) to 2, 3, 3, 4, and 5 is a Hessenberg function.

For any Hessenberg function ''h'' and a linear transformation 

:&lt;math&gt; X: \Complex^n \rightarrow \Complex^n, \, &lt;/math&gt;

the ''Hessenberg variety'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}(X,h)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all flags &lt;math&gt; F_{\bullet} &lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt; X \cdot F_i \subseteq F_{h(i)} &lt;/math&gt; 

for all ''i''.

== Examples ==
Some examples of Hessenberg varieties (with their &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; function) include:

The Full Flag variety: ''h''(''i'') = ''n'' for all ''i''

The [[Peterson variety]]: &lt;math&gt;h(i) = i+1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i = 1,2,\dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Springer variety]]: &lt;math&gt; h(i) = i &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.

==Mathematical contributions==

===Early work===
Cannon's early work concerned topological aspects of embedded surfaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and understanding the difference between "tame" and "wild" surfaces.

His first famous result came in late 1970s when Cannon gave a complete solution to a long-standing "double suspension" problem posed by [[John Milnor]]. Cannon proved that the double [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of a [[homology sphere]] is a topological sphere.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Cannon, [http://www.ams.org/bull/1978-84-05/S0002-9904-1978-14527-3/home.html ''The recognition problem: what is a topological manifold?'']
[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 84 (1978), no. 5, pp. 832–866.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shr"&gt;J. W. Cannon, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1971245 ''Shrinking cell-like decompositions of manifolds. Codimension three.''] [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), '''110''' (1979), no. 1, 83–112.&lt;/ref&gt; R. D. Edwards had previously proven this in many cases.

The results of Cannon's paper&lt;ref name="shr"/&gt; were used by Cannon, Bryant and Lacher to prove (1979)&lt;ref name="CBL"&gt;J. W. Cannon, J. L. Bryant and R. C. Lacher, ''The structure of generalized manifolds having nonmanifold set of trivial dimension''. Geometric topology (Proc. Georgia Topology Conf., Athens, Ga., 1977), pp. 261–300, Academic Press, New York-London, 1979. {{ISBN|0-12-158860-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an important case of the so-called ''characterization conjecture'' for topological manifolds. The conjecture says that a [[generalized manifold|generalized ''n''-manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the "disjoint disk property" is a topological manifold. Cannon, Bryant and Lacher established&lt;ref name="CBL"/&gt; that the conjecture holds under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a manifold except possibly at a set of dimension &lt;math&gt;(n-2)/2&lt;/math&gt;. Later [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]]. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t607584n91gm2152/ ''Resolutions of homology manifolds, and the topological characterization of manifolds.''] [[Inventiones Mathematicae]], vol. 72 (1983), no. 2, pp. 267–284.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the proof that the characterization conjecture holds if there is even a single manifold point.  In general, the conjecture is false as was proved by John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and [[Shmuel Weinberger]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and [[Shmuel Weinberger]], ''Topology of homology manifolds'', [[Annals of Mathematics]] '''143''' (1996), pp. 435-467; {{MR|1394965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: Hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifolds and geometric group theory===
In 1980s the focus of Cannon's work shifted to the study of [[3-manifold]]s, [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[Kleinian group]]s and he is considered one of the key figures in the birth of [[geometric group theory]] as a distinct subject in late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannon's 1984 paper "The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups"&lt;ref name="C84"&gt;J. W. Cannon, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v6051511338244x2/ ''The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups.''] Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 16 (1984), no. 2, pp. 123–148.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of [[word-hyperbolic group]]s, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;M. Gromov, ''Hyperbolic Groups'', in: "Essays in Group Theory" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the [[Cayley graph]]s of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the [[hyperbolic 3-space|hyperbolic space]]. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit [[finitely presented group|finite presentations]] where the [[Small cancellation theory#Dehn.27s algorithm|Dehn algorithm]] solves the [[word problem for groups|word problem]]. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being [[word-hyperbolic group|word-hyperbolic]] and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in [[word-hyperbolic group]]s is solvable by Dehn's algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Sher, R. J. Daverman. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYxdADnhZoC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=%22word-hyperbolic+group%22+cannon&amp;ei=5J7VSIOoJKeSjgHJjfGCBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U0ynlhqLsom-02HGkSR4l5EIldIxA Handbook of Geometric Topology.] Elsevier, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-444-82432-5}}; p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's 1984 paper&lt;ref name="C84"/&gt; also introduced an important notion a ''cone type'' of an element of a [[finitely generated group]] (roughly, the set of all geodesic extensions of an element). Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a [[rational function]]. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the [[word-hyperbolic group]] context.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; Now standard proofs&lt;ref name="aut"/&gt; of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a [[word-hyperbolic group]] is a [[regular language]] also use finiteness of the number of cone types.

Cannon's work also introduced an important notion of ''almost convexity'' for Cayley graphs of [[finitely generated group]]s,&lt;ref&gt;James W. Cannon. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7747325117n73132/ ''Almost convex groups.''] Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 22 (1987), no. 2, pp. 197–210.&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that led to substantial further study and generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Hermiller|S. Hermiller]] and J. Meier, ''Measuring the tameness of almost convex groups''. [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] vol. 353 (2001), no. 3, pp. 943–962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Cleary and J. Taback, ''Thompson's group ''F'' is not almost convex''. Journal of Algebra, vol. 270 (2003), no. 1, pp. 133–149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Elder and [[Susan Hermiller|S. Hermiller]], ''Minimal almost convexity''. Journal of Group Theory, vol. 8 (2005), no. 2, pp. 239–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential paper of Cannon and [[William Thurston]] "Group invariant Peano curves",&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Cannon and W. P. Thurston. [http://www.msp.warwick.ac.uk/gt/2007/11/b026.html ''Group invariant Peano curves''.] [[Geometry &amp; Topology]], vol. 11 (2007), pp. 1315–1355.&lt;/ref&gt; that first circulated in a preprint form in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Darryl McCullough, {{MR|2326947}} (a review of: Cannon, James W.; Thurston, William P. 'Group invariant Peano curves'. Geom. Topol. 11 (2007), 1315–1355), [[MathSciNet]]; Quote::''This influential paper dates from the mid-1980's. Indeed, preprint versions are referenced in more than 30 published articles, going back as early as 1990"&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the notion of what is now called the [[Cannon–Thurston map]]. They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold ''M'' that [[fiber bundle|fibers]] over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface ''S''. In this case the universal cover of ''S'', which is identified with the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], admits an embedding into the universal cover of ''M'', which is the [[hyperbolic 3-space]]. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')-equivariant [[surjective]] map (now called the ''Cannon–Thurston map'') from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] (the [[2-sphere]]).
Although the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of [[Mahan Mj|Mahan Mitra]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahan Mj|Mahan Mitra]]. [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-9383(97)00036-0 ''Cannon–Thurston maps for hyperbolic group extensions.''] [[Topology (journal)|Topology]], vol. 37 (1998), no. 3, pp. 527–538.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahan Mitra. [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214460609 ''Cannon–Thurston maps for trees of hyperbolic metric spaces.''] [[Journal of Differential Geometry]], vol. 48 (1998), no. 1, pp. 135–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Erica Klarreich,&lt;ref&gt;Erica Klarreich, ''Semiconjugacies between Kleinian group actions on the Riemann sphere.'' [[American Journal of Mathematics]], vol. 121 (1999), no. 5, 1031–1078.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Bowditch]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Bowditch]]. ''The Cannon–Thurston map for punctured-surface groups.'' [[Mathematische Zeitschrift]], vol. 255 (2007), no. 1, pp. 35–76.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

===1990s and 2000s: Automatic groups, discrete conformal geometry and Cannon's conjecture===
Cannon was one of the co-authors of the 1992 book "Word Processing in Groups"&lt;ref name="aut"&gt;David B. A. Epstein, James W. Cannon, Derek F. Holt, Silvio V. Levy, Michael S. Paterson, William P. Thurston. ''Word processing in groups.'' [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]], Boston, MA, 1992. {{ISBN|0-86720-244-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of [[automatic group]]s. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from [[computer science]] to [[geometric group theory]] and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s.

A 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the "[[combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem]]"&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;James W. Cannon. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9w0608p039151254/ ''The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem''.] [[Acta Mathematica]] 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155–234.&lt;/ref&gt; that was motivated by the classic [[Riemann mapping theorem]] in [[complex analysis]]. The goal was to understand when an [[group action|action]] of a group by [[homeomorphism]]s on a [[2-sphere]] is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard [[Riemann sphere]] by [[Möbius transformation]]s. The "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual [[conformal structure]] on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt; (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as [[Cannon's conjecture]], regarding characterizing [[word-hyperbolic group]]s with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in &lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;) states that if the ideal boundary of a [[word-hyperbolic group]] ''G'' is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[2-sphere]], then ''G'' admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] (so that ''G'' is essentially a 3-dimensional [[Kleinian group]]). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a [[word-hyperbolic group]] ''G'' is homeomorphic to the [[2-sphere]] then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'', is [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric]] to the standard 2-sphere.

The 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt; gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard "disks" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial "conformal" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''Sufficiently rich families of planar rings.'' Annales Academiæ Scientiarium Fennicæ. Mathematica. vol. 24 (1999), no. 2, pp. 265–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''Finite subdivision rules''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 5 (2001), pp. 153–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''Expansion complexes for finite subdivision rules. I. ''Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 10 (2006), pp. 63–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannon's conjecture motivated much of subsequent work by other mathematicians and to a substantial degree informed subsequent interaction between [[geometric group theory]] and the theory of analysis on metric spaces.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bourdon and H. Pajot, ''Quasi-conformal geometry and hyperbolic geometry.'' In: Rigidity in dynamics and geometry (Cambridge, 2000), pp. 1–17, Springer, Berlin, 2002; {{ISBN|3-540-43243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Bonk and Bruce Kleiner, ''Conformal dimension and Gromov hyperbolic groups with 2-sphere boundary''.

Vol. II, pp. 1349–1373, Eur. Math. Soc., Zürich, 2006; {{ISBN|978-3-03719-022-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Keith, T. Laakso, ''Conformal Assouad dimension and modulus''. ''Geometric and Functional Analysis'', vol 14 (2004), no. 6, pp. 1278–1321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Mineyev, [http://www.ams.org/ecgd/2007-11-11/S1088-4173-07-00165-8/home.html ''Metric conformal structures and hyperbolic dimension.''] Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 11 (2007), pp. 137–163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Kleiner, ''The asymptotic geometry of negatively curved spaces: uniformization, geometrization and rigidity''. International Congress of Mathematicians. Vol. II, pp. 743–768, Eur. Math. Soc., Zürich, 2006. {{ISBN|978-3-03719-022-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's conjecture was motivated (see &lt;ref name="CS"&gt;J. W. Cannon and E. L. Swenson, ''Recognizing constant curvature discrete groups in dimension 3''. [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] 350 (1998), no. 2, pp. 809–849.&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Geometrization conjecture|Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture]] and by trying to understand why in dimension three variable negative curvature can be promoted to constant negative curvature. Although the [[Geometrization conjecture]] was recently settled by [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]], Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in [[geometric group theory]] and [[geometric topology]].

===Applications to biology===
The ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem",&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.&lt;ref name="biol"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZHyqUli9y8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22james+w.+cannon%22+maths&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RP1svsBqga&amp;sig=kxyEXFBqOG5NnJncng9HHniHyrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA65,M1 ''Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry''.] Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65–82. World Scientific, 2000. {{ISBN|981-02-3792-8}}, {{ISBN|978-981-02-3792-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple [[finite subdivision rules]] can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; They suggested that the "negatively curved" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; In particular they suggested (see section 3.4 of &lt;ref name="biol"/&gt;) that such "negatively curved" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Lattice multiplication''', also known as '''gelusia multiplication''', '''sieve multiplication''', '''shabakh''', '''Venetian squares''', or the '''Chinese lattice''', is a method of [[multiplication]] that uses a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] to multiply two multi-digit numbers. It is mathematically identical to the more commonly used [[long multiplication]] algorithm, but it breaks the process into smaller steps, which some practitioners find easier to use.&lt;ref name="Lattice multiplication" /&gt;

The method had already arisen by medieval times, and has been used for centuries in many different cultures. It is still being taught in certain curricula today.&lt;ref&gt;Boag, Elizabeth, “Lattice Multiplication,” ''BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics'' 22:3 (Nov. 2007), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Patricia M., “Lattice Multiplication in a Preservice Classroom”, ''Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School'' 13:2 (Sept. 2007), pp. 110-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
A grid is drawn up, and each cell is split diagonally. The two [[multiplicand]]s of the product to be calculated are written along the top and right side of the lattice, respectively, with one digit per column across the top for the first multiplicand (the number written left to right), and one digit per row down the right side for the second multiplicand (the number written top-down). Then each cell of the lattice is filled in with product of its column and row digit.

As an example, let's consider the multiplication of 58 with 213. After writing the multiplicands on the sides, consider each cell, beginning with the top left cell. In this case, the column digit is 5 and the row digit is 2. Write their product, 10, in the cell, with the digit 1 above the diagonal and the digit 0 below the diagonal (see picture for Step 1).

If the simple product lacks a digit in the tens place, simply fill in the tens place with a 0.&lt;ref name="Lattice multiplication" /&gt;
[[File:Example of step 1 of lattice (shabakh) multiplication algorithm.svg|center|frame|Step 1]]
After all the cells are filled in this manner, the digits in each diagonal are summed, working from the bottom right diagonal to the top left. Each diagonal sum is written where the diagonal ends. If the sum contains more than one digit, the value of the tens place is carried into the next diagonal (see Step 2).
[[File:Example of step 2 of lattice (shabakh) multiplication algorithm.svg|center|frame|Step 2]]
Numbers are filled to the left and to the bottom of the grid, and the answer is the numbers read off down (on the left) and across (on the bottom).

== Multiplication of decimal fractions ==
The lattice technique can also be used to multiply [[decimal fractions]].  For example, to multiply 5.8 by 2.13, the process is the same as to multiply 58 by 213 as described in the preceding section.  To find the position of the decimal point in the final answer, one can draw a vertical line from the decimal point in 5.8, and a horizontal line from the decimal point in 2.13.  The grid diagonal through the intersection of these two lines then determines the position of the decimal point in the result.{{Examples|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name="Lattice multiplication"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Lattice multiplication has been used historically in many different cultures. It is not known where it arose first, nor whether it developed independently within more than one region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., ''A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip'' (Berlin: Springer, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of lattice multiplication:&lt;ref name="Jean-Luc Chabert 1999 pp. 21-26"&gt;Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., ''A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip'' (Berlin: Springer, 1999), pp. 21-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

* in Arab mathematics was by [[Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi]] in his ''Talkhīṣ a‘māl al-ḥisāb'', in the Maghreb in the late 13th century
* in European mathematics was by the unknown author of a Latin treatise in England, ''Tractatus de minutis philosophicis et vulgaribus'', c. 1300
* in Chinese mathematics was by Wu Jing in his ''Jiuzhang suanfa bilei daquan'', completed in 1450.

The mathematician and educator [[David Eugene Smith]] asserted that lattice multiplication was brought to Italy from the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Eugene, ''History of Mathematics'', Vol. 2, “Special Topics of Elementary Mathematics” (New York: Dover, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced by noting that the Arabic term for the method, ''shabakh'', has the same meaning as the Italian term for the method, ''gelosia'', namely, the metal grille or grating (lattice) for a window.

It is sometimes erroneously stated that lattice multiplication was described by [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] (Baghdad, c. 825) or by [[Fibonacci]] in his ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' (Italy, 1202, 1228).&lt;ref&gt;The original 1202 version of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' is lost. The 1228 version was later published in its original Latin in Boncompagni, Baldassarre, ''Scritti di Leonardo Pisano'', vol. 1 (Rome: Tipografia delle Scienze Matematiche e Fisiche, 1857); an English translation of the same was published by Sigler, Laurence E., ''Fibonacci’s Liber Abaci: A Translation into Modern English of Leonardo Pisano’s Book of Calculation'' (New York: Springer Verlag, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, however, no use of lattice multiplication by either of these two authors has been found. In Chapter 3 of his ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', [[Fibonacci]] does describe a related technique of multiplication by what he termed ''quadrilatero in forma scacherii'' (“rectangle in the form of a chessboard”). In this technique, the square cells are not subdivided diagonally; only the lowest-order digit is written in each cell, while any higher-order digit must be remembered or recorded elsewhere and then "carried" to be added to the next cell. This is in contrast to lattice multiplication, a distinctive feature of which is that the each cell of the rectangle has its own correct place for the carry digit; this also implies that the cells can be filled in any order desired. Swetz &lt;ref&gt;Swetz, Frank J., ''Capitalism and Arithmetic: The New Math of the 15th Century, Including the Full Text of the Treviso Arithmetic of 1478, Translated by David Eugene Smith'' (La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1987), pp. 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; compares and contrasts multiplication by ''gelosia'' (lattice), by ''scacherii'' (chessboard), and other tableau methods.

Other notable historical uses of lattice multiplication include:&lt;ref name="Jean-Luc Chabert 1999 pp. 21-26"/&gt;

* [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]]’s ''Miftāḥ al-ḥisāb'' (Samarqand, 1427), in which the numerals used are sexagesimal (base 60), and the grid is turned 45 degrees to a “diamond” orientation
* the ''Arte dell’Abbaco'', an anonymous text published in the Venetian dialect in 1478, often called the [[Treviso Arithmetic]] because it was printed in Treviso, just inland from Venice, Italy
* [[Luca Pacioli]]’s ''[[Summa de arithmetica]]'' (Venice, 1494)
* the Indian astronomer Gaṇeśa’s commentary on [[Bhāskara II]]’s ''[[Lilavati|Lilāvati]]'' (16th century).

==Derivations==
Derivations of this method also appeared in the 16th century in [[Matrakci Nasuh]]'s ''Umdet-ul Hisab''.&lt;ref&gt;Corlu, M.S., Burlbaw, L.M., Capraro, R. M., Corlu, M.A.,&amp; Han, S. (2010). "The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and The Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh." ''Journal of the Korea Society of Mathematical Education'', Series D: Research in Mathematical Education. 14(1), p 19-31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]'s triangular version of the multiplication technique is seen in the example showing 155 x 525 on the right, and explained in the example showing 236 x 175 on the left figure.&lt;ref&gt;https://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/471488/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:matraki2.jpg|300px|thumb|center]]

The same principle described by [[Matrakci Nasuh]] underlay the later development of the calculating rods known as [[Napier's bones]] (Scotland, 1617) and [[Genaille–Lucas rulers]] (France, late 1800s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16621">In [[computer science]], a '''loop invariant''' is a property of a [[Computer program|program]] [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] that is true before (and after) each iteration. It is a [[logical assertion]], sometimes checked within the code by an [[Assertion (software development)|assertion]] call. Knowing its invariant(s) is essential in understanding the effect of a loop.

In [[formal verification|formal program verification]], particularly the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]], loop invariants are expressed by formal [[predicate logic]] and used to prove properties of loops and by extension [[algorithm]]s that employ loops (usually [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]] properties).
The loop invariants will be true on entry into a loop and following each iteration, so that on exit from the loop both the loop invariants and the loop termination condition can be guaranteed.

From a programming methodology viewpoint, the loop invariant can be viewed as a more abstract specification of the loop, which characterizes the deeper purpose of the loop beyond the details of this implementation. A survey article &lt;ref&gt;Carlo A. Furia, [Bertrand Meyer] and Sergey Velder. "Loop invariants: analysis, classification, and examples."ACM Computing Surveys.  vol. 46, no. 3, February 2014([http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/methodology/invariants.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; covers fundamental algorithms from many areas of computer science (searching, sorting, optimization, arithmetic etc.), characterizing each of them from the viewpoint of its invariant.

Because of the similarity of loops and [[recursion|recursive]] programs, proving partial correctness of loops with invariants is very similar to proving correctness of recursive programs via [[structural induction|induction]].  In fact, the loop invariant is often the same as the inductive hypothesis to be proved for a recursive program equivalent to a given loop.

[[Loop-invariant code motion]], which involves moving code out of the loop if that does not change the effect of the program, is not directly related to loop invariants, which are properties of the loop overall.



==Informal example==
The following [[C (programming language)|C]] [[subroutine]] &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum value in its argument array &lt;code&gt;a[]&lt;/code&gt;, provided its length &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is at least 1.
Comments are provided at lines 3, 6, 9, 11, and 13. Each comment makes an assertion about the values of one or more variables at that stage of the function.
The highlighted assertions within the loop body, at the beginning and end of the loop (lines 6 and 11), are exactly the same. They thus describe an invariant property of the loop.
When line 13 is reached, this invariant still holds, and it is known that the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; from line 5 has become false. Both properties together imply that &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; equals the maximum value in &lt;code&gt;a[0...n-1]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, that the correct value is returned from line 14.

    int i = 1;
    while (i != n) {
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
        if (m &lt; a[i])
            m = a[i];
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i]
        ++i;
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
    }
    // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1], and i==n
    return m;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Following a [[defensive programming]] paradigm, the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; in line 5 should better be modified to &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt;, in order to avoid endless looping for illegitimate negative values of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. While this change in code intuitively shouldn't make a difference, the reasoning leading to its correctness becomes somewhat more complicated, since then only &lt;code&gt;i&gt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is known in line 13. In order to obtain that also &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds, that condition has to be included into the loop invariant. It is easy to see that &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt;, too, is an invariant of the loop, since &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt; in line 6 can be obtained from the (modified) loop condition in line 5, and hence &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds in line 11 after &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; has been incremented in line 10. However, when loop invariants have to be manually provided for formal program verification, such intuitively too obvious properties like &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; are often overlooked.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[partial correctness]] of a [[while loop]] is governed by the following rule of inference:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}} {\{I\}\;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}\;\{\lnot C\land I\}}&lt;/math&gt;

This means:
* If some property &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is preserved by the code &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; —more precisely, if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; holds after the execution of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; held beforehand— ''(upper line)'' then
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are guaranted to be false and true, respectively, after the execution of the whole loop &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; was true before the loop ''(lower line)''.

In other words: The rule above is a deductive step that has as its premise the [[Hoare triple]] &lt;math&gt;\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This triple is actually a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on machine states.  It holds whenever starting from a state in which the boolean expression &lt;math&gt;C\land I&lt;/math&gt; is true and successfully executing some code called &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, the machine ends up in a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true.  If this relation can be proven, the rule then allows us to conclude that successful execution of the program &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; will lead from a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true to a state in which &lt;math&gt;\lnot C\land I&lt;/math&gt; holds.  The boolean formula &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in this rule is known as the loop invariant.

The loop invariant plays an important role in the intuitive argument for soundness of the Floyd-Hoare rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops.  The loop invariant has to be true before each iteration of the loop body, and also after each iteration of the loop body.  Since a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is precisely the repeated iteration of the loop body, it follows that if the invariant is true before entering the loop, it must also be true after exiting the loop.

===Example===
The following example illustrates how this rule works.  Consider the program

 while (x &lt; 10)
     x := x+1;

One can then prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{x=10\}&lt;/math&gt;

The condition ''C'' of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt;.  A useful loop invariant &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; has to be guessed; it will turn out that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is appropriate.  Under these assumptions it is possible to prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x&lt;10 \land x\leq10\}\; x := x+1 \;\{x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

While this triple can be derived formally from the rules of Floyd-Hoare logic governing assignment, it is also intuitively justified: Computation starts in a state where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10 \land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is true, which means simply that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; is true.  The computation adds 1 to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is still true (for integer x).

Under this premise, the rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops permits the following conclusion:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1 \;\{\lnot(x&lt;10) \land x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the post-condition &lt;math&gt;\lnot(x&lt;10)\land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to 10, but it is not less than 10) is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;x=10&lt;/math&gt;, which is what we wanted to show.

The property &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x&lt;/math&gt; is another invariant of the example loop, and the trivial property &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; is another one.
Applying the above inference rule to the former invariant yields &lt;math&gt;\{0 \leq x\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying it to invariant &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\{\mathrm{true}\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is slightly more expressive.

==Programming language support==

===Eiffel===
The [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] programming language provides native support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]], ''Eiffel: The Language,'' [[Prentice Hall]], 1991, pp. 129–131.&lt;/ref&gt; A loop invariant is expressed with the same syntax used for a [[class invariant]]. In the sample below, the loop invariant expression &lt;code&gt;x&amp;nbsp;&lt;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/code&gt; must be true following the loop initialization, and after each execution of the loop body; this is checked at runtime.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;    from
        x := 0
    invariant
        x &lt;= 10
    until
        x &gt; 10
    loop
        x := x + 1
    end&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Whiley===
The [[Whiley (programming language)|Whiley]] programming language also provides first-class support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Designing a Verifying Compiler: Lessons Learned from Developing Whiley | doi=10.1016/j.scico.2015.09.006 | volume=113 | journal=Science of Computer Programming | pages=191–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loop invariants are expressed using one or more &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, as the following illustrates:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="whiley"&gt;
function max(int[] items) -&gt; (int r)
// Requires at least one element to compute max
requires |items| &gt; 0
// (1) Result is not smaller than any element
ensures all { i in 0..|items| | items[i] &lt;= r }
// (2) Result matches at least one element
ensures some { i in 0..|items| | items[i] == r }:
    //
    nat i = 1
    int m = items[0]
    //
    while i &lt; |items|
    // (1) No item seen so far is larger than m
    where all { k in 0..i | items[k] &lt;= m }
    // (2) One or more items seen so far matches m
    where some { k in 0..i | items[k] == m }:
        if items[i] &gt; m:
            m = items[i]
        i = i + 1
    //
    return m
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; function determines the largest element in an integer array.  For this to be defined, the array must contain at least one element.  The [[postconditions]] of &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; require that the returned value is: (1) not smaller than any element; and, (2) that it matches at least one element.  The loop invariant is defined inductively through two &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, each of which corresponds to a clause in the postcondition.  The fundamental difference is that each clause of the loop invariant identifies the result as being correct up to the current element &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, whilst the postconditions identify the result as being correct for all elements.

==Use of loop invariants==

A loop invariant can serve one of the following purposes:
# purely documentary 
# to be checked within in the code by an assertion call
# to be verified based on the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]]

For 1., a natural language comment (like &lt;code&gt;// m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]&lt;/code&gt; in the [[#Informal example|above]] example) is sufficient.

For 2., programming language support is required, such as the [[C (programming language)|C]] library [[assert.h]], or the [[#Eiffel|above]]-shown &lt;code&gt;invariant&lt;/code&gt; clause in Eiffel. Often, run-time checking can be switched on (for debugging runs) and off (for production runs) by a compiler or a runtime option.{{citation needed|reason=hope that C's or/and Eiffel assert.h supports that?|date=May 2016}}

For 3., some tools exist to support mathematical proofs, usually based on the [[#Floyd–Hoare logic|above]]-shown Floyd–Hoare rule, that a given loop code in fact satisfies a given (set of) loop invariant(s).

The technique of [[abstract interpretation]] can be used to detect loop invariant of given code automatically. However, this approach is limited to very simple invariants (such as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n &amp;&amp; i%2==0&lt;/code&gt;).

==Distinction from loop-invariant code==
{{see|Loop-invariant code motion}}
A loop invariant (loop-invariant ''property'') is to be distinguished from loop-invariant ''code''; note "loop invariant" (noun) versus "loop-invariant" (adjective).
Loop-invariant code consists of statements or expressions that can be moved outside the body of a loop without affecting the semantics of a program; such transformations, called [[loop-invariant code motion]], are performed by some compilers to [[optimizing compiler|optimize]] programs.
A loop-invariant code example (in the [[C programming language]]) is
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + x*x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
where the calculations &lt;code&gt;x = y+z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x*x&lt;/code&gt; can be moved before the loop, resulting in an equivalent, but faster, program:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x = y+z;
t1 = x*x;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In contrast, e.g. the property &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is a loop invariant for both the original and the optimized program, but is not part of the code, hence it doesn't make sense to speak of "moving it out of the loop".

Loop-invariant code may induce a corresponding loop-invariant property.{{clarify|reason=I guess, once the notion of 'loop-invariant code' is defined in a sufficiently formal way, it can be proven that loop-invariant code *always* induces a corresponding loop invariant property.|date=March 2016}} For the above example, the easiest way to see it is to consider a program where the loop invariant code is computed both before and within the loop:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x1 = y+z;
t1 = x1*x1;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x2 = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
A loop-invariant property of this code is &lt;code&gt;(x1==x2 &amp;&amp; t1==x2*x2) || i==0&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the values computed before the loop agree with those computed within (except before the first iteration).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The '''Lwów school of mathematics''' ({{lang-pl|lwowska szkoła matematyczna}}) was a group of Polish [[mathematician]]s who worked between the two [[World War]]s in [[Lwów]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (since 1945 [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). The mathematicians often met at the famous [[Scottish Café]] to discuss mathematical problems, and published in the journal ''[[Studia Mathematica]]'', founded in 1929. The school was renowned for its productivity and its extensive contributions to subjects such as [[point-set topology]], [[set theory]] and [[functional analysis]]. The biographies and contributions of these mathematicians were documented in 1980 by their contemporary [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] in his book ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics: Remembrances and Reflections''.

Many of the mathematicians, especially those of [[Jew]]ish background, fled this southeastern part of Poland in 1941 when it became clear that it would be invaded by [[Germany]]. Few of the mathematicians survived [[World War II]], but after the war a group including some of the original community carried on their work in western Poland's [[Wrocław]], the successor city to prewar Lwów; see [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)]]. A number of the prewar mathematicians, prominent among them [[Stanisław Ulam]], became famous for work done in the West.

Notable members of the Lwów school of mathematics included:
* [[Stefan Banach]]
* [[Feliks Barański]]
* [[Władysław Orlicz]]
* [[Stanisław Saks]]

In [[recursion theory|computability theory]] the '''Myhill isomorphism theorem''', named after [[John Myhill]], provides a characterization for two [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]]s to induce the same notion of computability on a set.

== Myhill isomorphism theorem ==

Sets ''A'' and ''B'' of [[natural number]]s are said to be '''[[computable isomorphism|recursively isomorphic]]''' if there is a [[total function|total]] [[computable function|computable]] [[bijection]] ''f'' from the set of natural numbers to itself such that ''f''(''A'') = ''B''. 

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is said to be '''[[many-one reduction|one-one reducible]]''' to a set ''B'' if there is a total computable injection ''f'' on the natural numbers such that &lt;math&gt;f(A) \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbb{N} \setminus A) \subseteq \mathbb{N} \setminus B&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Myhill's isomorphism theorem''' states that two sets ''A'' and ''B'' of natural numbers are recursively isomorphic if and only if ''A'' is one-reducible to ''B'' and ''B'' is one-reducible to ''A''.

The theorem is reminiscent of the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem|Schroeder–Bernstein theorem]].  The proof is different, however.  The proof of Schroeder-Bernstein uses the inverses of the two injections, which is impossible in the setting of the Myhill theorem since these inverses might not be recursive.  The proof of the Myhill theorem, on the other hand, defines the bijection inductively, which is impossible in the setting of Schroeder-Bernstein unless one uses the Axiom of Choice (which is not necessary for the proof).

A corollary of Myhill's theorem is that two [[Numbering (computability theory)|total numberings]] are [[one equivalent numbering|one-equivalent]] if and only if they are [[computable isomorphism|computably isomorphic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Nielsen theory''' is a branch of mathematical research with its origins in [[topological]] [[fixed point theory]]. Its central ideas were developed by Danish mathematician [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], and bear his name.

The theory developed in the study of the so-called ''minimal number'' of a [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' from a [[compact (topology)|compact]] space to itself, denoted ''MF''[''f'']. This is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MF}[f] = \min \{ \# \mathrm{Fix}(g) \, | \, g \sim f \},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''~'' indicates [[homotopy]] of mappings, and #Fix(''g'') indicates the number of fixed points of ''g''. The minimal number was very difficult to compute in Nielsen's time, and remains so today. Nielsen's approach is to group the fixed point set into classes, which are judged "essential" or "nonessential" according to whether or not they can be "removed" by a homotopy.

Nielsen's original formulation is equivalent to the following:
We define an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of fixed points of a self-map ''f'' on a space ''X''. We say that ''x'' is equivalent to ''y'' if and only if there exists a [[path (topology)|path]] ''c'' from ''x'' to ''y'' with ''f''(''c'') homotopic to ''c'' as paths. The equivalence classes with respect to this relation are called the '''Nielsen classes''' of ''f'', and the '''Nielsen number''' ''N''(''f'') is defined as the number of Nielsen classes having non-zero [[fixed point index]] sum.

Nielsen proved that
:&lt;math&gt;N(f) \le \mathit{MF}[f],&lt;/math&gt;
making his invariant a good tool for estimating the much more difficult ''MF''[''f'']. This leads immediately to what is now known as the '''Nielsen fixed point theorem:''' ''Any map f has at least N(f) fixed points.''

Because of its definition in terms of the [[fixed point index]], the Nielsen number is closely related to the [[Lefschetz number]]. Indeed, shortly after Nielsen's initial work, the two invariants were combined into a single "generalized Lefschetz number" (more recently called the [[Reidemeister trace]]) by [[Wecken]] and [[Reidemeister]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">In [[computational complexity theory]], the '''padding argument''' is a tool to conditionally prove that if some [[complexity classes]] are equal, then some other bigger classes are also equal.

== Example ==

The proof that  [[P (complexity)|P]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[NP (complexity)|NP]] implies [[EXP]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[NEXP]] uses "padding". &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EXP} \subseteq \mathrm{NEXP}&lt;/math&gt; by definition, so it suffices to show &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NEXP} \subseteq \mathrm{EXP}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let ''L'' be a language in NEXP.  Since ''L'' is in NEXP, there is a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] ''M'' that decides ''L'' in time &lt;math&gt;2^{n^c}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c''.  Let 

: &lt;math&gt;L'=\{x1^{2^{|x|^c}} \mid x \in L\},&lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''1'' is a symbol not occurring in ''L''.  First we show that &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; is in NP, then we will use the deterministic polynomial time machine given by P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP to show that ''L'' is in EXP.

&lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; can be [[Decision problem|decided]] in non-deterministic polynomial time as follows. Given input &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, verify that it has the form &lt;math&gt;x' = x1^{2^{|x|^c}}&lt;/math&gt; and reject if it does not.  If it has the correct form, simulate ''M(x)''.  The simulation takes non-deterministic &lt;math&gt;2^{|x|^c}&lt;/math&gt; time, which is polynomial in the size of the input, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; is in NP.  By the assumption P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP, there is also a deterministic machine ''DM'' that decides &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.  We can then decide ''L'' in deterministic exponential time as follows.  Given input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, simulate &lt;math&gt;DM(x1^{2^{|x|^c}})&lt;/math&gt;. This takes only exponential time in the size of the input, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  

The &lt;math&gt;1^d&lt;/math&gt; is called the "padding" of the language ''L''. This type of argument is also sometimes used for space complexity classes, alternating classes, and bounded alternating classes.

'''Paul Ernest''' is a contributor to the [[social constructivist]] philosophy of [[mathematics]]. Ernest's philosophical sources are the later works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[fallibilism]] of [[Imre Lakatos]]. This social constructivist philosophy claims that both the theorems and truths of mathematics, and the objects of mathematics, are cultural products created by humans. Furthermore, the theorems and truths of mathematics always remain [[wikt:corrigible|corrigible]], [[wikt:revisible|revisible]], and indeed fallible — in principle at least. This does not mean that mathematical knowledge is flawed or at risk. However, the claim is that the belief that mathematical knowledge is infallible cannot be demonstrated, it is an article of faith, even if the warrants for mathematical knowledge are the strongest warrants available to humankind for any knowledge claims. Ernest illustrates this position in his discussion of the issue of whether mathematics is discovered or invented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ex.ac.uk/~PErnest/pome12/article2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His fullest exposition of the social constructivist position is given in the 1998 reference, although an earlier version is given in the 1991 reference. Ernest's version of social constructivism is controversial and has led to strong criticism. The principal criticism is that mathematical theorems are truths and truths by their nature are infallible.

In his account of social constructivism Ernest links the worlds of research mathematics and that of school and college mathematics. This link is achieved though the role of experts who as teachers communicate mathematical knowledge to learners and warrant their personal knowledge by means of testing and assessment. As researchers experts both create new mathematical knowledge and warrant the productions of others. Through this linkage the personal knowledge of the experts is developed and itself warranted. Both explicit mathematical knowledge representations and personal mathematical knowledge circulate between the worlds of education and research, which are not themselves wholly disjoint. The personal knowledge cycle is mutually refreshing for both education and research. A criticism of this account is that if mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and accepted it might be accepted purely on the basis of group agreement. However Ernest argues that mathematical knowledge communication, creation and warranting take place in historical communities that respect traditions of mathematical practice with embedded and partly tacit criteria for acceptability. Such rules include accepted forms of presentation, reasoning, and consistency. Although these are historically contingent they are never arbitrary and in general conserve mathematical concepts, theories and rules of acceptance. Furthermore, the democratic, rational and critical elements of mathematical thinking and mathematical communities mean that errors are eliminated. A criticism of this position is that it conflates the social institution of mathematics with objective mathematical knowledge.

Paul Ernest was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in to parents [[John Ernest]] and [[Elna Ernest]] (née [[Adlerbert]]). However he has lived and worked in the UK since childhood, apart from two years of teaching at the [[University of the West Indies]], Jamaica (1982–84). He is currently emeritus professor of the [[philosophy of mathematics education]] at Exeter University, UK. Originally a student of mathematics and philosophy up to PhD level he became interested in educational issues through teaching school mathematics in London during the 1970s. His main research interests concern fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics and how it relates to teaching, learning and society. He has developed a [[semiotic]] theory of mathematics and education. He is best known for his work on philosophical aspects of [[mathematics education]] and his contributions to developing a social constructivist [[philosophy of mathematics]]. He is currently working on the [[ethics]] of mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">A '''propositional directed acyclic graph (PDAG)''' is a [[data structure]] that is used to represent a [[Boolean function]].  A Boolean function can be represented as a rooted, [[directed acyclic graph]] of the following form:
* Leaves are labeled with &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (true), &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; (false), or a Boolean variable.
* Non-leaves are &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; (logical and), &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangledown&lt;/math&gt; (logical or) and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; (logical not).
* &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangledown&lt;/math&gt;-nodes have at least one child.
* &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;-nodes have exactly one child.

Leaves labeled with &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;) represent the constant Boolean function which always evaluates to 1 (0). A leaf labeled with a Boolean variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the assignment &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. it represents the Boolean function which evaluates to 1 if and only if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;. The Boolean function represented by a &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt;-node is the one that evaluates to 1, if and only if the Boolean function of all its children evaluate to 1. Similarly, a &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangledown&lt;/math&gt;-node represents the Boolean function that evaluates to 1, if and only if the Boolean function of at least one child evaluates to 1. Finally, a &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;-node represents the complemenatary Boolean function its child, i.e. the one that evaluates to 1, if and only if the Boolean function of its child evaluates to 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7025">[[File:Reye configuration.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Reye configuration]]
In mathematics, the '''Reye configuration''', introduced by {{harvs|first=Theodor|last=Reye|authorlink=Theodor Reye|year=1882|txt}}, is a [[Configuration (geometry)|configuration]] of 12 points and 16 lines.
Each point of the configuration belongs to four lines, and each line contains three points. Therefore, in the notation of configurations, the Reye configuration is written as 12&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;16&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Realization==
The Reye configuration can be realized in three-dimensional [[projective space]] by taking the lines to be the 12 edges and four long diagonals of a [[cube]], and the points as the eight vertices of the cube, its center, and the three points where groups of four parallel cube edges meet the plane at infinity. Two regular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] may be inscribed within a cube, forming a [[stella octangula]]; these two tetrahedra are perspective figures to each other in four different ways, and the other four points of the configuration are their centers of perspectivity. These two tetrahedra together with the tetrahedron of the remaining 4 points form a [[desmic system]] of three tetrahedra.

Any two disjoint spheres in three dimensional space, with different radii, have two [[bitangent]] [[Cone (geometry)|double cones]], the apexes of which are called the centers of similitude. If three spheres are given, with their centers non-collinear, then their six centers of similitude form the six points of a [[complete quadrilateral]], the four lines of which are called the axes of similitude. And if four spheres are given, with their centers non-coplanar, then they determine 12 centers of similitude and 16 axes of similitude, which together form an instance of the Reye configuration {{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952}}.

The Reye configuration can also be realized by points and lines in the [[Euclidean plane]], by drawing the three-dimensional configuration in [[three-point perspective]]. An 8&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;12&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; configuration of eight points in the [[real projective plane]] and 12 lines connecting them, with the connection pattern of a cube, can be extended to form the Reye configuration if and only if the eight points are a [[perspective projection]] of a [[parallelepiped]] {{harv|Servatius|Servatius|2010}}
  
The 24 permutations of the points &lt;math&gt;(\pm 1, \pm 1, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;
form the vertices of a [[24-cell]] centered at the origin of four-dimensional Euclidean space.
These 24 points also form the 24 roots in the [[root system]] &lt;math&gt;D_4&lt;/math&gt;.
They can be grouped into pairs of points opposite each other on a line through the origin. The lines and planes through the origin of four-dimensional Euclidean space have the geometry of the points and lines of three-dimensional [[projective space]], and in this three-dimensional projective space the lines through opposite pairs of these 24 points and the central planes through these points become the points and lines of the Reye configuration {{harv|Manivel|2006}}. The permutations of &lt;math&gt;(\pm 1, \pm 1, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; form the [[homogeneous coordinates]] of the 12 points in this configuration.

==Application==
{{Harvtxt|Aravind|2000}} pointed out that the Reye configuration underlies some of the proofs of the [[Bell–Kochen–Specker theorem]] about the non-existence of hidden variables in quantum mechanics.

==Related configurations==
The [[Pappus configuration]] may be formed from two triangles that are perspective figures to each other in three different ways, analogous to the interpretation of the Reye configuration involving desmic tetrahedra.

If the Reye configuration is formed from a cube in three-dimensional space, then there are 12 planes containing four lines each: the six face planes of the cube, and the six planes through pairs of opposite edges of the cube. Intersecting these 12 planes and 16 lines with another plane in general position produces a 16&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;12&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, the dual of the Reye configuration. The original Reye configuration and its dual together form a 28&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;28&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration {{harv|Grünbaum|Rigby|1990}}.

There are 574 distinct configurations of type 12&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;16&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{harv|Betten|Betten|2005}}.

In [[geometry]], the '''rhombitrioctagonal tiling''' is a semiregular tiling of the 
[[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]. At each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the tiling there is one [[triangle]] and one [[octagon]], alternating between two [[square (geometry)|square]]s. The tiling has [[Schläfli symbol]] rr{8,3}. It can be seen as constructed as a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[trioctagonal tiling]], r{8,3}, as well as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]] [[octagonal tiling]] or expanded [[order-8 triangular tiling]].

== Symmetry ==
This tiling has [8,3], (*832) symmetry. There is only one uniform coloring.

Similar to the Euclidean [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]], by edge-coloring there is a half symmetry form (3*4) [[orbifold notation]]. The octagons can be considered as truncated squares, t{4} with two types of edges. It has [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|8|node_1}}, [[Schläfli symbol]] s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3,8}. The squares can be distorted into [[isosceles trapezoid]]s. In the limit, where the rectangles degenerate into edges, an [[order-8 triangular tiling]] results, constructed as an [[snub tritetratrigonal tiling]], {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|8|node}}.

From a [[Wythoff construction]] there are ten hyperbolic [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tilings]] that can be based from the regular octagonal tiling.

Drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces, yellow at the original vertices, and blue along the original edges, there are 8 forms.

This tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.n.4), and continues as tilings of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]. These [[vertex-transitive]] figures have (*n32) reflectional [[Orbifold notation|symmetry]].

The development of Singapore math began in the 1980s when the country's [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] developed its own mathematics textbooks that focused on problem solving and heuristic model drawing.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerard Wright"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wright|first= Gerard| title=Mathematics Mighty Ducks| newspaper=The Age|location= Australia|date = May 12, 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/mathematics-mighty-ducks/2008/05/10/1210131279908.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Singapore, these textbooks were adopted by several schools in the [[United States]] (U.S.) and in other countries such as [[Canada]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cris Prystay"&gt;{{cite news|last=Prystay|first=Cris|title=As math skills slip, U.S. schools seek answers from Asia|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|location=|date=December 13, 2004|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB110288916514797758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wong|first1=Khoon Yoong|last2=Lee|first2=Ngan Hoe|chapter=Singapore education and mathematics curriculum |title=Mathematics Education: The Singapore Journey| editor=Wong Koon Yoong|editor2=Lee Peng Yee|editor3=Berinderjeet Kaur| editor4=Foong Pui Yee |editor5=Ng Swee Fong|volume=2|date=February 19, 2009|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|pages=13–47|location=Singapore |isbn=981-283-375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early adopters of these textbooks in the U.S. included parents interested in [[homeschooling]] as well as a limited number of schools.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt; These textbooks became more popular since the release of scores from the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS), which showed Singapore at the top of the world four times in fourth and eighth grade mathematics.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garelick | first = Barry | title = Miracle math: A successful program from Singapore tests the limits of school reform in the suburbs. | journal = Educational Next | volume=6 | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://educationnext.org/miracle-math/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timss2015"/&gt; U.S. editions of these textbooks have since been adopted by a large number of [[School district#United States|school districts]] as well as [[Charter schools in the United States|charter]] and [[private schools]].&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt;

== History ==

Before the development of its own mathematics textbooks in the 1980s, Singapore imported its mathematics textbooks from other countries.&lt;ref name="Peng Yee Lee"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lee|first=Peng Yee|title=Sixty years of mathematics syllabi and textbooks in Singapore|booktitle=Mathematics Curriculum in Pacific Rim Countries—China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore Proceedings of a Conference|editor-last=Usiskin|editor-first=Zalman |editor2-last=Willmore |editor2-first=Edwin|pages=85–92|publisher=Information Age Publishing |date=September 12, 2008|location=|isbn=1-59311-953-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore (CDIS) (currently the Curriculum Planning and Development Division) began to develop its own mathematics textbooks and curriculum. The CDIS developed and distributed a textbook series for [[Primary school|elementary schools]] in Singapore called ''Primary Mathematics'', which was first published in 1982 and subsequently revised in 1992 to emphasize problem solving.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garelick | first = Barry | title = A tale of two countries and one school district. | journal = Nonpartisan Education Review | volume=6 | issue=8 | year = 2006 | url = http://npe.educationnews.org/Review/Essays/v2n8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fang&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fang|first1=Yanping|last2=Lee|first2=Christine Kim-Eng|last3=Haron|first3=Sharifah Thalha Bte Syed|chapter=Lesson study in mathematics: Three cases in Singapore |title=Mathematics Education: The Singapore Journey| editor=Wong Koon Yoong|editor2=Lee Peng Yee|editor3=Berinderjeet Kaur| editor4=Foong Pui Yee |editor5=Ng Swee Fong|volume=2|date=February 19, 2009|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|pages=104–129|location=Singapore |isbn=981-283-375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, the country's Ministry of Education opened the elementary school textbook market to private companies, and [[Marshall Cavendish]],  a local and private publisher of educational materials, began to publish and market the ''Primary Mathematics'' textbooks.&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell Landsberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Landsberg|first=Mitchell|title=In L.A., Singapore math has added value|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, CA|date=March 9, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/09/local/me-math9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Singapore's curricular and instructional initiatives, dramatic improvements in math proficiency among Singaporean students on international assessments were observed.&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt; TIMSS, an international assessment for math and science among fourth and eighth graders, ranked Singapore's fourth and eighth grade students first in mathematics four times (1995, 1999, 2003, and 2015) among participating nations.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timss2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurney-Read|first=Josie|title=Revealed: World pupil rankings in science and maths - TIMSS results in full|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=|date=November 29, 2016|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/11/29/revealed-world-pupil-rankings-science-maths-timss-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)'s [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), a worldwide study of 15-year-old school students' scholastic performance in mathematics, [[science]], and [[Reading (process)|reading]], has ranked Singaporean students first in 2015,&lt;ref name="pisa2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|title=Pisa tests: Singapore top in global education rankings|publisher=BBC|location=|date=December 6, 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-38212070}}&lt;/ref&gt; and second after [[Shanghai]], [[China]] in 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillon|first=sam|title=Top test scores from shanghai stun educators|newspaper=New York Times|location=New York, NY|date=December 7, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|author=The Economist|title=Finn-ished|newspaper=The Economist|location=|date=December 7, 2013|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21591195-fall-former-nordic-education-star-latest-pisa-tests-focusing-interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the TIMSS publication of Singapore's high ranking in mathematics, professional mathematicians in the U.S. took a closer look at Singapore mathematics textbooks such as ''Primary Mathematics''.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"/&gt; The term ''Singapore math'' was originally coined in the U.S. to describe the teaching approach based on these textbooks.&lt;ref name="US term" /&gt; In 2005, the [[American Institutes for Research]] (AIR) published a study, which concluded that U.S. schools could benefit from adopting these textbooks.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"/&gt; The textbooks were already distributed in the U.S. by Singapore Math, Inc., a private venture based in Oregon.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry2"/&gt; Early users of these textbooks in the U.S. included parents interested in [[homeschooling]] as well as a limited number of schools.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt; They became more popular since the release of the TIMSS scores showing Singapore's top ranking.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"/&gt; As of 2004, U.S. versions of Singapore mathematics textbooks were adopted in over 200 U.S. schools.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cris Prystay" /&gt; Schools and counties that had adopted these textbooks reported improvements in their students' performance.&lt;ref name="Cris Prystay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell Landsberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyle Moroney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moroney|first=Kyle|title=How Common Core standards are affecting elementary, middle school math classes|newspaper=MLive|location=|date=December 2, 2013|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/12/kentwood_first_west_michigan_s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore math textbooks were also used in schools from other countries such as [[Canada]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cris Prystay"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;

==Features==

===Covers fewer topics in greater depth===

Compared to a traditional U.S. math curriculum, Singapore math focuses on fewer topics but covers them in greater detail.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu" /&gt; Each semester-level Singapore math textbook builds upon prior knowledge and skills, with students mastering them before moving on to the next grade. Students, therefore, need not re-learn these skills at the next grade level.&lt;ref name="Laura Brown"/&gt; By the end of sixth grade, Singapore math students have mastered multiplication and division of fractions and can solve difficult multi-step word problems.&lt;ref name="Hoven and Garelick"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hoven | first = John | last2 = Garelick | first2 = Barry | title = Singapore Math: Using the bar model approach, Singapore textbooks enable students to solve difficult math problems--and learn how to think symbolically. | journal = Educational Leadership | volume=65 |pages =28–21 | date = November 2007 | url = http://www.utahsmathfuture.com/usj.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., it was found that Singapore math emphasizes the essential math skills recommended in the 2006 Focal Points publication by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM), the 2008 final report by the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, and the proposed [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]], though it generally progresses to topics at an earlier grade level compared to U.S. standards.&lt;ref name="www2.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Mathematics Advisory Panel |title=Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf | publisher=U.S. Department of Education| date=March 2008|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarah Garland"&gt;{{cite news |last=Garland|first= Sarah|title=How Does Common Core Compare?|newspaper= Huffington Post|date= October 16, 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/common-core-compare_n_4102973.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three-step learning process===
{{Main article|Arithmetic}}
[[File:Whole-part model addition 70 plus 30.jpg|thumb|right|250px| A bar model used to solve an addition problem. This pictorial approach is typically used as a problem-solving tool in Singapore math.]]
Singapore math teaches students mathematical concepts in a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial, and abstract.&lt;ref name="Winnie Hu"/&gt; This learning process was based on the work of an American psychologist, [[Jerome Bruner]]. In the 1960s, Bruner found that people learn in three stages by first handling real objects before transitioning to pictures and then to symbols.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC|title=Can the Singapore method help your children learn maths?|publisher=BBC|date=December 2, 2013|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/0/24925787}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore government later adapted this approach to their math curriculum in the 1980s.

The first of the three steps is concrete, wherein students learn while handling objects such as chips, dice, or paper clips.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Knake" /&gt; Students learn to count these objects (e.g., paper clips) by physically lining them up in a row. They then learn basic [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|arithmetic operations]] such as [[addition]] or [[subtraction]] by physically adding or removing the objects from each row.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Students then transition to the pictorial step by drawing diagrams called "bar-models" to represent specific quantities of an object.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; This involves drawing a rectangular bar to represent a specific quantity. For instance, if a short bar represents five paper clips, a bar that is twice as long would represent ten. By visualizing the difference between the two bars, students learn to solve problems of addition by adding one bar to the other, which will, in this instance, produce an answer of fifteen paper clips. They can use this method to solve other mathematical problems involving subtraction, [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoven and Garelick" /&gt; Bar modeling is far more efficient than the "guess-and-check" approach, in which students simply guess combinations of numbers until they stumble onto the solution.&lt;ref name="Garelick Barry" /&gt;

Once students have learned to solve mathematical problems using bar modeling, they begin to solve mathematical problems with exclusively abstract tools: numbers and symbols.

[[File:whole-part model multiplication.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The whole-part model can also be used to solve a multiplication problem.]]

====Bar modeling====

Bar modeling is a pictorial method used to solve [[Word problem (mathematics education)|word problems]] in [[arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="Hoven and Garelick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Frank Schaffer Publications|chapter=Introduction to Singapore Math|title=70 Must-Know Word Problems, Grade 7 (Singapore Math) |  pages=3–8|publisher=Frank Schaffer Publications|edition=workbook|isbn=0-7682-4016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bar models can come in multiple forms such as a whole-part or a comparison model.

With the whole-part model, students would draw a rectangular bar to represent a "whole" larger quantity, which can be subdivided into two or more "parts." A student could be exposed to a word problem involving addition such as:

:''If John has 70 apples and Jane has 30 apples, how many apples do they both have?''

The solution to this problem could be solved by drawing one bar  and dividing it into two parts, with the longer part as 70 and the shorter part as 30. By visualizing these two parts, students would simply solve the above word problem by adding both parts together to build a whole bar of 100. Conversely, a student could use whole-part model to solve a subtraction problem such as 100 - 70, by having the longer part be 70 and the whole bar be 100. They would then solve the problem by inferring the shorter part to be 30.

[[File:Comparison model subtraction.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The bar model can be drawn as a comparison model to compare two bars of unequal lengths, which can then be used to solve a subtraction problem.]]

The whole-part model can also be used to solve problems involving multiplication or division.&lt;ref name=Jackson2&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Bill|title=Singapore math bar model strategy|url=http://www.thedailyriff.com/WordProblems.pdf|accessdate=December 16, 2013 |publisher=The Daily Riff}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multiplication problem could be presented as follows:

:''How much money would Jane have if she saved $30 each week for 4 weeks in a row?''

The student could solve this multiplication problem by drawing one bar to represent the unknown answer, and subdivide that bar into four equal parts, with each part representing $30.  Based on the drawn model, the student could then visualize this problem as providing a solution of $120.

Unlike the whole-part model, a comparison model involves comparing two bars of unequal lengths.&lt;ref name="Hoven and Garelick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank Shaffer" /&gt; It can be used to solve a subtraction problem such as the following:

:''John needs to walk 100 miles to reach his home. So far, he has walked 70 miles. How many miles does he have left to walk home?''

By using the comparison model, the student would draw one long bar to represent 100 and another shorter bar to represent 70. By comparing these two bars, students could then solve for the difference between the two numbers, which in this case is 30 miles. Like the whole-part model, the comparison model can also be used to solve word problems involving addition, multiplication, and division.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7991">In [[complex analysis]] the '''Stokes phenomenon''', discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Sir George Gabriel Stokes|first=G. G. |last=Stokes|year1=1847|year2=1858}}, is that the asymptotic behavior of functions can differ in different regions of the complex plane. These regions are bounded by  '''Stokes line''' or '''anti-Stokes lines'''.

==Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines==

Somewhat confusingly, mathematicians and physicists use the terms "Stokes line" and "anti-Stokes line" in opposite ways. The lines originally studied by Stokes are what some mathematicians call anti-Stokes lines and what physicists call Stokes lines. (These terms are also used in optics for the unrelated [[Stokes line]]s and [[anti-Stokes line]]s in [[Raman scattering]]). This article uses the physicist's convention, which is historically more accurate and seems to be becoming more common among mathematicians. {{harvtxt|Olver|1997}} recommends the term "principal curve" for (physicist's) anti-Stokes lines.

Informally the anti-Stokes lines are roughly where some term in the asymptotic expansion changes from increasing to decreasing (and therefore can exhibit a purely oscillatory behavior), and the Stokes lines are lines along which some term approaches infinity or zero fastest. Anti-Stokes lines bound regions where the function exhibit a particular asymptotic behavior. The Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines are not unique and do not really have a precise definition in general, because the region where a function has a given asymptotic behavior is a somewhat vague concept. However the lines do usually have well determined directions at essential singularities of the function, and there is sometimes a natural choice of these lines as follows.  The asymptotic expansion of a function is often given by a linear combination of functions of the form ''f''(''z'')e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;plusmn;''g''(''z'')&lt;/sup&gt; for functions ''f'' and ''g''. The Stokes lines can then be taken as the zeros of the imaginary part of ''g'', and the anti-Stokes lines as the zeros of the real part of ''g''. (This is not quite canonical, because one can add a constant to ''g'', changing the lines.) If the lines are defined like this then they are orthogonal where they meet, unless ''g'' has a multiple zero.

As a trivial example, the function sinh(''z'') has two regions Re(''z'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and Re(''z'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 where it is asymptotic to e&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;/2 and −e&lt;sup&gt;−''z''&lt;/sup&gt;/2. So the anti-Stokes line can be taken to be the imaginary axis, and the Stokes line can be taken to be the real axis. One could equally well take the Stokes line to be any line of given imaginary part; these choices differ only by a vertical shift, showing that there is no canonical choice for the Stokes line.

==Example: the Airy function==

The [[Airy function]] Ai(''x'') is one of two solutions to a simple differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;y'' - xy = 0 , \, &lt;/math&gt;

which it is often useful to approximate for many values of ''x'' &amp;ndash; including complex values. For large ''x'' of given argument the solution can be approximated by a linear combination of the functions
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e^{\pm\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}.&lt;/math&gt;
However the linear combination has to change as the argument of ''x'' passes certain values because these approximations are multi-valued functions but the Airy function is single valued.
For example, if we regard the limit of ''x'' as large and real, and would like to approximate the Airy function for both positive and negative values, we would find that

[[Image:Airy Functions.svg|right|thumb|Plot of Ai(''x'') in red and Bi(''x'') in blue]]
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mathrm{Ai}(x) &amp;{}\sim \frac{e^{-\frac23x^{3/2}}}{2\sqrt\pi\,x^{1/4}} \\
 \mathrm{Ai}(-x) &amp;{}\sim \frac{\sin(\frac23x^{3/2}+\frac14\pi)}{\sqrt\pi\,x^{1/4}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Root-system-A2-v1.png|thumb|left|Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines for the Airy function]]
which are two very different expressions.  What has happened is that as we have increased the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of ''x'' from 0 to pi (rotating it around through the upper half complex plane) we have crossed an anti-Stokes line, which in this case is at &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg}\, x = \pi / 3&lt;/math&gt;.  At this anti-Stokes line, the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\frac{e^{-\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt; is forced to jump. The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\frac{e^{+\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt; can jump at this line but is not forced to; it can change gradually as arg ''x'' varies from π/3 to π as it is not determined in this region.

There are three anti-Stokes lines with arguments π/3, π. –π/3, and three Stokes lines with arguments  2π/3, 0. –2π/3.

==Example: second order linear differential equations==

The Airy function example can be generalized to a broad class of second order linear differential equations as follows. By standard changes of variables, a second order equation can often be changed to one of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2w}{dz^2} = f(z)w&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is holomorphic in a simply-connected region and ''w'' is a solution of the differential equation. Then in some cases the [[WKB approximation|WKB method]] gives an asymptotic approximation for ''w'' as a linear combination of functions of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\exp{\pm\int_a^z\sqrt{f(z')} \, dz'}}{f(z)^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''a''. (Choosing different values of ''a'' is equivalent to choosing different coefficients in the linear combination.) The anti-Stokes lines and Stokes lines are then the zeros of the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^z\sqrt{f(z)} \, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''a'' is a simple zero of ''f'' then locally ''f'' looks like &lt;math&gt;f'(a)(z-a)&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions will locally behave like the Airy functions; they will have three Stokes lines and three anti-Stokes lines meeting at ''a''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">In [[model theory]]&amp;mdash;a branch of [[mathematical logic]]&amp;mdash;a '''minimal structure''' is an infinite [[structure (mathematical logic)|one-sorted structure]] such that every subset of its domain that is definable with parameters is either finite or [[cofinite]]. A '''strongly minimal theory''' is a [[complete theory]] all models of which are minimal. A '''strongly minimal structure''' is a structure whose theory is strongly minimal.

Thus a structure is minimal only if the parametrically definable subsets of its domain cannot be avoided, because they are already parametrically definable in the pure language of equality.
Strong minimality was one of the early notions in the new field of classification theory and stability theory that was opened up by [[Morley's categoricity theorem|Morley's theorem]] on totally categorical structures.

The nontrivial standard examples for strongly minimal theories are the one-sorted theories of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and the theories ACF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of algebraically closed fields. As the example ACF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; shows, the parametrically definable subsets of the square of the domain of a minimal structure can be relatively complicated ("curves").

More generally, a subset of a structure that is defined as the set of realizations of a formula φ(''x'') is called a '''minimal set''' if every parametrically definable subset of it is either finite or cofinite. It is called a '''strongly minimal set''' if this is true even in all [[elementary extension]]s.

A strongly minimal set, equipped with the [[closure operator]] given by algebraic closure in the model-theoretic sense, is an infinite matroid, or [[pregeometry (model theory)|pregeometry]]. A model of a strongly minimal theory is determined up to isomorphism by its dimension as a matroid. Totally categorical theories are controlled by a strongly minimal set; this fact explains (and is used in the proof of) Morley's theorem. [[Boris Zilber]] conjectured that the only pregeometries that can arise from strongly minimal sets are those that arise in vector spaces, projective spaces, or algebraically closed fields. This conjecture was refuted by [[Ehud Hrushovski]], who developed a method known as the "Hrushovski construction" to build new strongly minimal structures from finite structures.

In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, '''Sturm separation theorem''', named after [[Jacques Charles François Sturm]], describes the location of roots of solutions of  [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] [[order (differential equation)|second order]] [[linear differential equation]]s. Basically the theorem states that given two linear independent solutions of such an equation the zeros of the two solutions are alternating.

== Sturm separation theorem ==

Given a homogeneous second order linear differential equation and two continuous linear independent solutions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; successive roots of ''u''(''x''), then ''v''(''x'') has exactly one root in the open interval ]''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[. It is a special case of the [[Sturm-Picone comparison theorem]].

== Proof ==

Since &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent it follows that the [[Wronskian]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle W[u,v]&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy &lt;math&gt;W[u,v](x)\equiv W(x)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; where the differential equation is defined, say &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle I&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, suppose that &lt;math&gt;W(x)&lt;0\mbox{ }\forall\mbox{ }x\in I&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)v'(x)-u'(x)v(x)\neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;
So at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W(x_0)=-u'\left(x_0\right)v\left(x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and either &lt;math&gt;u'\left(x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\left(x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt; are both positive or both negative. Without loss of generality, suppose that they are both positive. Now, at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_1&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;W(x_1)=-u'\left(x_1\right)v\left(x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and since &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_1&lt;/math&gt; are successive zeros of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle u(x)&lt;/math&gt; it causes &lt;math&gt;u'\left(x_1\right)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, to keep &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle W(x)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; we must have &lt;math&gt;v\left(x_1\right)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. We see this by observing that if &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle u'(x)&gt;0\mbox{ }\forall\mbox{ }x\in \left(x_0,x_1\right]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle u(x)&lt;/math&gt; would be increasing (away from the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt;-axis), which would never lead to a zero at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_1&lt;/math&gt;. So for a zero to occur at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=x_1&lt;/math&gt; at most &lt;math&gt;u'\left(x_1\right)=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;u'\left(x_1\right)\leq 0&lt;/math&gt; and it turns out, by our result from the [[Wronskian]] that &lt;math&gt;u'\left(x_1\right)\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;). So somewhere in the interval &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; the sign of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v(x)&lt;/math&gt; changed. By the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]] there exists &lt;math&gt;x^*\in\left(x_0,x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v\left(x^*\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, there can be only one zero in &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt;, because otherwise v would have two zeros and there would be no zeros of u in between, and it was just proved that this is impossible.

During the attendance of 1967 socialist convention, Haider was among one of the founding members of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and committed himself as a vehement support of change left-oriented philosophy of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]].&lt;ref name="The News Internationale"/&gt; In the 1970s, he played a vital role in formulating the public policy concerning the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb projects]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating Grass : The Making of the Pakistan Atom Bomb.|year=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804776011|format=|chapter=§15:The Dawn of a Nuclear Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions, he provided his expertise on taking [[Moral responsibility|moral stance]] on [[nuclear weapon]]s initiatives at the diplomatic conventions.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press (SUP)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating Grass : The Making of the Pakistan Atom Bomb.|year=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804776011|format=|chapter=§4:Never Again}}&lt;/ref&gt; On nuclear weapons development, Haider stated that "there was a need to aggressively project the peaceful intent of Pakistan's [[Nuclear weapons and Pakistan|atomic bomb program]].&lt;ref name="Dawn news archives"&gt;{{cite news|title=KARACHI: Leaders condemn US sanctions on Kahuta|url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/91238/karachi-leaders-condemn-us-sanctions-on-kahuta|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=Dawn news archives|date=3 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haider disassociated himself with the politics but remain member of [[Pakistan Mathematical Society]] and shifted towards writing political dramas at the [[Pakistan Television]] (PTV) in 1979.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald" /&gt; The [[Pakistan Television|PTV]] on-aired various political dramas written by Haider until 1985 when he renewed his association with [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald" /&gt; In 1990–2000, he contributed in [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]-initiated industrial projects such as the establishment of Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC), [[Hub Dam]] and various other social programmes.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; In 2001, Haider returned to his literary activities after rejoining the [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]], and penned two political drama serials for the [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]] which went aired-on in 2003.&lt;ref name="PTV listings" /&gt; In 2004, he returned to politics in opposition to [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] over the issue of [[nuclear proliferation]]. He bitterly criticised the United States over the sanctions of [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] and one of the noted politician expressing the discontent against the US, along with [[Raza Rabbani]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Dawn 2004"/&gt; About the [[nuclear proliferation#Pakistan|nuclear proliferation]] case, Haider defended the case of [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] in the public and condemned the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (Pakistan)|Information minister]], [[Sheikh Rashid Ahmad|Rashid Ahmad]]'s statement of acquitting former Prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] in the [[nuclear proliferation#Pakistan|nuclear proliferation]] case.&lt;ref name="Dawn 2004"/&gt;

Ultimately, he called for a [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliamentary inquiry]] over on that issues, and questioned about the involvement of [[President of Pakistan|President]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]] in the proliferation case.&lt;ref name="Dawn 2004"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff reporter|title=PPP blasts minister's statement|url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/352055/ppp-blasts-minister-s-statement|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=Dawn 2004|date=25 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Haider was awarded [[PTV Awards]] for Best Playwright Serial award, which he received in a televised ceremony.&lt;ref name="Dawn, July 17, 2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Lifetime achievement award for Mehdi Hasan|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2006/07/17/local7.htm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=Dawn, 17 July 2006|date=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn news, entertainment"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alavi|first=Omair|title=The 13th PTV Awards: A time to introspect|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/images/archive/060723/images1.htm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=Dawn news, entertainment|date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Haider was awarded with [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]] for his services to nation's [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb projects]] and his public policy efforts, which was conferred to him by the [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Zardari]].&lt;ref name="Dawn news, From the Newspapers"&gt;{{cite news|last=From the Newspapers|title=Abida Parveen, Aleem Dar among winners Posthumous awards for Manto, Mehdi Hassan|url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/742068/abida-parveen-aleem-dar-among-winners-posthumous-awards-for-manto-mehdi-hassan|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=Dawn news, From the Newspapers|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he was appointed as the "media coordinator" for the provincial [[Government of Sindh|government]] of [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="The News Internationale"/&gt;
Pakistan Peoples Party leader and provincial secretary-general Taj Haider is likely to be elected unopposed to the Senate on the seat vacated by Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh. The Senate election is scheduled for 5 June and the last date to submit nominations is 22 May, According to provincial election commissioner, if no other candidate submits nomination forms then Taj Haider will be elected unopposed.

===Writing and philosophy===

Haider extensively writes on nuclear policy issues, left-wing ideas, literary and political philosophy. His recent writings have included the support of [[social democracy]] in the country and power of balance in each state institutions.&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haider|first=Taj|title=Setting the PPP record straight|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/495800/setting-the-ppp-record-straight/|accessdate=4 October 2013|newspaper=The Express Tribune, 2013|date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On literary and political circles, he has written critic articles against the [[military dictatorship]], specifically policies enforced by the conservative [[President of Pakistan|President]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haider|first=Taj|title=Black out revisited|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/424252/blacked-out-revisited-i-was-three/|accessdate=4 October 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune, 2010|date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6513">In [[mathematics]], the '''theta correspondence''' or '''Howe correspondence''' is a correspondence between [[automorphic form]]s associated to the two groups of a [[dual reductive pair]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Howe|year=1979|authorlink=Roger Evans Howe}} as a generalisation of the [[Shimura correspondence]]. It is a conjectural correspondence between certain representations on the [[metaplectic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Mp}(2n)&lt;/math&gt; and those on the [[special orthogonal group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. The case &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt; was constructed by [[Jean-Loup Waldspurger]] in {{harvtxt | Waldspurger | 1980 }} and {{harvtxt | Waldspurger | 1991 }}.

== Statement ==
===Setup===
Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a non-archimedean [[local field]] of characteristic not &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, with its quotient field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a quadratic extension over &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) be an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Hermitian space]] (respectively an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Hermitian space) over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. We assume further &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;H(W)&lt;/math&gt;) to be the [[isometry group]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;). There exists a [[Weil representation]] associated to a non-trivial additive character &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; for the pair &lt;math&gt;G(V) \times H(W)&lt;/math&gt;, which we write as &lt;math&gt;\rho(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; be an irreducible admissible representation of &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, we only consider the case &lt;math&gt;G(V) \times H(W) = \mathrm{SO}(n) \times \mathrm{SO}(m)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;U(n) \times U(m)&lt;/math&gt;. We can find a certain representation &lt;math&gt;\theta(\pi, \psi)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H(W)&lt;/math&gt;, which is in fact a certain quotient of the Weil representation &lt;math&gt;\rho(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Howe duality conjecture.===

(i) &lt;math&gt;\theta(\pi,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible or &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;;

(ii) Let &lt;math&gt;\pi, \pi'&lt;/math&gt; be two irreducible [[admissible representation]]s of &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\theta(\pi, \psi) = \theta(\pi', \psi') \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\pi = \pi'&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, we have used the notations of {{harvtxt | Gan | Takeda | 2014 }}. The Howe conjecture in this setting was proved by J. L. Waldspurger in {{harvtxt | Waldspurger | 1990 }}. W. T. Gan and S. Takeda gave an alternative simpler proof in {{harvtxt | Gan | Takeda | 2014 }}.

'''Definition'''. (local theta correspondence). Let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Irr}(G(V))&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Irr}(H(W))&lt;/math&gt;) be the set of all irreducible admissible representations of &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;H(W)&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; be the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Irr}(G(V)) \rightarrow \mathrm{Irr}(H(W))&lt;/math&gt;, which associates every irreducible admissible representation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt; the irreducible admissible representation &lt;math&gt;\theta(\pi, \psi)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H(W)&lt;/math&gt;. We call &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; the local theta correspondence for the pair &lt;math&gt;G(V) \times H(W)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Comment'''. Here we can only define the theta correspondence locally, basically because the [[Weil representation]] used in our construction is only defined locally. The global theta lift can be defined on the [[cuspidal representation|cuspidal automorphic representations]] of &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt; as well, see {{harvtxt|Waldspurger|1991}}.

== Etymology ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; be the theta correspondence between &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Mp}(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;SO(3)&lt;/math&gt;. According to {{harvtxt | Waldspurger | 1986}}, one can associate to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; a function &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, which can be proved to be a [[modular function]] of half integer weight, that is to say, &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[theta function]].

'''Tikhonov regularization''', named for [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov|Andrey Tikhonov]], is the most commonly used method of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of [[ill-posed problem]]s.  In [[statistics]], the method is known as '''ridge regression''', in [[machine learning]] it is known as '''weight decay''', and with multiple independent discoveries, it is also variously known as the '''Tikhonov–Miller method''', the '''Phillips–Twomey method''', the '''constrained linear inversion''' method, and the method of '''linear regularization'''. It is related to the [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm]] for [[non-linear least squares|non-linear least-squares]] problems.

Suppose that for a known matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, we wish to find a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; such that
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
The standard approach is [[ordinary least squares]] linear regression. However, if no &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation or more than one &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; does—that is, the solution is not unique—the problem is said to be [[Well-posed problem|ill posed]]. In such cases, ordinary least squares estimation leads to an [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] ([[over-fitted]]), or more often an [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] ([[under-fitted]]) system of equations.  Most real-world phenomena have the effect of [[low-pass filters]] in the forward direction where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, in solving the inverse-problem, the inverse mapping operates as a [[high-pass filter]] that has the undesirable tendency of amplifying noise ([[eigenvalues]] / singular values are largest in the reverse mapping where they were smallest in the forward mapping).  In addition, ordinary least squares implicitly nullifies every element of the reconstructed version of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; that is in the null-space of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, rather than allowing for a model to be used as a prior for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Ordinary least squares seeks to minimize the sum of squared [[Residual (numerical analysis)|residuals]], which can be compactly written as
: &lt;math&gt;\|A\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_2^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|Euclidean norm]].

In order to give preference to a particular solution with desirable properties, a regularization term can be included in this minimization:
: &lt;math&gt;\|A\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_2^2 + \|\Gamma \mathbf{x}\|_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
for some suitably chosen '''Tikhonov matrix''' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma &lt;/math&gt;. In many cases, this matrix is chosen as a multiple of the [[identity matrix]] (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \alpha I&lt;/math&gt;), giving preference to solutions with smaller [[Norm (mathematics)|norms]]; this is known as '''{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} regularization'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Andrew Y. |last=Ng |authorlink=Andrew Ng |year=2004 |title=Feature selection, L1 vs. L2 regularization, and rotational invariance |conference=Proc. [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] |url=https://icml.cc/Conferences/2004/proceedings/papers/354.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, high-pass operators (e.g., a [[difference operator]] or a weighted [[discrete fourier transform|Fourier operator]]) may be used to enforce smoothness if the underlying vector is believed to be mostly continuous.
This regularization improves the conditioning of the problem, thus enabling a direct numerical solution. An explicit solution, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = (A^\top A + \Gamma^\top \Gamma)^{-1} A^\top \mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
The effect of regularization may be varied by the scale of matrix &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt; this reduces to the unregularized least-squares solution, provided that (A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;A)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; exists.

{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} regularization is used in many contexts aside from linear regression, such as [[Statistical classification|classification]] with [[logistic regression]] or [[support vector machine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R.-E.

==History==
Tikhonov regularization has been invented independently in many different contexts.
It became widely known from its application to integral equations from the work of

==Generalized Tikhonov regularization==
For general multivariate normal distributions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the data error, one can apply a transformation of the variables to reduce to the case above. Equivalently, one can seek an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to minimize

:&lt;math&gt;\|Ax - b\|_P^2 + \|x - x_0\|_Q^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_Q^2&lt;/math&gt; to stand for the weighted norm &lt;math&gt;x^\top Q x&lt;/math&gt; (compare with the [[Mahalanobis distance]]). In the Bayesian interpretation &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse [[covariance matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse covariance matrix of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The Tikhonov matrix is then given as a factorization of the matrix &lt;math&gt;Q = \Gamma^\top \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. the [[Cholesky factorization]]) and is considered a [[Whitening transformation|whitening filter]].

This generalized problem has an optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; which can be solved explicitly using the formula

: &lt;math&gt;x^* = (A^\top PA + Q)^{-1} (A^\top Pb + Qx_0),&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

: &lt;math&gt;x^* = x_0 + (A^\top PA + Q)^{-1} (A^\top P(b - Ax_0)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Regularization in Hilbert space==
Typically discrete linear ill-conditioned problems result from discretization of [[integral equation]]s, and one can formulate a Tikhonov regularization in the original infinite-dimensional context. In the above we can interpret &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as a [[compact operator]] on [[Hilbert space]]s, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as elements in the domain and range of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt;A^* A + \Gamma^\top \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; is then a [[Hermitian adjoint|self-adjoint]] bounded invertible operator.

==Relation to singular-value decomposition and Wiener filter==
With &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \alpha I&lt;/math&gt;, this least-squares solution can be analyzed in a special way using the [[singular-value decomposition]]. Given the singular value decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;A = U \Sigma V^\top&lt;/math&gt;

with singular values &lt;math&gt;\sigma _i&lt;/math&gt;, the Tikhonov regularized solution can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = V D U^\top b,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; has diagonal values

:&lt;math&gt;D_{ii} = \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_i^2 + \alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and is zero elsewhere. This demonstrates the effect of the Tikhonov parameter on the [[condition number]] of the regularized problem. For the generalized case, a similar representation can be derived using a [[generalized singular-value decomposition]]. &lt;ref name="Hansen_SIAM_1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Per Christian |title=Rank-Deficient and Discrete Ill-Posed Problems: Numerical Aspects of Linear Inversion |date=Jan 1, 1998 |publisher=SIAM |location=Philadelphia, USA |isbn=9780898714036 |edition=1st |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it is related to the [[Wiener filter]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = \sum _{i=1}^q f_i \frac{u_i^\top b}{\sigma_i} v_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where the Wiener weights are &lt;math&gt;f_i = \frac{\sigma _i^2}{\sigma_i^2 + \alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

==Determination of the Tikhonov factor==
The optimal regularization parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is usually unknown and often in practical problems is determined by an ''ad hoc'' method. A possible approach relies on the Bayesian interpretation described below. Other approaches include the [[discrepancy principle]], [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]], [[L-curve method]], [[restricted maximum likelihood]] and [[unbiased predictive risk estimator]]. [[Grace Wahba]] proved that the optimal parameter, in the sense of [[cross-validation (statistics)#Leave-one-out cross-validation|leave-one-out cross-validation]] minimizes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wahba |first=G. |year=1990 |title=Spline Models for Observational Data |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last3=Wahba |first3=G. |first=G. |last=Golub |first2=M. |last2=Heath |year=1979 |title=Generalized cross-validation as a method for choosing a good ridge parameter |journal=Technometrics |volume=21 |pages=215–223 |url=http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~wahba/ftp1/oldie/golub.heath.wahba.pdf |doi=10.1080/00401706.1979.10489751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{\operatorname{RSS}}{\tau^2} = \frac{\|X \hat{\beta} - y\|^2}{[\operatorname{Tr}(I - X(X^T X + \alpha^2 I)^{-1} X^T)]^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{RSS}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[residual sum of squares]], and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective number of degrees of freedom]].

Using the previous SVD decomposition, we can simplify the above expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{RSS} = \left\| y - \sum_{i=1}^q (u_i' b) u_i \right\|^2 + \left\| \sum _{i=1}^q \frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_i^2 + \alpha^2} (u_i' b) u_i \right\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{RSS} = \operatorname{RSS}_0 + \left\| \sum_{i=1}^q \frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_i^2 + \alpha^2} (u_i' b) u_i \right\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = m - \sum_{i=1}^q \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\sigma_i^2 + \alpha^2}
= m - q + \sum_{i=1}^q \frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma _i^2 + \alpha^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to probabilistic formulation==
The probabilistic formulation of an [[inverse problem]] introduces (when all uncertainties are Gaussian) a covariance matrix &lt;math&gt; C_M&lt;/math&gt; representing the ''a priori'' uncertainties on the model parameters, and a covariance matrix &lt;math&gt; C_D&lt;/math&gt; representing the uncertainties on the observed parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tarantola |first1=Albert |title=Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation |date=2005 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0898717922 |edition=1st |url=http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/SIAM/index.html |accessdate=9 August 2018 |ref=ATarantolaSIAM2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the special case when these two matrices are diagonal and isotropic, &lt;math&gt; C_M = \sigma_M^2 I &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; C_D = \sigma_D^2 I &lt;/math&gt;, and, in this case, the equations of inverse theory reduce to the equations above, with &lt;math&gt; \alpha = {\sigma_D}/{\sigma_M} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Bayesian interpretation==
{{further|Minimum mean square error#Linear MMSE estimator for linear observation process}}
Although at first the choice of the solution to this regularized problem may look artificial, and indeed the matrix &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; seems rather arbitrary, the process can be justified from a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian point of view]]. Note that for an ill-posed problem one must necessarily introduce some additional assumptions in order to get a unique solution. Statistically, the [[prior probability]] distribution of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes taken to be a [[multivariate normal distribution]]. For simplicity here, the following assumptions are made: the means are zero; their components are independent; the components have the same [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma _x&lt;/math&gt;. The data are also subject to errors, and the errors in &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are also assumed to be [[statistical independence|independent]] with zero mean and standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma _b&lt;/math&gt;. Under these assumptions the Tikhonov-regularized solution is the [[maximum a posteriori|most probable]] solution given the data and the ''a priori'' distribution of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, according to [[Bayes' theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vogel, Curtis R. |title=Computational methods for inverse problems |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-89871-550-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the assumption of [[normal distribution|normality]] is replaced by assumptions of [[homoscedasticity]] and uncorrelatedness of [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]], and if one still assumes zero mean, then the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]] entails that the solution is the minimal [[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimator]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amemiya |first=Takeshi |authorlink=Takeshi Amemiya |year=1985 |title=Advanced Econometrics |location= |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=60–61 |isbn=0-674-00560-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
