{{distinguish|100K Pathogen Genome Project}}
The '''100,000 Genomes Project''' is a [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] project that is [[sequencing]] whole [[genome]]s from [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] patients. The project is focusing on [[rare diseases]], some common types of [[cancer]], and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeremy Hunt launches genomics body to oversee healthcare revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/05/health-jeremy-hunt|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeremy Hunt launches genomics body to oversee healthcare revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/05/health-jeremy-hunt|publisher= The Guardian |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunt13&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA mapping to better understand cancer, rare diseases and infectious diseases |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dna-mapping-to-better-understand-cancer-rare-diseases-and-infectious-diseases |publisher= UK Government |date= 2013-07-05 |accessdate=2016-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants give consent for their genome data to be linked to information about their medical condition and health records.

==History==
The project was first announced by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DNA tests to revolutionise fight against cancer and help 100,000 NHS patients. |url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dna-tests-to-revolutionise-fight-against-cancer-and-help-100000-nhs-patients | publisher= UK Government |date = 2012-12-10|accessdate = 2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government set up a new company [[Genomics England]] to oversee the project&lt;ref name="Hunt13" /&gt; with the plan to focus on rare diseases, cancer and infectious diseases announced by [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] [[Jeremy Hunt]] in July 2013. The project was also made possible by the [[National Institute for Health Research]], [[NHS England]], [[Public Health England]] and [[Health Education England]].  In 2015 [[Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland joins the 100,000 Genomes Project|url=https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/northern-ireland-joins-the-100000-genomes-project/|website=Genomics England|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scotland]]&lt;ref name="Scottish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish investment in genomic medicine|url=https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/scottish-investment-in-genomic-medicine/|website=Genomics England|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; also joined the project with plans to start work the following year. In 2016, [[Wales|the Welsh government]] issued a statement of intent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Written Statement -Statement of Intent for Genomics and Precision Medicine|url=http://gov.wales/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/previous-administration/2016/genomics/?lang=en|website=The Welsh Government|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considering participating in the 100,000 Genomes Project.&lt;ref name="Scottish" /&gt;

The initial participants were recruited from [[Cambridge University Hospitals]], [[University College London Partners]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust]]. The following medical centres joined the project a short time later: [[Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust]], [[Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]] and [[Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust]].

In September 2015, Genomics England announced it had contracted with interpretation partners Congenica and Omicia. This is in addition to ongoing work with sequencing partner Illumina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/genomics-england-announces-interpretation-partners-and-expands-industry-engagement/|title=Genomics England announces interpretation partners and expands industry engagement {{!}} Genomics England|date=2015-09-30|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1st October 2018, the 100,000 Genomes Project had completed the sequencing of 87,231 whole genomes in England&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/the-100000-genomes-project-by-numbers/|title=The 100,000 Genomes Project by numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Genomics England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and results are in the process of being returned to NHS GMCs and ultimately back to participants; the first diagnoses from the Project were returned to patients in spring 2015 and over 2,000 families' results have been returned to the NHS in the rare disease programme to date (July 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-35282764 First children diagnosed in DNA project] by James Gallagher published by [[BBC]] News on January 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHS Genomic Medicine Centres==
Following the pilot studies, NHS England ran a tender to appoint NHS Genomic Medicine Centres with responsibility for recruiting suitable patients, gaining their consent to participate in the project and taking samples for [[whole genome sequencing]] by [[Illumina (company)]]. The successful bidders designated as NHS Genomic Medicine Centres are:
    
* East of England NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* South London NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust]]
* North West Coast NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust]]
* Greater Manchester NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* University College London Partners NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust]]
* North East and North Cumbria NHS GMC – designated GMC for rare disease only. Led by The [[Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]

* Imperial College Health Partners NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. Led by [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]]
* West Midlands NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease.  Led by [[University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust]]

In December 2015, two new NHS Genomic Medicine Centres were announced by [[NHS England]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NHS England » New NHS centres add their might to world-leading genomics project|url = https://www.england.nhs.uk/2015/12/16/genomic-medicine-centres/|website = www.england.nhs.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Yorkshire and Humber NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. 
* West of England NHS GMC – designated for both cancer and rare disease. 
There are now 13 designated NHS Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs) across the country.

In 2017, Northern Ireland and Scotland began recruiting participants for the project and Wales aims to begin in 2017–18.

==Research==
The Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP) includes 2,500 UK and international clinicians and scientists from approximately 300 institutions in 24 countries. There are plans to increase this number.
Researchers are organised in "domains" formed around particular conditions, cancer types and research areas such as Machine Learning and Health Economics. The partnership is integrated with the NHS and the aims include improving the use of genotype and phenotype data in healthcare, and providing a platform for genomic research collaborations to add to the knowledge base for genetic disorders.

==Industrial partnerships==
From 2015 to 2017, 13 companies joined to form a pre-competitive industry trial, named the Genomics Expert Network for Enterprises (GENE) Consortium. This trial aimed to bring industry expertise into the 100,000 Genomes Project to identify potential benefits for patients, as the private sector is involved in developing new medicines and diagnostics for the NHS.

'''Proposition 22'''  was a law enacted by [[California]] voters in March 2000 to prevent marriage between same-sex couples. In May 2008, it was struck down by the [[California Supreme Court]] as contrary to the state constitution.

The Act was proposed by means of the [[initiative]] process. It was authored by state Senator [[William J. Knight|William "Pete" Knight]] and is known informally as the '''Knight initiative'''. Voters adopted the measure on March 7, 2000, with 61% in favor to 39% against.&lt;ref&gt;4,618,673 votes versus 2,909,370 against www.census.gov/census2000/states/ca.html. [http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/returns/prop/00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of victory surprised many, since a Field Poll immediately prior to the election estimated support at 53%, with 40% against and 7% undecided.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10497209&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act added Section 308.5 of the Family Code, which read "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California". Because the Act was an ordinary statute, it could be struck down if it were inconsistent with the state constitution, as happened on May 15, 2008, when the state supreme court, ruling in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', declared that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2008-05/38894545.PDF California Supreme Court. ''re Marriage Cases'' (2008) 43 Cal.4th 757 (76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 183 P.3d 384)]&lt;/ref&gt; This 4–3 decision invalidated Proposition 22 and some related California laws.

Proposition 22 provoked debate long after its passage. In November 2008 California voters overturned the ''In re Marriage Cases'' decision by approving an amendment of the state constitution called [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]]. In June 2010, Proposition 8 was declared unconstitutional by U.S district judge [[Vaughn Walker]] based on the [[Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection]] clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A. Now | date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' ruled that the Intervenor-Defendants had no [[Article III]] standing to appeal Walker's ruling, keeping Proposition 8 unenforceable throughout California and enabling same-sex marriage to resume just two days after the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/proposition-8-gay-marriage_n_3519340.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Gay Marriages To Resume In California As Prop 8 Hold Lifted By Appeals Court | date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory framework==
Prior to 1977, marriage was defined in Section 4100 of the [[California Civil Code]]. This stated that marriage is "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which consent of the parties making that contract is necessary".&lt;ref&gt;''Calif. Civil Code section 4100 prior to 1977:'' '''Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, s. 8,  p. 3314'''; ''amended to incorporate explicit gender requirement:'' '''Calif. Stats. 1977, ch. 339, s. 1, p. 1295'''; ''recodified at Calif. Family Code section 300 without substantive change:'' '''Calif. Stats. 1992, ch.162 s. 10, p. 474'''&lt;/ref&gt; While related sections of the law made references to sex, a State Assembly committee that was debating adding sex-specific terms to this section in 1977 noted: "Under existing law it is not clear whether partners of the same sex can get married".&lt;ref&gt;California Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, Bill Digest for A.B. 607 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the legislature amended the legal definition of marriage to remove any ambiguity. In 1992 the legal definition of marriage was moved from the Civil Code to Section 300 of the Family Code.

When Proposition 22 came before voters, marriage was defined in the Family Code as "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract ''between a man and a woman,'' to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary" [''italics'' added].&lt;ref&gt;California Family Code, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=300-310 Section 300] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630150250/http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=300-310 |date=2016-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the definition governing who may marry explicitly precluded contracting a same-sex marriage in California, a separate provision, Section 308, governed recognition of marriages contracted elsewhere. This stated that a "marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state".&lt;ref&gt;California Family Code, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=300-310 Section 308] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630150250/http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=300-310 |date=2016-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of Proposition 22 described Section 308 as a "loophole", apparently forcing California to recognize a same-sex marriage validly contracted in some other state.&lt;ref&gt;2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide, [http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22norbt.htm Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this, Proposition 22 did not reword the existing provisions of the Family Code, but added to them the declaration that "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California".&lt;ref&gt;2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide,  [http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22text.htm Text of Proposition 22]&lt;/ref&gt; The official citation of Proposition 22, the "California Defense of Marriage Act", is almost the same as that of a federal law, the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], which was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1996. This federal law had a similar purpose, and was intended to prevent any state from being obligated to recognize a same-sex marriage contracted in another state.

==Disputes over its effect==
Central to many subsequent disputes over Prop 22's effect is a distinction between statutes enacted by the legislature and initiative statutes enacted directly by the electorate.  The legislature is free to amend or rescind its own enactments, but voters must approve any attempt by the legislature to amend or repeal an initiative statute unless the initiative itself states otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;California Constitution, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2 Article II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008203818/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2 |date=2010-10-08 }}, Section 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over domestic partnerships===
{{see also|Domestic partnership in California}}
In 1999, California enacted the first in a series of [[domestic partnership]] provisions. California courts have entertained several challenges to legislative expansions of the domestic partnership scheme enacted after Prop 22. Generally, these challenges alleged that the legislature inappropriately amended Prop 22 by making California's domestic partnership scheme too similar to marriage, or more broadly, that Prop 22 made 'any' subsequent recognition of same-sex partnerships beyond the legislature's inherent power. [[California Courts of Appeal]] rejected those claims, noting that domestic partnerships already existed as a legal institution separate from marriage at the time Prop 22 was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight v. Superior Court'' (2005) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/c048378.pdf 128 Cal.App.4th 18]; ''Armijo v. Miles'' (2005) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/b166050.pdf 127 Cal.App.4th 1405]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over marriage licensing within California===
{{main|Same-sex marriage in California}}
In September 2005, the [[California legislature]] passed a bill, A.B. 849, eliminating the gender requirements for marriage now found in Family Code section 300. Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] [[veto]]ed the bill.  In his veto message,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.ca.gov/state/govsite/gov_htmldisplay.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1290673326.1168180466@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccceaddjkmlgggkcfngcfkmdffidfng.0&amp;iOID=71793&amp;sTitle=Statement+by+Gubernatorial+Press+Secretary+Margita+Thompson+on+AB+849+++&amp;sFilePath=/govsite/press_release/2005_09/20050907_GAAS41205_AB_849_Veto_Statement.html&amp;sCatTitle=Press+Release Statement by Gubernatorial Press Secretary Margita Thompson] on AB 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger argued that passing a law that would implicitly repeal Section 308.5 required the assent of the electorate (and separately made note of pending court challenges).&lt;ref&gt;Legislative history of [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_849&amp;sess=0506&amp;house=B&amp;author=leno A.B. 849 (2005)], Legislative Counsel of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ruling on the disputes between Prop 22 and the domestic partnership enactments, [[California Courts of Appeal]] have reached differing conclusions as to Prop 22's scope within the marriage statutes.

In ''Armijo v. Miles,'' the Second Appellate District distinguished Prop 22 from the case at bar by noting, in part, that the initiative prevented the recognition of same-sex marriages conducted ''outside'' California:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The legislative analysis and the ballot arguments readily demonstrate that Proposition 22 was crafted with a prophylactic purpose in mind.  It was designed to prevent same-sex couples who could marry validly in other countries or who in the future could marry validly in other states from coming to California and claiming, in reliance on Family Code section 308, that their marriages must be recognized as valid marriages.  With the passage of Proposition 22, then, only opposite-sex marriages validly contracted outside this state will be recognized as valid in California.&lt;ref&gt;''Armijo v. Miles'' (2005) 127 Cal. App.4th 1405, 1424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Armijo'' court may not have ruled that the historical purpose of Prop 22 limited its scope to out of state marriages. The court appears to have ultimately presumed that Proposition 22 did indeed apply to in-state arrangements deemed to be "marriages," but held that the challenged wrongful death statute did not violate that prohibition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question remaining is whether the portion of AB 2580 that amends the wrongful death statute subverts Proposition 22.  Defendants' position that it does is based on the faulty premise that the right to sue for wrongful death is an exclusive benefit of marriage.  It is not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Less than a week later, on April 4, 2005, the Third Appellate District ruled more explicitly, in ''Knight v. Superior Court,'' that Prop 22 also included within the initiative's ambit marriages licensed ''within'' the state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The plain language of Proposition 22 and its initiative statute, section 308.5, reaffirms the definition of marriage in section 300, by stating that only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid and recognized in California. This limitation ensures that California will not legitimize or recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, as it otherwise would be required to do pursuant to section 308, and that California will not permit same-sex partners to validly marry within the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight v. Superior Court (Schwarzenegger)'' (2005) 128 Cal. App.4th 14, 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with ''Armijo,'' the ''Knight'' court upheld the challenged statute on the grounds that it did not constitute a "marriage" for purposes of Prop 22 or Section 300.  The cases differed, however, in that ''Armijo'' appeared to rely on a narrow observation that a particular benefit was not exclusive to marriage, while ''Knight'' upheld a broad domestic partnership statute against challenges it left almost no substantive difference between the two institutions.  Parties in subsequent cases, including the same-sex marriage cases, have noted the apparent split between the appellate courts with respect to its scope.

As the ultimate rulings in these cases arguably did not require a finding that Prop 22 applies to in-state marriages (both were upheld against a challenge that they constituted marriage under Prop 22, the same result that would have obtained if they had ruled Prop 22 did not apply to in-state marriages), some argue that these findings are [[dicta]].&lt;ref&gt;Liebert, Mark. "[http://www.assembly.ca.gov/acs/committee/c15/publications/SelectedBillAnalyses/AB%2019%20(Leno)%20Gender%20neutral%20marriage.htm AB 19 Bill Analysis]." California Assembly Committee on the Judiciary. 21 Apr 2005; also, Dolan, Maura. "[http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/press/CourtsLikelyToHaveFinalSayOnGayMarriageBill.html Courts Likely to Have Final Say on Gay-Marriage Bill]." ''Los Angeles Times'', 7 Sep 2005; and, Kroll, Panda. "[http://www.vcba.org/citationsmag/2005/05oct.pdf California's Same-sex Yo-Yo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005053645/http://www.vcba.org/citationsmag/2005/05oct.pdf# |date=2006-10-05 }}." ''Citations'' (Ventura County Bar Association), Oct 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the flip side, an argument can be made that these holdings are ''not'' dicta, as both courts ruled on the merits of whether or not a challenged in-state arrangement constituted a "marriage" for purposes of Prop 22, an allegation that would be moot if either court believed Prop 22 permitted in-state marriages.

In 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] resolved the controversy in ruling on the constitutionality of statutes limiting marriage to a man and a woman: "this provision reasonably must be interpreted to apply both to marriages performed in California and those performed in other jurisdictions."&lt;ref name="scoca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF |format=PDF|title=Opinion ''In re Marriage Cases'' |date=2008-05-15 |publisher=Supreme Court of California| accessdate=2008-06-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603070921/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invalidation==

Separately, numerous challenges to the constitutionality of the opposite-sex requirements found in California's marriage statutes, including Prop 22, came before the courts. A [[San Francisco]] trial court threw out all of the gender requirements on state constitutional grounds. On appeal, an intermediate court reversed that decision. In December 2006, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral argument on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&amp;doc_id=447693&amp;doc_no=S147999|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|author=|date=|website=appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court ruled on May 15, 2008, that Proposition 22 violated the state Constitution and was therefore invalid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/BAGAVNC5K.DTL (San Francisco Chronicle)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] immediately issued a statement pledging to uphold the ruling, and repeated his pledge to oppose [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]], a constitutional amendment initiative that would override the Court's ruling and again ban same sex marriages by placing the text of Proposition 22 in the [[California Constitution|State Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/05/15/state/n113018D48.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Schwarzenegger says he respects court's marriage ruling|date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519201115/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F05%2F15%2Fstate%2Fn113018D48.DTL|archivedate=2008-05-19|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2001 Jos riots''' were [[riot]]s involving [[Religion in Nigeria#Christianity|Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslim]]s in [[Jos]], [[Nigeria]], over the appointment of a Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/octoberweb-only/10-1-23.0.html|title=Religious Riots in Nigeria Leave Hundreds Dead|publisher=''[[Christianity Today]]''|date=1 October 2001|author=Obed Minchakpu|accessdate=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clashes started on 7 September and lasted nearly two weeks, ending on 17 September. Some 1,000 people were killed during the riots.&lt;ref name=cnnworld&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/11/29/nigeria.riots.ap/index.html?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail|title=300 bodies taken to mosque on 2nd day of Nigeria riots|publisher=CNN|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=30 November 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Human Rights Watch|title="Leave Everything to God": Accountability for Inter-Communal Violence in Plateau and Kaduna States, Nigeria|date=December 12, 2013|pages=42-43|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/12/12/leave-everything-god-0|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
Religious and ethnic conflicts have repeatedly occurred in Jos due to the city's geographical placement in Nigeria. Jos, the capital of [[Plateau State]], is located in the middle of the country, which lies between the predominantly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south. Jos was also known for its job opportunities leading people from around Nigeria to move there for employment. The influx of people led to tensions between members of "indigene" (indigenous) ethnic groups and non-indigene ethnic groups (often referred to as "settlers").&lt;ref name=Geneva&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krause|first1=Jana|title=A Deadly Cycle: Ethno-Religious Conflict in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria|date=2011|publisher=Geneva Declaration|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=“They Do Not Own This Place”: Government Discrimination Against “Non-Indigenes” in Nigeria|date=April 2006|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/nigeria0406webwcover.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001 the federal government appointed a Hausa Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program, leading indigene Christians to protest his appointment. Tensions turned violent on 7 September 2001, when a Christian woman attempted to cross a barricaded street outside a mosque during Friday prayers. It led to a conflict between her and a group of Muslims. The fight eventually spread to other parts of the city.&lt;ref name=ct /&gt;&lt;ref name=HRW2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=Jos: A City Torn Apart|date=December 2001|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/nigeria1201_1.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
Fighting spread through various Jos neighborhoods and to surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=HRW2001 /&gt; Property and even human beings were set on fire. Many houses, shops, mosques and churches were burned or damaged. Torched cars were left along the streets after the clashes.  Christian leaders reported that Muslims spontaneously attacked Christians and burned churches, including three churches of the [[Church of Christ in Nigeria]] (COCIN), the main [[Assemblies of God]] church, and a Jos Apostolic Church.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The military was eventually deployed and stopped the violence.&lt;ref name=HRW2001 /&gt; Local sources{{Who|date=December 2009}} said the military's intervention and strict enforcement of the curfew helped end the clashes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Aftermath==
The 10 days of violence left approximately 1,000 dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/nigeria-christan-and-muslim-conflict Nigeria Christian and Muslim conflict timeline | Timetoast timelines]. Timetoast.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the large number of people killed in the clashes, a mass burial had to be arranged.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The riots caused the displacement of at least 50,000 civilians.&lt;ref name=HRW2001 /&gt; The authorities arrested several hundred people and set up a commission of inquiry, which identified people who were allegedly involved in the violence, but no one was successfully prosecuted.&lt;ref name=hrw2013 /&gt;

The '''40th government of Turkey''' (21 June 1977 – 21 July 1977) was a short term (one month) government that governed [[Turkey]] in 1977. It was a minority government of [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party (CHP)]] led by [[Bülent Ecevit]].

==The elections==
In [[Turkish general election, 1977|the elections held on 5 June 1977]], CHP received 41% (highest percentage CHP ever reached after 1950) of the vote and became the first party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.belgenet.net/ayrinti.php?yil_id=8 |title=Election results |access-date=2013-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807213412/http://belgenet.net/ayrinti.php?yil_id=8 |archive-date=2013-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the parliament, CHP gained only 213 seats out of 450. Other parties were reluctant to form a coalition with CHP. However, Ecevit, confident of his prestige, tried a minority government.

The [[Federal government of the United States]] requires [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that receive federal anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] or anti-[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] funds to adopt an organization-wide policy opposing [[prostitution]] and [[Sex trafficking|sex-trafficking]]. This requirement, known as the '''anti-prostitution pledge''', has been in place since 2003.

The policy has been criticized as counterproductive, as it hampers enlisting those involved in the sex industry in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-says-law-cant-dictate-anti-aids-groups-speech/2013/06/20/1cf84846-d9bc-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_story.html|title=Supreme Court says law can't dictate anti-AIDS groups' speech|date=20 June 2013|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the requirement was only applied to foreign-based NGOs, but in 2005 the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began applying it to U.S.-based organizations as well, resulting in legal challenges on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. These challenges were ultimately successful before the Supreme Court, with the 2013 decision in the case ''[[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International]]''. The requirement remains in effect for foreign-based NGOs that receive U.S. funds.

==Legislation and implementation==
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced the five-year $15 billion [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] in January 2003; [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed it in May 2003 under the name "United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS, [[Tuberculosis]], and [[Malaria]] Act (Global AIDS Act)". The act identifies prostitution and sex trafficking as contributing to the spread of HIV and explicitly advances a new U.S. policy goal: the eradication of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The act states:
* "No funds ... may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds ... may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

In December 2003 Congress passed the [[Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act]] which provided for funding of anti-trafficking activities, subject to the following restrictions.
* "No funds ... may be used to promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution."
* "No funds ... may be used to implement any program ... through any organization that has not stated in either a grant application, a grant agreement, or both, that it does not promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216135913/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/61130.htm Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003], 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7110 (2003). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge language in both acts was authored by Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004]] amended the AIDS Authorization to exempt the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] and any [[United Nations]] agency from having to sign the anti-prostitution pledge.&lt;ref name=aa/&gt;

While the language of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had expressed First Amendment concerns.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/17/AR2005051701247.html U.S. Backs Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf Letter from Justice Department to Judiciary Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808195530/http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf |date=8 August 2009 }}, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General [[Daniel Levin (attorney)|Daniel Levin]] reversed this opinion,&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf Implementation of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 – Eligibility Limitation on the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex Trafficking.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910012240/http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, (9 June 2005). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A document issued by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in May 2005 sought to extend the pledge requirement to the large group of organizations that receive funding through the multilateral [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (to which the U.S. contributes). This was quickly overturned by US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Rationale and reactions==
In a February 2002 [[presidential directive|National Security Presidential Directive]], President George W. Bush wrote: "The United States opposes prostitution and any related activities, including pimping, pandering, and/or maintaining brothels as contributing to the phenomenon
of trafficking in persons. These activities are inherently harmful and dehumanizing. The United States Government's position is that these activities should not be regulated as a legitimate form of work for any human being."&lt;ref&gt;NSPD-22, 25 February 2002. Quoted in [http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf An Administration Priority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021095527/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf |date=21 October 2008 }}, U.S. Dept. of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a group of non-profit organizations including [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Save the Children]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy in a letter to US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge "makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these hard-to-reach groups" and it will "exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/20050518LTR.pdf Letter to President Bush], 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This was countered in August 2005 by a letter to the President supporting the policy, signed by over 100 groups, including the [[Christian Medical and Dental Associations|Christian Medical Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association of Evangelicals]], [[Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]], [[Sex Industry Survivors]], [[The Medical Institute]], [[The Salvation Army]], [[World Hope International]] and [[World Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28834.php|title=Over 100 Groups Urge Bush to Enforce Anti-Prostitution Policy to Aid Sexually Exploited Women and Children|work=Medical News TODAY|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the pledge requirement argued that prostitution is inherently harmful and needs to be abolished, rejected [[harm reduction]] approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/595392355.html|title=Christian Medical Association Lauds Anti-Prostitution Pledge Ruling|work=Christian News Wire|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held that legalized prostitution increases demand for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

In May 2005, the [[Brazil]]ian government turned down $40 million in anti-HIV/AIDS funding from the U.S. government because of the anti-prostitution pledge. Brazil's AIDS commissioner Pedro Chequer was quoted as saying "Sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?"&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050530/kaplan|title=Just Say Não|journal=The Nation|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge has been criticized as counterproductive, because projects that work with and support prostitutes are often seen as instrumental in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Brazilian anti-AIDS program, which employs prostitutes to hand out information and free condoms, is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/01/AR2006030102316.html|title=Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sonagachi]] Project is a prostitutes' cooperative in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], that supports [[sex workers' rights]] and works to stop the spread of HIV; it has received strong positive evaluations from both [[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Bank]], and has been cited by UNAIDS as a "best-practice" model of working with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/ProstitutionOathImplications.pdf Implications of U.S. Policy Restrictions for Programs Aimed at Commercial Sex Workers and Victims of Trafficking Worldwide], Center for Health and Gender Equity, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Weitzer]] has described the anti-prostitution pledge as a symptom of what he calls the "[[moral panic|moral crusade]]" against sex trafficking, resulting in a broad attack against all forms of commercial sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2007 |title=The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade |url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035(3)%20%20447-475.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Politics &amp; Society |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=447–475 |doi=10.1177/0032329207304319 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043556/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035%283%29%20%20447-475.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the policy juxtaposes the words "prostitution" and "sex trafficking"; it has been pointed out that it is important to clearly distinguish between these two concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2803%2913596-9/fulltext|author=Butcher K.|title=Confusion between prostitution and sex trafficking|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=361|pages=329–332|year=2003|pmid=12801757|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13596-9|issue=9373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all relevant organizations already strongly oppose sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e207 EP –|last=Masenior|first=Nicole Franck|author2=Chris Beyrer|title=The US Anti-Prostitution Pledge: First Amendment Challenges and Public Health Priorities|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=1 July 2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040207|pmid=17676943|pmc=1925124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randall L. Tobias]], the U.S. administration's foreign aid chief who was responsible for implementation of the anti-prostitution pledge, resigned in April 2007 over allegations that he had used an [[escort service]]. Some sex worker organizations and commentators called the situation "ironic" and Tobias "hypocritical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html The Anti-Prostitution Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219100932/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html |date=19 December 2008 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/29/ex_aids_chief_in_escort_flap_called_hypocritical/ Ex-AIDS chief in escort flap called hypocritical], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 29 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 final report of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]'s Global Commission on HIV and the Law denounced the anti-prostitution pledge and included the recommendation
{{quote|text=3.2.8 Repeal punitive conditions in official development assistance—such as the United States government's PEPFAR anti-prostitution pledge and its current anti-trafficking regulations—that inhibit sex workers' access to HIV services or their ability to form organisations in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Global Commission on HIV and the Law|title=Final Report|url=http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&amp;Health-EN.pdf|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lawsuits===
In response to the 2005 decision to apply the policy also to U.S.-based organizations, two lawsuits were filed, alleging that the policy compels or prohibits speech in violation of the First Amendment, and also prohibits actions that are exclusively privately funded.

In the first case (''DKT v. USAID''), the non-profit [[DKT International]] prevailed in [[United States district court|District Court]] but lost on appeal, at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit]]. The February 2007 appeals court ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution as long as it is done through an affiliate that doesn't receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in [http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517062512/http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf |date=17 May 2008 }}. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The second case (''AOSI v. USAID'') involved the plaintiffs [[Alliance for Open Society International]], its affiliate the [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Pathfinder International]]. In May 2006, a District Court in New York issued a [[preliminary injunction]], preventing the government from requiring these organizations to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed this injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court]]. During the oral arguments in the case, the government stated that it would allow legally and physically separate affiliates to engage in the prohibited speech.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Appeals Court rebuffed the government and let the preliminary injunction stand, returning the case to the District Court. [[Global Health Council]] and [[InterAction]] joined the case, and the District Court extended the injunction to all U.S.-based members of these organizations in August 2008. The Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision in July 2011, affirmed the injunction and held that the anti-prostitution policy requirement "likely violates the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/aosi_v_usaid  ''AOSI v. USAID'' resources], [[Brennan Center for Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110713031758/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/11e51f0b-8781-4661-b383-d5d3dc77096b/2/doc/08-4917_complete_opn.pdf Alliance for Open Society International v. U.S. Agency for International Development], Appeals Court decision, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] obtained a ruling forcing the Department of Justice's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] to hand over the original February 2004 memorandum which had argued that the pledge, as applied to U.S.-based organizations, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. must show anti-prostitution pledge memo for HIV groups: court|date=19 September 2012|work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/09_-_September/U_S__must_show_anti-prostitution_pledge_memo_for_HIV_groups__court/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court [[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|ruled]] in 2013 that the anti-prostitution pledge violated the First Amendment: the government may not leverage funding to regulate grant recipient's speech outside of the funded program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency for Int'l Dev. v.

Born '''Dimitrios Arhondonis''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτριος Αρχοντώνης, Dimítrios Archontónis}}), in the village of Agios Theodoros (Zeytinli Köyü) on the island of [[Imbros]] (later renamed Gökçeada by Turkey), after his graduation he held a position at the [[Halki Seminary|Patriarchal Theological Seminary of Halki]], where he was ordained a priest. Later, he served as Metropolitan of Philadelphia and Chalcedon and he became a member of the [[Holy Synod]] as well as other committees, prior to his enthronement as Ecumenical Patriarch.

Bartholomew's tenure has been characterized by intra-Orthodox cooperation, intra-Christian and [[inter-religious dialogue]], and formal visits to Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim leaders seldom previously visited by an Ecumenical Patriarch. He has exchanged numerous invitations with church and state dignitaries. His efforts to promote [[religious freedom]] and [[human right]]s, his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among the world's religions, as well as his efforts to promote [[ecology]] and the [[environmental protection|protection of the environment]], have been widely noted, and these endeavors have earned him the title "The Green Patriarch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=MARLISE SIMONS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/science/bartholomew-i-of-constantinoples-bold-green-stance.html |title=Bartholomew I of Constantinople's Bold Green Stance - The New York Times |website=Nytimes.com |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apostolicpilgrimage.org/the-green-patriarch |title=The Green Patriarch - Apostolic Pilgrimage of Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Jerusalem |website=Apostolicpilgrimage.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many international positions, he currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for [[the Elijah Interfaith Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/?id=730 |title=Elijah Interfaith – Sharing Wisdom Fostering Peace |website=Elijah-interfaith.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Bartholomew I was born in the village of Zeytinli ({{lang-el|Άγιος Θεόδωρος, Agios Theodoros}}) in the island of [[Gökçeada]] ({{lang-el|Ίμβρος, Imvros}}), son of Christos and Merope Archontónis. His secular birth name is ''Dimitrios Arhondonis'' (Δημήτριος Αρχοντώνης, Dimítrios Archontónis). He is a Turkish citizen, but he belongs (ethnically) to the historically indigenous Rum - descendants of Eastern Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire  [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek community in Turkey]], which today is diminished and reduced due to the [[Greek genocide]], the subsequent population exchange of 1923 between Greece and Turkey and ultimately through the exodus of Greeks post the 1960s Cyprus conflicts.

Dimitrios Archontonis attended elementary school in his native Imvros and continued his secondary education in the famous [[Zographeion Lyceum]] in [[Istanbul]]. Soon afterwards, he studied [[Theology]] as an undergraduate at the Patriarchal Theological school or [[Halki seminary]], from which he graduated with highest honours in 1961, and was immediately [[ordained]] [[deacon]], receiving the name [[Bartholomew]]. Bartholomew fulfilled his military service in the [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish army]] as a non regular officer between 1961 and 1963. From 1963 to 1968, Bartholomew pursued his postgraduate studies at the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]] in [[Rome]], the [[Bossey Ecumenical Institute|Ecumenical Institute of Bossey]] in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] in [[Germany]]. His doctoral research was on the [[Canon Law]]. The same year he became a lecturer in the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.

After returning to [[Istanbul]] in 1968, he took a position at the Patriarchal Theological Seminary of Halki, where he was ordained a priest in 1969, by [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]]. When [[Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople|Demetrius I]] became Ecumenical Patriarch in 1972 and established the Patriarchal Office, he selected Bartholomew as its director. On Christmas of 1973, Bartholomew became Metropolitan of Philadelphia, and was renamed as director of the patriarchal office until his enthronement as Metropolitan of [[Chalcedon]] in 1990. From March 1974 until his enthronement as Ecumenical Patriarch, he was a member of the [[Holy Synod]] as well as of many Synodical Committees.

He speaks [[Modern Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]; he is also fluent in [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]] and [[Latin]].

Bartholomew I was the target of an assassination plot which was planned to take place on May 29, 2013.&lt;ref name="Kaya"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaya|first=Bayram|title=One arrested as plot to assassinate Patriarch Bartholomew uncovered|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-315022-one-arrested-as-plot-to-assasinate-patriarch-bartholomew-uncovered.html|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=Zaman|date=10 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510174058/http://todayszaman.com/news-315022-one-arrested-as-plot-to-assasinate-patriarch-bartholomew-uncovered.html|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suspect was arrested and there is an ongoing search for two others.&lt;ref name=Kaya /&gt;

As [[Ecumenical Patriarch]], he has been particularly active internationally. One of his first focuses has been on rebuilding the once-persecuted [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] following the fall of [[Communism]] there in 1990. As part of this effort he has worked to strengthen ties among the various national Churches and Patriarchates of the Eastern Orthodox Communion. He has also continued the reconciliation dialogue with the [[Roman Catholic]] Church started by his predecessors, and initiated dialogue with other faiths, including other [[Christianity|Christian]] sects, [[Muslim]]s, and [[Jewish|Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Patriarch Bartholomew I: Texts and Speeches (1991-1992)'' (1998) George C.

He has also gained a reputation as a prominent [[environmentalism|environmentalist]], putting the support of the Patriarchate behind various international environmental causes. This has earned him the nicknames of "the Green Patriarch" and "the Green Pope",&lt;ref name="env"&gt;''Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew: insights into an Orthodox Christian worldview'' (2007) John Chryssavgis International Journal of Environmental Studies, 64, (1);pp: 9 - 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patriarchate.org/multimedia/video/green-patriarch |title=The Green Patriarch &amp;#124; Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople |publisher=Patriarchate.org |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903074150/http://www.patriarchate.org/multimedia/video/green-patriarch |archivedate=3 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/science/bartholomew-i-of-constantinoples-bold-green-stance.html ''Orthodox Leader Deepens Progressive Stance on Environment''] December 3, 2012 ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415135950/http://www.patriarchate.org/documents/encyclical-of-his-all-holiness-for-the-church-new-year]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 he was honored with the [[Sophie Prize]]. He has also been honoured with the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], the highest award which may be bestowed by the [[Legislative Branch]] of the [[United States government]].

Bartholomew I, after his attempts to celebrate the [[liturgy]] in remote areas of the country, thereby renewing the Orthodox presence, which was absent since before 1924, has now come under intense pressure from Turkish nationalist elements. The patriarchal [[Halki seminary|Seminary of Halki]] in the [[Princes' Islands]] remains closed since 1971 on government orders.

During his trip to Turkey in November 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] traveled to Istanbul on the invitation of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I. The Pope participated in the feast day services of [[St. Andrew]] the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. This was the third official visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate by a [[Pope]] (the first being by [[Paul VI]] in 1967, and the second by [[John Paul II]] in 1979).

In an interview published on 19 November 2006 in the daily newspaper ''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'', Bartholomew I addressed the issues of religious freedom and the then upcoming papal trip to Turkey. He also referred to the closing of the Halki seminary by saying: "As Turkish citizens, we pay taxes. We serve in the military. We vote. As citizens we do everything. We want the same rights. But it does not happen... If Muslims want to study theology, there are 24 theology faculties. Where are we going to study?" He also addressed the issue of his Ecumenical title and it not being accepted by the Turkish government: "We've had this title since the 6th century... The word ecumenical has no political content. [...] This title is the only thing that I insist on. I will never renounce this title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2006/11/19/gnd119.html|title=Derin devlet açtırmıyor|accessdate=2007-05-24|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/19/turkey.pope.ap/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119154818/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/19/turkey.pope.ap/index.html |archivedate=2006-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[Papal inauguration of Pope Francis|Papal inauguration]] of [[Pope Francis]] on 19 March 2013, paving the way for better Catholic–Orthodox relations. It was the first time that the spiritual head of Eastern Orthodox Christians had attended a papal inauguration since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/19/us-pope-idUSBRE92D05P20130319 Pope sets tone for humbler papacy, calls for defense of the weak].

Pope Francis was also invited to the Patriarchate for the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] (30 November).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/United-against-economic-crisis-and-worldly-trends,-Bartholomew-and-Francis-to-be-in-Jerusalem-next-year-27450.html United against economic crisis and "worldly trends", Bartholomew and Francis to be in Jerusalem next year].

On 16 April 2016 he visited, together with [[Pope Francis]] and [[Ieronymos II of Athens|Archbishop Hieronymus]], the Mòria camp in the island of [[Lesbos]], to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/apr/16/pope-francis-europe-visits-lesbos-in-pictures Pope Francis visits Lesbos].

'''Commonwealth of the Independent States - Election Monitoring Organization (CIS-EMO)''' — is an international [[non-governmental organization]] founded by the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

Celebrities have two kinds of specific power; the abilities to shed light on issues and persuade audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-2498-0.html|title=Celebrity Influence|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is one of the most common areas for celebrities to discuss specific issues or current events that are being politicized; the individuals may also speak out in public forums such as television talk shows, events, or during their own widely-attended performances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History  ==

=== The Use of Media ===
The adoption of wide-reaching mediums has made it easier for celebrities to exert influence in politics that began with the creation of television.  According to John Street, celebrity influence in politics began with television, as the medium is intimate and focused more on the human side of people, including political candidates, than any other medium. He further states that celebrities were able to use television to reach a wide audience and that their influence affected others' understandings of certain topics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As different mediums emerged, such as social media, where celebrities could voice their opinions on various topics, their influence had a greater effect. Mark Wheeler has opined that this led to one of the main critiques of celebrity involvement in politics in that celebrities could be viewed as a manufactured product, one fabricated through media exposure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

=== Examples of Celebrities in Politics  ===
Celebrities such as movie stars, professional athletes, musicians, and reality television stars have campaigned for and against political parties, candidates, and on political issues. Examples include [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[George Clooney]] endorsing [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008]] and a song written by American musician [[Hank Williams Jr.]] endorsing Senator [[John McCain]]'s campaign in the same election.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Prior to winning the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States presidential election,]] President [[Donald Trump]] was a businessman and television personality who actively appeared on [[Fox News]] to discuss politics and endorsed political candidates. Michael Higgins concludes that Trump's media-centered politics amounts to a "pseudo presidency", confounding orthodox forms of political accountability. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Higgins|first=Michael|title=The Donald: Media, Celebrity, Authenticity, and Accountability|date=2018-10-18|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94069-4_9|work=Trump’s Media War|pages=129–141|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-94069-4_9|isbn=9783319940687|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Street, this is evident in how he is represented, how he performs and how his 'fans' respond to him. It is also symptomatic of wider changes in the conduct and form of the contemporary, mediatised political realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=John|date=2018-05-10|title=What is Donald Trump? Forms of ‘Celebrity’ in Celebrity Politics|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478929918772995|journal=Political Studies Review|language=en|pages=147892991877299|doi=10.1177/1478929918772995|issn=1478-9299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Smriti Irani]] have campaigned for various political parties and positions. 

There are multiple cases of celebrities who have performed well in the polls and have become important political figures in their respective countries. Examples include Austrian-American bodybuilder and movie star [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Italian comedian [[Beppe Grillo]], Israeli television host [[Yair Lapid]], Brazilian singer and composer [[Gilberto Gil]], and Panamanian salsa singer and actor [[Rubén Blades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Genre_Approach_to_Celebrity_Politics.html?id=AL2_BwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Genre Approach to Celebrity Politics: Global Patterns of Passage from Media to Politics|last=Ribke|first=Nahuel|date=2015-03-17|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137409393|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on the Public ==

=== General Influence ===
Through their activism on the world stage, a self-selected cast of celebrities have begun to have a significant impact on policy, shaping the agenda on a range of global humanitarian issues. Celebrities play a growing role as part of an emerging strategy for political advocacy. Spawned by the difficulty most groups have making news, and made possible by the evolution of technology and the public sphere, this new celebrity advocacy strategy represents one aspect of the broader shift in American politics being ushered in by the digital age.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mishra|first=Anubhav A.|last2=Mishra|first2=Abhinav|date=2014|title=National vs. Local Celebrity Endorsement and Politics|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24713304|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|volume=27|issue=4|pages=409–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities have the ability to generate parasocial relationships (feelings of a personal connectedness despite the lack of direct contact with the consumers).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Brian Loader et al, young citizens are generally cautiously positive about both politicians and celebrities using social media but feel that they should learn to use it appropriately if they are to rebuild trust and credibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the United States and Canada, there is empirical confirmation of celebrities having a positive effect on the willingness of young people to support specific causes. According to Anubhav and Abhinav Mishra, the credibility of the endorser will likely translate to that of the political group that celebrity is endorsing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Identification ===
Identification is the process by which individuals are thought to develop a deep connection with celebrities. This increases the likelihood that the viewer will perform the behaviors advocated by the celebrity as well as adopt similar attitudes and beliefs. Individuals go through the process of identification where they start to believe in the values, convictions and behaviors portrayed by the celebrity endorser and eventually adopt them as their own. Because it is easier to identify with people who have a connection or relationship, individuals are more likely to identify with celebrities that are closer to them in age. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars consider identification a significant component in the persuasion process through which celebrities influence audience behavior. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Erica Weintraub|last2=Vord|first2=Rebecca Van de|last3=Pinkleton|first3=Bruce E.|last4=Epstein|first4=Evan|date=2008-10-16|title=Celebrity Endorsements and Their Potential to Motivate Young Voters|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15205430701866600?needAccess=true|journal=Mass Communication and Society|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=420–436|doi=10.1080/15205430701866600|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
Various concerns have been raised over celebrity involvement in politics. According to John Street, one of the main criticisms of celebrity involvement in politics is when celebrities take an office. In his article, as his example of this Street mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming the Governor of California. He cites the main concerns surrounding celebrities holding office is lacking the qualities necessary to be a representative of the people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Street|first=John|date=2004-11-01|title=Celebrity Politicians: Popular Culture and Political Representation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00149.x|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=435–452|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2004.00149.x|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street also argues that reliance on intimate mediums, such as television shifts the criteria by which politicians are judged from leadership skills to populist empathy. In Mark Wheeler's book, ''Celebrity Politics,'' he mentions that outside of politicians holding public office, their advocacy on political issues can cause skewed understanding of that particular topic. Wheeler suggests these critique's of celebrity involvement in politics reflects the values of the [[Frankfurt School]]. The school's critical theorists contended that media has become an expression of dominate ideology, which celebrities advocate for. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Yu-U5tfCaqoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=critique+of+celebrity+politics&amp;ots=5cOx1MmHdh&amp;sig=uZNJlAYgo3hMkmt28Om9Rlnh0QY#v=onepage&amp;q=critique%20of%20celebrity%20politics&amp;f=false|title=Celebrity Politics|last=Wheeler|first=Mark|date=2013-08-05|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745652498|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale for civic education in the United States ==

The promotion of a republic and its values has been an important concern for policy-makers – to impact people´s political perceptions, to encourage political participation, and to foster the principles enshrined in the Constitution (e.g. liberty, freedom of speech, civil rights). The subject of “Civics” has been integrated into the Curriculum and Content Standards, to enhance the comprehension of democratic values in the educational system. Civic literature has found that “engaging young children in civic activities from an early age is a positive predictor of their participation in later civic life”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"&gt;Bers, Marina Umaschi. (2008). “Civic Identities, Online Technologies: From Designing Civic Curriculum to Supporting Civic Experiences." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp. 139–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an academic subject, Civics has the instructional objective to promote knowledge that is aligned with self-governance and participation in matters of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen C. Lagemann &amp; Harry R. Lewis. (2012). “Renewing Civic Education: Time to Restore American Higher Education's Lost Mission” (Harvard Magazine, March-Apr).&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives advocate for an instruction that encourages active student participation in democratic decision-making environments, such as voting to elect a course representative for a school government, or deciding on actions that will affect the school environment or community. Thus the intersection of individual and collective decision making activities, are critical to shape “individual´s moral development”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; To reach those goals, civic instructors must promote the adoption of certain skills and attitudes such as “respectful argumentation, debate, information literacy”, to support “the development of morally responsible individuals who will shape a morally responsible and civically minded society".&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; In the 21st century, young people are less interested in direct political participation (i.e. being in a political party or even voting), but are motivated to use digital media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Digital media enable young people to share and exchange ideas rapidly, enabling the coordination of local communities that promote volunteerism and political activism, in topics principally related to human rights and  environmental subjects.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"&gt;Bennett, W. Lance. (2008). “Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp.1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people are constructing and supporting their political identities in the 21st century by using social media, and digital tools (e.g. text messaging, hashtags, videos) to share, post, reply an opinion or attitude about a political/social topic and to promote social mobilization and support through online mechanism to a wide and diverse audience. Therefore, civics' end-goal in the 21st century must be oriented to “empower the learners to find issues in their immediate communities that seem important to the people with whom they live and associate”, once “learners have identified with a personal issue and participated in constructing a collective framing for common issues”.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"/&gt;

== Current state of civic education in the United States ==

According to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, one of the purposes of Civic Education is to “foster civic competence and responsibility”  which is promoted through the Center for Civic Education’s We the People and Project Citizen initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-110, § 115, Stat. 1425 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is a lack of consensus for how this mission should be pursued.  The Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning &amp; Engagement (CIRCLE) reviewed state civic education requirements in the United States for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Godsay, S., Henderson, W., Levine, P., Littenberg-Tobias, J., &amp; CIRCLE (The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and, E). (2012). State Civic Education Requirements. CIRCLE Fact Sheet. Center For Information And Research On Civic Learning And Engagement (CIRCLE).&lt;/ref&gt;  The findings include:
* All 50 states have social studies standards which include civics and government.
* 40 states require at least one course in government/civics.
* 21 states require a state-mandated social studies test which is a decrease from 2001 (34 states).
* 8 states require students to take a state-mandated government/civics test.
* 9 states require a social studies test as a requirement for high school graduation.
The lack of state-mandated student accountability relating to civics may be a result of a shift in emphasis towards reading and mathematics in response to the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Nora. (2011) "Few States Test Students on Civics." ''Education Week, 32 (08).''  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/10/11/08civics.h32.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is a movement to require that states utilize the citizenship test as a graduation requirement, but this is seen as a controversial solution to some educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://civiceducator.org/tests-wont-fix-civics-education/|title=Hey Policy Makers! Tests Are Not the Answer for Better Civics Education|date=2017-09-13|work=The Civic Educator|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are also demonstrating that their civic knowledge leaves much to be desired.  A National Center for Education Statistics NAEP report card for civics (2010) stated that “levels of civic knowledge in U.S. have remained unchanged or even declined over the past century”. Specifically, only 24 percent of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders were at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in civics.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics (2011). The Nation’s Report Card: Civics 2010 (NCES 2011–466). Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, civic education has emphasized the facts of government processes detached from participatory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, A. (2015). Citizenship education in American schools and its role in developing civic engagement: a review of the research.Educational Review, 67(1), 35–63. {{doi|10.1080/00131911.2013.813440}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to combat the existing approach, the National Council for the Social Studies developed the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards.  The C3 Framework emphasizes “new and active approaches” including the “discussion of controversial issues and current events, deliberation of public issues, service-learning, action civics, participation in simulation and role play, and the use of digital technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS). (2013), The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards: Guidance for Enhancing the Rigor of K–12 Civics, Economics, Geography, and History. Silver Spring, MD: NCSS.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civic education in the United States in the 21st century ==

According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, among teens 12–17 years old, 95% have access to the Internet, 70% go online daily, 80% use social networking sites, and 77% have cell phones.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"&gt;Jenkins, H. (2007). "Confronting the challenges of participatory culture: Media education for the 21st century." Chicago: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, participatory culture has become a staple for today’s youth, affecting their conceptualization of civic participation.  They use Web 2.0 tools (i.e. blogs, podcasts, wikis, social media) to: circulate information (blogs and podcasts); collaborate with peers (wikis); produce and exchange media; and connect with people around the world via social media and online communities.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Lenhart, Mary Madden, Aaron Smith, Kristen Purcell, Kathryn Zickuhr and Lee Rainie, Teens, Kindness and Cruelty on Social Network Sites: How American teens navigate the new world of “digital citizenship” (Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, November 2011),&lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2011/PIP_Teens_Kindness_Cruelty_SNS_Report_Nov_2011_FINAL_110711.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed on October 8, 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;  The pervasiveness of participatory digital tools has led to a shift in the way adolescents today perceive civic action and participation. Whereas 20th century civic education embraced the belief of “dutiful citizenship” and civic engagement as a “matter of duty or obligation;” 21st century civic education has shifted to reflect youths' “personally expressive politics” and “peer-to-peer relationships” that promote civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"/&gt;

This shift in students' perceptions has led to classroom civic education experiences that reflect the digital world in which 21st century youth now live, in order to make the content both relevant and meaningful.  Civics education classrooms in the 21st century now seek to provide genuine opportunities to actively engage in the consumption, circulation, discussion, and production of civic and political content via Web 2.0 technologies such as blogging, wikis, and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Don Tapscott, ''Growing up digital: The rise of the net generation'' ( New York: McGraw-Hill, 1997); W. Lance Bennett, Deen Freelon and Chris Wells, “Changing Citizen Identity and the Rise of a Participatory Media Culture,” in Lonnie R. Sherrod, Judith Torney-Purta and Constance A. Flanagan (Eds.), ''Handbook of Research on Civic Engagement in Youth'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these tools offer new ways for engagement, interaction, and dialogue, educators have also recognized the need to teach youth how to interact both respectfully and productively with their peers and members of online communities.  As a result, many school districts have also begun adopting Media Literacy Frameworks for Engaged Citizenship as a pedagogical approach to prepare students for active participatory citizenship in today’s digital age.  This model includes critical analysis of digital media as well as a deep understanding of media literacy as a “collaborative and participatory movement that aims to empower individuals to have a voice and to use it.”&lt;ref&gt;All Together Now: Collaboration and Innovation for Youth Engagement: The Report of the Commission on Youth Voting and Civic Knowledge (Medford, MA: Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 2013),  www.civicyouth.org/about-circle/ commission-on-youth-voting-civic-knowledge/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihailidis, P., &amp; Thevenin, B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4460">'''Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity''' was a small [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] group that left the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1963. CDRCU was led by Michael McCreery, the son of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Richard McCreery]]. CDRCU was sympathetic towards the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], with CDRCU members attending May Day celebrations in Tirana in May 1964. The group began publishing ''Vanguard'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="moorhouse"&gt;John Moorhouse, ''A Historical Glossary of British Marxism'' (Pauper's Press, 1987) {{ISBN|0-946650-06-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CDRCU reached the height of its activity from February 1964 to February 1965, during which CDRCU cells were established in London, the Thames Valley, Scotland, West Yorkshire, Manchester and Cardiff, and public meetings were arranged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kick Inside - Revolutionary Opposition in the CPGB, 1945-1991|last=Parker|first=Lawrence|publisher=November Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781291196092|location=London|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDRCU had split with other CPGB members, some of them based around the ''Forum'' publication, who wanted to remain inside the CPGB to conduct the anti-revisionist struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kick Inside - Revolutionary Opposition in the CPGB, 1945-1991|last=Parker|first=Lawrence|publisher=November Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781291196092|location=London|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1964, the CDRCU stood a candidate in [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]], gaining 899 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Tom. ''East Wind: China and the British Left, 1925-1976,'' Oxford: 2012, p201&lt;/ref&gt;

After McCreery died (at the age of only 36) from cancer in 1965 in New Zealand, the activity of the group declined sharply. Most of the members of CDRCU regrouped into the [[Action Centre for Marxist-Leninist Unity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv7n2/blandobit.htm William B. Bland - Obituary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved into the [[Marxist-Leninist Organisation of Britain]]. A small number formed the Finsbury Communist Association.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.firstwave/finsbury-open-letter.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.firstwave/cdr-kenna.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Others later formed the [[Workers' Party of Scotland]] and the London Workers' Committee. In 1966 the London Workers' Committee split, becoming the 
[[Working People's Party of England]].&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt;  

Some of the Irish members of the CDRCU later joined the Irish Communist Group in 1965. When the latter organisation split, they went on to form the [[Irish Communist Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Widgery]], The Left in Britain (1976) p.489.&lt;/ref&gt;
Noel Jenkinson, a Protestant from [[County Meath|Meath]],&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;{{harvnb|Swan|2007|p=346}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was another Ireland-born member of CDRCU who had joined from the Communist Party of Great Britain.&lt;ref name="swan"/&gt; He later joined the [[Official IRA]] and was convicted for carrying out the [[1972 Aldershot bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workersliberty.org/node/10205 An account of the IWU, ICG and IWG]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Containerization''' is a system of [[intermodal freight transport]] using [[intermodal container]]s (also called '''shipping containers''' and '''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] containers''').&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite web| first = John | last = Edmonds | title = The Freight Essentials: Getting Your Products Across The Ocean. | url = https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2017/03/freight-essentials.html | accessdate =2017-09-01| date = 2017-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The containers have [[Standardization|standardized]] dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—[[container ship]]s, [[rail transport]] [[flatcar]]s, and [[semi-trailer truck]]s—without being opened. The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes &lt;ref name="PTS"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last = Lewandowski | title = Growth in the Size of Unit Loads and Shipping Containers from Antique to WWI. | journal = Packaging Technology and Science. | volume = 29 |  issue = 8–9 | year =  2016 | pages =  451–478 | issn = 1099-1522| doi = 10.1002/pts.2231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and special forklift trucks.  All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.

Containerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after [[World War II]], when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in [[globalization]].  Containerization did away with the manual sorting of most shipments and the need for warehousing. It displaced many thousands of dock workers who formerly handled [[break bulk cargo]]. Containerization also reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time and reduced losses from damage and theft.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=17 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archive-date=22 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Containers can be made of [[weathering steel]] to minimize [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] needs.

Before containerization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Istazk|first1=Pavel|title=10ft opslagcontainer verhuur bij|url=http://www.containerwebshop.nl/verhuur-opslagcontainer/10ft-opslagcontainer|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; goods were usually handled manually as [[break bulk cargo]]. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle from the factory and taken to a port warehouse where they would be offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved to the side of the ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.&lt;ref name="Levinson"/&gt;

Containerization has its origins in early [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal mining regions in England]] beginning in the late 18th century. In 1766 [[James Brindley]]  designed the box boat 'Starvationer' with 10 wooden containers, to transport coal from [[Worsley]] Delph (quarry) to Manchester by [[Bridgewater Canal]]. In 1795, [[Benjamin Outram]] opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in [[wagons]] built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal [[barge]]s on the [[Derby Canal]], which Outram had also promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, David (1993). ''The Little Eaton Gangway and Derby Canal'' (Second ed.). Oakwood Press. {{ISBN|0-85361-431-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1830s, railroads on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in the United Kingdom was one of these. "Simple rectangular timber boxes, four to a wagon, they were used to convey coal from the Lancashire collieries to Liverpool, where they were transferred to horse-drawn carts by crane."&lt;ref&gt;Essery, R. J, Rowland. D. P. &amp; Steel W. O. ''British Goods Wagons from 1887 to the Present Day''. Augustus M. Kelly Publishers. New York USA. 1979 Page 92&lt;/ref&gt; Originally used for moving coal on and off barges, "loose boxes" were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, at places like the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. By the 1840s, iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones. The early 1900s saw the adoption of closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail.

=== Twentieth century ===
On 17 May 1917, Benjamin Franklin Fitch inaugurated exploitation of the experimental installation for transfer of the containers called the demountable bodies based on his own design in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] in US. Later in 1919, his system was extended to over 200 containers serving 21 railway stations with 14 freight trucks.&lt;ref name="GJHSSHI"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last = Lewandowski | title = Benjamin Franklin Fitch the forgotten developer of the container system in US of America. | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284019751 | journal = Global Journal of Human Social Science.

Prior to the Second World War, many European countries independently developed container systems.

In 1919,  Stanisław Rodowicz, an [[engineer]], developed the first draft of the container system in [[Poland]]. In 1920, he built a prototype of the biaxial wagon. The [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] stopped development of the container system in Poland.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last = Lewandowski | title = Stanisław Rodowicz, Eng.

The US Post Office contracted with the New York Central Railroad to move mail via containers in May 1921.  In 1930, the [[Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad]] began shipping containers between Chicago and Milwaukee.  However, their efforts ended in the spring of 1931 when the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] wouldn't allow the use of a flat rate for the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=H. Roger |date=1996 |title=The Northwestern A History of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway System |location=DeKalb, IL |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University Press]] |page=156 |isbn=978-0-87580-214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, a regular connection of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, [[Golden Arrow (train)|Golden Arrow]]/[[La Flèche d’Or (train)|Fleche d'Or]],  by [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] and [[French Northern Railway]], began. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat cars in the UK and "CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL" in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator [[Silvio Benigno Crespi|Silvio Crespi]] proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition.  This would be done under the auspices of an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided international carriage of passengers in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular container service in the northeast United States. After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means of transport for cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in [[Venice]] on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests were done to assess the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.&lt;ref name="logistica2014a" &gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last =  Lewandowski | title = Czechoslovak activity to prepare European norms for containers before the Second World War|journal=Acta Logistica|volume=1|year=2014|issue=4|pages=1–7|issn=1339-5629|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270794211| format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, 1931, in USA Benjamin Franklin Fitch designed the two largest and heaviest containers in existence anywhere at the time. One measured 17'6" by 8'0" by 8'0" with a capacity of 30,000 pounds in 890 cubic feet, and a second measured 20'0" by 8'0" by 8'0", with a capacity of 50,000 pounds in 1,000 cubic feet.&lt;ref name="GJHSSHI" /&gt;

In November 1932 in Enola the first [[container terminal]] in the world was opened by PRR Pennsylvania RailRoad company.&lt;ref name="logistica2014a" /&gt; The Fitch hooking system was used for reloading of the containers.&lt;ref name="GJHSSHI" /&gt;

The development of containerization was created in Europe and the US as a way to revitalize rail companies after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which had caused economic collapse and reduction in use of all modes of transport &lt;ref name="logistica2014a" /&gt;

In 1933 in Europe under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce the [[Bureau International des Containers|International Container Bureau]] (French: ''Bureau International des Conteneurs'', B.I.C.) was established.  In June 1933, the&amp;nbsp;B.I.C. decided on obligatory parameters for containers used in international traffic. Containers handled by means of lifting gear, such as cranes, overhead conveyors, etc. for traveling elevators (group I containers), constructed after July 1, 1933. Obligatory Regulations: 
* Clause 1.—Containers are, as regards form, either of the closed or the open type, and, as regards capacity, either of the heavy or the light type. 
* Clause 2.—The loading capacity of containers must be such that their total weight (load, plus tare) is: 5 metric tons for containers of the heavy type; 2.5 metric tons for containers of the light type; a tolerance of 5 percent excess on the total weight is allowable under the same conditions as for wagon loads.&lt;ref name="logistica2014a" /&gt;

From 1926 to 1947 in the United States, the [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway]] carried motor carrier vehicles and shippers' vehicles loaded on [[flatcar]]s between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois. Beginning in 1929, [[Seatrain Lines]] carried railroad boxcars on its sea vessels to transport goods between New York and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Seatrain:  Railroad or steamship line? | first =  Robert E. | last = Mohowski | journal = Classic Trains |date=Spring 2011 | pp = 64–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s, the [[Chicago Great Western Railway]] and then the [[New Haven Railroad]] began "piggyback" service (transporting highway freight trailers on flatcars) limited to their own railroads.  The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles.  Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Great Western Railway'', David J. Fiore, Sr., Charleston, South Carolina:  Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1953, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]], the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad|Chicago and Eastern Illinois]], and the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.

==== World War II ====
During World War II, the [[Australian Army]] used containers to help more easily deal with various [[break of gauge|breaks of gauge]] in the railroads. These non-stackable containers were about the size of the later [[Teus|20-foot ISO container]] and perhaps made mainly of wood.&lt;ref&gt;'''With Iron Rails''' p8.26 by David Burke 1988{{Full citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2013}}

During the same time, the [[United States Army]] started to combine items of uniform size, lashing them onto a pallet, [[Unit load|unitizing]] cargo to speed the loading and unloading of transport ships. In 1947 the [[Transportation Corps]] developed the ''Transporter'', a rigid, corrugated steel container with a {{convert|9000|lb|t|abbr=on}} carrying capacity, for shipping household goods of officers in the field. It was 8' 6" long, 6' 3" wide, and 6' 10" high (2.59 x 1.91 x 2.08 m), with double doors on one end, mounted on skids, and had lifting rings on the top four corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Ham |first=Hans |last2=Rijsenbrij |first2=Joan |date=2012-12-15 |title=Development of Containerization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgQmkTczzPwC&amp;pg=PA8 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=[[IOS Press]] |page=8 |isbn=978-1614991465 |access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportation.army.mil/museum/transportation%20museum/CONEX.htm |title=History &amp; Development of the Container — The "Transporter", predecessor to the CONEX |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 May 2013 |website=www.transportation.army.mil |publisher=[[U.S. Army Transportation Museum]] |access-date=20 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720104152/http://www.transportation.army.mil/museum/transportation%20museum/CONEX.htm |archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]] the Transporter was evaluated for handling sensitive military equipment and, proving effective, was approved for broader use. Theft of material and damage to wooden crates convinced the army that steel containers were needed.

==== Mid-twentieth century ====
In April 1951, at [[Zürich Tiefenbrunnen railway station]], the Swiss Museum of Transport and ''[[Bureau International des Containers]]'' (BIC) held demonstrations of container systems, with the aim of selecting the best solution for Western Europe. Present were representatives from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Great Britain, Italy and the United States. The system chosen for Western Europe was based on the Netherlands' system for consumer goods and waste transportation called ''Laadkisten'' (literally, "loading bins"), in use since 1934. This system used [[roller container]]s that were moved by rail, truck and ship, in various configurations up to a capacity of {{convert|5500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and up to 3.1 x 2.3 x 2 metres in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.K. |date= |title=Vorläufer der heutigen Container: pa, BT und B900 | trans-title=Predecessors of today's containers: pa, BT and B900 |language=German |url=http://s1gf.de/index.php?page=Attachment&amp;attachmentID=15438&amp;h=baff58dff7aacd89e3c5f73a93e2a6f668971165 |journal=MIBA |issue=Special 54 |pages=12–19 |access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicospilt.com/index_laadkisten.htm |title=Laadkistvervoer - Langs de rails |author=Nico Spilt |date= |language=Dutch |trans-title=Loading bin transport |access-date=20 July 2015 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720180139/http://www.nicospilt.com/index_laadkisten.htm |archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the first post World War&amp;nbsp;II European railway standard [[International Union of Railways|UIC]] 590, known as "pa-Behälter."

With the popularization of the larger ISO containers, support for pa containers was phased out by the railways. In the 1970s they began to be widely used for transporting waste.&lt;ref name="PojazdySzynowe2015a"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Krzysztof |last=Lewandowski |title=Wymagania Organizacyjne Stosowania Systemu ACTS |language=Polish |trans-title=Organizational Requirements Use the ACTS System |journal=Pojazdy Szynowe |volume=2 |year=2014 |pages=1–14 |issn=0138-0370 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269251044 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, former trucking company owner [[Malcom McLean]] worked with engineer [[Keith Tantlinger]] to develop the modern [[intermodal container]]. The challenge was to design a [[shipping container]] that could efficiently be loaded onto ships and would hold securely on long sea voyages. The result was a {{convert|8|ft|m}} tall by {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide box in {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}-long units constructed from {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick corrugated steel. The design incorporated a [[twistlock]] mechanism atop each of the four corners, allowing the container to be [[spreader (container)|easily secured and lifted]] using cranes. After helping McLean create the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to industry; this began international standardization of shipping containers.&lt;ref name="bbc-boxtcb"&gt;{{cite video|title=The Box that Changed Britain|people=McGough, Roger (Narrator), McAulay, Graeme (Director &amp; Producer), Crossley-Holland, Dominic (Executive Producer)|medium=documentary|network=BBC4|publisher=BBC|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first vessels purpose-built to carry containers had begun operation in 1926 for the regular connection of the luxury passenger train between London and Paris, the Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or. Four containers were used for the conveyance of passengers' baggage. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to the ports of Dover or Calais.&lt;ref name="logistica2014a" /&gt;

The next step was in Europe was after the Second World War.  Vessels purpose-built to carry containers were used between UK and Netherlands &lt;ref name="PojazdySzynowe2015a" /&gt; and also in Denmark in 1951.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = Marc Levinson | title = The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger | publisher = Princeton Univ.

First, the containers were rather small, with 52% of them having a volume of less than {{convert|3|m3|cuft|0}}.

The first truly successful container shipping company dates to April 26, 1956, when American trucking entrepreneur McLean put 58 ''trailer vans'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/04/27/archives/tankers-to-carry-2way-pay-loads-filled-trailer-vans-to-form-cargoes.html|title=TANKERS TO CARRY 2-WAY PAY LOADS; Filled Trailer Vans to Form Cargoes for Vessels That Normally Carry Ballast|work=NEW York Times| date= April 27, 1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later called containers, aboard a refitted tanker ship, the {{SS|Ideal X}}, and sailed them from [[Newark, New Jersey]] to [[Houston|Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Independently of the events in Canada, McLean had the idea of using large containers that never opened in transit and that were transferable on an intermodal basis, among trucks, ships, and railroad cars. McLean had initially favored the construction of "trailerships"—taking trailers from large trucks and stowing them in a ship's [[cargo]] hold. This method of stowage, referred to as [[roll-on/roll-off]], was not adopted because of the large waste in potential cargo space on board the vessel, known as broken [[stowage]]. Instead, McLean modified his original concept into loading just the containers, not the chassis, onto the ship; hence the designation "container ship" or "box" ship.&lt;ref name="CudahyB-TRN-2006-Sep-Oct"&gt;Cudahy, Brian J.,  [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/trnews/trnews246.pdf "The Containership Revolution: Malcom McLean's 1956 Innovation Goes Global"].

[[File:Psa keppel.JPG|thumb|right|Keppel Container Terminal in [[Singapore]]]]

During the first 20 years of containerization, many container sizes and corner fittings were used; there were dozens of incompatible container systems in the United States alone. Among the biggest operators, the [[Matson Navigation Company]] had a fleet of {{convert|24|ft|m|2|adj=on}} containers, while [[Sea-Land Service, Inc]] used {{convert|35|ft|m|2|adj=on}} containers. The standard sizes and fitting and reinforcement norms that now exist evolved out of a series of compromises among international shipping companies, European railroads, US railroads, and US trucking companies. Four important ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]]) recommendations standardized containerization globally:&lt;ref name="Rushton"&gt;Rushton, A., Oxley, J., Croucher, P. (2004). ''The Handbook of Logistics and Distribution Management''. Kogan Page: London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 1968: '''[[ISO 668]]''' defined the terminology, dimensions and ratings.
* July 1968: '''R-790''' defined the identification markings.
* January 1970: '''R-1161''' made recommendations about corner fittings.
* October 1970: '''R-1897''' set out the minimum internal dimensions of general purpose freight containers.

Based on these standards, the first [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] container ship was the Japanese ''[[:de:Hakone Maru]]'' from shipowner NYK, who started sailing in 1968 and could carry 752 TEU containers.

In the United States, containerization and other advances in shipping were impeded by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC), which was created in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to [[regulatory capture]]. By the 1960s, ICC approval was required before any shipper could carry different items in the same vehicle or change rates. The fully integrated systems in the United States today became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Postrel |first =Virginia |title =The Box that Changed the World | work =Dynamist.com | date =2006-03-23 | url =http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/archives/002097.html | accessdate =2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double-stack rail transport|Double-stacked rail transport]], where containers are stacked two high on railway cars, was introduced in the United States. The concept was developed by Sea-Land and the Southern Pacific railroad. The first standalone double-stack container car (or single-unit 40-ft COFC well car) was delivered in July 1977. The 5-unit well car, the industry standard, appeared for the first time in 1981. Initially, these double-stack railway cars were deployed in regular train service. Ever since American President Lines initiated in 1984 a dedicated double-stack container train service between Los Angeles and Chicago, transport volumes increased rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Effects ===
[[File:Shanghai Express Port of Rotterdam 17-Apr-2006.jpg|thumb|''Shanghai Express'', [[Port of Rotterdam]]]]

Containerization greatly reduced the expense of [[international trade]] and increased its speed, especially of consumer goods and commodities. It also dramatically changed the character of port cities worldwide. Prior to highly mechanized container transfers, crews of 20–22 [[longshoremen]] would pack individual cargoes into the hold of a ship. After containerization, large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.

Meanwhile, the port facilities needed to support containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports and the rise of others. At the [[Port of San Francisco]], the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring [[port of Oakland]] emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|ports of Manhattan and New Jersey]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[Port of London]] and [[Port of Liverpool]] declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's [[Port of Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Rotterdam]] in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, [[inland port]]s on waterways incapable of deep-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of [[seaport]]s. With intermodal containers, the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.

The effects of containerization rapidly spread beyond the shipping industry. Containers were quickly adopted by trucking and rail transport industries for cargo transport not involving sea transport. Manufacturing also evolved to adapt to take advantage of containers. Companies that once sent small consignments began grouping them into containers. Many cargoes are now designed to fit precisely into containers. The reliability of containers also made [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just in time manufacturing]] possible as component suppliers could deliver specific components on regular fixed schedules.

=== Twenty-first century ===
[[File:Maersk Virginia, Fremantle, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|''Maersk Virginia'' departing from [[Fremantle Harbour|Fremantle]], Australia]]

{{As of|2009}}, approximately 90% of non-[[bulk cargo]] worldwide is moved by containers stacked on transport ships;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ebeling | first = C. E. | title = Evolution of a Box | journal = Invention and Technology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 8–9 | date = Winter 2009 | issn = 8756-7296}}&lt;/ref&gt; 26% of all container [[transshipment]] is carried out in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.SHP.GOOD.TU |title=Container port traffic (TEU: 20 foot equivalent units) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009 there were 105,976,701 transshipments in China (both international and coastal, excluding Hong Kong), 21,040,096 in Hong Kong (which is listed separately), and only 34,299,572 in the United States. In 2005, some 18 million containers made over 200 million trips per year. Some ships can carry over {{TEU|14,500|first=yes}}, such as the ''[[Emma Mærsk]]'', {{convert|396|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, launched in August 2006. It has been predicted that, at some point, container ships will be constrained in size only by the depth of the [[Straits of Malacca]], one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, linking the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. This so-called [[Malaccamax]] size constrains a ship to dimensions of {{convert|470|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name="box"/&gt;

However, few initially foresaw the extent of the influence of containerization on the [[shipping industry]]. In the 1950s, Harvard University economist [[Benjamin Chinitz]] predicted that containerization would benefit New York by allowing it to ship its industrial goods more cheaply to the Southern United States than other areas, but he did not anticipate that containerization might make it cheaper to import such goods from abroad. Most economic studies of containerization merely assumed that shipping companies would begin to replace older forms of transportation with containerization, but did not predict that the process of containerization itself would have a more direct influence on the choice of producers and increase the total volume of trade.&lt;ref name="box"/&gt;

The widespread use of ISO standard containers has driven modifications in other freight-moving standards, gradually forcing removable truck bodies or [[swap body|swap bodies]] into standard sizes and shapes (though without the strength needed to be stacked), and changing completely the worldwide use of freight [[pallet]]s that fit into ISO containers or into commercial vehicles.

Improved cargo security is also an important benefit of containerization. Once the cargo is loaded into a container, it isn’t touched again until it reaches its destination. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courtesytransferinc.com/detroit-michigan-intermodal-transport-and-drayage/|title=Detroit, Michigan Intermodal Transport and Drayage {{!}} Courtesy Transfer Inc.|work=Courtesy Transfer Inc.|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when the doors are opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.

The use of the same basic sizes of containers across the globe has lessened the problems caused by incompatible [[rail gauge]] sizes in different countries.  The majority of the rail networks in the world operate on a {{RailGauge|sg}} gauge track known as [[standard gauge]], but many countries (such as Russia, India, Finland, and Lithuania) use [[broad gauge|broader gauges]], while many others in Africa and South America use [[narrow gauge|narrower gauges]] on their networks. The use of container trains in all these countries makes transshipment between different trains of different gauges easier.

Containers have become a popular way to [[Car shipping|ship private cars and other vehicles]] overseas using 20- or 40-foot containers. Unlike [[roll-on/roll-off]] vehicle shipping, personal effects can be loaded into the container with the vehicle, allowing for easy international relocation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Container standards ==

=== ISO standard ===
&lt;!-- Please do not change the above heading; if it has to be changed, then please change the huge number of links to Containerization#ISO_standard. --&gt;
{{Main article|Intermodal container}}

There are five common [[wikt:standardization|standard]] lengths:
*{{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|45|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|48|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|53|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}

US domestic standard containers are generally {{convert|48|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|53|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (rail and truck). Container capacity is often expressed in [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEU, or sometimes ''teu''). An equivalent unit is a measure of containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (length) × {{convert|8|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (width) container. As this is an approximate measure, the height of the box is not considered. For instance, the {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} ''high cube'' and the {{convert|4|ft|3|in|m|2|abbr=on}} ''half height'' {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} containers are also called one TEU. 48' containers have been phased out over the last ten years in favor of 53' containers.

The maximum gross mass for a {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} dry cargo container is {{convert|24,000|kg|abbr=on}}, and for a {{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} container (including the {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}} &lt;!-- {{convert|2.87|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=or}} --&gt; high cube) it is {{convert|30,480|kg|abbr=on}}. Allowing for the [[tare weight|tare mass]] of the container, the maximum payload mass is therefore reduced to approximately {{convert|22,000|kg|abbr=on}} for {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|27,000|kg|abbr=on}} for {{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emase.co.uk/data/cont.html |title=Shipping containers |publisher=Emase |accessdate=2007-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143514/http://emase.co.uk/data/cont.html |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original choice of {{convert|8|ft|m|2|adj=on}} height for ISO containers was made in part to suit a large proportion of railway tunnels, though some had to be modified.  The current standard is {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m|2|spell=in}} high. With the arrival of even taller hi-cube containers at {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|spell=in}} and [[Double-stack rail transport|double stacking]] rail cars, further enlargement of the rail [[loading gauge]] is proving necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railwaysafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3493&amp;Itemid=36|title=Railways Africa|first=Railways|last=Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air freight containers ===

While major airlines use containers that are custom designed for their aircraft and associated ground handling equipment the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] has created a set of standard aluminium container sizes of up to {{convert|11.52|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in volume.

== Container loading ==

=== Full container load ===
{{Main article|Largest domestic 53 foot container companies (fleet size)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
A full container load (FCL) is an [[ISO standard]] container that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, it means that the whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower [[freight rate]]s than an equivalent weight of [[cargo]] in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on [[ocean freight]] does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.

=== Less-than-container load ===
{{See also|less-than-carload}}
Less-than-container load (LCL) is a [[shipment]] that is not large enough to fill a standard [[cargo container]]. The abbreviation LCL formerly applied to "less than (railway) car load" for quantities of material from different shippers or for delivery to different destinations carried in a single [[Railway carriage|railway car]] for efficiency. LCL freight was often sorted and redistributed into different railway cars at intermediate [[railway terminal]]s en route to the final destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=This Fascinating Railroad Business |author=Henry, Robert Selph|authorlink=Robert Selph Henry |publisher=The Bobs-Merrill Company |year=1942 |pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCL is "a quantity of [[cargo]] less than that required for the application of a carload rate. A quantity of cargo less than that fills the visible or rated capacity of an inter-modal container."{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} It can also be defined as "a consignment of cargo which is inefficient to fill a shipping container. It is grouped with other consignments for the same destination in a container at a container [[freight station]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knownet.hhs.gov/log/transDR/Glossary/definitions.htm |title=The Federal Logistics SuperSite&amp;nbsp;– The Federal Transportation Management Desk Reference: Glossary&amp;nbsp;– Definitions |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031151651/http://www.knownet.hhs.gov/log/transDR/Glossary/definitions.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2004 }}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Hazards ===
Containers have been used to smuggle [[contraband]]. The vast majority of containers are never subjected to scrutiny due to the large number of containers in use. In recent years there have been increased concerns that containers might be used to transport [[terrorist]]s or terrorist materials into a country undetected.  The US government has advanced the [[Container Security Initiative]] (CSI), intended to ensure that high-risk cargo is examined or scanned, preferably at the port of departure.

=== Empty containers ===
Containers are intended to be used constantly, being loaded with new cargo for a new destination soon after having been emptied of previous cargo. This is not always possible, and in some cases, the cost of transporting an empty container to a place where it can be used is considered to be higher than the worth of the used container. [[Shipping line]]s and container leasing companies have become expert at repositioning empty containers from areas of low or no demand, such as the US West Coast, to areas of high demand, such as China. Repositioning within the port hinterland has also been the focus of recent logistics optimization work. However, damaged or retired containers may also be recycled in the form of [[shipping container architecture]], or the steel content salvaged. In the summer of 2010, a worldwide shortage of containers developed as shipping increased after the recession, while new container production had largely ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thu, Aug 19, 2010 @ 05:03 PM |url=http://www.universalcargo.com/blog/bid/49979/Shipping-Container-Shortage-Pushing-Up-Prices |title=Shipping Container Shortage Pushing Up Prices |publisher=Universalcargo.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[MV Rena]] ran aground off the coast of New Zealand. As the ship listed, some containers were lost, while others were held on board at a precarious angle.

=== Trade union challenges ===
Some of the biggest battles in the container revolution were waged in Washington, D.C.. Intermodal shipping got a huge boost in the early 1970s, when carriers won permission to quote combined rail-ocean rates. Later, non-vessel-operating [[common carrier]]s won a long court battle with a US Supreme Court decision against contracts that attempted to require that union labor be used for stuffing and stripping containers at off-pier locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/854/854.F2d.1338.82-1347.87-1370.html |title=854 F.2d 1338, 129 L.R.R.M.

== Other uses for containers ==
[[File:Container wendy house.JPG|thumb|upright|A converted container used as an office at a building site]]

[[Shipping container architecture]] is the use of containers as the basis for housing and other functional buildings for people, either as temporary or permanent housing, and either as a main building or as a cabin or workshop. Containers can also be used as sheds or storage areas in industry and commerce.

Tempo Housing in Amsterdam stacks containers for individual housing units.

Containers are also beginning to be used to house computer data centers, although these are normally specialized containers.

There is now a high demand for containers to be converted in the domestic market to serve specific purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} As a result, a number of container-specific accessories have become available for a variety of applications, such as racking for archiving, lining/heating/lighting/powerpoints to create purpose-built secure offices, canteens and drying rooms, condensation control for furniture storage, and ramps for storage of heavier objects. Containers are also converted to provide equipment enclosures, pop-up cafes, exhibition stands, security huts, and more.

Public containerised transport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eubase.net/reports/PCT.html |title=Public Containerised Transport, ways to improve the efficiency and convenience of travel by intermodalizing automobiles |publisher=Nordic Communications Corporation |date=4 January 2013 |access-date=12 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314083116/http://www.eubase.net/reports/PCT.html |archive-date=14 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the concept, not yet implemented, of modifying motor vehicles to serve as personal containers in non-road passenger transport.

The ACTS roller container standards have become the basis of [[roller container#Containerized firefighting equipment|containerized firefighting equipment]] throughout Europe.

In May 2016 Canada officially removed its objector status to UNDRIP, almost a decade after it was adopted by the General Assembly. By now the other 3 objectors have to varying degrees, also turned their votes.

While as a General Assembly Declaration it is not a legally binding instrument under [[international law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413164920/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to a UN press release it does "represent the dynamic development of international legal norms and it reflects the commitment of the UN's member states to move in certain directions"; the UN describes it as setting "an important standard for the treatment of [[indigenous people]]s that will undoubtedly be a significant tool toward eliminating [[human rights violations]] against the planet's 370 million indigenous people, and assisting them in combating [[discrimination]] and [[marginalisation]]."

UNDRIP codifies "Indigenous historical grievances, contemporary challenges and socio-economic, political and cultural aspirations" and is the "culmination of generations-long efforts by Indigenous organizations to get international attention, to secure recognition for their aspirations, and to generate support for their political agendas."&lt;ref name="Coates_2013" /&gt; Canada Research Chair and faculty member at the [[University of Saskatchewan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferguson |first=Mark |url=http://news.usask.ca/2011/10/12/canada-research-chairs-announced/ |title=News |publisher=News.usask.ca |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925080146/http://news.usask.ca/2011/10/12/canada-research-chairs-announced/ |archivedate=September 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uwaterloo.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971022152230/http://www.uwaterloo.ca/ |archivedate=October 22, 1997 |df=mdy-all }} University of Waterloo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Coates (historian)|Ken Coates]] argues that UNDRIP resonates powerfully with Indigenous peoples, while national governments have not yet fully understood its impact.&lt;ref name="Coates_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Coates|first=Ken|date=18 September 2013|publisher=The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI)|title=From aspiration to inspiration: UNDRIP finding deep traction in Indigenous communities|editor1=Ken Coates|editor2=Terry Mitchell|series=The Rise of the Fourth World|url=http://www.cigionline.org/blogs/aspiration-inspiration-undrip-finding-deep-traction-indigenous-communities|accessdate=20 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923083225/http://www.cigionline.org/blogs/aspiration-inspiration-undrip-finding-deep-traction-indigenous-communities|archivedate=September 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Due to the past and ongoing violence and abuse of Indigenous individuals and peoples, the UN created this non-legally binding declaration as an aspiration for how Indigenous individuals and peoples should be treated. The Declaration sets out the individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples, as well as their rights to culture, identity, language, employment, health, education and other issues. It also "emphasizes the rights of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations".&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf Frequently Asked Questions: Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413164920/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf |date=April 13, 2013 }} United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.&lt;/ref&gt; It "prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples", and it "promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them and their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own visions of economic and social development".&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23794&amp;Cr=indigenous&amp;Cr1= United Nations adopts Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313182426/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23794&amp;Cr=indigenous&amp;Cr1= |date=March 13, 2017 }} United Nations News Centre, 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Declaration is to encourage countries to work alongside indigenous peoples to solve global issues, like development, multicultural democracy and decentralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|accessdate=5 March 2012|author=United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115004932/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/FAQsindigenousdeclaration.pdf|archivedate=January 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Article 31, there is a major emphasis that the indigenous peoples will be able to protect their cultural heritage and other aspects of their culture and tradition in order to preserve their heritage from over controlling nation-states.

The elaboration of this Declaration had already been recommended by the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part II, paragraph 29&lt;/ref&gt;

This declaration is a resolution, meaning it is not a law bearing document. Indigenous people are not considered a country [nation - state] and do not have right to international law protection through the international court of justice. Article 40 states that Indigenous peoples have right to fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts and dispute with countries or other parties, because Indigenous people cannot use the International court of justice, UNDRIP has no indication of which judicial power indigenous peoples are to bring disputes to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/uphold-international-law/.|title=Uphold International Law|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006065208/http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/uphold-international-law/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The Declaration is structured as a [[United Nations resolution]], with 23 preambular clauses and 46 articles. In most articles, an aspiration for how the State should promote and protect the rights of indigenous people is included (see Provision for further explanation). Major themes of the articles include:
* Rights of self-determination of indigenous individuals and peoples (Articles 1 - 8; 33 -34)
** The difference is between the individual and people’s group
* Rights of indigenous individuals and people to protect their culture through practices, languages, education, media, and religion (Articles 9 - 15, 16, 25, and 31)
* Asserts the indigenous peoples’ right to own type of governance and to economic development (Articles 17 - 21, 35 -37)
* Health rights (Article 23 -24)
* Protection of subgroups ex. elderly, women, and children (Article 22)
* Land rights from ownership (including reparation, or return of land i.e. Article 10) to environmental issues (Articles 26 -30, and 32)
* Dictates how this document should be understood in future reference(Articles 38 - 46).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United Nations. General Assembly. ''United Nations Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples''. New York: United Nations, 2007. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provisions ===
The opening and Article 2 of the Declaration provide that “indigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples” (source). Besides asserting the rights that indigenous individuals and peoples’ have as other peoples, there are Articles (23 of the 46) pointing to how States should interact with the declaration. Most of the articles point to States working in conjunction with the indigenous peoples. Some measures countries are suggested to take are
* to return land (article 26), ceremonial objects (article 12), and human remains (article 12)
* To place “programmes for monitoring, maintaining, and restoring the health of indigenous peoples” (article 29 )
* To protect and uphold the rights of indigenous individuals and peoples (subpoint in many articles; see Declaration) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Declaration was over 25 years in the making. The idea originated in 1982 when the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) set up its [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] (WGIP), established as a result of a study by [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] [[José Ricardo Martínez Cobo]] on the problem of discrimination faced by indigenous peoples. Tasked with developing human rights standards that would protect indigenous peoples, in 1985 the Working Group began working on drafting the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The draft was finished in 1993 and was submitted to the [[Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]], which gave its approval the following year. During this the [[International Labour Organization]] adopted the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].

The Draft Declaration was then referred to the [[Commission on Human Rights]], which established another Working Group to examine its terms. Over the following years this Working Group met on 11 occasions to examine and fine-tune the Draft Declaration and its provisions. Progress was slow because of certain states' concerns regarding some key provisions of the Declaration, such as indigenous peoples' [[right to self-determination]] and the control over natural resources existing on indigenous peoples' traditional lands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/declaration.html Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Adopted by the Human Rights Council on 29 June 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120122457/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/declaration.html |date=January 20, 2012 }} United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;
The final version of the Declaration was adopted on 29 June 2006 by the 47-member [[Human Rights Council]] (the successor body to the Commission on Human Rights), with 30 member states in favour, 2 against, 12 abstentions, and 3 absentees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19056&amp;Cr=rights&amp;Cr1=council UN Human Rights Council adopts documents on disappearances and indigenous peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913135207/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19056&amp;Cr=rights&amp;Cr1=council |date=September 13, 2017 }} United Nations News Centre, 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration (document A/61/L.67) was then referred to the General Assembly, which voted on the adoption of the proposal on 13 September 2007 during its 61st regular session.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6993776.stm Indigenous rights outlined by UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928081940/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6993776.stm |date=September 28, 2013 }} BBC News, 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

''Against'': Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States.
All four member states that voted against have their origins as [[British Empire|colonies]] of the United Kingdom, and have large non-indigenous immigrant majorities and thriving indigenous populations. Since then, all four countries have moved to endorse the declaration in some informal way in which it would not actually become binding law pleadable in court. Canada, under a Conservative Party leadership made official public statements against the application of the UN DRIP in Canada, e.g.
: "Indian Affairs Minister [[Jim Prentice]] has stated publicly that the Declaration conflicts with the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] but has never substantiated this extraordinary claim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kairoscanada.org/dignity-rights/indigenous-rights/undrip/canadas-opposition-to-undrip/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130185813/http://www.kairoscanada.org/dignity-rights/indigenous-rights/undrip/canadas-opposition-to-undrip/ |archivedate=November 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

However, the Liberal Government elected to leadership in 2015, has unequivocally indicated Canada's support for the UN DRIP and is working on amending Canada's laws accordingly.

Australian government interventions have been challenged under its terms without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1233/22PRLPJ247.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234111/http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1233/22PRLPJ247.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
===Support and compromises ===
In contrast to the Declaration's initial rejection by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States over legal concerns (all 4 countries later switched their positions to accepting the declaration as a non-legally-binding document), United Nations officials and other world leaders expressed pleasure at its adoption. [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] described it as a "historic moment when UN Member States and indigenous peoples have reconciled with their painful histories and are resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights, justice and development for all." [[Louise Arbour]], a former justice of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] then serving as the UN's [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], expressed satisfaction at the hard work and perseverance that had finally "borne fruit in the most comprehensive statement to date of indigenous peoples' rights."&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt; Similarly, news of the Declaration's adoption was greeted with jubilation in Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200709131047.html Africa: Jubilation as UN Approves Indigenous Peoples Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215212/http://allafrica.com/stories/200709131047.html |date=September 26, 2007 }} AllAfrica.com, 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and, present at the General Assembly session in New York, [[Bolivia]]n [[foreign minister]] [[David Choquehuanca]] said that he hoped the member states that had voted against or abstained would reconsider their refusal to support a document he described as being as important as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/448939.html Aprueba ONU declaración de derechos indígenas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306055618/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/448939.html |date=March 6, 2008 }} ''El Universal,'' 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia has become the first country to approve the U.N. declaration of indigenous rights. [[Evo Morales]], [[President of Bolivia]], stated, "We are the first country to turn this declaration into a law and that is important, brothers and sisters. We recognize and salute the work of our representatives. But if we were to remember the indigenous fight clearly, many of us who are sensitive would end up crying in remembering the discrimination, the scorn."

[[Stephen Corry]], Director of the international indigenous rights organization [[Survival International]], said, "The declaration has been debated for nearly a quarter century. Years which have seen many tribal peoples, such as the [[Akuntsu]] and [[Kanoê]] in Brazil, decimated and others, such as the [[Innu]] in Canada, brought to the edge. Governments that oppose it are shamefully fighting against the human rights of their most vulnerable peoples. Claims they make to support human rights in other areas will be seen as hypocritical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/2499|title=After 22 years, UN votes on indigenous peoples declaration|author=Survival International|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429234520/http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/2499|archivedate=April 29, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism, defiance and "aspirational" nullification ===
Prior to the adoption of the Declaration, and throughout the 62nd session of the General Assembly, a number of countries expressed concern about some key issues, such as [[self-determination]], access to lands, territories and resources and the lack of a clear definition of the term "indigenous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Z-FzCJ6-Y&amp;list=PL5049A0699834E460|title=Video Discussions on the Indigenous Peoples Rights Declaration|publisher=sommerfilms – Rebecca Sommer|date=|accessdate=26 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181048/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Z-FzCJ6-Y&amp;list=PL5049A0699834E460|archivedate=February 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to those intending to vote against the adoption of the declaration, a group of African countries represented by [[Namibia]] proposed to defer action, to hold further consultations, and to conclude consideration of the declaration by September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Joins Australia and New Zealand in Criticizing Proposed Declaration on Indigenous Peoples' Rights" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 101, No. 1 (January 2007), pp.211–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration, a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level.

The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, all four opposing countries have since then changed their vote in favour of the Declaration.

====Australia====
Australia's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007, but has since endorsed the Declaration. Australia's [[Mal Brough]], [[Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]], referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples' customary legal systems, said that "There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

[[Marise Payne]], [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[New South Wales]], further elaborated on the Australian government's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the [[Australian Senate]]:&lt;ref name="Matters"&gt;[http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb//view_document.aspx?TABLE=HANSARDS&amp;ID=2481341 Matters of Urgency: United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524190121/http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=2481341&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS |date=May 24, 2011 }} Senate Hansards, 10 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Concerns about references to self-determination and their potential to be misconstrued.
*Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources. "They seem, to many readers, to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties."&lt;ref name="Matters" /&gt;
*Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law.
*The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them, "which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state, which would include national laws and other administrative measures."&lt;ref name="Matters" /&gt;
*The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual, real and cultural property, that "does not acknowledge the rights of third parties – in particular, their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law."&lt;ref name="Matters" /&gt; Furthermore, that the Declaration "fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard."&lt;ref name="Matters" /&gt;
*Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law, and that this may "permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board",&lt;ref name="Matters" /&gt; such as customary corporal and capital punishments.

In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected. He said that the distinctiveness of people's identity and their rights to preserve their heritage should be acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7039823.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Asia-Pacific – Howard vows Aborigine rights vote|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013004854/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7039823.stm|archivedate=October 13, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2009, the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]] formally endorsed the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30382 Experts hail Australia’s backing of UN declaration of indigenous peoples’ rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011233542/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30382 |date=October 11, 2017 }}, UN News Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
The Canadian government said that while it supported the "spirit" of the declaration, it contained elements that were "fundamentally incompatible with [[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitutional framework]]",&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; which includes both the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]], which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights. In particular, the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 (which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy), and Articles 26 and 28 (which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=eec0b550-e95a-492b-8801-6ede20a2d35e|title=Factbox: What is the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples?|newspaper=National Post|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=25 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102195634/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=eec0b550-e95a-492b-8801-6ede20a2d35e|archivedate=November 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] [[Chuck Strahl]] described the document as "unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=23df9769-3423-4f43-b828-a755725c2719&amp;k=23677|title=Native rights declaration inconsistent with legal tradition: Strahl|newspaper=National Post|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=25 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011071636/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=23df9769-3423-4f43-b828-a755725c2719&amp;k=23677|archivedate=October 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strahl elaborated, saying "In Canada, you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights, and (this) document ... has none of that. By signing on, you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the [[First Nations]]. And, of course, in Canada, that's inconsistent with our constitution." He gave an example: "In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because (native rights) don't trump all other rights in the country. You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years, and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=5a03839b-6ee5-4391-8cd8-fe9338ac7baf|title=Tories defend 'no' in native rights vote|newspaper=Canwest News Service|date=14 September 2007|accessdate=25 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307021048/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=5a03839b-6ee5-4391-8cd8-fe9338ac7baf|archivedate=March 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assembly of First Nations]] passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Evo Morales]] to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, calling the two heads of state "visionary leaders" and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations [[Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.handsoffvenezuela.org/canadian_indigenous_leaders_invite_chavez.htm|first=Jorge|last=Barrera|title=AFN plans to invite "visionary" Chavez to visit Canada|newspaper=Canwest News Service|date=7 Feb 2008|accessdate=25 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522075415/http://www.handsoffvenezuela.org/canadian_indigenous_leaders_invite_chavez.htm|archivedate=May 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2010, in the [[Speech from the throne|Speech From the Throne]], the [[Governor General of Canada]] announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration. "We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage. A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada’s Constitution and laws."

On 12 November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration but without changing its position that it was 'aspirational'.&lt;ref name="Canada_IPIR_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=52:north-america-indigenous-peoples&amp;id=7509:canada-canada-endorses-the-united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples |title=Canada: Canada Endorses The United Nations Declaration On The Rights Of Indigenous Peoples |publisher=IPIR |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617031434/http://indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=52:north-america-indigenous-peoples&amp;id=7509:canada-canada-endorses-the-united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples |archivedate=June 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anishinabek]] spiritual leader, Chief [[William Commanda]] (1908-3 August 2011) was honoured at the 21st annual week-long [[First Peoples' Festival]] held in Montreal from 2–9 August 2011, celebrating Canada's 2010 adoption of the U.

In 2015, [[Romeo Saganash]] (a [[Cree]] Member of Parliament for [[Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou]]) sponsored [[Private Member's Bill]] C-641, the "United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act", which would have required the Canadian government to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with UNDRIP but it was defeated on May 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-2/C-641/ Bill C-641 (Historical) United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202035651/https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-2/C-641/ |date=February 2, 2016 }}, openparliament.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2015 in an open letter to provincial cabinet members, [[Premier of Alberta]] [[Rachel Notley]] asked each minister to conduct a review of their policies, programs, and legislation that might require changes based on the principles of the UN Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://indigenous.alberta.ca/QandA-UN-Declaration.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In December of 2015, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] listed ratifying UNDRIP as one of its national "calls to action" in its final report.

In 2016, Canada officially adopted and promised to implement the declaration fully. Speaking at the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues|UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]], [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada]] minister Carolyn Bennett announced, "We are now a full supporter of the declaration, without qualification.

The federal government pledged on 21 June 2017 to rename its [[National Aboriginal Day]] to be consistent with the terminology used by the Declaration.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Kathleen|title=Trudeau marks National Aboriginal Day with pledge to build relations, rename day|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-aboriginal-indigenous-day-1.4170695|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=CBC News|date=21 June 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622033724/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-aboriginal-indigenous-day-1.4170695|archivedate=June 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[British Columbia]] provincial government announced that it will govern in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://energeticcity.ca/2017/09/b-c-government-adopts-un-declaration-rights-indigenous-peoples/ |title=B.C. government adopts UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples |last=Newton |first=Chris |date=September 6, 2017 |website=energeticcity.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907162553/https://energeticcity.ca/2017/09/b-c-government-adopts-un-declaration-rights-indigenous-peoples/ |archivedate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
[[File:NZ delegation UN Forum on Indigenous Issues.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand delegation at the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. New Zealand endorsed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010.]]
In 2007 New Zealand's [[Minister of Māori Affairs]] [[Parekura Horomia]] described the Declaration as "toothless", and said, "There are four provisions we have problems with, which make the declaration fundamentally incompatible with New Zealand's constitutional and legal arrangements." Article 26 in particular, he said, "appears to require recognition of rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens, both indigenous and non-indigenous. This ignores contemporary reality and would be impossible to implement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0709/S00272.htm Māori Party’s head in the clouds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013049/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0709/S00272.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }} New Zealand government press release, via [[scoop.co.nz]], 14 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, [[Māori Party]] leader [[Pita Sharples]] said it was "shameful to the extreme that New Zealand voted against the outlawing of discrimination against indigenous people; voted against justice, dignity and fundamental freedoms for all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4202223a8153.html |title=NZ indigenous rights stance 'shameful' – Maori Party |date=14 September 2007 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=New Zealand |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2009, the [[New Zealand government]] announced that it would support the Declaration; this, however, appeared to be a premature announcement by [[Pita Sharples]], the current Minister of Māori Affairs, as the New Zealand government cautiously backtracked on Sharples' July announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/2570689/Government-to-endorse-UN-indigenous-rights-declaration |title=Government to endorse UN indigenous rights declaration |work=Stuff |location=New Zealand |date=7 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 19 April 2010, Sharples announced New Zealand's support of the declaration at a speech in New York.&lt;ref name="NZ support"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3599153/NZ-does-U-turn-on-rights-charter|title=NZ does U-turn on rights charter |date=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4850:new-zealand-statement-on-adoption-of-declaration-at-un-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues&amp;catid=58:oceania-indigenous-peoples&amp;Itemid=80 New Zealand Statement Before 9th Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908110951/http://indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4850%3Anew-zealand-statement-on-adoption-of-declaration-at-un-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues&amp;catid=58%3Aoceania-indigenous-peoples&amp;Itemid=80 |date=September 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Speaking for the United States mission to the UN, spokesman Benjamin Chang said, "What was done today is not clear. The way it stands now is subject to multiple interpretations and doesn't establish a clear universal principle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/13/news/UN-GEN-UN-Indigenous-Peoples.php UN adopts declaration on rights for indigenous peoples worldwide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916145638/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/13/news/UN-GEN-UN-Indigenous-Peoples.php |date=September 16, 2007 }} ''International Herald Tribune,'' 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. mission also issued a floor document, "Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples", setting out its objections to the Declaration. Most of these are based on the same points as the three other countries' rejections but, in addition, the United States drew attention to the Declaration's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term "indigenous peoples" is intended to cover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070612010029/http://www.un.int/usa/press_releases/20070913_204.html Explanation of vote on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] United States Mission to the United Nations press release, 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2010, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] declared that the United States would "lend its support" to the Declaration. The decision was announced during the second White House Tribal Nations Conference, where he said he is "working hard to live up to" the name that was given to him by the Crow Nation: "One Who Helps People Throughout the Land." Obama has told Native American leaders that he wants to improve the "nation-to-nation" relationship between the United States and the tribes and repair broken promises. Today, there are more than 560 Indian tribes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/xraca/documents/text/idc1-021809.pdf Federal Register, Volume 78, Number 87 dated May 6, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019173349/http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/xraca/documents/text/idc1-021809.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }} ({{Federal Register|78|26384}})&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States that are recognized [[List of federally recognized tribes by state|at the federal level]], with [[State recognized tribes in the United States|some sixty-plus tribes recognized at the state level]]. Many had representatives at the White House conference and applauded Obama's announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121603136.html |title=U.S. will sign U.N. declaration on rights of native people, Obama tells tribes |work=The Washington Post |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111180610/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121603136.html |archivedate=November 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration's decision came after three consultation meetings with Native Americans and more than 3,000 written comments on the subject.&lt;ref name=USSupport&gt;{{Citation| last = U.S. Department of State| title = Announcement of U.S. Support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples| accessdate = 2015-03-19| date = 2010-12-16| url = https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/184099.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150218235610/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/184099.pdf| archivedate = February 18, 2015| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support of the government also included several interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration. In the view of the United States government, the Declaration advances "a new and distinct international concept of [[self-determination]] specific to indigenous peoples," which is not the same as the existing concept in international law.&lt;ref name=USSupport /&gt; The statement also interprets free, prior, and informed consent, "which the United States understands to call for a process of meaningful consultation with tribal leaders, but not necessarily the agreement of those leaders, before the actions addressed in those consultations are taken."&lt;ref name=USSupport /&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom government, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, [[Karen Pierce]], "emphasized that the Declaration was non-legally binding and did not propose to have any retroactive application on historical episodes. National minority groups and other ethnic groups within the territory of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories did not fall within the scope of the indigenous peoples to which the Declaration applied."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10612.doc.htm GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS DECLARATION ON RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925040218/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10612.doc.htm |date=September 25, 2014 }} at www.un.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK position was also clearly intended to prevent formal appeal of Canadian decisions to UK courts: Canadian indigenous peoples never accepted the 1982 constitution in which such appeal (regarding early treaties made with the Crown of the British Empire) was cut off. Under the prior 1867 constitution, 1920s Dominion of Canada and earlier law, which continue to apply to these peoples and treaties, the UN DRIP could have been pleaded in a UK court in conflicts between treaty and Canadian law. Calls to pursue this approach have been common among Canadian natives.

====Finland====
Finland signed the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it was originally put forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=voting&amp;index=.VM&amp;term=ares61295 |title=UNBISnet |publisher=Unbisnet.un.org:8080 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106220245/http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=voting&amp;index=.VM&amp;term=ares61295 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples/DeclarationontheRightsofIndigenousPeoples.aspx |title=Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples |publisher=Social.un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623070256/http://social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples/DeclarationontheRightsofIndigenousPeoples.aspx |archivedate=June 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the reindeer owners and Forest Administration ([[Metsähallitus]]) have a long dispute in the area of the forests.&lt;ref&gt;YK pyysi säästämään Nellimen porot HS 27.9.2011 A6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|UN Human Rights Committee]] ordered the Finnish State to stop logging in some of the disputed areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Abstentions===

====Ukraine====
Ukraine, which initially abstained from adopting the Declaration, changed its approach to indigenous issues in response to the recent [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]], asserting that [[Crimean Tatars]] are an Indigenous people. In May 2014, the country formally endorsed the UNDRIP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccrimea.org/reports/dont-cry-ukraina.html Don't Cry for Us Ukraina! (Ukraine)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625095340/http://www.iccrimea.org/reports/dont-cry-ukraina.html |date=June 25, 2016 }}, International Committee for Crimea, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific Island states====
Ten UN member states in the Pacific, all with indigenous majorities, were absent from the assembly at the time of the vote: [[Fiji]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vanuatu]]. It is unclear whether this represents the equivalent of deliberate abstention, or whether the country delegations were absent for some other reason. The constitutions of these states typically make mention of "indigenous inhabitants" and accommodate customary laws in at least part of their modern legal systems. The constitution of [[Law of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], for example, has an explanatory section on the "[[Law of Papua New Guinea#underlying law|underlying law]]" being based on custom, while Sch.1.2. says that "custom" means "the customs and usages of ''indigenous inhabitants'' of the country ..." (emphasis added). It may be the case, therefore, that the governments of these states took the position that their own legal systems offered sufficient protection to their own indigenous peoples. There has been no suggestion at any time since decolonisation commenced in the 1960s and the present that indigenous people are absent from any of the ten countries.

Nonetheless, [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]] are among countries in this group plagued by [[land grabbing]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/pacific-land-grab-among-worlds-worst-says-expert/1260668 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916152259/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/pacific-land-grab-among-worlds-worst-says-expert/1260668 |archivedate=September 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} Pacific land grab among worlds worst says expert, ABC Radio Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have warned that as much as 12% of the land surface of Papua New Guinea has been leased without informed consultation and consent from landowners, typically suppressing customary rights for 99 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/our-land-modern-land-grabs-reversing-independence-papua-new-guinea |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203171800/https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/our-land-modern-land-grabs-reversing-independence-papua-new-guinea |archivedate=February 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}, On Our Land: Modern Land Grabs Reversing Independence in Papua New Guinea, Oakland Institute 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Given that land grabbing was recently ruled to lie within the remit of the [[International Criminal Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2016/09/19/international-criminal-court-extends-remit-to-land-grabbing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162106/http://www.scottishlegal.com/2016/09/19/international-criminal-court-extends-remit-to-land-grabbing/ |archivedate=February 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}, International Criminal Court extends remit to land grabbing, Scottish Legal News,19 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; it is a reasonable conclusion that legal systems in the Pacific, unsupported by UNDRIP, have insufficient built-in safeguards for the protection of indigenous rights.

There are also significant implications in the extractive sector for these states not having signed UNDRIP. Mining companies that are members of the [[International Council on Mining and Metals]] commit to respect the ICMM's [http://www.icmm.com/en-gb/members/member-commitments/position-statements/indigenous-peoples-and-mining-position-statement position statement on indigenous peoples]. However, ambiguity surrounds how or if member companies recognise when they are dealing with indigenous peoples. For example, [[Barrick Gold]] lists only its operations in North and South America as lying on indigenous land, yet operates in Fiji and Papua New Guinea (where a subsidiary has operated the [[Porgera Gold Mine|Porgera gold mine]] since 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barrick.com/responsibility/society/communities/indigenous-peoples/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162936/http://www.barrick.com/responsibility/society/communities/indigenous-peoples/default.aspx |archivedate=February 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}, Barrick Gold, "Indigenous Peoples", accessed 3 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Another member, [[Newmont Mining Corporation|Newmont Mining]], said in its 2011 Sustainability Report&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120705201621/http://www.beyondthemine.com/2011/community_relationships/indigenous_peoples], Beyond the Mine: the journey towards sustainability, 2011 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; that it had been conducting mining exploration in Papua New Guinea for three years, yet its disclosures do not show how activities in this country may have followed the ICMM's [http://www.icmm.com/en-gb/publications/mining-and-communities/indigenous-peoples-and-mining-good-practice-guide Indigenous Peoples and Mining Good Practice Guide], first published in 2010.

The '''Department of Agriculture and Aquaculture''' in the [[Canada|Canadian]] Province of [[New Brunswick]] was formed when [[Shawn Graham]] became [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier]] on October 3, 2006. He split the departments, introducing a Bill On March 2, 2007 disbanding the [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture (New Brunswick)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture]] and creating the Department of Agriculture and Aquaculture and a separate [[Department of Fisheries (New Brunswick)|Department of Fisheries]]. Once it received [[Royal Assent]], the Bill was retroactive to October 3, 2006.

The first Department of Agriculture was created in 1882 by the government of then Premier [[Daniel Lionel Hanington|Daniel Hanington]].

The '''Electoral Reform Society''' ('''ERS''') is a political [[pressure group]] based in the [[United Kingdom]] which promotes [[electoral reform]]. It seeks to replace the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system with one of [[proportional representation]], advocating the [[single transferable vote]]. It is the world's oldest operating organisation concerned with political and electoral reform.

==Overview==

The Electoral Reform Society seeks a "representative democracy fit for the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/what-we-stand-for/|title=What we stand for|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society advocates the replacement of the [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[Plurality-at-large voting|plurality-at-large]] voting systems with a proportional voting system, the [[single transferable vote]]. First-past-the-post is currently used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|elections to the House of Commons]] and for most local elections in England and Wales, while plurality-at-large is used in multi-member council wards in England and Wales, and was historically used in the multi-member parliamentary constituencies before their abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunleavy|first1=Patrick|last2=Travers|first2=Tony|last3=Gilson|first3=Chris|title=The LSE’s simple guide to UK voting systems|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-lses-simple-guide-to-uk-voting-systems/|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also campaigns for improvements to public elections and representative democracy, and is a regular commentator on all aspects of representation, public participation and democratic governance in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The ERS was founded in January 1884 as the Proportional Representation Society by the Victorian naturalist, archaeologist and polymath [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]]. The founding members included academics, [[barrister]]s, and an equal number of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party UK|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s. Famous early members included Charles Dodgson (better known as [[Lewis Carroll]]), [[C.P. Scott]], editor of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and [[Thomas Hare (political scientist)|Thomas Hare]], inventor of the Single Transferable Vote. Alongside its sister organisation, [[Proportional Representation Society of Ireland]], the Society succeeded in getting STV introduced in local and then national elections in [[Ireland]], and in numerous religious, educational and professional organisations.

A PRS pamphlet of the 1920s described the organisation's aims thus:
1. to reproduce the opinions of the electors in parliament and other public bodies in their true proportions
2. to secure the majority of electors shall rule and all other considerable minorities shall be heard
3. to give electors a wider freedom in the choice of representation
4. to give representative greater independence by freeing them from the pressure of sectional interests (perhaps party discipline and back-room deals were meant]
5. to ensure to parties representation by their ablest and most trusted members.&lt;ref&gt;The Influence of the Method of Election upon the Constitution of Local Authorities, London: PRS, [1926]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] the Society suffered from financial problems and a lack of public appetite for reform. When [[Fianna Fáil]] put to a referendum a proposal to revert to [[first-past-the-post voting]] twice (1959 and 1968), the Society, under the leadership of [[Enid Lakeman]], led a successful campaign to keep the STV system in Ireland&lt;ref&gt;(Sinnott, Richard, 1999. ‘The electoral system’, pp. 99–126 in John Coakley and Michael Gallagher (eds), ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'', 3rd ed. London: Routledge and PSAI Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 STV was introduced in [[Northern Ireland]] for elections to local councils and to the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], and the Society and its staff were called upon to advise in the programme of education set up by the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] to raise public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/electoralsystem.htm|title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Introduction to the Electoral System in Northern Ireland|work=ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in [[proportional representation]] revived sharply in Britain after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]]. From then on the Society was able to secure a higher public profile for its campaigns. In 1983 the Society was recognised by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] as a [[Non-Governmental Organisation]] with Consultative Status.

==Activities==

The Society has campaigned successfully for the introduction of STV for local elections in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fairsharevoting.org/what.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204134245/http://www.fairsharevoting.org/what.htm | title=What is Fairshare? | archivedate=4 February 2012 | accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the call for a referendum on the voting system in the wake of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]] as part of the Vote for a Change campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament in crisis: When will MPs start to listen to the people?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/24/letters-mps-expenses|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding member of the [[Votes at 16|Votes at 16 Coalition]].

===AV referendum===

The Society was later a principal funder of the [[YES! To Fairer Votes]] campaign in the unsuccessful bid for a Yes vote in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Curtis |first1=Polly |last2=Kollewe |first2=Julia |title=AV referendum: full details of donations to yes and no campaigns |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/03/av-referendum-details-donations-yes-no-campaigns |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Chief Executive, [[Katie Ghose]], served as the campaign's chair.

===Police and crime commissioners===

In 2012, the Society criticised Government handling of its policy of elected [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s - which led to the [[England and Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections, 2012|lowest turnout in British peacetime history]].

In August 2012 the Society predicted turnout could be as low as 18.5% and outlined steps to salvage the elections, mobilising support from both candidates and voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Police and crime commissioner candidates warn of turnout |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19727952 |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government did not change tack, dubbing the prediction a "silly season story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beckford |first1=Martin |title= Turnout of 18% predicted for police commissioner election 'shambles' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9483006/Turnout-of-18-predicted-for-police-commissioner-election-shambles.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the result (in which the national turnout was a mere 15.1%, even lower than the Society's prediction), the Society branded the Government's approach to elections as a "comedy of errors", views that were reiterated by Shadow Home Secretary [[Yvette Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yvette Cooper MP |date=16 November 2012| url=http://www.labour.org.uk/police-and-crime-commissioner-elections-shambles | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125012141/http://www.labour.org.uk/police-and-crime-commissioner-elections-shambles | archivedate=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voter registration===

The Society led bids to change the Government's approach to introduction of Individual Electoral Registration, which the ''New Statesman'' dubbed "the biggest political scandal you've never heard of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hasan |first1=Mehdi |title= Electoral registration: the biggest political scandal you've never heard of |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/2011/10/electoral-registration-voters |work=New Statesman |location= London |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electoral Commission sources estimated as many as 10 million voters could disappear from the electoral roll under government plans, predominantly poor, young or black, and more liable to vote Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wintour |first1=Patrick |title= Shocked MPs told electoral plan could remove 10m voters |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/15/shocked-mps-electoral-register-shake-up |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society succeeded in securing changes to the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/an-important-victory-for-voters-but-no-time-for-complacency|title=An important victory for voters, but no time for complacency|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In a 2014 report the society recommended several ways to make the [[European Union]] more accountable and argues that there is a [[democratic deficit in the European Union|democratic deficit]].  These included: better scrutiny of EU legislation by the British parliament, a voting system which gives voters more influence over individual candidates (e.g. [[single transferable vote]]) and recruitment of party candidates with a wider ranges of views on the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/images/dynamicImages/file/Close%20the%20Gap%20FOR%20ONLINE%204.pdf Close the Gap — Tackling Europe's Democratic Deficit.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702034544/http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/images/dynamicImages/file/Close%20the%20Gap%20FOR%20ONLINE%204.pdf |date=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of 2016 EU referendum===
In August 2016 the Society published a highly critical report on the referendum and called for a review of how future events are run. Contrasting it very unfavourably with the 'well-informed grassroots' campaign for [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence]], Labour supporter Ghose described it as "dire" with “glaring democratic deficiencies” which left voters bewildered. Ghose noted a generally negative response to establishment figures with 29% of voters saying [[David Cameron]] (a Remain supporter) made them more likely to vote leave whilst only 14% said he made them want to vote remain. Looking ahead, the society called for an official organisation to highlight misleading claims and for [[Ofcom]] to define the role of broadcasters are expected to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/electoral-reform-campaigners-slam-dire-eu-referendum-debate|title=Electoral reform campaigners slam ‘dire’ EU referendum debate |work=Guardian newspapers|author=Rajeev Syal|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 gender analysis ===
{{Further|Women in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom#2017 election}}
In February 2018 the ERS reported that hundreds of seats were being effectively 'reserved' by men, holding back women’s representation. Their report states that 170 seats are being held by men first elected in 2005 or before – with few opportunities for women to take those seats or selections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Martin | first = George | title = Male MPs are ‘blocking’ the safe seats – forcing women to fight marginals | url = https://inews.co.uk/news/male-mps-seat-blocking-safe-constituencies-cost-female-politicians/ | work = [[i (newspaper)|i]] | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 16 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hundreds of seats effectively ‘reserved’ by men at Westminster, research shows | url = https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/media-centre/press-releases/hundreds-of-seats-effectively-reserved-by-men-at-westminster-research-shows/ | website = electoral-reform.org.uk | publisher = Electoral Reform Society | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financialization''' is a term sometimes used to describe the development of [[financial capitalism]] during the period from 1980 until 2010, in which [[Financial leverage|debt-to-equity ratios]] increased and [[financial markets|financial services]] accounted for an increasing share of [[national income]] relative to other sectors.

Financialization describes an economic process by which exchange is facilitated through the intermediation of [[financial instrument]]s. Financialization may permit real goods, services, and risks to be readily exchangeable for [[currency]], and thus make it easier for people to rationalize their assets and income flows.

==Specific academic approaches==
Various definitions, focusing on specific aspects and interpretations, have been used:
* Greta Krippner of the [[University of Michigan]] writes that financialization refers to a "pattern of [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] in which [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and [[Production (economics)|commodity production]]." In the introduction to the 2005 book ''Financialization and the World Economy'', editor Gerald A. Epstein wrote that some scholars have insisted on a much narrower use of the term: the ascendancy of [[shareholder value]] as a mode of [[corporate governance]], or the growing dominance of [[capital market]] financial systems over bank-based financial systems. Pierre-Yves Gomez and Harry Korine, in their 2008 book ''Entrepreneurs and Democracy: A Political Theory of Corporate Governance'', have identified a long-term trend in the evolution of corporate governance of large corporations and have shown that financialization is one step in this process.

*[[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] described financialization as "a lapse back into the pre-industrial [[usury]] and rent economy of European [[feudalism]]" in a 2003 interview:&lt;ref&gt;Standard Schaefer. [http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/08/29/who-benefited-from-the-tech-bubble-an-interview-with-michael-hudson Who Benefited from the Tech Bubble? an Interview with Michael Hudson]   ''CounterPunch'', August 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"only [[debt]]s grew exponentially, year after year, and they do so inexorably, even when—indeed, especially when—the economy slows down and its companies and people fall below break-even levels. As their debts grow, they siphon off the economic surplus for debt service (...) The problem is that the financial sector's receipts are not turned into fixed capital formation to increase output. They build up increasingly on the opposite side of the balance sheet, as new loans, that is, debts and new claims on society’s output and income.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Companies] are not able to invest in new physical capital equipment or buildings because they are obliged to use their operating revenue to pay their bankers and bondholders, as well as junk-bond holders. This is what I mean when I say that the economy is becoming financialized. Its aim is not to provide tangible capital formation or rising living standards, but to generate interest, financial fees for underwriting mergers and acquisitions, and capital gains that accrue mainly to insiders, headed by upper management and large financial institutions.  The upshot is that the traditional business cycle has been overshadowed by a secular increase in debt. Instead of labor earning more, hourly earnings have declined in real terms. There has been a drop in net disposable income after paying taxes and withholding "forced saving" for social Security and medical insurance, pension-fund contributions and–most serious of all–debt service on [[credit card]]s, [[bank loan]]s, [[mortgage loan]]s, [[student loan]]s, [[auto loan]]s, [[home insurance]] premiums, [[life insurance]], [[private medical insurance]] and other [[FIRE economy|FIRE-sector]] charges. ... This diverts spending away from goods and services.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Thomas Marois, looking at the big emerging markets, defines "emerging finance capitalism" as the current phase of accumulation, characterized by "the fusion of the interests of domestic and foreign financial capital in the state apparatus as the institutionalized priorities and overarching social logic guiding the actions of state managers and government elites, often to the detriment of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marois|first=Thomas|title=States, Banks and Crisis: Emerging Finance Capitalism in Mexico and Turkey|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|url=https://www.academia.edu/1457363/States_Banks_And_Crisis_Emerging_Finance_Capitalism_in_Mexico_and_Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Gerald A. Epstein" "Financialization refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international levels."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Epstein [http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/financial/fin_Epstein.pdf Financialization, Rentier Interests, and Central Bank Policy].  December, 2001 (this version, June, 2002 )&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financialization may be defined as "the increasing dominance of the finance industry in the sum total of economic activity, of financial controllers in the management of corporations, of financial assets among total assets, of marketised securities and particularly equities among financial assets, of the stock market as a market for corporate control in determining corporate strategies, and of fluctuations in the stock market as a determinant of business cycles" (Dore 2002).
* More popularly, however, financialization is understood to mean the vastly expanded role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and [[financial institution]]s in the operation of domestic and international economies.
* Sociological and political interpretations have also been made. In his 2006 book, ''[[American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century]]'', American writer and commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] presents financialization as "a process whereby financial services, broadly construed, take over the dominant economic, cultural, and political role in a national economy" (268). Phillips considers that the financialization of the US economy follows the same pattern that marked the beginning of the decline of [[Habsburg Spain]] in the 16th century, the [[Dutch trading empire]] in the 18th century, and the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century (it is also worth pointing out that the true final step in each of these historical economies was [[economic collapse|collapse]]):
::... the leading economic powers have followed an evolutionary progression: first, agriculture, fishing, and the like, next commerce and industry, and finally finance. Several historians have elaborated this point. Brooks Adams contended that "as societies consolidate, they pass through a profound intellectual change. Energy ceases to vent through the imagination and takes the form of capital."

Jean Cushen explores how the workplace outcomes associated with financialization render employees insecure and angry.&lt;ref&gt;Cushen, J. (2013). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368213000408 Financialization in the workplace: Hegemonic narratives, performative interventions and the angry knowledge worker]. ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'', Volume 38, Issue 4, May 2013, pp 314–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the American experience, increased financialization occurred concomitant with the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and the free-market doctrines of [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago School of Economics]] in the late Twentieth Century. Various academic economists of that period worked out ideological and theoretical rationalizations and analytical approaches to facilitate the increased [[deregulation]] of financial systems and banking.

In a 1998 article, [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] discussed previous economists who saw the problems that result from financialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hudson | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Hudson (economist) | title = Financial Capitalism v. Industrial Capitalism (Contribution to The Other Canon Conference on Production Capitalism vs. Financial Capitalism Oslo, September 3-4, 1998 ) | url = http://michael-hudson.com/1998/09/financial-capitalism-v-industrial-capitalism/ | date = September 1998 | access-date = March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems were identified by [[John A. Hobson]] (financialization enabled Britain's imperialism), [[Thorstein Veblen]] (it acts in opposition to rational engineers), [[Herbert Somerton Foxwell]] (Britain was not using finance for industry as well as Europe), and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] (Germany was surpassing Britain and the United States in banking that supports industry).

At the same 1998 conference in Oslo, [[Erik S. Reinert]] and Arno Mong Daastøl in "Production Capitalism vs. Financial Capitalism" provided an extensive bibliography on past writings, and prophetically asked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Reinert | first1 = Erik S. | last2 = Daastøl | first2 = Arno Mong | author-link1 = Erik S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the United States, probably more money has been made through the appreciation of real estate than in any other way. What are the long-term consequences if an increasing percentage of savings and wealth, as it now seems, is used to '''inflate the prices of already existing assets''' - real estate and stocks - instead of to create new production and innovation? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Financial turnover compared to gross domestic product==
Other financial markets exhibited similarly explosive growth. Trading in US equity (stock) markets grew from $136.0 billion (or 13.1% of US GDP) in 1970 to $1.671 trillion (or 28.8% of U.S. GDP) in 1990. In 2000, trading in US equity markets was $14.222 trillion (144.9% of GDP). Most of the growth in stock trading has been directly attributed to the introduction and spread of [[program trading]].

According to the [http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0703b.pdf March 2007 Quarterly Report from the Bank for International Settlements] (see page 24.):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trading on the international derivatives exchanges slowed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Combined turnover of interest rate, currency and stock index derivatives fell by 7% to $431 trillion between October and December 2006. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, derivatives trading—mostly [[futures contract]]s on interest rates, foreign currencies, Treasury bonds, and the like—had reached a level of $1,200 trillion, or $1.2 quadrillion, a year. By comparison, US GDP in 2006 was $12.456 trillion.

==Futures markets==
[[File:Futures Trading Composition.jpg|right]]
The data for turnover in the futures markets in 1970, 1980, and 1990 is based on the number of contracts traded, which is reported by the organized exchanges, such as the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New York Commodity Exchange, and compiled in data appendices of the Annual Reports of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The pie charts below show the dramatic shift in the types of futures contracts traded from 1970 to 2004.

For a century after organized futures exchanges were founded in the mid-19th century, all futures trading was solely based on agricultural commodities. But after the end of the gold-backed fixed-exchange rate system in 1971, contracts based on foreign currencies began to be traded. After the deregulation of interest rates by the Bank of England and then the US Federal Reserve in the late 1970s, futures contracts based on various bonds and interest rates began to be traded. The result was that financial futures contracts—based on such things as interest rates, currencies, or equity indices—came to dominate the futures markets.

The dollar value of turnover in the futures markets is found by multiplying the number of contracts traded by the average value per contract for 1978 to 1980, which was calculated in research by the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 1981. The figures for earlier years were estimated on computer-generated exponential fit of data from 1960 to 1970, with 1960 set at $165 billion, half the 1970 figure, on the basis of a graph accompanying the ACLI data, which showed that the number of futures contracts traded in 1961 and earlier years was about half the number traded in 1970.

According to the ALCI data, the average value of interest-rate contracts is around ten times that of agricultural and other commodities, while the average value of currency contracts is twice that of agricultural and other commodities. (Beginning in mid-1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange itself began to release figures of the nominal value of contracts traded at the CME each month. In November 1993, the CME boasted that it had set a new monthly record of 13.466 million contracts traded, representing a dollar value of $8.8 trillion. By late 1994, this monthly value had doubled. On January 3, 1995, the CME boasted that its total volume for 1994 had jumped by 54%, to 226.3 million contracts traded, worth nearly $200 trillion. Soon thereafter, the CME ceased to provide a figure for the dollar value of contracts traded.)

Futures contracts are a "contract to buy or sell a very common homogenous item at a future date for a specific price". The nominal value of a futures contract is wildly different from the risk involved in engaging in that contract. Consider two parties who engage in a contract to exchange 5,000 bushels of wheat at $8.89 per bushel on December 17, 2012. The nominal value of the contract would be $44,450 (5,000 bushels x $8.89). But what is the risk? For the buyer. the risk is that the seller will not be able to deliver the wheat on the stated date. This means the buyer must purchase the wheat from someone else; this is known as the "spot market". Assume that the spot price for wheat on December 17, 2012, is $10 per bushel. This means the cost of purchasing the wheat is $50,000 (5,000 bushels x $10). So the buyer would have lost $5,550 ($50,000 less $44,450), or the difference in the cost between the contract price and the spot price. Furthermore, futures are traded via exchanges, which guarantee that if one party reneges on its end of the bargain, (1) that party is blacklisted from entering into such contracts in the future and (2) the injured party is insured against the loss by the exchange. If the loss is so large that the exchange cannot cover it, then the members of the exchange make up the loss. Another mitigating factor to consider is that a commonly traded liquid asset, such as gold, wheat, or the S&amp;P 500 stock index, is extremely unlikely to have a future value of $0; thus the counter-party risk is limited to something substantially less than the nominal value.

==Economic effects==
[[Financial services]] (banking, insurance, investment, etc.) have become a key industry in developed economies, in which it represents a sizeable share of the [[GDP]] and an important source of employment. Those activities have also played a key role in facilitating [[economic globalization]]. In the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007-2010 financial crisis]], a number of economists and others began to argue that [[financial services]] had become too large a sector of the US economy, with no real benefit to society accruing from the activities of increased financialization. Some, such as former [[International Monetary Fund]] chief economist [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], went so far as to argue that the increased power and influence of the financial services sector had fundamentally transformed the American polity, endangering representative democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;Megan McCardle. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200905/imf-advice The Quiet Coup].  ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, white-collar criminologist and former senior financial regulator [[William K. Black]] listed the ways in which the financial sector harms the real economy. Black wrote, "The financial sector functions as the sharp canines that the predator state uses to rend the nation. In addition to siphoning off capital for its own benefit, the finance sector misallocates the remaining capital in ways that harm the real economy in order to reward already-rich financial elites harming the nation."&lt;ref&gt;William K. Black. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-k-black/how-the-servant-became-a_b_318010.html How the Servant Became a Predator: Finance's Five Fatal Flaws].  ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', February 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emerging country|Emerging countries]] have also tried to develop their financial sector, as an engine of [[economic development]]. A typical aspect is the growth of [[microfinance]] or [[microcredit]], as part of [[financial inclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Mader, P. (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313553041_Microfinance_and_Financial_Inclusion Microfinance and Financial Inclusion]. ''The Oxford Handbook of the Social Science of Poverty'', Ch. 37, pp 843-865.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2010, [[Adair Turner]], the head of Britain’s [[Financial Services Authority]], directly named financialization as a primary cause of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007–2010 financial crisis]]. In a speech before the [[Reserve Bank of India]], Turner said that the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 was similar to the 2008–9 crisis in that "both were rooted in, or at least followed after, sustained increases in the relative importance of financial activity relative to real non-financial economic activity, an increasing 'financialisation' of the economy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Reserve Bank of India]]. [https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=475  "After the Crises: Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Financial Liberalisation"]. Speech delivered by Lord Adair Turner, Chairman, Financial Services Authority, United Kingdom, at the Fourteenth C. D. Deshmukh Memorial Lecture on February 15, 2010 at Mumbai.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Bartlett]] summarized several studies in a 2013 article indicating that financialization has adversely affected economic growth and contributes to [[income inequality]] and wage stagnation for the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bartlett. [https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/financialization-as-a-cause-of-economic-malaise/  Financialization as a Cause of Economic Malaise]. ''[[NY Times]]'',  June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The development of leverage and financial derivatives==
One of the most notable features of financialization has been the development of [[leverage (finance)|overleverage]] (more borrowed capital and less own capital) and, as a related tool, [[financial derivatives]]: financial instruments, the price or value of which is derived from the price or value of another, underlying financial instrument. Those instruments, whose initial purpose was hedging and risk management, have become widely traded financial assets in their own right. The most common types of derivatives are futures contracts, swaps, and options. In the early 1990s, a number of central banks around the world began to survey the amount of derivative market activity and report the results to the Bank for International Settlements.

In the past few years, the number and types of financial derivatives have grown enormously. In November 2007, commenting on the financial crisis sparked by the subprime mortgage collapse in the United States, Doug Noland's ''Credit Bubble Bulletin'', on Asia Times Online, noted,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The scale of the Credit "insurance" problem is astounding. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the OTC market for Credit default swaps (CDS) jumped from $4.7 TN at the end of 2004 to $22.6 TN to end 2006. From the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] we know that the total notional volume of [[credit derivative]]s jumped about 30% during the first half to $45.5 TN. And from the Comptroller of the Currency, total U.S. commercial bank Credit derivative positions ballooned from $492bn to begin 2003 to $11.8 TN as of this past June....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A major unknown regarding derivatives is the actual amount of cash behind a transaction. A derivatives contract with a notional value of millions of dollars may actually only cost a few thousand dollars. For example, an [[interest rate swap]] might be based on exchanging the interest payments on $100 million in US Treasury bonds at a fixed interest of 4.5%, for the floating interest rate of $100 million in credit card receivables. This contract would involve at least $4.5 million in interest payments, though the notional value may be reported as $100 million. However, the actual "cost" of the swap contract would be some small fraction of the minimal $4.5 million in interest payments. The difficulty of determining exactly how much this swap contract is worth, when accounted for on a financial institution's books, is typical of the worries of many experts and regulators over the explosive growth of these types of instruments.

Contrary to common belief in the United States, the largest financial center for derivatives (and for foreign exchange) is London. According to [http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/global-financing-race-new-york/story.aspx?guid=%7b5967C688-8AEB-4279-9704-F5CF3B45C653%7d&amp;print=true&amp;dist=printTop MarketWatch on December 7, 2006],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The global [[foreign exchange market]], easily the largest financial market, is dominated by London. More than half of the trades in the derivatives market are handled in London, which straddles the time zones between Asia and the U.S. And the trading rooms in the Square Mile, as the City of London financial district is known, are responsible for almost three-quarters of the trades in the secondary fixed-income markets.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Findev Inc.''' (formerly '''TransGaming Inc.''') is a real estate financing company, and former technology company, with its head office in [[Toronto]]. It was founded by Gavriel State, who ran the [[Linux]] product division at [[Corel]]. The current CEO is Sruli Weinreb. TransGaming's Graphics and Portability Group was acquired by [[NVIDIA]] in 2015, paving way to NVIDIA's first office in Canada, located in Toronto.

In 2016, TransGaming Inc. decided to change its business focus from technology and gaming to real estate financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 23, 2016|url=http://media.transgaming.com/uploads/2016/09/Transgaming-NC-140p-Final.pdf|publisher=Transgaming Inc.|title=Notice Of Special Meeting Of Shareholders To Be Held On September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016 its last remaining gaming division, GameTree TV, together with its subsidiaries and offices in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Kiev]], were sold to TransGaming Interactive UK Limited, a subsidiary of General Media Ventures based in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TransGaming Signs Agreement To Sell Its Gametree TV Business To General Medial Adventures|location=Toronto, Canada|date=August 16, 2016|url=http://findev.ca/index.php/2016/08/16/transgaming-signs-agreement-to-sell-its-gametree-tv-business-to-general-media-ventures/|publisher=Findev}}&lt;/ref&gt; This company now carries on the GameTree TV business under the TransGaming name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.transgaming.com/about-us/|publisher=TransGaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former technology products ==

=== Cider ===
Cider was a technology marketed towards developers that allows [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] games to run on [[Mac OS X]].  It shared much of the same core technology as [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]] but was designed for video game designers and publishers. Like Cedega, Cider was a proprietary [[Fork (software)|fork]] of [[Wine (software)|Wine]].

At the 2007 World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC07), Electronic Arts announced their return to the Mac, publishing various titles simultaneously on both PCs and Macs, using Cider on the Mac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/06/11/eas_new_mac_games_will_demand_intel_based_systems.html AppleInsider | EA's new Mac games will demand Intel-based systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newsletter dated 2007-11-13, the company announced that Cider's improvements will be merging back into [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedega.com/theden/?p=6 |title=The Den |format=Members only |work=Cedega |publisher=TransGaming |date= |accessdate=2009-01-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GameTree Linux ===
{{Main|Cedega (software)}}
GameTree Linux was a developer program dedicated to the further development of [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]], which is a compatibility layer for running [[Microsoft Windows]] games on [[Linux]].There are games that run on Cedega but not on Wine, and games that run on Wine but not Cedega. Users that want to play a specific game usually look for it on the games databases available on the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appdb.winehq.org/ |title=Wine Application Database |publisher=WineHQ.org |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedegawiki.net/Welcome_to_the_GameTree_Linux_Wiki |title=GameTree Linux Wiki |work=Cedega |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SwiftShader ===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
SwiftShader is an advanced software renderer with Direct3D 8/9 class features, including shaders. SwiftShader was sold to Google in 2015 for $1.25 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transgaming-announces-assignment-swiftshader-ip-202600923.html|title=TransGaming Announces Assignment of SwiftShader IP|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GameTree TV ===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
In 2010 Transgaming launched their new app, GameTree TV, a cloud-based, on-demand entertainment platform for Smart TV. In 2012 Transgaming acquired the connected TV division of Oberon Media and integrated them into their GameTree TV platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TransGaming acquires Oberon Media’s TV games division for $7M|url = https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/04/transgaming-acquires-oberon-medias-tv-games-division-for-7m/|website = VentureBeat|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital rights management (DRM) ===
In a press release dated 2008-08-20, TransGaming announced that they "will utilize Sony DADC's [[SecuROM]] [[digital rights management]] (DRM) solution for all video game titles enabled through TransGaming's Cider portability engine for Mac games."  TransGaming's use of SecuROM is notable because of the company's decision to use SecuROM technology for all Mac games enabled through Cider, irrespective of distribution channel (download vs. retail) and whether SecuROM was used for a game's Windows PC release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.developmag.com/news/30391/Cider-powered-games-to-get-SecuROM-DRM | title=Cider-powered games to get SecuROM DRM | date=2008-08-22 | publisher=Develop Magazine | accessdate=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ID=16897 | title=TransGaming Adds SecuROM To Ciderized Titles | date=2008-08-21 | publisher=Inside Mac Games | accessdate=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48251">'''Followership '''is the actions of someone in a subordinate role. It can also be considered as a specific set of skills that complement [[leadership]], a role within a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization, a social construct that is integral to the leadership process, or the behaviors engaged in while interacting with leaders in an effort to meet organizational objectives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhl-Bien|first=M.|last2=Riggio|first2=R.|last3=Lowe|first3=K.|last4=Carsten|first4=M.|date=2014|title=Followership theory: A review and research agenda|url=|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=25|pages=83–104|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2013.11.007|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, followership is best defined as an intentional practice on the part of the subordinate to enhance the synergetic interchange between the follower and the leader. 

In organizations, “leadership is not just done by the leader, and followership is not just done by followers.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggio|first=R.|date=2014|title=Followership research: looking back and looking forward|url=|journal=Journal of Leadership Education|volume=Special|issue=4|pages=15–19|doi=10.12806/V13/I4/C4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective suggests that leadership and followership do not operate on one continuum, with one decreasing while the other increases. Rather, each dimension exists as a discrete dimension, albeit with some shared competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Favara|first=F.L.|date=2009|title=Putting Followership On The Map: Examining Followership Styles and Their Relationship With Job Satisfaction and Job Performance|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e99b/e41da68dfad8c2ce71857cc44d1c3b4b32f9.pdf|volume=5|pages=68-77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The study of followership is an emerging area within the leadership field that helps explain outcomes. Specifically, followers play important individual, relational, and collective roles in organizational failures and successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=S.D.|date=2007|title=Followership: The theoretical foundation of a contemporary construct.|url=|journal=Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies|volume=14|pages=50–60|doi=10.1177/0002831207304343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=R.E.|date=1988|title=In praise of followers|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=66|pages=142–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koonce, R.

The term follower can be used as a personality type, as a position in a hierarchy, as a role, or as a set of traits and behaviors. Studies of followership have produced various theories including trait, behavioral attributes, role, and [[Social constructionism|constructionist]] theories in addition to exploring myths or misunderstandings about followership.

== Followership in organizations ==
=== In the military ===
Military perspectives on good followership includes behaviors such as: knows themselves and seeks self-improvement, is technically and tactically proficient, complies with orders and initiates appropriate actions in the absence of orders, develops a sense of responsibility and takes responsibility for own actions, makes sound and timely decisions or recommendations, sets the example for others, is familiar with their leader and his job, and anticipates his requirements, keeps leader informed, understands the task and ethically accomplishes it, a team member, not a yes man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=P.|date=2002|title=Fitting teamwork into the grand scheme of things|url=|journal=The Journal for Quality and Participation|volume=25| issue =  1|pages=16–18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army has produced a new military doctrine called mission command that highlights the role of followers. It acknowledges one of Colin Powell’s principles of leadership that “the commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong, unless proven otherwise”&lt;ref&gt;Powell, C, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Mission command doctrine was conceived from a wartime environment that enables followers in the field to act according to the dictates of the situation on the ground, giving them maximum [[discretion]]. In order to exercise mission command appropriately, commanders must embrace the principles of followership to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=T.|last2=Berg|first2=P.|date=2014|title=Followership: Exercising discretion|url=|journal=Journal of Leadership Education|volume=Special|issue=4|pages=21–35|doi=10.12806/V13/I4/C4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the nursing profession ===
It is vital to understand that, without effective followers in nursing, our leaders face severe limitations. Current leaders and educators must share and promote the vision of enlightened followership if nursing is to achieve its potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiRienzo|first=S.|date=1994|title=A challenge to nursing: Promoting followers as well as leaders|url=|journal=Holistic Nursing Practice|volume=9 |issue=1|pages=26–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research suggests that there is significant difference in organizational effectiveness among nurses with different followership styles – passive, alienated, conformist, pragmatist, or effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Ji-Young|last2=Kim|first2=Mi-Ye|date=2009|title=The Impact of the Followership Style on the Organizational Effectiveness in Nursing Organization|url=|journal=Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Administration|volume= 15| issue = 2,|pages=233–243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In education and the classroom ===
The appearance of followership in mainstream leadership education books has become more commonplace, including the works of [[The Leadership Challenge|Kouzes &amp; Posner (2012)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The leadership challenge|last=Kouzes,|first=J.|last2=Posner|first2=B.|publisher=Jossey-Bass.|year=2012|isbn=|edition=5th|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson &amp; Parry (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A very short, fairly interesting and reasonably cheap book about studying leadership|last=Jackson|first=B.|last2=Parry|first2=K.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Ltd|year=2011|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=London, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz (2015)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership is half the story: A fresh look at followership, leadership, and collaboration|last=Hurwitz|first=M.|last2=Hurwitz|first2=S.|publisher=University of Toronto Press 2015 Rotman-UTP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=|location=Toronto, ON|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective followership training in the classroom is challenging because of media messages that preference leadership, internal schemas held by students that ignore followership, and cultural biases against it. Undergraduate and graduate students have been resistant to the idea of followership and followership has been interpreted as leadership poorly enacted or as settling for a lesser position. In recent years, attitudes have begun to change and students have noted that following is an expected, healthy part of a reciprocal relationship in social media and that it did not carry negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurwitz|first=M.|date=2017|title=Followership: A Classroom Exercise to Introduce the Concept|url=|journal=Management Teaching Review|volume=|pages=237929811771746|doi=10.1177/2379298117717468|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a student’s contribution in the classroom has such high significance, the college admissions system has yet to find a way to recognize and reward students who have continuously made these contributions. Given that outstanding classroom contributions have been ignored, yet play such a vital role, it is the responsibility of the college admissions system to find a way to identify them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of followership: How great followers create great leaders and organizations|last=Kleiner|first=K.|publisher=Jossey-Bass – A Wiley Imprint|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Riggio|editor-first=R.|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=89–93|chapter=Rethinking leadership and followership: A student’s perspective|editor-last2=Chaleff|editor-first2=I.|editor-last3=Lipman-Blumen|editor-first3=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the [[Franchising|Franchise]] business model ===
Followership, as defined by Hurwitz (2008), is “accepting or enabling [italics original] the goal achievement of one’s leader” (p.&amp;nbsp;11).  In the context of franchising, the franchisee could be seen as a follower because he or she accepts the franchisor’s business idea and enables the franchisor’s goal achievement through the individual franchise operations.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, J (2016).

''Impact of executive coaching on small businesses and franchisees.'' Available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global. (1501643317).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the hospitality industry ===
In hospitality and tourism, being an effective follower is important for achieving the service-oriented goals of many operations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=235–252|doi=10.1080/15313220.2016.1180964|title=What does it mean to follow?

It has been suggested that incorporating followership into training and education in intentional, purposeful ways could assist operations in hospitality and tourism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Followership Learning Community of the International Leadership Association ===
The Followership Learning Community (FLC) is a learning community within the International Leadership Organization (ILA) and is “dedicated to the development of knowledge, competencies, and programs concerning the leader-follower relationship. It is the first such academic or practice community devoted to the study of followership. It focuses on research, collaboration, and dissemination of ideas and information”.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ila-net.org/Communities/LC/Followership.htm|title=Followership Learning Community (FLC)|website=www.ila-net.org|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current priorities of the FLC are to:
* Help advance followership to a mainstream idea
* Generate greater interest in followership studies
* Develop a network of scholars who focus on leader-follower relationships
* Create a practitioner network of consultants/leaders who employ leader-follower best practices
* Support scholars and practitioners seeking to learn more about followership&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

!Summary
|-
|Robert Kelley
|According to Kelley, effective followers are individuals who are enthusiastic, intelligent, ambitious, and self-reliant. Kelley identified two underlying behavioral dimensions that distinguish types of followers. The first behavioral dimension is the degree to which the individual is an independent, critical thinker. The second dimension is the degree to which the individual is active or passive.  Depending on where a person falls on these two dimensions, there are five different follower types:
*'''The Sheep (low independence, passive)''': These individuals require external motivation and constant supervision.
*'''The Yes-People (low independence, active)''': These conformists are committed to the leader and the goal (or task) of the organization (or group/team) and will defend adamantly their leader when faced with opposition from others. They do not question the decisions or actions of the leader.
*'''The Pragmatics (average on both dimensions)''': These individuals are not trail-blazers; they will not stand behind controversial or unique ideas until the majority of the group has expressed their support and often prefer to stay in the background.
*'''The Alienated (high independence, passive)''': These individuals are negative and often attempt to stall or bring the group down by constantly questioning the decisions and actions of the leader.
*'''The Star Followers (high independence, active)''': These exemplary followers are positive, active, and independent thinkers. Star followers will not blindly accept the decisions or actions of a leader until they have evaluated them completely but can be trusted to get the job done.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

|Ira Chaleff
|Chaleff’s  original model of Courageous Followership proposed four dimensions in which courageous followers operates within a group, and a fifth dimension in which the follower operates either within or outside the group depending on the response of the leadership. The dimensions of courageous followership are:
*'''Assume responsibility''': They assume responsibility for themselves and the organization. They do not expect the leader or organization to provide for their security and growth, or need permission to act. Courageous followers discover and create opportunities to fulfill their potential and maximize their value to the organization. They initiate values-based action to improve the organization’s external activities and its internal processes.
*'''To serve''': Courageous followers are unafraid of the hard work required to serve a leader. They assume new or additional responsibilities, stay alert for areas in which their strengths complement the leader’s, and assert themselves in these areas.  Courageous followers stand up for their leader and the tough decisions a leader must make if the organization is to achieve its purpose. They are as passionate as the leader in pursuing the common purpose.
*'''To challenge''': Courageous followers give voice to the discomfort they feel when the behaviors or policies of the leader or group conflict with their sense of what is right. They are willing to stand up, to stand out, to risk rejection, to initiate conflict in order to examine the actions of the leader and group when appropriate. They are willing to deal with the emotions their challenge evokes in the leader and group. Courageous followers value organizational harmony and their relationship with the leader, but not at the expense of the common purpose and their integrity.
*'''To participate in transformation''': Courageous followers champion the need for change and stay with the leader and group while they mutually struggle with the difficulty of real change. They examine their own need for transformation and become full participants in the change process as appropriate.
*'''To take moral action''': Courageous followers know when it is time to take a stand that is different than that of the leader’s The stand may involve refusing to obey a direct order, appealing the order to the next level of authority, or tendering one’s resignation. These and other forms of moral action involve personal risk, but service to the common purpose justifies and sometimes demands acting. If attempts to redress the morally objectionable situation fail, a follower faces the more difficult prospect of whether to become a whistleblower.&lt;ref&gt;Chaleff, I. (2009). The courageous follower (Google play books ed.). San Francisco, CA: Barrett – Koehler Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Barbara Kellerman (academic)|Barbara Kellerman]]
|Barbara Kellerman  categorized followers as isolates, bystanders, participants, activists, and diehards based on their level of engagement in the leadership process.
*'''Isolates''':  Isolates are completely detached. They do not care about their leaders, know anything about them, or respond to them in any way. Their alienation is, nevertheless, of consequence.
*'''Bystanders''':  Bystanders observe but do not participate. They make a deliberate decision to stand aside, to disengage from their leaders and from whatever is the group dynamic.
*'''Participants''':  Participants are engaged in some way. They either clearly favor or oppose their leaders, groups, and organizations of which they are members.  In either case, they invest resources to try and make an impact.
*'''Activists''': Activists feel strongly about their leaders and act accordingly. They are eager, energetic, and engaged.  Because they are heavily invested in people and processes, they work hard either on behalf of their leaders or to undermine and even unseat them.
*'''Diehards''': Diehards are, as their name implies, prepared to die if necessary for their cause, whether it is an individual, an idea, or both. Diehards are deeply devoted to their leaders; or, in contrast, they are ready to remove them from positions of power, authority, and influence by any means necessary. In either case, Diehards are defined by their dedication including their willingness to risk life and limb.  Being a Diehard is all-consuming.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kellerman, B. (2008).

|Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz
|The Generative Partnership Model ® comprises five guiding principles, five skill pairings, and an array of associated behaviors. The guiding principles are at the core of every partnership, team, and organization, providing a framework on which the skills are used. The skills come in matched pairs: each of the five skill pairings involves a multitude of associated behaviors. The behaviors could be considered best practice, but are better considered adaptive and adaptable.
Hurwitz and Hurwitz  described these five skills of good followership:
*'''Decision advocating''': Adding value to decision making when it is not your decision to make.
*'''Peak performing''': Taking initiative for your own engagement, development, and on-the-job performance.
*'''Organizational agility:''' Aligning and thriving within the broader organization including being able to adapt to the norms of different subunits.
*'''Dashboard communicating''': Keeping your partner well informed and stimulating the right leadership action.
*'''Relationship building''': Developing rapport, trust, and an understanding of how to work best with leadership

The five complementary areas of leadership skill are:
*'''Decision framing''': Creating an environment and process that optimizes collaboration and decision quality.
*'''Performance coaching''': Ensuring an environment of purpose, progress, and positivity.
*'''Organizational mentoring''': Helping to guide others on how best to navigate and operate organizationally.
*'''Cascade communicating''': Keeping team members informed and stimulating the right followership initiative.
*'''Relationship framing''': Creating a comfortable, professional, equitable environment for each team member.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

|Boas Shamir
|Shamir looks at the different types of leader-follower theoretical perspectives rather than developing a specific model of positive followership.
*'''Followers as recipients of leadership''': A leader’s behavior (e.g., articulating a vision, setting a personal example, intellectual stimulation) affects followers’ attitudes and behaviors such as commitment to the organization, or exerting extra effort at work. According to this view followers do not play an active role in the leadership process.
*'''Followers as moderators of leadership impact''': the leader’s influence on the followers’ attitudes and performances depends on the followers’ characteristics.
*'''Followers as substitutes for leadership''': There are certain conditions that can neutralize or negate the need for leadership. The theory emphasizes followers’ training, experience, and job related knowledge.
*'''Followers as constructors of leadership''': A much more central and explicit role is given to followers in theories that present leadership as cognitively or socially constructed by followers.
*'''Followers as leaders – shared leadership''': This perspective questions the usefulness of the distinction between leaders and followers.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, B. (2007).

The process begins with identifying a leader worth following.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, J. (2013). (with Cooley, M.). In Creative followership: In the shadow of greatness. Decatur, Georgia: Looking Glass Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, when Collins’ suggests that people choose their boss, he gives credibility to followers as more than merely people who work for someone.

|Gordon Curphy, Mark Roellig
|The Curphy-Roellig Followership Model builds on some of the earlier research of Hollander, Chaleff, Kellerman and Kelley and consists of two independent dimensions and four followership types. The two dimensions of the Curphy-Roellig model are Critical Thinking and Engagement. Critical thinking is concerned with a follower's ability to challenge the status quo, ask good questions, detect problems, and develop solutions. Engagement is concerned with the level of effort people put forth at work. Based on these two dimensions followers are then categorized into four groups: '''Slackers''' (low critical thinking, low engagement), '''Brown-nosers''' (low critical thinking, high engagement), '''Criticizers''' (high critical thinking, low engagement) and '''Self-starters''' (high critical thinking, high engagement). The authors stress a situational nature of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership: Enhancing the Lessons of Experience (8th ed.)|last=Curphy|first=Gordy J.|last2=Ginnet|first2=Robert C.|last3=Hughes|first3=Richard L.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0077862404|location=USA|pages=323–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Looking backward and forward ==

=== A brief history of followership ===
The relationship between leader/follower is ancient and is referenced throughout history.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maroosis, J. (2008). Leadership: A partnership in reciprocal following. In R. Riggio, I. Chaleff, &amp; J. Lipman-Blumen (Eds.), The art of followership: How great followers create great leaders and organizations (pp. 17-24). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass – A Wiley Imprint&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of leader/follower partnerships are present in the great literatures and wisdom traditions of China such as the [[I Ching]] (1000-750 BC), India, and the aboriginal myths of Africa, Australia and the Native Peoples of North and South America.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The best known advice from ancient philosophers came from Aristotle who believed, “He who cannot be a good follower cannot be a leader.” In his time, [[Aristotle]] perceived that followership was necessary, albeit mainly as a precursor to what he considered to be a more important role: leader.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.12806/V13/I4/C1|title=Foreward|journal=Journal of Leadership Education|volume=13|issue=4|year=2014|last1=Lipman-Blumen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldasar Castiglione wrote about followers, following and followership in [[The Book of the Courtier]] in 1516.&lt;ref&gt;Castoglione, B. (1959). The book of the courtier. (C. S. Singleton, Trans.) New York: Double Day, Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; During Japan’s Edo or Tokugawa period (1603–1868), the [[Samurai]] were a class of followers – the very name samurai meant those who served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages= 54–57|doi=10.1002/jls.21494|title=Followership and the Samurai|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=10|issue=3|year=2016|last1=Pascoe|first1=Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, followership research began with [[Mary Parker Follett]] (1868–1933) who believed that all individuals, regardless of their place in society, deserved respect. She wanted to give more power to individuals and ensure that individuals’ voices were not only heard but were also integrated into solutions. Not only were many of her ideas rejected in the 1930s and 1940s, later theorists also paid limited recognition to her work. Follett’s writings have also been underappreciated in contemporary research, despite the fact that her work served as a prelude to many of the developments in the management literature and are still considered timely and insightful by many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=740–760|doi=10.1108/00251740510597752|title=Following in the footsteps of Mary Parker Follett|journal=Management Decision|volume=43|issue=5|year=2005|last1=Barclay|first1=Laurie J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Management theorist Warren Bennis said of Follett's work, "Just about everything written today about leadership and organizations comes from Mary Parker Follett's writings and lectures." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business.com/management/management-theory-of-mary-parker-follett/|title=Management Theory of Mary Parker Follett|work=business.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followership research continued in 1955 when Hollander and Webb (1955) argued that leader and follower was not an either/or proposition in which leaders and followers were found at opposite ends of a continuum. They proposed that the qualities associated with leadership and followership were interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=50–60|doi=10.1177/0002831207304343|title=Followership|journal=Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies|volume=14|year=2016|last1=Baker|first1=Susan D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zelaznik published work in 1964 that focused on the leader-follower relationship by considering the dimensions of dominance vs. submissiveness and activity vs. passivity.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=80–86|doi=10.1108/00197850910939117|title=The romance of the follower: Part 1|journal=Industrial and Commercial Training|volume=41|issue=2|year=2009|last1=Hurwitz|first1=Marc|last2=Hurwitz|first2=Samantha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers have been largely neglected in the study of leadership, an omission addressed by Robert Kelley in his seminal 1988 Harvard Business Review article “In Praise of Followers”.&lt;ref name="Bennis, W. 2008"&gt;Bennis, W.

Kellogg Foundation provided a four year grant to study leadership that attracted 50 practitioners and scholars to “shed light on some of the most compelling topics in the field.” Three focus groups emerged from the Kellogg Leadership Studies Project (KLSP), one being the Leadership and Followership Focus Group. The conveners of this group were Ed Hollander and Lynn Offermann who published a bound collection of papers called The Balance of Leadership &amp; Followership.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, E., &amp; Offerman, L. (1997). The balance of leadership and followership. No additional information available.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major organized activity to bring scholars and practitioners together on the subject of followership occurred in 2008 at Claremont University, chaired by [[Jean Lipman-Blumen]] of the [[Peter Drucker and Mastoshi Ito Graduate School of Management]] , Ron Riggio of the Kravis Leadership Center and Ira Chaleff, author of The Courageous Follower. Participants included researchers and practitioners mentioned in this article including Robert Kelley, [[Barbara Kellerman (academic)|Barbara Kellerman]] and others. In addition to focusing on the elevating aspects of followership, research was introduced on the problematic aspects of followership including the work of Thomas Blass on the famous [[Milgram experiment|Stanley Milgram experiments]] on obedience and by Jean Lipman-Blumen on why we follow toxic leaders. The book of essays by conference contributors, The Art of Followership, was published as part of the Warren Bennis Leadership Series with a forward by [[James MacGregor Burns|James McGregor Burns]].

Participants in the KLSP went on to form the International Leadership Association (ILA) as a vehicle for keeping the dialogue alive. Similarly, participants in the Claremont conference went on to form the Followership Learning Community within the ILA with Ira Chaleff as its first chair.  Both of these entities are continuing with this work.

Additional areas of followership that have been studied include:
* Upwards impression management – influencing management through persuasion and other tactics,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. J., Kacmar, K. M., and Carlson, D. S. (2006), “An examination of temporal variables and relationship quality on promotability ratings”, Group and Organization Management, Vol. 31, No. 6, pp. 677-699&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s  – examples of this include civic virtue, sportsmanship, or helping others,&lt;ref&gt;Podsakoff, P. M., MacKenzie, S. B., Paine, J. B., and Bachrach, D. G. (2000), “Organizational citizenship behaviors: A critical review of the theoretical and empirical literature and suggestions for future research”, Journal of Management, Vol. 26, No. 3, pp. 513-563&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proactive personality theory – the idea that people can influence and shape their own environment,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. A. (2006), “Proactive personality and job performance: A social capital perspective”, Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 90, No. 5, pp. 1011–1017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leader–member exchange theory|Leader-member exchange]] or LMX  – the interchange and relationships between a leader and follower.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstner, C. R. and Day, D. V. (1997), “Meta-analytic review of Leader-Member Exchange theory: Correlates and construct issues”, Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 82, No. 6, 827-844&lt;/ref&gt;
Missing from the present research are additional critical components of followership such as the ability to convert strategies into actions that deliver on the actual intent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The future of followership ===
Followership theory offers promise for reinvigorating leadership research in rich new ways:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Moves beyond leader-centric views to recognize the importance of follower roles and following behaviors making the leadership process more inclusive.
* Distributes responsibility for constructing leadership and its outcomes to all players in the leadership process.
* Focuses us on identifying more and less effective followership behaviors.
* Embeds context within the leadership process.
* Recognizes that leadership can flow in all directions, e.g., not only downward but also upward in a hierarchy when subordinates engage in leading behaviors.
* Allows us to understand why and how managers are not always effective leaders, such as when they are unable to co-construct leadership with their subordinates.
* Promotes followership development, not just leadership development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Robert Kelley proposes seven areas for further followership research:&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, R. (2008). ''Rethinking Followership''. In R. E. Riggio, I. Chaleff, &amp; J. Lipman-Blumen (Eds.), The Art of Followership (pp. 5-15). San Francisco, CA: Josey-Bass A Wiley Imprint.&lt;/ref&gt;

1. World Events

2. Culture

3. Leader(ship)

4. Follower qualities

5. Role of the Follower

6. Language of followership

7. Courageous Conscience

He challenges the field to focus followership research more on “the big issues happening in the world” such as suicide bombers, religious fundamentalism, democratically elected dictators and corporate abuses of power.

Chaleff calls for a similar focus for research on susceptibility to extremism and the use and development of assessments to help people understand their own tendencies in order to pre-empt their expression in the presence of toxic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Chaleff, I. (2017). ''In praise of followership style assessment. Journal of Leadership Studies, 10''(3), 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Behavioral Attribute
|Directly lists the behavioral attributes of good followers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Kelley (1988), Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz (2015)
|-
|Role Based Approaches
|Role-based views consider how individuals enact leadership and followership in the context of hierarchical roles. The primary purpose is to advance understanding of how subordinates work with managers in ways that contribute to or detract from leadership and organizational outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|Constructionism
|Investigates how people interact and engage together in social and relational contexts to construct (or not construct) leadership and followership.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhurst, G. T., &amp; Uhl-Bien, M. (2012). Organizational discourse analysis (ODA): Examining leadership as a relational process. The Leadership Quarterly, 23(6), 1043–1062&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|Distributed Leadership &amp; Followership
|Distributed leadership starts with the perspective many people can take on a leadership role, not just those with formal power and authority. Leadership and followership can move from person to person as the dialogue twists and turns.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Not only are team members challenged to enact followership and leadership roles effectively, but they must be able to switch between the roles. Generally speaking, however, distributed leadership theories focus exclusively on the leadership role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|Leader-Member Exchange Theory
|The focus in LMX theory is on how leaders and followers engage together to generate high quality work relationships that allow them to produce effective leadership outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Graen, G. B., &amp; Uhl-Bien, M. (1995). Relationship-based approach to leadership: Development of leader–member exchange (LMX) theory of leadership over 25 years: Applying a multi-level multi-domain perspective. The Leadership Quarterly, 6(2), 219–247.&lt;/ref&gt;  While LMX theory does acknowledge followers in the relational process, it is still more leadership – than followership – focused in that it privileges the leader as the driver of the relationship-building process.&lt;ref&gt;Uhl-Bien, M., Graen, G. B., &amp; Scandura, T. A. (2000). Implications of leader–member exchange (LMX) for strategic human resource management systems: Relationships as social capital for competitive advantage. Research in Personnel and Human Resources Management, 18, 137–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|Implicit Followership Theories
|Follower-centric approaches arose in response to leader-centric views and drew attention to the role of the follower in constructing leaders and leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Implicit followership research proposes that leaders’ beliefs for follower behavior influence the extent to which followership is effective; followers who behave as expected will be more successful. They use these schemas to encode followership information, which serves as essential elements of organizational sensemaking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|}
Other behavioral traits of effective followership that have been proposed include: a belief in the importance of being a good follower, looks beyond themselves, values their own independence, follows while offering up ideas, self-motivated and self-directed, displays loyalty, considers integrity of paramount importance, functions well in change-oriented environments, functions well on teams, thinks independently and critically, gets involved, generates ideas, willing to collaborate, willing to lead initiatives, develops leaders and themselves, stays current, anticipates, drives own growth, and is a player for all seasons.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Myths and misconceptions about followership ==
The traditional notion that leaders are active and followers are passive is mistaken and contributes to misconceptions about the organizational functions of superiors and subordinates. Behaviorists now recognize that active followers influence leaders at every level of the hierarchy, and that leadership itself is a process, not a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199209/in-praise-followers|title=In Praise of Followers: Many leaders start out as good followers|last=Psychology Today Staff|first=|date=June 9, 2016|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many myths about followership:
* It is a lesser role.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
* It is just preparation for being a leader.
* It is managing up, brownnosing or ‘being political'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Once you are a leader you are no longer a follower.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, S., Stites-Doe, S., Mathis, C., &amp; Rosenbach, W. (2014). The fluid nature of follower and leader roles. In L. M. Lapierre, &amp; M. K. Carsten (Eds.), Followership: What is it and why do people follow? (pp. 73-88). Bradford, GBR: Emerald Group Publishing Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;
* You have to be a good follower to be a good leader.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Following is passive. It’s easy.&lt;ref name="Bennis, W. 2008" /&gt;

The '''Gordon Riots''' of 1780 were several days of rioting based on [[anti-Catholic]] feeling.  They began with a massive and orderly protest in London against the [[Papists Act 1778|Papists Act of 1778]], which was intended to reduce official discrimination against [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|British Catholics]]. [[Lord George Gordon]], head of the Protestant Association warned that the law would enable Catholics in the British Army to become a dangerous threat. The protest evolved into riots and widespread looting.  Local magistrates were afraid of reprisals and did not issue the riot act. There was no repression until the Army finally moved in and started shooting.  The main violence lasted from 2 June to 9 June, 1780.

The [[Popery Act 1698]] had imposed a number of penalties and disabilities on [[Roman Catholicism in England and Wales|Roman Catholics in England]]; the 1778 Act eliminated some of these. An initial peaceful protest led on to widespread rioting and looting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Printed by W.

The term "King Mob" afterwards denoted an unruly and fearsome proletariat.

The Riots came at the height of the [[American War of Independence]], when Britain, with no large ally, was fighting [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American rebels]], France, Spain, and the [[Dutch Republic]].  Public opinion, especially in middle-class and elite circles, repudiated anti-Catholicism and lower-class violence, and rallied behind [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North's government.]] Demands were made for a London police force.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Marshall, ''Eighteenth Century England'' (1974) pp 469-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:LordGeorgeGordon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Lord George Gordon]], head of the [[Protestant Association]].]]
The stated intention of the Papists Act of 1778 was, as its preamble notes, to mitigate some of the official discrimination against [[Roman Catholics]] in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. It absolved Catholics from taking the religious oath when joining the [[British Armed Forces]] as well as granting a few and limited liberties. There were strong expedient reasons for this change. British military forces at the time were stretched very thinly in what had become a global [[American War of Independence]], with conflicts ongoing with France, Spain, and the new United States. The recruitment of Catholic people would be a significant help to address this shortfall of manpower.

The 1698 anti-Catholic laws had largely been ignored for many years and were rarely enforced. Because of this, many leading Catholics were opposed to the repeal of the Act, fearing it would stir up anti-Catholic sentiment for little practical return.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.24-27&lt;/ref&gt; It was also pointed out that large numbers of Catholics, recruited in [[Ireland]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]], were already serving in the military. In spite of this, the government decided to press ahead with the Bill, and had it introduced in Parliament by [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]].

===Protestant Association===
The Protestant Association of London had the support of leading Calvinist religious figures, including [[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]], [[Erasmus Middleton]], and [[John Rippon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Innes|title=Inferior Politics:Social Problems and Social Policies in Eighteenth-Century Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-1Q78IUE4IC&amp;pg=PP446|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=8 October 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160677-9|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord George Gordon]] became its President in 1779, in an effort to force the repeal of the Papists Act.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Thomas Bayly (ed.) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ad6YpE1POPwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A complete collection of state trials and proceedings for high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors from the earliest period to the year 1783, with notes and other illustrations], Vol. 21. London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown (1816), p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; An articulate propagandist, though eccentric, Gordon inflamed the mob with fears of Papism and a return to [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchical rule]]. He implied that Catholics in the military would, given a chance, join forces with their co-religionists on the Continent and attack Britain. He enjoyed popularity in [[Scotland]] where he took part in a successful campaign to prevent the same legislation from being introduced into [[Scots law]], although the Act continued in force in [[England and Wales]] and in [[Ireland]]. The success in obstructing the law in Scotland led Gordon to believe he could enjoy similar success in the rest of Britain. Early in 1780 Gordon had several [[audience]]s with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] but was unable to convince him of what he saw as the dangers of the Act. George III initially humoured Gordon, but grew increasingly irritated with him and eventually refused any future audiences.

The political climate deteriorated rapidly. On 29 May 1780, Gordon called a meeting of the Protestant Association, and his followers subsequently marched on the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] to deliver a petition demanding the repeal of the Act.

===Other causes===
After the first march to Parliament, further riots occurred involving groups whose grievances were nationalistic, economic, or political, rather than religious. Aside from the issue of Catholic emancipation, it has also been suggested that the driving force of the riots was Britain's poor economic situation: the loss of trade during the war had led to falling wages, rising prices, and periodic unemployment. As Rudé noted, there was no general attack on the Catholic community, "the victims of the riots" being distinguished by the fact they were "on the whole, persons of substance".&lt;ref&gt;Rudé, (1974), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Voting in parliamentary elections was restricted by a property threshold, so most Londoners were unable to vote and many hoped for reforms to make Parliament more representative of the people.

Shortly after the riots had broken out, the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] suggested that they were directly attributable to the passing of the [[Quebec Act (1774)|Quebec Act]] six years before, a view that was ridiculed by many of his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested cause was Britain's weakened international position, which had arisen from the country's isolation in Europe and the disappointing news coming from the ongoing war.&lt;ref&gt;Simms p.633&lt;/ref&gt; Some rioters were against the continuation of the war, and many strongly supported American independence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-gordon-riots-of-1780-london-in-flames-a-nation-in-ruins]&lt;/ref&gt; while others were angry that Britain's war effort was being mishandled by [[Lord North]]. In many cases a mix of issues blended together and drove people to take part in the rioting.

==Riots==

===March on Parliament===
On 2 June 1780 a huge crowd, estimated at 40,000 to 60,000 strong, assembled and marched on the Houses of Parliament. Many carried flags and banners proclaiming "[[Popery|No Popery]]", and most wore blue [[cockades]] which had become the symbol of their movement. As they marched, their numbers swelled. They attempted to force their way into the House of Commons, but without success. Gordon, petition in hand, and wearing in his hat the blue cockade of the Protestant Association, entered the Commons and presented the petition. Outside, the situation quickly got out of hand and a [[riot]] erupted. Members of the [[House of Lords]] were attacked as they arrived, and a number of carriages were vandalised and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.47-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being aware of the possibility of trouble, the authorities had failed to take steps to prevent violence breaking out. The Prime Minister, Lord North, had forgotten to issue an order mobilising the small number of [[Constables]] in the area. Those that were present in the House of Commons were not strong enough to take on the angry mob. Eventually a detachment of soldiers was summoned, and they dispersed the crowd without violence. Inside the House of Commons, the petition was overwhelmingly dismissed by a vote of 192 to 6.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embassies attacked===
Once the mob around Parliament had dispersed, it seemed to the government that the worst of the disorder was over. However, the same night a crowd gathered and attacked the Roman Catholic [[Sardinian Embassy Chapel]] in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Moorfields===

The area of [[Moorfields]], one of the poorest parts of the city, was the home of many [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant workers and had a large area of open ground where crowds could assemble. Despite the appeal of a prominent Irish merchant, James Malo, to the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]], [[Brackley Kennett]], no additional protection was offered to the area. During 3 June a crowd had gathered in Moorfields, and by nightfall it began to go on the rampage. Malo's house was amongst the many to be sacked and burned.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.66-71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newgate Prison]], where rioters arrested on June 2 were being held, was attacked and largely destroyed, as was [[The Clink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Southwark - Winchester House and Barclay's Brewery | work=British History Online | accessdate = 2009-07-25 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed large numbers of prisoners to escape, many of whom were never recaptured. Severe destruction was inflicted on Catholic churches and homes and chapels on the grounds of several embassies, as well as on [[New Prison]], [[Fleet Prison]], and the house of the Lord Chief Justice, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]]. On June 7, called "Black Wednesday" by [[Horace Walpole]], the riot reached its climax. An attempt on the [[Bank of England]] was narrowly averted when a combination of the London Military Association and regular troops repulsed rioters, resulting in heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;George Rudé, "The Gordon Riots: A Study of the Rioters and Their Victims: The Alexander Prize Essay," ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' Vol. 6 (1956), p. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army response===
[[File:The Gordon Riots by John Seymour Lucas.jpg|thumb|230px|The Gordon Riots, depicted in a painting by [[John Seymour Lucas]]]]
The army was called out on 7 June and given orders to fire upon groups of four or more who refused to disperse. About 285 people were shot dead,  with another 200 wounded. Around 450 of the rioters were arrested. Of those arrested, about twenty or thirty were later tried and executed. Gordon was arrested and charged with [[high treason]], but was found not guilty.  Brackley Kennett, the Lord Mayor, was convicted of [[criminal negligence]] for not reading out the [[Riot Act]] and given a £1,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Babington p.27&lt;/ref&gt; The military units which dealt with the rioters included the [[Household Cavalry|Horse Guards]], [[Foot Guards]], Inns of Court Yeomanry, the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], line infantry&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mansel, pages 126-7, ''Pillars of Monarchy'', {{ISBN|0-7043-2424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)]], and militia brought in from neighbouring counties. The defence of the Bank of England was conducted by the [[9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot]] under the command of [[Thomas Twisleton, 13th Baron Saye and Sele]].

==Aftermath==
The Riots damaged the reputation of Britain across Europe, where many saw British [[constitutional monarchy]] as an inherently unstable form of government. This came at a time when Britain was searching for allies, particularly Catholic Austria, in the [[American War of Independence]] to challenge the strong coalition the French had built.&lt;ref&gt;Simms p.640&lt;/ref&gt; Britain had also initiated secret negotiations with Spain to end Spanish support of the United States. After learning of the riots, the Spanish government pulled back from peace negotiations with Britain, concerned that the disorder would lead to a widespread collapse of the current British administration.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris, ''The Peacemakers: The Great Powers and American Independence'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), p. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The riots highlighted the problems Britain faced by not deploying a professional police force, a notion which was opposed as it was considered foreign and [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]]. The [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Earl of Shelburne]] shocked many the day after the riots broke out by proposing in parliament that Britain should consider forming a force modelled on the French police.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert p.64-65&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A Greater London Professional Police Force-the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]-would not however be established until 29 September 1829. The [[City of London Police]] would not be established until 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

The riots destroyed the popularity of radical politician [[John Wilkes]], who led troops against the rioters. Many of his followers saw this as a betrayal; some of them may have been among the rioters. A pamphlet and a book of poems defending the role of Gordon were written and published by the polemicist and hymn-writer [[Maria De Fleury]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events at the [[Bank of England]] started a tradition where a detachment of soldiers, usually from the [[Brigade of Guards]] would march to the bank to perform security duties.  Until 1963 the duty was performed by the Guards in [[Home Service Dress]] with [[bearskin]], though tennis shoes were worn inside the bank.  From that date until 31 March 1973 the detachment became more functional than ceremonial, doing their duties in service dress with automatic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;p.113 Lindsay, Oliver ''Once a Grenadier: The Grenadier Guards 1945-1995'' Pen and Sword, 14 Mar 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

[[Maria Edgeworth]]'s 1817 novel ''Harrington'' contains a vivid evocation of the Gordon Riots, with two characters readers would find unsympathetic taken for Papists and finding refuge in the home of the rich Spanish Jew, the father of the young Jewish woman at the centre of the love story.

[[Charles Dickens]]' 1841 novel ''[[Barnaby Rudge]]'' depicts the Gordon Riots and features Lord George in a prominent role.

[[John Creasey]]'s 1974 novel ''[[The Masters of Bow Street]]'' depicts the Gordon Riots and the recalcitrance of Lord North to the establishment of a police force.

In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[Sharpe (novel series)|Sharpe]]'' novels, the protagonist Richard Sharpe's mother was killed during the riots while he was still a child.

Miranda Hearn's 2003 historical novel ''A Life Everlasting'' depicts the main protagonists caught up in the riots as innocent Londoners.

The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] is an Islamic organization that was founded in [[Ismailia]], '''[[Egypt]]''' by [[Hassan al-Banna]] in March 1928 as an [[Islamist]] religious, political, and social movement.&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/mb.htm|title=FAS Intelligence Resource Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MBMHome"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ummah.net/ikhwan/|title=Muslim Brotherhood Movement Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group spread to other Muslim countries but has its largest, or one of its largest, organizations in Egypt, where for many years it has been the largest, best-organized, and most disciplined political opposition force,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, John R.

==History==
===1928-1938===
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1928-1938)}}
The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 by [[Hassan al-Banna]], along with six workers of the [[Suez Canal]] Company. Al-Banna was a schoolteacher, to promote implementing traditional, religious, Islamic [[sharia]] law into government and a social regression based on an [[Islam]]ic ethos of altruism and civic duty, in opposition to what he saw as political and social injustice and to [[British Empire|British imperial rule]]. The organisation initially focused on educational and charitable work, but quickly grew to become a major political force as well, by championing the cause of disenfranchised [[social class|classes]], playing a prominent role in the Egyptian [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement, and promoting a conception of Islam that attempted to restore broken links between tradition and [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=A genealogical inquiry into early Islamism: the discourse of Hasan al-Banna |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=61–85 |doi= 10.1080/13569317.2012.644986|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13569317.2012.644986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939-1954===
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939-1954)}}

On December 28, 1948 Egypt's prime minister, [[Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha]], was assassinated by Brotherhood member and veterinary student Abdel Meguid Ahmed Hassan, in what is thought to have been retaliation for the government crackdown. A month and half later Al-Banna himself was killed in Cairo by men believed to be government agents and/or supporters of the murdered premier. Al-Banna was succeeded as head of the Brotherhood by Hassan Isma'il al-Hudaybi, a former judge.

In 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of taking part in arson that destroyed some "750 buildings" in downtown Cairo — mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners —  "that marked the end of the liberal, progressive, cosmopolitan" Egypt.&lt;ref name="RebellionWright"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Rebellion Within, An Al Qaeda mastermind questions terrorism. by Lawrence Wright. newyorker.com, June 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood supported the military coup that overthrew the monarchy in 1952, but the [[military dictatorship|junta]] was unwilling to share power or lift [[martial law]] and clashed with the Brotherhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

=== 1954-1982 ===
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1954-present)}}
After the attempted assassination of then-president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal 'Abd al-Nasser]], in 1954, a member of the secret apparatus was accused by the authorities of being the perpetrator of the attempt.  [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] then abolished the Brotherhood and imprisoned and punished thousands of its members.

Many members of the Brotherhood were held for years in prisons and [[concentration camp]]s, where they were sometimes tortured, during Nasser's rule.  In 1964 there was a minor thaw when writer [[Sayyid Qutb]] was released from prison only to be arrested again along with his brother [[Muhammad Qutb|Muhammad]] in August 1965, when he was accused of being part of a plot to overthrow the state—to assassinate the President and other Egyptian officials and personalities&lt;ref&gt;(Sivan (1985) p. 93.; Fouad Ajami, "In the Pharaoh's Shadow: Religion and Authority in Egypt," ''Islam in the Political Process,'' editor James P. Piscatori, Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 25–26.)&lt;/ref&gt;—and subjected to what some consider a show trial.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hasan, S. Badrul, ''Syed Qutb Shaheed'', Islamic Publications International, 2nd ed. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial culminated in a death sentence for Qutb and six other members of the Muslim Brotherhood and on 29 August 1966, he was executed by hanging.

Qutb became the Brotherhood's most influential thinker. He argued that Muslim society was no longer Islamic and must be transformed by an Islamic vanguard through violent revolution. To restore Islam from modern [[jahiliyya]], Muslim states must be overthrown.  While Qutb's ideology became very popular elsewhere, in Egypt the Brotherhood's leadership distanced itself from his revolutionary ideology, adhering instead to a nonviolent [[reformist]] strategy, to which it has remained ever since.

Nasser's successor, [[Anwar Sadat]], became president of Egypt in 1970 and gradually released imprisoned Brothers and enlisted their help against leftist groups. The organisation was tolerated to an extent, but remained technically illegal and subject to periodic crackdowns.  Eventually the Brotherhood was key in the assassination of Anwar Sadat.

In the 1970s, a large student Islamic activist movement took shape, independently from the Brotherhood.  Sadat himself became the enemy of the Brotherhood and other Islamist groups after signing a peace agreement with [[Israel]] in 1979, and was assassinated by a violent Islamist group Tanzim al-Jihad on October 6, 1981.

===1982-2005===
In the 1980s, during [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s presidency, many of the student Islamist activists joined the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood dominated the professional and student associations of Egypt and was famous for its network of social services in neighborhoods and villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1048/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403223047/http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1048/ |archivedate=2007-04-03 |df= }} John Walsh. Harvard International Review: Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.  Perspectives on the United States, Vol. 24 (4) Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In order to quell the Brotherhood's renewed influence, the government again resorted to repressive measures starting in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=The Islamic world in the age of western dominance|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-83826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Despite mass arrests, police harassment and an essentially closed political system, Brotherhood candidates have made strong showings in several parliamentary elections.

Over the next ten years the Brotherhood made repeated calls for a more democratic political system. In 1997 Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide [[Mustafa Mashhur]] told journalist Khalid Daoud&lt;ref&gt;article printed in ''Al Ahram Weekly'' July 5–9, 1997, quoted in Passion for Islam: Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience by Caryle Murphy, pp. 241, 330.&lt;/ref&gt; that he thought Egypt's Coptic Christians and Orthodox Jews should pay the long-abandoned [[jizya]] poll tax, levied on non-Muslims in exchange for protection from the state, rationalized by the fact that non-Muslims are exempt from military service while it is compulsory for Muslims. He went on to say, "we do not mind having Christians members in the [[People's Assembly of Egypt|People's Assembly]]...the top officials, especially in the army, should be Muslims since we are a Muslim country ... This is necessary because when a Christian country attacks the Muslim country and the army has Christian elements, they can facilitate our defeat by the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;''Passion for Islam: Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience,'' by Caryle Murphy, Simon and Schuster, 2002, pp. 241, 330.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[The Guardian]] newspaper, the proposal caused an "uproar" among Egypt's six million Coptic Christians and "the movement later backtracked."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/egypt-muslim-brotherhood-uncovered The Muslim Brotherhood uncovered]| ack Shenker in Cairo and  Brian Whitaker| guardian.co.uk| 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, 15 MB deputies were elected to the Egyptian parliament. A book detailing the record of the MB deputies in the 2000-2005 Egyptian parliament (''The Brothers in the 2000-2005 Parliament'') found its parliamentary leader Hamdy Hassan working vigorously to fight cultural expression the Brotherhood felt was unIslamic and blasphemous, from literature to beauty contests. Hassan accused the Minister of Culture ([[Farouk Hosny]]) of leading what Hassan called the `current US-led war against Islamic culture and identity`. Another Brotherhood MP (Gamal Heshmat) took credit for forcing culture minister Hosni to ban the publication of three novels on the ground they promoted blasphemy and unacceptable sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, John R., ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005-2010===

In 2005, the Brotherhood participated in pro-democracy demonstrations with the [[Kifaya]] movement. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood's candidates could only stand as independents under the emergency law, but identified themselves by campaigning under the most famous of their slogans - 'Islam Is the Solution'.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, John R. ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;   They won 88 seats (20% of the total) to form the largest opposition bloc despite many violations of the electoral process. Meanwhile, the legally approved opposition parties won only 14 seats.

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than 1,000 Brothers were arrested before the vote's second and third rounds, and police blocked Brotherhood supporters from entering the polls in some districts, according to independent organizations monitoring the election. Brotherhood leaders also accused the government of changing the final count to lead to a victory for the ruling party candidate in seven districts, a concern echoed by independent monitors. More than 100 Egyptian judges signed a statement condemning "aggression and acts of thuggery by supporters of the ruling party against the judges while...police forces stood idle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/egypt/muslim-brotherhood-egypts-parliamentary-elections/p9319 Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's Parliamentary Elections]| Sharon Otterman| 1 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During and after the election the Brethren launched what some have called a "charm offensive." Its leadership talked about its `responsibility to lead reform and change in Egypt.` It addressed the `[[Persecution of Copts#Modern era|Coptic]] issue` stating that `conditions` for [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] (Copts) would be better `under the Brotherhood group`, and Copts would be "full citizens, not ahl-dhimma," and insinuated that the Brethren would do away with Egypt's decade's old church [[Persecution of Copts#Modern era|building-permit system]] that Coptic Christians felt was discriminatory.&lt;ref name=Osman.p101&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.101&lt;/ref&gt;  Internationally the Brethren launched an English-language website and some of the MB's leaders participated in an Initiative to `Re-Introduc[e] the Brotherhood to the West `, "listing and addressing many `Western misconceptions about the Brotherhood.`" An article was written for [[The Guardian]] newspaper under the title `No need to be afraid of us`; and another for American Jewish newspaper [[The Forward]].&lt;ref name=Osman.p101/&gt;

This campaign, however, was a direct threat to the Egyptian government and its position as an indispensable ally of the west in its fight against radical Islamist ideologues "bent on the Islamization of society and permanent conflict with the West."  The government responded by not only continuing to arrest the Brotherhood's leaders and squeeze its finances, but introduced an amendment of Article 1 of the Egyptian constitution.  The amendment would ("in theory") have had the effect of "allowing women, and Christians, to run for any position, including the presidency," by defining Egypt as `a state of citizenship` and remove the reference to Islam as `the religion of the state.` When challenged to vote for the new version of the article, the Brotherhood's members of parliament walked out of the legislative chamber.&lt;ref name=Osman.p102&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has also reportedly been weakened by "missteps" that have alienated "many Egyptians" and reportedly played into the government's hands.  In December 2006 masked Brotherhood students at Cairo's Al Azhar University staged a militia-style march, which included the "wearing of uniforms, displaying the phrase, 'We Will be Steadfast', and drills involving martial arts. This betrayed the group's intent to plan for the creation of militia structures, and a return by the group to the era of 'secret cells'", according to journalist Jameel Theyabi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.daralhayat.com/opinion/OPED/12-2006/Article-20061218-95ae9eb8-c0a8-10ed-00b1-7119b3684228/story.html The Brotherhood's Power display (18 December 2006)] Jameel Theyabi| ''Dar Al-Hayat''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one observer: "after a number of conciliatory engagements and interactions with the West", the Brotherhood,

&lt;blockquote&gt;retreated into its comfort zone of inflammatory rhetoric intended for local consumption: all suicide bombers are `martyrs`; `Israel` regularly became the Jews`; even its theological discourse became more confrontational and oriented to social conservatism.&lt;ref name=Osman.p113&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later the Egyptian government amended the constitution, prohibiting independent candidates from running for Parliament, these being the only candidates the Brotherhood could field. It also arrested thousands of its members, many of whom were tried in military courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/162970/fault-lines-egypts-muslim-brotherhood fault lines in egypts muslim brotherhood]&lt;/ref&gt; The state delayed local council elections from 2006 to 2008, disqualifying most MB candidates. The MB boycotted the election. The government incarcerated thousands of rank-and-file MB members in a wave of arrests and military trials, the harshest such security clampdown on the Brotherhood "in decades." &lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

All but one of the Brotherhood candidates lost their seats in the 2010 election marred by massive arrests of Brethren and polling place observers.  The reaction of a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman to the election was: "We lost seats and a much deserved representation in the parliament. But we won people's love and support and a media battle that exposed [irregularities in] the elections."&lt;ref&gt;Essam Elerian quoted in [http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/11/2010112912557915300.html Egypt's winners and losers]| Alaa Bayoumi|  aljazeera.net| 29 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first couple of years after the revolution, there was both cooperation and tension between the Brotherhood and (secular oriented) military.

According to Fandy, SCAF intends to ensure the MB's victory in the elections, in return for an MB effort to draft a constitution guaranteeing the military a central role in running the country, as in the [[National Security Council (Turkey)#The role of the military in Turkish politics|Turkish model]].

The '''Immorality Act, 1927''' (Act No. 5 of 1927) was an [[act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of South Africa]] that prohibited extramarital sex between white people and people of other races. In its original form it only prohibited sex between a white person and a black person, but in 1950 it was amended to apply to sex between a white person and any non-white person.

The act forbade any "illicit carnal intercourse" (which meant sex outside of marriage) between a "European" (i.e. white) male and a "native" (i.e. black) female, or vice versa. It imposed a penalty of up to five years in prison for the man and four years for the woman. It also prohibited "[[procuring (prostitution)|procuring]]" women for the purpose of interracial sex, and knowingly allowing premises to be used for interracial sex; both offences carried a penalty of up to five years imprisonment.

In 1950, the Nationalist government of [[DF Malan]], in one of the first legislative acts of [[apartheid]], introduced the Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 (Act No. 21 of 1950) to extend the prohibition to sex between "Europeans" and all "non-Europeans". This therefore included in the scope of the act people of mixed descent and people of Asian descent. The 1950 amendment came one year after the passage of the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]], which forbade marriages between white and non-white people.

The act was repealed by the [[Immorality Act, 1957]], section 16 of which contained a similar prohibition of sex between whites and non-whites. The prohibition was finally lifted by the [[Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5513">'''Johannes Kringlebotn''' (3 July 1898 – 1959) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper editor. He edited ''[[Folketanken]]'' and, during the Nazi era in Norway, ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''. After serving a treason sentence he returned in the 1950s to edit the [[historical revisionist]] newspaper ''[[Folk og Land]]''. He was involved in politics and organizational life in the interwar period, and was also among Norway's top-ten [[middle distance track event|middle distance runners]].

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Bergen]], but grew up in [[Østfold]] and [[Aust-Agder]]. His father was the manager of Holt Agricultural School.&lt;ref name=fl&gt;{{cite news|title=Ved Kringlebotns fratreden i Folk og Land|last=Trahaug|first=Eilev|date=14 December 1957|work=Folk og Land|url=http://www.sno.no/applications/DocumentLibraryManager/upload/FL/1957_40/1957_40_3a.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of politician [[Berge Helle Kringlebotn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{stortingetbio|BEKR|name=Berge Helle Kringlebotn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Noregs Ungdomslag]] and [[Noregs Mållag]] during his younger days, and also competed for the sports club [[IL i BUL]].&lt;ref name=fl/&gt; In 1923 he was registered as among the top ten in two middle distance events; he was the ninth fastest Norwegian in the [[800 metres]] (2:05.6 minutes at [[Dælenenga]] in August; the fastest Norwegian was later Nazi [[Charles Hoff]]) and the seventh fastest Norwegian in the [[1500 metres]] (4:18.5 minutes at Dælenenga in June).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/arsstatistikk/Documents/1923.pdf |title=Norge/Norway 1923 (men) |last=Johansen |first=Tore |year=1985 |work=PDF |publisher=Norwegian Athletics |accessdate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831222818/http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/arsstatistikk/Documents/1923.pdf |archivedate=31 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his journalistic career in local newspapers as well as ''[[Den 17de Mai]]'' and ''[[Morgenbladet]]''. He edited the [[Risør]] newspaper ''[[Folketanken]]'' from 1923, succeeding Andreas Hansson.&lt;ref name=fl/&gt;

==Second World War and beyond==
When the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] started, he turned ''Folketanken'' into a Nazi newspaper,&lt;ref name=purge&gt;{{cite news|title=Rikstaleren Kringlebotn|last=|first=|date=13 August 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1941 he was hired as editor of ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]'' as it was usurped by Nazis and [[Sven Oftedal (politician)|Sven Oftedal]] was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slå ned Aftenbladet!|last=Omdal|first=Sven Egil|date=23 April 2010|work=Stavanger Aftenblad|pages=28–29|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor from 18 April 1941 to 27 June 1942.&lt;ref name=purge/&gt;

He lost his position at the war's end. During the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]] he was tried in court for being a [[Nasjonal Samling]] member from September 1940, being the local party leader in [[Risør (town)|Risør]] from October 1940, being acting mayor in Risør from January to April 1941, being a [[Hird (Nazi)|Hird]] member and holding several pro-Nazi speeches all over Norway between 1940 and 1942. He was also tried for several actions as editor of ''Stavanger Aftenblad'', among others the [[delator|denouncing]] of salesman Josef Kvavik and illustrator [[Henry Imsland]].&lt;ref name=purge/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Imsland was supposedly imprisoned as a result of this, but he is not included in {{cite book|editor=[[Kristian Ottosen|Ottosen, Kristian]]|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-15-00288-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor wanted eight years of forced labour and confiscation of money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Svermer og landssviker|last=|first=|date=16 August 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Gulating Court of Appeal]] in August 1946 he was sentenced for treason to four years of forced labour. None of his money was confiscated. He was acquitted for several of the trial points.&lt;ref name=purge/&gt;

In 1952 he became editor-in-chief of the [[historical revisionist]] newspaper ''[[Folk og Land]]''. He remained editor up to and including 1957, and was succeeded by former ''[[Fritt Folk]]'' editor and Nazi [[Odd Erling Melsom]].&lt;ref name=npresse&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|editor=Flo, Idar|title=Norske aviser fra A til Å|series=Volume four of ''[[Norsk presses historie 1660–2010]]''|year=2010|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-15-01604-7|page=116|chapter=''Folk og Land''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kringlebotn died in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/vis.php?mode=x|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kelly de Almeida Key''' (born March 3, 1983), known for her stage name '''Kelly Key''', is a [[Portuguese-Brazilian]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]].

== Biography ==

===2001–04: Debut album, ''Do Meu Jeito'' and live album===
[[File:Kelly Key 2003 021.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kelly Key in 2003.]]

Of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese descent]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_150/152_kelly_key.html Kelly Key Ask Men] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602221728/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_150/152_kelly_key.html |date=2009-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key released her first, [[Kelly Key (2001 album)|self-titled album]] in 2001 at the age of 17. Her first single was the song "Escondido" ("Hidden") in which she sang the suggestive lyics 'We went out to make out and to make love'. The song received lots of airplay thanks to her then-boyfriend, Brazilian funk singer [[Latino (singer)|Latino]], who she had dated for years, and the risqué lyrics.

Her big breakthrough was the song "Baba" ("Drool") which was the biggest hit in the country during 2001 and 2002. In the controversial song and music video, Kelly provokes an older man that ignored her when she was young and infatuated with him, but now that she's older, is sexually attracted to her.  Thanks to the success of the song, the album went 2x platinum in Brazil and selling over 500.000 copies. In 2002 was released to international markets. Furthermore, Key's first two singles comprised highly explicit [[Human sexuality|sexual]] content; although, the albums appealed predominantly to minors. The album would later tender two more successful singles: ''Cachorrinho'' ("Little Dog"), about a petulant man and his eventual apprehension of the reality of his relationship with his female boss, and "Anjo" ("Angel"), a sad ballad. Both songs received major airplay and were big radio hits.

[[File:Kelly Key 2005.png|thumb|right|180px|Kelly Key in 2005.]]
She spawned a doll, a shoes line and lots of other products targeted at young girls during her early years. In the same year, Kelly received substantial exposure after appearing on the covers of various [[gossip magazine]]s due to her divorce with Latino, which did not end amicably, and participation in a recent ''[[Playboy]]'' exposé. In 2002 was released [[Kelly Key en Español]], a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version of the debut album only in [[Latin America]], selling a 50,000 copies, and also was released [[Remix Hits]], a remix album for the [[LGBT]] clubs, selling 100,000 copies worldwide. On 2003 saw the release of Key's second album ''[[Do Meu Jeito]]'' (en: My Way). Following "Baba"'s legacy, the album's first single, "Adoleta", recited Key's difficult relationship with a younger man. Key also released "Chic Chic", song about the fame. The album sold 300,000 copies in Brazil.

===2005–09: ''Kelly Key'', ''Por Que Não?'' and music hiatus===

In 2005, after changing the writers and producers of her first works, Key went through a transformation to her third studio album, [[Kelly Key (2005 album)|Kelly Key 2005]] which featured [[teen pop]] songs. The album featured the hits "Escuta Aqui, Rapaz" ("Listen, Boy") and a remake of [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]'s 1997 hit "[[Barbie Girl]]", selling about 100,000 copies in Brazil. In 2006 she released her last album on the [[Warner Music]] label, ''[[Por Que Não?]]'' (English: ''Why Not?''), selling 45,000 copies. The album spawned the hits "Pegue e Puxe" ("Reach and Pull"), "Shake Boom" and "Analista" ("Analyst").

In 2007 Key released her first compilation, ''[[100% Kelly Key]]'', by Som Livre Records, her new label, selling 50,000 copies. The album released the smash "Você é o Cara" ("You're the Dude"), reaching her seventh number one single in [[Brazil]]. In 2008 Key released her fifth studio album ''[[Kelly Key (2008 album)|Kelly Key]]'', rescuing adult themes and selling 40,000 copies. In 2009 Key left Som Livre Records to become a presenter.

===2010–present: Television career and ''No Controle''===

In 2009 she became host of the [[Rede Record]]'s TV show ''Hoje em Dia'' with other presenters. In 2010, she became host of her own TV show, the ''Game Show de Verão''. In 2011 she returned to music and released her first [[house music]] [[single (music)|single]], "O Problema é Meu" ("The Problem is Mine"), which featured DJ and producer ''Mister Jam''. On November 15, she released her debut English [[single (music)|single]], "[[Shaking (Party People)]] for the [[LBGT]] charts. Currently, Brown is recording tracks for a 2012 album, produced by ''Mister Jam'' and inspired by [[LGBT]] songs.

In 2014 Kelly announced return to the stage, the first single "Controle", marks his return to music after 5 years dedicating herself exclusively to television. On February 3, 2015, the singer released her sixth studio album ''"No Controle"'', which contains a sound inspired by the rhythms [[kizomba]], [[zouk]] and [[electronic music]].

==Philanthropy and other activities==
Key has a great success with the [[LGBT people in Brazil]], and she supports [[same-sex marriage]] in the country. She was a spokesperson to high-school age young adults in a campaign in which she said, "Show how you've grown up. This [[Bahian Carnival|Carnaval]], use condoms."&lt;ref name="Brazil1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okie|first=Susan|title=Fighting HIV - Lessons from Brazil|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=[[Massachusetts Medical Society]] |date=May 11, 2006|volume=354|pages=1977–1981|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp068069|accessdate=24 October 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMp068069|pmid=16687709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people in [[Bhutan]] may face legal challenges not faced by non-LGBT people. [[Homosexuality]] is illegal in Bhutan. The Penal Code (aticles 213 and 214) states that same-sex sexual acts (regardless of whether they were consensual or done in private) are punishable by a prison sentence of between one month to less than one year.&lt;ref name="ILGA 2012"/&gt;

LGBT people in Bhutan face little violence or persecution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/meet-bhutans-first-openly-gay-couple/|title=Bhutan's first openly gay couple get nothing but love from the public|date=12 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though most Bhutanese do not know they even exist with the idea of being gay or transgender "pretty much unheard of". In recent years, due to Bhutan opening up more to the outside world, Bhutanese LGBT people have started to publicly come out and establish visible outlets for the LGBT community. As such, attitudes among the general population are changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/28/gay-in-nirvana-bhutan-s-lgbt-population-emerges-from-the-shadows|title=Gay in Nirvana: Bhutan's LGBT Population Emerges from the Shadows|first=Hugh|last=Ryan|date=28 October 2015|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activtity==
The [[United States Department of State]] issues this warning to LGBT travelers to Bhutan: "Although there are no laws that explicitly prohibit consensual same-sex sexual activity, laws against "sodomy or any other sexual conduct that is against the order of nature" exist. Under the Penal Code, a person can be imprisoned for as long as one year for engaging in such acts. One government official noted that prosecution under this law is rare, as criminal intent must be proven by the prosecution. There have been no reported cases of such charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1068.html#safety |accessdate=2013-08-15 |title=Bhutan- Threats to Safety and Security |first= |last= |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] online |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065136/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1068.html |archivedate=28 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decriminalisation efforts===
Some members of the [[Parliament of Bhutan]] have publicly called for the laws to be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/bhutan-lawmaker-says-law-criminalizing-gays-may-go160913/|title=Bhutan lawmaker says law criminalizing gays may go|date=16 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationship==
Currently, Bhutan does not provide any form of legal recognition for same-sex couples.

==Blood donation==
According to the Bhutan Medical and Health Council, anyone in good health aged at least 18 years and weighing at least 45kg (100 lbs) may donate. Until recently, there have been few restrictions on blood donations in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who can be a blood donor?|url=http://www.bmhc.gov.bt/news/give-the-gift-of-life-donate-blood/|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance about homosexuality is common due to stereotypes in popular culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhutan's underground gay community seeks acceptance|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-16/an-bhutans-hidden-gay-community-seeks-acceptance/4960248|accessdate=31 December 2014|date=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutanese culture does not share the typical Western view of heterosexuality and homosexuality. Some have referred to it as an openly bisexual society, although this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/g-bhutan.html|title=Bhutan - GlobalGayz|website=www.globalgayz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more likely than men to be open about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="equal"/&gt; There are cultural and traditional struggles for those who seek acceptance.&lt;ref name="equal"&gt;{{cite web|title=More equal or less equal?|url=http://bhutanobserver.bt/2345-bo-news-about-more_equal_or_less_equal.aspx|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2016 Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) survey, over 42% of transgender women and 23% of gay and bisexual men in Bhutan have attempted suicide more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/194152/lgbt-bhutan/|title=Amid Widespread Stigma and Harassment, Bhutan's LGBT Community Seeks Acceptance|website=The Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], the main religion of Bhutan does not condemn homosexuality. In 2015, [[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]], Bhutan's most prominent Buddhist teacher, said that sexual orientation has nothing to do with who will reach enlightenment. He further stated that Bhutanese should not merely tolerate gay people but should respect them.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;

''[[Bhutan Observer]]'', one of the country's main weekly newspapers, has written a significant number of articles on LGBT issues which elicited a lot of interest making them the most commented articles on the paper's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/6340-bo-news-about-how_gay_are_bhutanese_gays.aspx|accessdate=2017-04-14 |title=How Gay Are Bhutanese Gays? |first=Phuntsho |last=Wangmo |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government-supported newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'', meanwhile, has referred to gays as being the "Third Gender" in an article discussing HIV programmes targeted towards gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2011/?p=21883 |accessdate=2011-11-28 |title=Healthcare for the third gender |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=2011-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Jarble |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dasho [[Neten Zangmo]], described as "the most important woman in the country" and the "Iron Lady of Bhutan", was the first senior Bhutanese government official to make a comment about gay Bhutanese, when she said in a speech in August 2014 to high school students: "Romantic relationships, by the way, can be boy-boy or girl-girl."&lt;ref name="be"&gt;[http://www.glreview.org/article/to-be-or-not-to-be-in-bhutan/ To Be, or Not to Be, in Bhutan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia]] was first celebrated in Bhutan in 2016. [[United Nations]] offices in the country launched a video campaign to defend the rights of LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dayagainsthomophobia.org/welcome-to-idahot-newbies/|title=Welcome to IDAHOT Newbies !|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhutan Kuen-Nyam Party]] has expressed support for LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/bkp-pledges-an-inclusive-government/|title=BKP pledges an inclusive government – KuenselOnline|website=www.kuenselonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A same-sex couple who went public with their relationship in 2018 reported being fully accepted by their families and friends.&lt;ref name="bhutanese"/&gt;

===Public opinion===
One of the first homosexuality opinion polls in Bhutan carried out by an exchange student at the Royal Thimphu College on campus with 150 participants resulted in the following responses in 2013. 60% of the respondents believed that homosexuality is immoral and 40% believed that homosexuality should be accepted and homosexuals protected from discrimination and harm. However, with only 150 participants and all of which were within a single area, the validity of the poll to be used as a national basis is very lacking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Statistics===
According to 2018 estimates from the [[United Nations Development Programme]], there were about 9,100 [[men who have sex with men]] in Bhutan.&lt;ref name="bhutanese"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebhutanese.bt/bhutans-first-public-gay-couple-receive-positive-responses-after-coming-out/|title=Bhutan's first public Gay couple receive positive responses after coming out - The Bhutanese|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights reports ===
====2017 United States Department of State report====
In 2017, the United States Department of State reported the following, concerning the status of LGBT rights in Bhutan:

*Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity&lt;br /&gt;"The constitution guarantees equal protection of the laws and application of rights but does not explicitly protect individuals from discrimination for sexual orientation or gender identity. Laws against “sodomy or any other sexual conduct that is against the order of nature” exist. The penal code imposes penalties of up to one year in prison for engaging in prohibited sexual conduct.&lt;br/&gt; Members of the LGBTI community reported instances of discrimination and social stigma based on sexual orientation.&lt;br/&gt; The law does not provide any distinct legal status to transgender individuals, nor does it provide explicit protections."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277523.pdf BHUTAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ]{{PD-notice}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], '''lèse majesté''' is criminalized by '''Section 112''' of the Thai Criminal Code. It is illegal to [[defamation|defame]], insult, or threaten the king, queen, heir-apparent, or regent. The [[lèse-majesté]] law has been on the statute books since 1908. The punishment is three to fifteen years of imprisonment per [[Criminal charge|count]] and has been described as the "world's harshest lèse majesté law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-10/thai-king-requests-constitutional-changes-to-ensure-powers/8174062|title=New Thai King requests constitutional changes to 'ensure his royal powers': Prime Minister|author-first=Liam|author-last=Cochrane|date=2017-01-11|accessdate=2017-04-20|publisher=ABC|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "possibly the strictest criminal-defamation law anywhere".&lt;ref name="economist" &gt;{{cite news|title=How powerful people use criminal-defamation laws to silence their critics|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21724993-some-countries-insulting-politicians-can-lead-jail-how-powerful-people-use|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social scientist Michael Connors has written that enforcement of Thailand's lèse majesté law "has been in the interest of the palace."&lt;ref name="Connors"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

There is no legal definition, however, of what actions constitute lèse majesté, and there is plenty of room for interpretation. The [[Supreme Court of Thailand|Supreme Court]] decided that the law also applies to any previous monarchs. Criticism of any [[Privy Council of Thailand|privy council member]] also raised the question. Even "[[attempt]]ing" to commit lèse majesté, and making sarcastic comment about the King's pet have been prosecuted for lèse majesté.

Lèse-majesté complaints can be filed by any person against anyone else, and they must always be formally investigated.&lt;ref name="explained"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29628191 Thailand's lèse-majesté laws explained]&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions from the beginning to the end of a case, especially when asking for a provisional release.&lt;ref name = "sunday appointment"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = iLaw | title = รอบอาทิตย์แรก ธ.ค. 54: อากงSMS effect | date = 2 December 2011 | url = http://ilaw.or.th/node/1286 | accessdate = 9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Indefinite detention without trial|months-long pretrial detention]]s, and those who are charged are routinely denied [[bail]]. The United Nations [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated [[international human rights law]].&lt;ref name="HRW14"&gt;Human Rights Watch. [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/thailand World Report 2014: Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting the [[reasonable doubt|benefit of the doubt]] to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not have to prove the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal [[pardon]].

Coup makers, since the coup in 1976, have regularly cited a surge of alleged lèse-majesté as a prerequisite for overthrowing an elected government. The [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 coup]], when lèse-majesté was cited as one of the major reasons, marked a surge of the lèse-majesté cases.&lt;ref name="2014highest"&gt;[http://prachatai.com/english/node/4218 2014 coup marks the highest number of lèse-majesté prisoners in Thai history]. ''Prachatai''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2014 Thai coup d'état]], Thailand had the highest number of lèse-majesté prisoners in the nation's history.&lt;ref name="2014highest"/&gt; The [[National Council for Peace and Order|junta]] granted authority to [[Court-martial|army courts]] to prosecute lèse-majesté. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The longest recorded sentence was 60 years imprisonment (reduced to half because the defendant pleaded guilty).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/record-jail-terms-for-royal-insults Record jail terms for royal insults]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-lesemajeste-idUSKCN0QC1D620150807 Thai courts hand down record sentences for royal insults]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secret trial]]s and harsh punishments have also been used.

==Scope of the law==
As lèse-majesté is listed as one of the offences relating to the security of the kingdom, according to section 7 of the Thai Criminal Code, even alleged offences committed outside the kingdom can be punished within Thailand.

Section 112 of Thai Criminal Code currently reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the [[Constitution of Thailand|Constitution]] adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The penalty for lèse-majesté in Thailand was toughened from a maximum of seven years imprisonment during the premiership of royalist [[Tanin Kraivixien]] (1976–77). Also banned was criticism of any member of the royal family, royal development projects, the institution of royalty, the Chakri Dynasty, or any previous Thai king. These harsher provisions have been retained to the present day.&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;

In 2007, controversy arose over whether criticism of members of Bhumibol's [[Privy Council of Thailand|privy council]] also constituted criticism of Bhumibol.&lt;ref name="foes"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 April 2007 |url=http://pages.citebite.com/v1x4o9y3g2jxi|title=Authorities close in on Prem's foes|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Special Branch Commander Lt Gen Theeradech Rodpho-thong refused to file charges of ''lèse-majesté'' against activists who launched a petition to oust Privy Council President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], declaring that the law only applied to members of the royal family.&lt;ref name="nationxyz"&gt;{{cite web|date=3 April 2007|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/03/headlines/headlines_30030967.php|title=Row festers over website seeking to oust Prem|work=The Nation|accessdate=26 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930010354/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/03/headlines/headlines_30030967.php|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he was demoted by Police Commander [[Seripisut Temiyavet]].&lt;ref name="nationabc"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 April 2007 |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/headlines/headlines_30031154.php|title=Special Branch chief demoted in reshuffle|work=The Nation|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2008–2010 Thai political crisis|Songkran 2009 unrest]], [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] accused the privy council president of masterminding the 2006 military coup. Royalists chose to interpret this as an attack on Bhumibol himself.

The [[Supreme Court of Thailand]] [[:s:Judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice No. 6378/2556|decided in 2013]] that the law also applies to any previous monarchs.

In a [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] twist, even calls to reform lèse-majesté laws have, themselves, resulted in charges of lèse-majesté.&lt;ref name="jazeerax"&gt;{{cite web |date=12 March 2007 |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/headlines/headlines_30031154.php|title=Swiss man 'insulted' Thai king|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Giles Ungpakorn]] noted that "the ''lèse-majesté'' laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy. In the past, the laws have been used to protect governments and to shield military coups from lawful criticism. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace."&lt;ref name="frenchmanjail"&gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/13/wthai13.xml|title=Swiss man faces jail for lèse majesté|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Conners argued that some even used it as a political weapon, but it has been in the interest of the palace.&lt;ref name="Conners"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

In 2013, a man was found guilty of "preparing and [[attempt]]ing" to commit an act of lèse-majesté. He had images and captions deemed to defame or threaten the royal family in his electronic device—which, his accusers said, potentially could have been connected to the Internet and been spread online. But the police seized the material before it was posted. He was found guilty, despite the law providing that mere preparation of the act is not a legal offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedom.ilaw.or.th/en/blog/new-lese-majeste-precedence-set-thailand%E2%80%99s-public-prosecutors-and-court New lèse-majesté precedents set by Thailand’s public prosecutors and Court]. (iLaw).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a singer and activist, in addition to his prison sentence for defaming the monarchy, was ordered to write a song promoting "national reconciliation" after completing his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/06/01/singer-gets-7-years-for-lese-majeste-must-write-reconciliation-song/ Singer Gets 7 Years for Lèse-Majesté, Must Write 'Reconciliation Song']. ''Khaosod English''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal proceedings ===
In 2013, a person filed lèse-majesté charges against his brother, showing how easily the lèse-majesté law can be misused and that the law has now become a potential weapon in family feuds. Often the police, courts, and prosecutors are afraid they will be accused of disloyalty to the monarch if they fail to prosecute allegations of lèse-majesté.&lt;ref name="HRW14"/&gt;

Details of the charges are rarely made public for fear of compounding the offence by repeating the original words deemed to have been insulting.

Article 14 of the Computer Crimes Act BE 2550 (2007), which broadly bars the circulation through computer systems of information and material deemed detrimental to national security, has also been used to prosecute cases of lèse-majesté.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/02/thailand-end-harsh-punishments-lese-majeste-offenses Thailand: End Harsh Punishments for Lèse-Majesté Offenses]. Human Right Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Ampon Tangnoppakul]], the Criminal Court found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The prosecutor could not expressly prove that the defendant sent the messages as mentioned in the charge...but the grounds for his inability to introduce any eyewitnesses are the serious nature of the offence in question, to such an extent that a person intending to commit it would conduct the commission in absence of others...It needs to derive the guilt from the circumstantial evidence introduced by the prosecutor...And every circumstance evidence adduced by the prosecutor could firmly, proximately and reasonably indicate all circumstances giving rise to an absolute belief that during the periods of time aforementioned, the defendant sent the four messages as accused."&lt;ref name = "decision"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Judiciary of Thailand#Courts of Justice|Courts of Justice of Thailand]] | title = คำพิพากษาคดีอากง (ฉบับเต็ม) | date = 23 December 2011 | url = http://th.wikisource.org/wiki/คำพิพากษาศาลอาญา_ในคดีหมายเลขแดงที่_อ._๔๗๒๖/๒๕๕๔ | accessdate = 9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to why the court did not grant the benefit of the doubt to Ampon, Court of Justice spokesperson Sitthisak Wanachaikit replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the public prosecutor who institutes the proceedings can exercise his [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to the extent of bringing to light the evil intent of the defendant...the defendant needs to be punished according to the gravity of the case."&lt;ref name = "having no compassion"&gt;{{cite web | author = สิทธิศักดิ์ วนะชกิจ | title = อากงปลงไม่ตก (2) | date = 9 May 2012 | url = http://news.coj.go.th/document/03022012101049rkong2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The courts sometimes use [[videoconferencing]] systems for court proceedings, so that defendants do not have to be physically present in the court. Judges have also said the accuser did not necessarily have to prove the information was factual "because if it is true, it is more defamatory, and if it isn't true, then it's super-defamatory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Court-defers-lese-majeste-case-defence-advised-30186584.html Court defers lèse-majesté case, defence advised]&lt;/ref&gt; Detainees are seen barefoot and shackled at the ankles when brought to court,&lt;ref name="Time14"/&gt; while two detainees have [[Death in custody|died in military custody]].

''BBC''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleading guilty to committing lèse-majesté is seen as a move to seek a royal [[pardon]] if a person is handed a lengthy prison term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/995117/tom-dundee-confesses-to-lese-majeste Tom Dundee confesses to lèse-majesté].

''Bangkok Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acts punished ===

In 1976, a man was arrested on charges of lèse-majesté for using a royal [[village scout]] scarf to wipe a table.&lt;ref name="Conners"/&gt;{{rp|134}} In 1988, a politician served four year imprisonment for suggesting that life would have been easier had he been born in
the palace.&lt;ref name="Conners"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

Acts deemed insulting to Bhumibol's image are also considered as criminal offences under the doctrine of lèse-majesté in Thailand. This includes placing photographs of anybody on a website in such a way as to appear above photographs of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [http://in.reuters.com/article/asiaCompanyAndMarkets/idINBKK26310120080602 BBC rejects Thai royal slur complaint], 2 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 Oliver Jufer, a Swiss man, was sentenced to 10 years in jail for daubing black paint on portraits of Bhumibol while drunk in [[Chiang Mai]],&lt;ref name="bbcjailed"&gt;{{cite news |date=29 March 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6505237.stm |title=Swiss man jailed for Thai insult |work=BBC News |accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6498297.stm Sensitive heads of state], 29 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; although he received a royal [[pardon]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai king pardons man who defaced his portrait|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/12/thailand|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suwicha Thakor was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison, later commuted to 10, for posting a picture on an Internet web board that was deemed insulting to Bhumibol, thereby violating section 112 of the Criminal Code and violating the Computer Crime Act (CCA) of 2007. The CCA was passed by the military junta following the 2006 coup.

== History ==
Michael Kelly Connors, a professor in social science from University of Nottingham, wrote that the king had dual position: an agent of political and economic interests and the soul of the nation of glaring disparity between social classes, and thus required controlled imagery. Lèse majesté was enforced actively since 1976. Lèse majesté changed from offense against the monarchy to offense against national security in 1957.&lt;ref name="Conners"&gt;{{cite book |last= Connors |first= Michael Kelly |date= 2003 |title= Democracy and National Identity in Thailand |url= |location= |publisher= RoutledgeCurzon |page= |isbn= 0-203-36163-6 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}

The stage-managed role of the monarch, the compulsory respect shown to the institution, and the pressure of social conformity left many
people with a taste of bitterness which few felt confident to express. Thai elites feared that Thai monarchy will be subjected to mockery once it was open to scrutiny, just like the British monarchy.&lt;ref name="Conners"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

Premier [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] and royalist activist [[Sondhi Limthongkul]] both filed charges of lèse majesté against each other during the [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|2005–2006 political crisis]].

During his birthday speech in 2005, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] encouraged criticism of himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid of the criticism concerning what I do wrong, because then I know. If you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human. [...] If [[Sovereign immunity|the king can do no wrong]], it is akin to looking down upon him, because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong....If someone offers criticisms suggesting that the king is wrong, then I would like to be informed of their opinion. If I am not, that could be problematic... If we hold that the king cannot be criticised or violated, then the king ends up in a difficult situation."&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite web|date=5 December 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html |title=Royal Birthday Address: 'King Can Do Wrong' |work=The Nation |accessdate=26 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DAzbOJh9?url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html |archivedate=25 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-2006 coup===
After the [[2006 Thai coup d'état]], dozens of radio stations have also been shut down due to alleged lèse majesté insults.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Without Borders, [http://en.rsf.org/thailande-lese-majeste-charge-used-to-02-05-2011,40121.html Lèse-majesté charge used to crack down on opposition media], 2 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have been investigated, imprisoned, and forced into exile over accusations of lèse-majesté. In 2007, Boonsong Chaisingkananon of [[Silpakorn University]] was the subject of a police investigation for asking students in an exam to discuss whether the monarchy was necessary in principle for Thai society and if it could be reformed to be consistent with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article112.blogspot.com/2011/03/blog-post_6472.html กรณีบุญส่ง ชัยสิงห์กานานนท์], 30 มีนาคม พ.ศ. 2554&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent historian [[Somsak Jeamteerasakul]] was arrested for proposing an eight-point plan on the reform of the monarchy.

Observers attribute the increasing number of lèse-majesté cases in recent years to King Bhumibol's public invitation of criticism in 2005, increased polarization following the 2006 military coup, and to speculation over his declining health.&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110527/ap_on_re_as/as_thailand_monarchy |title=Thailand arrests American for alleged king insult |author=Todd Pitman and Sinfah Tunsarawuth |date=27 March 2011 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO), the [[military junta]], granted authority to a military tribunal to prosecute lèse-majesté in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/4021 All crimes involving alleged lèse-majesté, sedition subjected to Military Court: Thai Coup makers]", 25 May 2014.

In August 2015, the Bangkok Military Court sentenced Pongsak Sriboonpeng to 60 years in prison for his six Facebook postings (later reduced to 30 years, when he pleaded guilty). It was Thailand's longest recorded sentence for lèse-majesté.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Running Afoul of the Thai Monarchy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/18/world/asia/thailand-king-lese-majeste.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: UPR Submission 2015|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/21/thailand-upr-submission-2015|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 September 2015|date=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts were dubbed "[[kangaroo court]]s."&lt;ref name="Time14"/&gt;

Human rights groups say the lèse-majesté laws have been used as a political weapon to stifle [[free speech]].&lt;ref name="explained"/&gt; iLaw, a Thai non-profit organization seeking legislative change, released a 2014 annual report which details changes after the 2014 coup. The junta issued orders and invoked martial law to hold persons in custody for seven days without pressing any charges against them. [[Secret trial]]s were used. The officials seized personal communication devices to search for incriminating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedom.ilaw.or.th/en/report/2014/LeseMajeste 2014 Situation Summary Report 2/5: Lèse-majesté cases: One step forward, three steps backward]. iLaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies]], the [[United States Ambassador to Thailand|US ambassador to Thailand]], was investigated for a speech criticizing long prison sentences handed to those found guilty of lèse-majesté.

In December 2016, Jatupat “Pai” Boonpattararaksa, a rights group member was accused of lèse majesté for sharing BBC Thai biography of Thailand's new king [[Vajiralongkorn]].

Of particular concern to Thailand relating to the Internet are (1) malicious comments made against the institution of the monarchy and the royal families, who are by law not in a position to defend themselves, (2) improper content and language aimed at inciting hatred and undermining national security for political or other reasons, and (3) pornographic content, in particular child pornography.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The government, through the Office of Prevention and Suppression of Information Technology Crimes, maintains a "war room" where about a dozen computer specialists monitor the content of the Internet for pages which disparage the monarchy or pose a threat to national security. A [[web crawler]] is used to search widely. When an offending image or language is found the office obtains a court order blocking the site. On 28 October 2008, The [[Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (Thailand)|Ministry of Information and Communication Technology]] (MICT) announced plans to spend about 100–500 million baht to build a gateway to block websites with contents defaming the royal institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=28 October 2008|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=131678 |title=Thailand firewall to block 'offensive' websites|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website of Same Sky Books, publishers of ''[[Same Sky (magazine)|Same Sky]]'' magazine, was shut down by the military government after comments on its bulletin board questioned claims made by the Thai media that the entire country was in mourning over the death of Princess [[Galyani Vadhana]].&lt;ref&gt;AP, [http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Jan06/0,4675,ThailandWebSiteBan,00.html Thailand Shuts Down Political Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the court verdict against [[Prachatai|Chiranuch Premchaiporn]], webmaster of the news website ''Prachatai'', was upheld in the highest court: "an eight-month suspended jail sentence and a 20,000 baht fine".&lt;ref name="chiangraitimes.com"&gt;http://www.chiangraitimes.com/court-upholds-lese-majeste-conviction-of-newspaper-editor-chiranuch-premchaiporn.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, she had been jailed without bail for nearly a year for not removing—in 2008&lt;ref name="chiangraitimes.com"/&gt;—an allegedly insulting comment from an article fast enough.

== Opinion ==

=== Support ===
A Thai official said that the lèse majesté law is similar to [[libel]] law for commoners. Some abuse their rights by spreading [[hate speech]]es or distorted information to incite hatred towards the monarchical institution. Those who were accused of lèse majesté had [[right to fair trial]], due opportunity to contest the charges and assistance from lawyer, as well as the [[right to appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE USE OF THE LÈSE-MAJESTÉ LAW IN THAILAND|url=http://www.thaiembassy.sg/press_media/news-highlights/the-use-of-the-l%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9-law-in-thailand|website=Royal Thai Embassy Singapore|publisher=Government of Thailand|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Justice Minister remarked on "concerns raised by United Nations Security Council member countries during the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) in Geneva" on 11 May 2016: "that foreign countries would not understand why Thailand needs the lèse majesté law because they are not "civilised" nations with cultural refinement like ours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Address UN rights worries|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/address-un-rights-worries/972541|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=14 May 2016|format=Editorial|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge in a lèse majesté case, which a man was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison, said he would have given a longer sentence, but was advised on the shorter term by the court's deputy president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/997653/singer-tom-dundee-gets-7-years-6-months-for-lese-majeste Singer Tom Dundee gets 7 years, 6 months for lese majeste]. ''Bangkok Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppose ===
The lèse majesté law is described as "[[wikt:draconian|draconian]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34661870 Thailand lese majeste: 'More arrests' due over Crown Prince plot]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] considers anyone jailed for insulting Bhumibol to be a [[political prisoner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bangkok Post'', [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/257120/all-eyes-on-article-112 All eyes on Article 112], 18 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 112 is typically deployed with politically expedient timing, rather than at the time of the supposed offense. [[Jakrapob Penkair]], a former Minister to the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]], commented "It’s not about your action; it’s about the timing. They wait until the moment when you seem most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Time14"&gt;[http://time.com/3650981/thailand-lese-majeste-article-112/ The Draconian Legal Weapon Being Used to Silence Thai Dissent]. ''Time''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[UN Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], commenting on the detention of a Thai national who posted a link to a Thai language [[BBC]] profile of Thailand's new king, said, "Public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority, may be subject to criticism, and the fact that some forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify restrictions or penalties." Kaye went on to say that such laws "have no place in a democratic country" and called for Thailand to repeal them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN slams Thailand for first royal slur charge under new king|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2068736/un-slams-thailand-first-royal-slur-charge-under-new-king|agency=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=South China Morning Post|date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mennonite Central Committee''' (MCC) is a relief, service, and peace agency representing fifteen [[Mennonite]], [[Brethren in Christ]] and [[Amish]] bodies in [[North America]]. The U.S. headquarters are in [[Akron, Pennsylvania]], the Canadian in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

==History==
[[Image:CPS141ratpoison.jpg|thumb|Mennonite [[Civilian Public Service]] worker Harry Lantz distributes rat poison for [[Endemic typhus|typhus]] control in Gulfport, Mississippi.]]

Founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]], MCC held its first meeting on September 27, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Its original goal was to provide food for Mennonites starving in Ukraine.  MCC soon realized that it could not help only their Mennonite brothers and sisters and began to help anyone in need. MCC (Canada) was founded in 1963.

The initial work of MCC focused on:&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
:1920-1925: famine work in Ukraine.
:1925-1930: inactive
:1930-1937: colonization of [[Russian Mennonite]] and [[Bruderhof]] refugees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://robertbuck.blog/2017/10/23/why-i-keep-talking-about-alternativity-the-bruderhof-and-church-of-all-nations/|title=Why I Keep Talking About…Alternativity, the Bruderhof, and Church of All Nations|date=2017-10-23|work=Proximity|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in Paraguay and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:1939-present: relief work; initially in Poland, then (1940) England and France.
:1941-1947: administration of [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS) as part of [[Center on Conscience &amp; War|National Service Board for Religious Objectors]].
:1950s: administration of 1-W service, the replacement of CPS, for draftees classified as [[conscientious objector]]s.

===Famine in Ukraine===
Mennonites of [[Molotschna]] sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to aid these [[Russian Mennonite]]s. P. C. Hiebert of the [[Mennonite Brethren Church]] initially chaired the organization, with secretary Levi Mumaw of the (Old) Mennonite Church and attorney Maxwell Kratz of the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]]. Other Mennonite conferences joined later.

The new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in [[Istanbul]]. The Istanbul group, mainly [[Goshen College]] graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]]. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt just as [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] of the [[White Army]] was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while [[Clayton Kratz]], who remained in Halbstadt (Molotschna) as the [[Red Army]]  overran the village, was never heard from again.

A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine. Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty [[Fordson]] tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. This relief effort cost $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary service===
As Civilian Public Service started to wind down in 1946, MCC began exploring a peacetime service program that would continue the types of projects performed by CPS. The new program, Voluntary Service, had several aims.&lt;ref&gt;MCC Headquarters Letter, No. 90, November 1946 as quoted by Haury pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
It would provide young people with a way to voluntarily perform Christian service for up to a year as a means of testifying more widely to the gospel and its way of love and [[nonresistance]]. Projects were to help alleviate human need in a culturally sensitive manner. The program would operate as an internship in Christian service, developing the workers' service motivation, witness and religious conviction. It would provide Mennonite young people with an opportunity to express appreciation for the material blessings, religious and other national liberties and to contribute to the well-being of the nation. Finally, it was hoped that some individuals would decide to devote their careers to full-time ministry or missionary service.

The first Voluntary Service unit started during the summer of 1946 in association with the CPS unit at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] .

==Activities==
[[Image:MCC-hq.jpg|thumb|left|[[Akron, Pennsylvania]], headquarters, August 1982.]]

MCC was an early proponent of [[fair trade]] through its [[Ten Thousand Villages]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0907/creative-giving-ten-thousand-villages-grows-with-fair-trade.html|title=Ten Thousand Villages Grows With Fair Trade|last=Ebeling|first=Ashlea|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds for MCC's worldwide relief and service projects are raised through independent [[Mennonite relief sale]]s. Around 45 sales are held throughout the United States and Canada, raising US$5 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcc.org/about/annualreport|title=Annual report 2015: Growing together in Christ|first=|last=jamesstuckeyweber|date=17 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these sales feature [[quilts]] handmade by Mennonite and Amish volunteers, [[auctions]], artwork, crafted woodwork, homemade foods, antiques, crafts, plants, children's activities, and musical programs. Most of the goods and labor are donated, and 78.2% of the funds raised go directly into the field.

MCC focuses its [[Social development|development]] efforts in areas such as health, education, peace and justice, and fair trade. It responds to [[disaster]] situations, as well as focusing its efforts on the longer-term issues of economic and social policy.

MCC maintains offices in both Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washington.mcc.org/|title=Washington Office|first=|last=jamesstuckeyweber|date=17 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ottawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccottawa.ca/|title=Ottawa Office|first=|last=jamesstuckeyweber|date=17 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to advocate to the American and Canadian federal governments, respectively. MCC also has an international advocacy office at the United Nations in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;https://mcc.org/get-involved/advocacy/un&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, [[Ewuare Osayande]] served as the group's Anti-Oppression Coordinator.&lt;ref name=Herholz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herholz|first1=Quinci|title=BLACK AND WHITE MENNONITES IN ST. LOUIS WORK TOGETHER FOR RACIAL JUSTICE|url=http://interact.stltoday.com/pr/non-profits/PR041415035721139|accessdate=19 September 2015|issue=14 April 2015|publisher=St. Louis Post-Disbatch|ref=Herholz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peacemaking===
MCC also takes an active role in advocating for peace both in North America and around the world, seeking "to be a witness against forces that contribute to poverty, injustice and violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcc.org/about/peacecommitment/practice.html Integrating peacemaking into relief, development and service] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321012703/http://www.mcc.org/about/peacecommitment/practice.html |date=March 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, MCC established the Mennonite Conciliation Service (MCS) in 1979 to encourage Mennonites and others to actively pursue peaceful resolution of conflicts. MCS was a pioneer in the burgeoning field of [[conflict resolution]] in the 1980s and director [[Ronald S. Kraybill]] led early mediation workshops in Northern Ireland which eventually led to the establishment of the Northern Ireland Mediation Network. [[John Paul Lederach]] took over MCS in 1989 when Kraybill moved on to South Africa, and in the years following, MCC moved active peace building into  the forefront of its work abroad.

Responding in part to the establishment of active Mennonite-led peace centers that had emerged in the 80s and 90s, such as the Conflict Transformation Program at [[Eastern Mennonite University]], the Lombard Mennonite Peace Center in Lombard, Illinois, a group of peace builders at [[Fresno Pacific University]], the Peace and Justice Network of the Mennonite Church and other activities, MCS was discontinued in 2004. But the Peace Office of MCC continues to advocate peace interests broadly in the US and in MCC programming abroad.  Internationally, MCC partners with local organizations to reduce violence in the aftermath of conflict or [[war]].

Perhaps one of MCC's more controversial activities is in advocating military exemption or alternative service for [[conscientious objectors]] in times of war.  MCC runs a "conscientious objector registry" in Canada, taking statements from Canadians in the hope that they will be recognized by the Canadian government should the government restart [[conscription|drafting]] citizens into the military.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9697">A '''middleman minority''' is a minority population whose main occupations link producers and consumers: traders, money-lenders, etc. A middleman minority, while possibly suffering discrimination, does not hold an "extreme subordinate" status in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Middleman Minority Concept: Its Explanatory Value in the Case of the Japanese in California Agriculture|first=David J.|last=O'Brien|author2=Stephen S. Fugita|journal=The Pacific Sociological Review|volume=25|issue=2|date=April 1982|pages=185–204|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|jstor=1388723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "middleman minority" concept was developed by sociologists like Blalock and Bonacich starting in the 1960s but is also used by political scientists and economists.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There are numerous examples of such groups gaining eventual prosperity in their adopted country despite discrimination. Often, they will take on roles between producer and consumer, such as trading and moneylending. Famous examples such as [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jews]] throughout Europe even at times when discrimination against them was high, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] throughout [[Southeast Asia]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Parsis]] in [[India]], [[Igbo people|Igbos]] in [[Nigeria]], [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|Indians]] in [[East Africa]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] in [[West Africa]], and many others.&lt;ref name=sowell&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Anti-Semitism Generic?|first =Thomas|last=Sowell|journal=[[Hoover Digest]]|volume=2005|issue=3|publisher=[[Hoover Press]]|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/anti-semitism-generic|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middleman minorities usually provide an economic benefit to communities and nations and often start new industries. However, their economic aptitude, financial success and clannishness, combined with social prejudices by other groups against businesses and moneylending, can cause resentment among the native population of a country. Middleman minorities can be victims of violence, genocide, racialist policy, or other forms of repression. Other ethnic groups often accuse them of plotting conspiracies against their nation or of stealing wealth from the native population.&lt;ref name="sowell" /&gt;

'''Operation Gladio''' is the codename for clandestine "stay-behind" operations of armed resistance that was planned by the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (WU), and subsequently by the [[NATO]], for a potential [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion and conquest in Europe. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO [[stay-behind]] organizations, "Operation Gladio" is used as an informal name for all of them. Stay-behind operations were prepared in many NATO member countries, and some neutral countries.&lt;ref name="Haberman Times 1990"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | last=Haberman | first=Clyde | last2=Times | first2=Special to The New York | title=EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Italy Discloses Its Web Of Cold War Guerrillas | journal=The New York Times | date=Nov 16, 1990  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/16/world/evolution-in-europe-italy-discloses-its-web-of-cold-war-guerrillas.html | accessdate=Feb 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[CIA]] in Gladio and the extent of its activities during the [[Cold War]] era, and any relationship to [[terrorism|terrorist attacks]] perpetrated in Italy during the "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]" (late 1960s to early 1980s) are the subject of debate. Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.be/lexdocs/S0523/S05231297.pdf "Belgian parliamentary report concerning the stay-behind network"], named "Enquête parlementaire sur l'existence en Belgique d'un réseau de renseignements clandestin international" or "Parlementair onderzoek met betrekking tot het bestaan in België van een clandestien internationaal inlichtingenetwerk" pp. 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''gladio'' is the [[Italian language|Italian]] form of ''[[gladius]]'', a type of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[shortsword]]. 

==History and general stay-behind structure==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stay-behind.png|thumb|right|Emblem of NATO's "stay-behind" paramilitary organizations.]] --&gt;

===British experience during World War II ===
Following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] created the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to both assist resistance movements and itself carry out sabotage and subversive operations in [[occupied Europe]]. It was revealed half a century later that SOE was complemented by a stay-behind organisation in Britain, created in extreme secrecy, to [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|prepare for a possible invasion by Nazi Germany]].

A network of resistance fighters was formed across Britain and arms caches were established. The network was recruited, in part, from the 5th (Ski) Battalion of the [[Scots Guards]] (which had originally been formed, but was not deployed, to fight alongside [[Finland|Finnish]] forces fighting the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]]).&lt;ref name="Scots Guards"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm|website=Scots Guards Association|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The network, which became known as the [[Auxiliary Units]], was headed by Major [[Colin Gubbins]] – an expert in guerrilla warfare (who would later lead SOE). The units were trained, in part, by [[Mike Calvert|"Mad Mike" Calvert]], a Royal Engineers officer who specialised in demolition by explosives and covert raiding operations.  To the extent that they were publicly visible, the Auxiliary Units were disguised as [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] units, under [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|GHQ Home Forces]]. The network was allegedly disbanded in 1944; some of its members subsequently joined the [[Special Air Service]] and saw action in [[Western_Front_(World_War_II)#1944–1945:_The_Second_Front|North-West Europe]]. 

While David Lampe published a book on the Auxiliary Units in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;David Lampe, ''The Last Ditch: Britain's Resistance Plans against the Nazis'' Cassell 1968 {{ISBN|0-304-92519-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; their existence did not become widely known by the public until reporters such as [[David Pallister]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' revived interest in them during the 1990s.

===Post-war creation===
After World War II, the UK and the US decided to create "stay-behind" [[paramilitary]] organizations, with the official aim of countering a possible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion through [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]] behind enemy lines. Arms caches were hidden, escape routes prepared, and loyal members recruited, whether in Italy or in other European countries.  Its clandestine "cells" were to stay behind in enemy-controlled territory and to act as [[resistance movement]]s, conducting sabotage, guerrilla warfare and assassinations.

The stay-behind armies were created with the experience and involvement of former SOE officers.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt; Following Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations, [[John Winthrop Hackett Junior|General Sir John Hackett]], former commander-in-chief of the [[British Army on the Rhine]], declared on November 16, 1990, that a contingency plan involving "stay behind and resistance in depth" was drawn up after the war. The same week, [[Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley]], former commander-in-chief of NATO's Forces in Northern Europe from 1979 to 1982, declared to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that a secret arms network was established in Britain after the war.&lt;ref name="Secretunit"/&gt; Hackett had written in 1978 a novel, ''The Third World War: August 1985'', which was a fictionalized scenario of a Soviet Army invasion of West Germany in 1985. The novel was followed in 1982 by ''[[The Third World War: The Untold Story]]'', which elaborated on the original. Farrar-Hockley had aroused controversy in 1983 when he became involved in trying to organise a campaign for a new Home Guard against a potential Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name="Farrar-Hockley"&gt;[[Dan van der Vat]]. "[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/15/guardianobituaries.military Obituary: General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley]," ''Guardian''. 15 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating in all of NATO and even in some neutral countries such as Spain before its 1982 admission to NATO, Gladio was first coordinated by the Clandestine Committee of the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (CCWU), founded in 1948. After the creation of NATO in 1949, the CCWU was integrated into the "Clandestine Planning Committee" (CPC), founded in 1951 and overseen by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), transferred to Belgium after France's official withdrawal from the NATO military organization – but not from NATO – which was not followed by the dissolution of the French stay-behind paramilitary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themindrenewed.com/transcripts/792-int-70t|title=TMR 097 : Transcript : Dr. Daniele Ganser : Operation GLADIO &amp; The Strategy of Tension|last=Dr. Daniele Ganser|first=|date=January 2016|website=The Mind Renewed - Thinking Christianly in a New World Order|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Daniele Ganser]] claims&lt;ref name="Ganser1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ganser | first=Daniele | title=Terrorism in Western Europe: An Approach to NATO's Secret Stay-Behind Armies | publisher=''[[Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations]]'', South Orange NJ, Winter/Spring 2005, Vol. 6, No. 1. | website=ISN | url=http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/kms2.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/PHP/18583/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/f4e652a3-cad7-4284-9aae-243b630f3440/en/Terrorism_Western_Europe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Next to the CPC, a second secret army command center, labeled Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC), was set up in 1957 on the orders of NATO's [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Allied Commander in Europe]] (SACEUR). This military structure provided for significant US leverage over the secret stay-behind networks in Western Europe as the SACEUR, throughout NATO's history, has traditionally been a US General who reports to the Pentagon in Washington and is based in NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. The ACC's duties included elaborating on the directives of the network, developing its clandestine capability, and organizing bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE. According to former CIA director [[William Colby]], it was 'a major program'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Coordinated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), {the secret armies} were run by the European military [[secret service]]s in close cooperation with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the British foreign secret service [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS, also MI6). Trained together with US [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]] and British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), these clandestine NATO soldiers, with access to underground arms caches, prepared to fight against a potential Soviet invasion and occupation of Western Europe, as well as the coming to power of communist parties. The clandestine international network covered the European NATO membership, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, as well as the neutral European countries of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) responded to the series of accusations made by Ganser in his book regarding the CIA's involvement in Operation Gladio, by claiming that neither Ganser nor anyone else could have solid evidence supporting their accusations. At one point in his book Ganser talks about the CIA's covert action policies as being "terrorist in nature" and then accuses the CIA of using their "networks for political terrorism". The CIA responded by noting that Daniele Ganser's sourcing is "largely secondary" and that Ganser himself has complained about "not being able to find any official sources to support his charges of the CIA's or any Western European government's involvement with Gladio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peake|first=Hayden B.|title=Intelligence in Recent Public Literature|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Bookshelf_11.htm#author|work=The Intelligence Officer's Bookshelf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of these clandestine NATO units remained a closely guarded secret throughout the Cold War until 1990, when the first branch of the international network was discovered in Italy. It was code-named ''Gladio'', the Italian word for a short double-edged sword [''[[gladius]]'']. While the press said that the NATO stay-behind units were 'the best-kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II', the Italian government, amidst sharp public criticism, promised to close down the secret army. Italy insisted identical clandestine units had also existed in all other countries of Western Europe. This allegation proved correct and subsequent research found that in Belgium, the secret NATO unit was code-named SDRA8, in Denmark Absalon, in Germany TD BDJ, in Greece LOK, in Luxemburg Stay-Behind, in the Netherlands I&amp;O, in Norway ROC, in Portugal Aginter Press, in Spain Red Quantum, in Switzerland P26, in Turkey [[Özel Harp Dairesi]], In Sweden AGAG (Aktions Gruppen Arla Gryning), in France 'Plan Bleu', and in Austria OWSGV; however, the code name of the stay-behind unit in Finland remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Ganser1"/&gt;

Upon learning of the discovery, the parliament of the [[European Union]] (EU) drafted a resolution sharply criticizing the fact.{{clarify|reason = What does this mean?|date=September 2015}} Yet only Italy, Belgium and Switzerland carried out parliamentary investigations, while the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] refused to comment.&lt;ref&gt;Len Scott, R. Gerald Hughes ''Intelligence, Crises and Security: Prospects and Retrospects'', Routledge, 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

If Gladio was effectively "the best-kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II",&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnessy, Hugh. "Gladio: Europe's Secret Networks," ''[[The Observer]]'', 18 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; it must be underlined, however, that on several occasions, arms caches were discovered and stay-behind paramilitary organizations officially dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/operation-gladio-documents-collection.pdf|title=Operation Gladio Document Collection|last=Secker|first=Tom|date=|website=Biblioteca Pleyades|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO's "stay-behind" organizations were never called upon to resist a Soviet invasion. According to a November 13, 1990, [[Reuters]] cable,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Reuters|title=Secret Cold-War Network Group Hid Arms, Belgian Member Says|date=1990-11-13|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; "André Moyen – a former member of the Belgian military security service and of the [stay-behind] network – said Gladio was not just anti-Communist but was for fighting subversion in general. He added that his predecessor had given Gladio 142 million francs ($4.6 millions) to buy new radio equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8457082.html?dids=8457082:8457082&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=NOV+14%2C+1990&amp;author=Pedrick%2C+Clare%3B+Lardner%2C+George+Jr&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=CIA+Organized+Secret+Army+in+Western+Europe&amp;pqatl=google

==Operations in NATO countries==

=== First publicly revealed in Italy ===
The Italian NATO stay-behind organization, dubbed "Gladio", was set up under [[Italian Minister of Defense|Minister of Defense]] (from 1953 to 1958) [[Paolo Emilio Taviani|Paolo Taviani]]'s ([[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]]) supervision.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;Willan, Philip.

(Obituary.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gladio's existence came to public knowledge when Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] revealed it to the Chamber of Deputies on October 24, 1990, although far-right terrorist [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] had already revealed its existence during his 1984 trial. According to media analyst [[Edward S.

====Giulio Andreotti's revelations on 24 October 1990====
Christian Democrat Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] publicly recognized the existence of Gladio on 24 October 1990. Andreotti spoke of a "structure of information, response and safeguard", with arms caches and reserve officers. He gave to the ''Commissione Stragi'', the parliamentary commission led by senator [[Giovanni Pellegrino]] in charge of investigations on bombings committed during the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years Of Lead]] in Italy, a list of 622 civilians who according to him were part of Gladio. Andreotti also stated that 127 weapons caches had been dismantled, and said that Gladio had not been involved in any of the bombings committed from the 1960s to the 1980s.

Andreotti declared that the Italian military services (predecessors of the SISMI) had joined in 1964 the Allied Clandestine Committee created in 1957 by the US, France, Belgium and Greece, and which was in charge of directing Gladio's operations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbera, Myriam. "[https://www.humanite.fr/1990-11-10_Articles_-Gladio-et-la-France Gladio: et la France?]," ''[[L'Humanité]]'', November 10, 1990 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gladio was actually set up under [[Italian Minister of Defense|Minister of Defence]] (from 1953 to 1958) [[Paolo Emilio Taviani|Paolo Taviani]]'s supervision.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; Beside, the list of Gladio members given by Andreotti was incomplete. It didn't include, for example, Antonio Arconte, who described an organization very different from the one brushed by Giulio Andreotti: an organization closely tied to the [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]] secret service and the Atlanticist strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Caso Moro.

====General Serravalle's statement====
General Gerardo Serravalle, who commanded the Italian Gladio from 1971 to 1974, related that "in the 1970s the members of the CPC [Coordination and Planning Committee] were the officers responsible for the secret structures of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Italy. These representatives of the secret structures met every year in one of the capitals... At the stay-behind meetings representatives of the CIA were always present. They had no voting rights and were from the CIA headquarters of the capital in which the meeting took place... members of the US Forces Europe Command were present, also without voting rights. "&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo Serravalle, ''Gladio'' (Rome: Edizione Associate, {{ISBN|88-267-0145-8}}, 1991), p.78-79 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the CPC a second secret command post was created in 1957, the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC). According to the Belgian Parliamentary Committee on Gladio, the ACC was "responsible for coordinating the 'Stay-behind' networks in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States". During peacetime, the activities of the ACC "included elaborating the directives for the network, developing its clandestine capability and organising bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE; organisers were to activate clandestine bases and organise operations from there".&lt;ref&gt;Belgian Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Gladio, quoted by Daniele Ganser (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; General Serravale declared to the ''Commissione Stragi'' headed by senator [[Giovanni Pellegrino]] that the Italian Gladio members trained at a military base in Britain.&lt;ref name="Secretunit"/&gt;

===Belgium===
{{Main article|Belgian stay-behind network}}

After the 1967 withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure, the SHAPE headquarters were displaced to [[Mons]] in Belgium. In 1990, following France's denial of any "stay-behind" French army, Giulio Andreotti publicly said the last Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) meeting, at which the French branch of Gladio was present, had been on October 23 and 24, 1990, under the presidency of Belgian General Van Calster, director of the [[Belgian General Information and Security Service|Belgian military secret service SGR]]. In November, Guy Coëme, the Minister of the Defense, acknowledged the existence of a Belgian "stay-behind" army, raising concerns about a similar implication in terrorist acts as in Italy. The same year, the [[European Parliament]] sharply condemned NATO and the United States in a resolution for having manipulated European politics with the stay-behind armies.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"&gt;[http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology.cfm?navinfo=15301 Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212053626/http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology.cfm?navinfo=15301 |date=2008-12-12 }}, ''Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies'', [[ETH Zurich]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/European_Parliament_resolution_on_Gladio|title=European Parliament resolution on Gladio|first=European|last=Parliament|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New legislation governing intelligence agencies' missions and methods was passed in 1998, following two government inquiries and the creation of a permanent parliamentary committee in 1991, which was to bring them under the authority of Belgium's federal agencies. The Commission was created following events in the 1980s, which included the [[Brabant massacres]] and the activities of far right group [[Westland New Post]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comiteri.be/index_en.html Official site of the Belgian Permanent Committee for the Control of Intelligence Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623222207/http://www.comiteri.be/index_en.html |date=2006-06-23 }} See "history" section in the "Presentation" part.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The Danish stay-behind army was code-named ''Absalon'', after [[Absalon|a Danish archbishop]], and led by E.J. Harder. It was hidden in the military secret service ''[[Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste]]'' (FE). In 1978, [[William Colby]], former director of the [[CIA]], released his memoirs in which he described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in [[Scandinavia]]:&lt;ref name=colby/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The situation in each Scandinavian country was different. [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] were NATO allies, [[Sweden]] held to the neutrality that had taken her through two world wars, and [[Finland]] were required to defer in its foreign policy to the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, counting on activating them from exile to carry on the struggle. These nets had to be co-ordinated with NATO's plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In other set of countries, CIA would have to do the job alone or with, at best, "unofficial" local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a World War III unharmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===France===
In 1947, Interior Minister [[Édouard Depreux]] revealed the existence of a secret stay-behind army in France codenamed "Plan Bleu". The next year, the "Western Union Clandestine Committee" (WUCC) was created to coordinate secret unorthodox warfare. In 1949, the WUCC was integrated into [[NATO]], whose headquarters were established in France, under the name "Clandestine Planning Committee" (CPC). In 1958, NATO founded the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) to coordinate secret warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems that deliver Unforgettable Customer Service|last=Duthel|first=Heinz|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|year=2014|isbn=9783738607710|location=|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology76c1.html?navinfo=15301|title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies|last=|first=|date=October 2016|website=Parallel History Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network was supported with elements from [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]], and had military support from the [[11e régiment parachutiste de choc|11th Choc regiment]]. The former director of [[Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure|DGSE]], admiral Pierre Lacoste, alleged in a 1992 interview with ''[[The Nation]]'', that certain elements from the network were involved in terrorist activities against [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] and his Algerian policy. A section of the 11th Choc regiment split over the 1962 Evian peace accords, and became part of the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS), but it is unclear if this also involved members of the French stay-behind network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Kwitny, Jonathan | url = http://www.thenation.com/archive/detail/9203303730 | title = The C.I.A.'s Secret Armies in Europe | work = The Nation | date = 1992-04-06 | pages = 446–447 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103549/http://www.thenation.com/archive/detail/9203303730 | archivedate = 2007-10-11 | df =  }} Quoted in Ganser's "Terrorism in Western Europe".{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Cogan, Charles | title = 'Stay-Behind' in France: Much ado about nothing? | journal = Journal of Strategic Studies | year = 2007 | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 937–954 | doi = 10.1080/01402390701676493 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Rose des Vents'' and ''Arc-en-ciel'' ("Rainbow") network were part of Gladio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volumen 1|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=9780815340577|location=|pages=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[François de Grossouvre]] was Gladio's leader for the region around [[Lyon]] in France until his alleged suicide on April 7, 1994. Grossouvre would have asked Constantin Melnik, leader of the French secret services during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–62), to return to activity. He was living in comfortable exile in the US, where he maintained links with the [[Rand Corporation]]. Constantin Melnik is alleged to have been involved in the creation in 1952 of the ''Ordre Souverain du Temple Solaire'', an ancestor of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]], created by former [[A.M.O.R.C.]] members, in which the [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]] (French former military intelligence agency) was interested.&lt;ref name="Amnistia"&gt;Daeninckx, Didier.

===Germany===

US intelligence also assisted in the set up of a German stay-behind network. [[CIA]] documents released in June 2006 under the [[Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group|1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act]], show that the CIA organized "stay-behind" networks of German agents between 1949 and 1953. According to the ''Washington Post'', "One network included at least two former Nazi SS members—Staff Sgt. Heinrich Hoffman and Lt. Col. Hans Rues—and one was run by Lt. Col. Walter Kopp, a former German army officer referred to by the CIA as an "unreconstructed Nazi". "The network was disbanded in 1953 amid political concerns that some members' neo-Nazi sympathies would be exposed in the West German press."&lt;ref name="CIAdocWP"&gt;Lee, Christopher. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/06/AR2006060601555_pf.html CIA Ties With Ex-Nazis Shown], ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents shown to the Italian parliamentary terrorism committee revealed that in the 1970s British and French officials involved in the network visited a training base in Germany built with US money.&lt;ref name="Secretunit"&gt;Norton-Taylor, Richard and David Gow. [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/gladio.terrorism.inquiry_graun_17nov1990.html Secret Italian Unit]," ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 17, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the secret service BND secretary Heidrun Hofer was arrested after having revealed the secrets of the German stay-behind army to her husband, who was a spy of the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt;

In 2004 the German author Norbert Juretzko published a book about his work at the BND. He went into details about recruiting partisans for the German stay-behind network. He was sacked from BND following a [[secret trial]] against him, because the BND could not find out the real name of his Russian source "[[Rübezahl]]" whom he had recruited. A man with the name he put on file was arrested by the KGB following treason in the BND, but was obviously innocent, his name having been chosen at random from the public phone book by Juretzko.&lt;ref name="Duthel2008b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinz Duthel|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Service - I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XStIIDEkEGkC&amp;pg=PA235|date=23 July 2008|publisher=Lulu Enterprises Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4092-1088-7|pages=235–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Juretzko, the BND built up its branch of Gladio, but discovered after the fall of the [[German Democratic Republic]] that it was fully known to the [[MfS|Stasi]] early on. When the network was dismantled, further odd details emerged. One fellow "spymaster" had kept the radio equipment in his cellar at home with his wife doing the engineering test call every four months, on the grounds that the equipment was too "valuable" to remain in civilian hands. Juretzko found out because this spymaster had dismantled his section of the network so quickly, there had been no time for measures such as recovering all caches of supplies.&lt;ref name="Duthel2014b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinz Duthel|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems that deliver Unforgettable Customer Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gK5gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT204|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7386-6375-4|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians recruited as stay-behind partisans were equipped with a clandestine shortwave radio with a fixed frequency. It had a keyboard with digital encryption, making use of traditional Morse code obsolete. They had a cache of further equipment for signalling helicopters or submarines to drop special agents who were to stay in the partisan's homes while mounting sabotage operations against the communists.&lt;ref name="Duthel2008b"/&gt;

===Greece===
When Greece joined NATO in 1952, the country's special forces, [[1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade (Greece)|LOK]] (''Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn'', i.e., "mountain raiding companies"), were integrated into the European stay-behind network. The CIA and LOK reconfirmed on March 25, 1955 their mutual co-operation in a secret document signed by US General [[Lucian Truscott|Truscott]] for the CIA, and [[Konstantinos Dovas]], chief of staff of the Greek military. In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion, the CIA instructed LOK to prevent a leftist coup. Former CIA agent [[Philip Agee]], who was sharply criticized in the US for having revealed sensitive information, insisted that "paramilitary groups, directed by CIA officers, operated in the sixties throughout Europe [and he stressed that] perhaps no activity of the CIA could be as clearly linked to the possibility of internal subversion."&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Agee]] and Louis Wolf, ''Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe'' (Secaucus: Lyle Stuart Inc., 1978), p.154 (quoted by Daniele Ganser) (2005) p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Daniele Ganser, LOK was involved in the [[1967 Greek coup d'état|military coup d'état on 21 April 1967]],&lt;ref name="Ganser2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganser|first=Daniele|authorlink=Daniele Ganser|date=2004|title=NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe|isbn=9780714685007|url=https://libcom.org/files/NATOs_secret_armies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|221}} which took place one month before the scheduled national elections for which opinion polls predicted an overwhelming victory of the centrist [[Center Union]] of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George]] and [[Andreas Papandreou]]. Under the command of paratrooper Lieutenant Colonel [[Costas Aslanidis|Costas Aslanides]], LOK took control of the Greek Defence Ministry while Brigadier General [[Stylianos Pattakos]] gained control of communication centers, parliament, the royal palace, and according to detailed lists, arrested over 10,000 people. According to Ganser, [[Phillips Talbot]], the US ambassador in Athens, disapproved of the military coup which established the "[[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Regime of the Colonels]]" (1967–1974), complaining that it represented "a rape of democracy"—to which Jack Maury, the CIA chief of station in Athens, answered, "How can you rape a whore?"{{r|Ganser2|p=221}}

Arrested and then exiled in Canada and Sweden, Andreas Papandreou later returned to Greece, where he won the [[Greek legislative election, 1981|1981 election]], forming the first socialist government of Greece's post-war history. According to his own testimony, Ganser alleges, he discovered the existence of the secret NATO army, then codenamed "Red Sheepskin", as acting prime minister in 1984 and had given orders to dissolve it.{{r|Ganser2|p=223}}

Following Giulio Andreotti's revelations in 1990, the Greek defence minister confirmed that a branch of the network, known as Operation Sheepskin, operated in his country until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/nato.net.france_graun_14nov1990.html NATO's secret network 'also operated in France']", ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 14, 1990, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, journalist Kleanthis Grivas published an article in ''To Proto Thema'', a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused "Sheepskin" for the assassination of CIA station chief [[Richard Welch]] in Athens in 1975, as well as the assassination of British military attaché [[Stephen Saunders (British Army officer)|Stephen Saunders]] in 2000. This was denied by the [[US State Department]], who responded that "the Greek terrorist organization '[[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]]" was responsible for both assassinations", and that Grivas's central piece of evidence had been the [[Westmoreland Field Manual]] which the state department, as well as an independent congressional inquiry have alleged to be a Soviet forgery.&lt;ref name="StateDept"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Misinformation about "Gladio/Stay Behind" Networks Resurfaces |publisher=United States Department of State |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328042037/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |archivedate=March 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, "Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials" while "Sheepskin" couldn't have assassinated Stephen Saunders for the simple reason that, according to the US government, "the Greek government stated it dismantled the 'stay behind' network in 1988."&lt;ref name="StateDept"/&gt;

===Netherlands===
Speculation that the Netherlands was involved in ''Gladio'' arose from the accidental discovery of large arms caches in 1980 and 1983.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Clarion Group 1990a"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clarion: Nato network in France, Guardian 14 Nov 1990 | website=Cambridge Clarion Group | date=Nov 14, 1990  | url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/nato.net.france_graun_14nov1990.html | accessdate=Feb 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter incident, people walking in a forest near the village of [[Velp, North Brabant]] chanced upon a large hidden cache of arms, containing dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives.&lt;ref name="AP News Archive 1990" /&gt; That discovery forced the Dutch government to confirm that the arms were related to NATO planning for unorthodox warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology.cfm?navinfo=15301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212053626/http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology.cfm?navinfo=15301 |archivedate=2008-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, then-Prime Minister [[Ruud Lubbers]] told the Dutch Parliament that his office was running a secret organisation that had been set up inside the Dutch defence ministry in the 1950s, but denied it was supervised directly by NATO or other foreign bodies. He went to inform that successive prime ministers and defence chiefs had always preferred not to inform other Cabinet members or Parliament about the secret organization. It was modeled on the nation's World War II experiences of having to evacuate the royal family and transfer government to a government-in-exile,&lt;ref name="AP News Archive 1990"&gt;{{cite web | title=Secret Gladio Network Planted Weapons Caches in NATO Countries | website=AP News Archive | date=Nov 13, 1990  | url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Secret-Gladio-Network-Planted-Weapons-Caches-in-NATO-Countries/id-4a4d84723deb2ba38917a68a41c28628 | accessdate=Feb 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally aiming to provide an underground intelligence network to a government-in-exile in the event of a foreign invasion, although it included elements of guerilla warfare. Former Dutch Defence Minister [[Henk Vredeling]] confirmed the group had set up arms caches around the Netherlands for sabotage purposes.&lt;ref name="AP News Archive 1990" /&gt; Members of the cell are believed to have taken part in a training exercise in Sicily.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Clarion Group 1990b"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clarion: gladio, Norton-Taylor, Guardian 5 Dec 1990 | website=Cambridge Clarion Group | date=Dec 5, 1990  | url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/gladio_graun_5dec1990.html | accessdate=Feb 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating bureaus of the organisation would also move to safety in England or the USA at the first sign of trouble.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Already in 1990, it was known that the weapons cache near Velp, while accidentally 'discovered' in 1983, had been plundered partially before. It still contained dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives at the time of discovery, but five hand grenades had gone missing.&lt;ref name="AP News Archive 1990" /&gt; A Dutch investigative television program revealed on 9 September 2007, that another arms cache that had belonged to Gladio had been ransacked in the 1980s. It was located in a park near [[Scheveningen]]. Some of the stolen weapons, including hand grenades and machine guns, later turned up when police officials arrested criminals [[John Mieremet]] and Sam Klepper in 1991. The Dutch military intelligence agency [[MIVD]] feared at the time that disclosure of the Gladio history of these weapons would have been politically sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=MIVD verzwijgt wapenvondst in onderwereld|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1228111/mivd-verzwijgt-wapenvondst-in-onderwereld.html|publisher=Nu.nl |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reporter.kro.nl/seizoenen/reporter-2007/afleveringen/09-09-2007 |title=Gladio|publisher=Brandpunt Reporter|date=2007-09-09|access-date=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In 1957, the director of the secret service [[Norwegian Intelligence Service|NIS]], [[Vilhelm Evang]], protested strongly against the pro-active intelligence activities at [[Allied Forces North|AFNORTH]], as described by the chairman of CPC: "[NIS] was extremely worried about activities carried out by officers at [[Kolsås]]. This concerned SB, Psywar and Counter Intelligence." These activities supposedly included the blacklisting of Norwegians. [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] denied these allegations. Eventually, the matter was resolved in 1958, after Norway was assured about how stay-behind networks were to be operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Olav Riste |authorlink=Olav Riste | title = The Norwegian Intelligence Service: 1945–1970 | year = 1999 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-7146-4900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1978, the police discovered an arms cache and radio equipment at a mountain cabin and arrested Hans Otto Meyer, a businessman accused of being involved in selling illegal alcohol. Meyer claimed that the weapons were supplied by Norwegian intelligence. [[Rolf Arthur Hansen|Rolf Hansen]], defence minister at that time, stated the network was not in any way answerable to NATO and had no CIA connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Secret Anti-Communist Network Exposed in Norway in 1978 | agency = Associated Press | date = 1990-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the CIA set up [[Aginter Press]] which, under the direction of Captain [[Yves Guérin-Sérac]] (who had taken part in the founding of the OAS), ran a secret stay-behind army and trained its members in covert action techniques amounting to terrorism, including bombings, silent assassinations, subversion techniques, clandestine communication and infiltration and colonial warfare.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt;

==Parallel stay-behind operations in non-NATO countries==

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the first secret stay-behind army was exposed in 1947. It had been set up by the far-right Soucek and Rössner, who both insisted during their trial that "they were carrying out the secret operation with the full knowledge and support of the US and British occupying powers." Sentenced to death, they were pardoned under mysterious circumstances by [[Theodor Körner (Austrian president)|President Körner]] (1951–1957).

[[:de:Franz Olah|Franz Olah]] set up a new secret army codenamed ''Österreichischer Wander-, Sport- und Geselligkeitsverein'' (OeWSGV, literally "[[Austrian Association of Hiking, Sports and Society]]"), with the cooperation of MI6 and the CIA. He later explained that "we bought cars under this name. We installed communication centres in several regions of Austria", confirming that "special units were trained in the use of weapons and plastic explosives". He stated that "there must have been a couple of thousand people working for us... Only very, very highly positioned politicians and some members of the union knew about it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems that deliver Unforgettable Customer Service|last=Duthel|first=Heinz|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|year=2014|isbn=9783738607710|location=|pages=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mwcnews.net/focus/analysis/5248-natos-secret-armies.html?start=1|title=NATO's Secret Armies|last=Lendman|first=Stephen|date=September 2010|website=MCW News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, police discovered a stay-behind arms cache in an old mine close to Windisch-Bleiberg and forced the British authorities to hand over a list with the location of 33 other caches in Austria.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt;

In 1990, when secret "stay-behind" armies were uncovered all around Europe, the Austrian government said that no secret army had existed in the country. However, six years later, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' revealed the existence of secret CIA arms caches in Austria. Austrian President [[Thomas Klestil]] and Chancellor [[Franz Vranitzky]] insisted that they had known nothing of the existence of the secret army and demanded that the US launch a full-scale investigation into the violation of Austria's neutrality, which was denied by President [[Bill Clinton]]. State Department spokesman [[R. Nicholas Burns|Nicholas Burns]]—appointed in August 2001 by President [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] as the US Permanent Representative to the Atlantic treaty organization, where, as ambassador to NATO, he headed the combined State-Defense Department United States Mission to NATO and coordinated the NATO response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]—insisted: "The aim was noble, the aim was correct, to try to help Austria if it was under occupation. What went wrong is that successive Washington administrations simply decided not to talk to the Austrian government about it."&lt;ref name="Ganser1"/&gt;

===Finland===
In 1944, the Swedes worked with Finnish Intelligence to set up a stay-behind network of agents within Finland to keep track of post-war activities in that country. While this network was allegedly never put in place, Finnish codes, [[SIGINT]] equipment and documents were brought to Sweden and apparently exploited until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. McKay, Bengt Beckman, ''Swedish Signal Intelligence'', Frank Cass Publishers, 2002, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Interior Minister [[Yrjö Leino]] exposed a secret stay-behind army which was closed down (so called ''[[Weapons Cache Case]]''). This operation was organized by Finnish general staff officers (without foreign help) in 1944 to hide weapons in order to sustain a large-scale guerrilla warfare in the event the Soviet Union tried to occupy Finland in the aftermath of the [[Continuation War]]. See also [[Operation Stella Polaris]].

In 1991, the Swedish media claimed that a secret stay-behind army had existed in neutral [[Finland]] with an exile base in [[Stockholm]]. Finnish Defence Minister [[Elisabeth Rehn]] called the revelations "a fairy tale", adding cautiously "or at least an incredible story, of which I know nothing."&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt; However, in his memoirs, former CIA director [[William Colby]] described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in Scandinavian countries, including Finland, with or without the assistance of local governments, to prepare for a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name=colby&gt;[[William Colby|Colby, William]].

===Spain===
Several events prior to Spain's 1982 membership in NATO have also been tied to Gladio. In May 1976, half a year after [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s death, two [[Carlism|Carlist]] militants were [[Montejurra massacre|shot down]] by far-right terrorists, among whom were Gladio operative [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] and members of the [[Triple_A_(Spain)|Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance]] (''Triple A''), demonstrating connections between Gladio and the South American "[[Dirty War]]" of the [[Operation Condor]]. This incident became known as the [[Montejurra Incidents|Montejurra incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montejurra-jurramendi.3a2.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026103210/http://www.montejurra-jurramendi.3a2.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-10-26|title=CARLISMO MONTEJURRA LIBERTAD Actos de Montejurra 2006|website=www.montejurra-jurramendi.3a2.com|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Italian [[CESIS]] (Executive Committee for Intelligence and Security Services), Carlo Cicuttini (who took part in the 1972 Peteano bombing in Italy alongside [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]]), participated in the [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]] in Madrid, killing five people (including several lawyers), members of the [[Workers' Commissions]] trade-unions closely linked with the [[Spanish Communist Party]].

===Sweden===
In 1951, CIA agent [[William Colby]], based at the CIA station in Stockholm, supported the training of stay-behind armies in neutral [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] and in the NATO members [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]. In 1953, the police arrested right winger Otto Hallberg and discovered the preparations for the Swedish stay-behind army. Hallberg was set free and charges against him were dropped.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main article|Projekt-26}}
In Switzerland, a secret force called [[Projekt-26|P-26]] was discovered, by coincidence, a few months before Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations. After the "[[secret files scandal]]" (''Fichenaffäre''), Swiss members of parliament  started investigating the Defense Department in the summer of 1990. According to Felix Würsten of the [[ETH Zurich]], "P-26 was not directly involved in the network of NATO's secret armies but it had close contact to [[MI6]]."&lt;ref name="ETHConference"&gt;[http://archiv.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/NatoGeheimarmee.html The Dark Side of the West], Conference "Nato Secret Armies and P-26," [[ETH Zurich]], 2005. Published 10 February 2005. Retrieved February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniele Ganser (ETH Zurich) wrote in the ''Intelligence and National Security'' review that "following the discovery of the stay-behind armies across Western Europe in late 1990, Swiss and international security researchers found themselves confronted with two clear-cut questions: Did Switzerland also operate a secret stay-behind army? And if yes, was it part of NATO's stay-behind network? The answer to the first question is clearly yes... The answer to the second question remains disputed..."&lt;ref name="GanserINS"&gt;Ganser, Daniele. "[http://www.danieleganser.ch/The_British_Secret_Service_in_Neutral_Switzerland_1211543138.html The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland: An Unfinished Debate on NATO's Cold War Stay-behind Armies]", published by the ''Intelligence and National Security'' review, vol.20, n°4, December 2005, pp. 553–580 {{ISSN|0268-4527}} print 1743–9019 online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Colonel Herbert Alboth, a former commander of P-26, declared in a confidential letter to the Defence Department that he was willing to reveal "the whole truth". He was later found in his house, stabbed with his own bayonet. The detailed parliamentary report on the Swiss secret army was presented to the public on 17 November 1990.&lt;ref name="ETH chronology"/&gt; According to ''The Guardian'', "P-26 was backed by [[Projekt-27|P-27]], a private foreign intelligence agency funded partly by the government, and by a special unit of Swiss army intelligence which had built up files on nearly 8,000 "suspect persons" including "leftists", "bill stickers", "[[Jehovah's witnesses]]", people with "abnormal tendencies" and [[anti-nuclear]] demonstrators.
On 14 November, the Swiss government hurriedly dissolved P26 – the head of which, it emerged, had been paid £100,000 a year."&lt;ref name=Gladiofile&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], "[http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/gladio_graun_5dec1990.html The Gladio File: did fear of communism throw West into the arms of terrorists?]", in ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a report by Swiss magistrate Pierre Cornu was released by the Swiss defence ministry. It found that P-26 was without "political or legal legitimacy", and described the group's collaboration with British secret services as "intense". "Unknown to the Swiss government, British officials signed agreements with P-26 to provide training in combat, communications, and sabotage. The latest agreement was signed in 1987... P-26 cadres participated regularly in training exercises in Britain... British advisers – possibly from the SAS – visited secret training establishments in Switzerland." P-26 was led by Efrem Cattelan, known to British intelligence.&lt;ref name=swiss&gt;Norton-Taylor, Richard. [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/swiss.subversion_graun_20sep1991.html UK trained secret Swiss force]" in ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 20, 1991, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 conference presenting Daniele Ganser's research on Gladio, [[Hans Senn]], General Chief of Staff of the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] between 1977 and 1980, explained how he was informed of the existence of a secret organisation in the middle of his term of office. According to him, it already became clear in 1980 in the wake of the Schilling/Bachmann affair that there was also a secret group in Switzerland. But former MP, Helmut Hubacher, President of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] from 1975 to 1990, declared that although it had been known that "special services" existed within the army, as a politician he never at any time could have known that P-26 was behind this. Hubacher pointed out that the President of the parliamentary investigation into P26 (PUK-EMD), the right-wing politician from Appenzell and member of the Council of States for that Canton, [[Carlo Schmid (Swiss politician)|Carlo Schmid]], had suffered "like a dog" during the commission's investigations. Carlo Schmid declared to the press: "I was shocked that something like that is at all possible," and said to the press he was glad to leave the "conspirational atmosphere" which had weighted upon him like a "black shadow" during the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13502168.html

==Daniele Ganser and the "strategy of tension"==
{{Further information|Strategy of tension}}

Swiss historian [[Daniele Ganser]] in his 2005 book, ''NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe''&lt;ref name="Ganser2"/&gt;, accused Gladio of trying to influence policies through the means of "[[false flag]]" operations and a "strategy of tension".
Ganser alleges that on various occasions, stay-behind movements became linked to [[right-wing terrorism]], crime and attempted coups d'état.&lt;ref name="Ganser1"/&gt; In ''NATO's Secret Armies'' Ganser states that Gladio units closely cooperated with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against its own civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Anton, Michael Schetsche, Michael K. Walter ''Konspiration'' p. 175, Springer VS 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-531-19324-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer Henrik Hansen, a scholar at [[Roskilde University]], wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the ''International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence'' and the ''Journal of Intelligence History'', describing Ganser's work as "a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories" that "fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries."  Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his "claim of the big conspiracy" off ''[[US Army Field Manual 30-31B]]'', a Cold War era forged document.&lt;ref&gt;Peer Henrik Hansen, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070826145603/http://www.intelligence-history.org/jih/reviews-5-1.html Review of NATO's Secret Armies]," ''Journal of Intelligence History'', Summer 2005. ''Web Archive - archived website of August 26, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peer Henrik Hansen, "Falling Flat on the Stay-Behinds," ''International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence'', January 2006, 182-186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden Peake's book review ''Intelligence in Recent Public Literature'' maintains that, "Ganser fails to document his thesis that the CIA, MI6, and NATO and its friends turned GLADIO into a terrorist organization."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Bookshelf_11.htm ''The Intelligence Officer’s Bookshelf''] Hayden Peake, ''CIA,'' April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Philip HJ Davies of the Brunel University Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is "marred by imagined conspiracies, exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities, misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments, and... an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context." According to Davies, "the underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research to be able to discuss covert action and special operations effectively."&lt;ref&gt;Philip HJ Davies, "Review of NATO's Secret Armies," ''The Journal of Strategic Studies'', December 2005, 1064-1068.&lt;/ref&gt; Olav Riste of the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, writing for the journal ''Intelligence and National Security'', mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that "a detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book."&lt;ref&gt;Olav Riste, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," ''Intelligence and National Security'', September 2005, 550-551.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the University of Rome, the two concluded that the book's "ambitious conclusions do not seem to be entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available."&lt;ref&gt;Olav Riste and Leopoldo Nuti, "Introduction: Strategy of 'Stay-Behind'," ''The Journal of Strategic Studies'', December 2007, 930.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Kaplan wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making "heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy", but also arguing that "connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO's military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage." Kaplan believes that some of Ganser's conspiracy theories "may be correct", but that "they do damage to the book's credibility."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Kaplan, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," ''The International History Review'', September 2006, 685-686.&lt;/ref&gt; In a mostly positive review for the journal ''Cold War History'', Beatrice Heuser praises Ganser's "fascinating study" while also noting that "it would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone, and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer."&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Heuser, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," ''Cold War History'', November 2006, 567-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Security analyst John Prados writes "Ganser, the principal analyst of Gladio, presents evidence across many nations that Gladio networks amounted to anti-democratic elements in their own societies."&lt;ref&gt;John Prado ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'' 2006, p. 95, {{ISBN|9781615780112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[State Department]] stated in 2006 that Ganser had been taken in by long-discredited Cold-War era disinformation and "fooled by the forgery". In an article about the Gladio/stay-behind networks and ''US Army Field Manual 30-31B'' they stated, "Ganser treats the forgery as if it was a genuine document in his 2005 book on "stay behind" networks, ''Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe'' and includes it as a key document on his website on the book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080710005257/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html State Department].&lt;/ref&gt;

==US State Department's 2006 response==
The [[US State Department]] published a communiqué in January 2006 which, while confirming the existence of NATO stay-behind efforts, in general, and the presence of the "Gladio" stay-behind unit in Italy, in particular, with the purpose of aiding resistance in the event of Soviet aggression directed westward, from the Warsaw Pact, dismissed claims of any United States ordered, supported, or authorized terrorism by stay-behind units.

The State Department stated that the accusations of US-sponsored "false flag" operations are rehashed former Soviet [[disinformation]] based on documents that the Soviets forged; specifically the [[US Army Field Manual 30-31B|Westmoreland Field Manual]], whose forged nature was confirmed by former KGB operatives, following the end of the Cold War. The alleged Soviet-authored forgery, disseminated in the 1970s, explicitly formulated the need for a "strategy of tension" involving violent attacks blamed on radical left-wing groups in order to convince allied governments of the need for counter-action. It also rejected a Communist Greek journalist's allegations made in December 2005.&lt;ref name="StateDept2"&gt;{{Cite |title=Misinformation about 'Gladio/Stay Behind' Networks Resurfaces |publisher=United States Department of State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gladio in fiction==
A precise analogue of Operation Gladio was described in the 1949 fiction novel ''An Affair of State'' by [[Pat Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pat Frank]].  ''An Affair of State''.  J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1949&lt;/ref&gt; In Frank's version, U.S. Department of State officers recruit a stay-behind network in Hungary to fight an insurgency against the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union launches an attack on and captures Western Europe.

In the ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' episode "Lo Scandalo", the character [[Malory Archer]] mentions having been involved in Operation Gladio when younger. It is described by [[Lana Kane]] as "a crypto-[[fascist]] shitshow, starring [[Allen Dulles]] and a bunch of former [[Nazis]]."

[[File:County Route 521 crossing Lackawanna Cut-Off November 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The new bridge over [[County Route 521 (New Jersey)|County Route&amp;nbsp;521]] in [[Blairstown, New Jersey|Blairstown, NJ]], shown before it opened in November 2006, is a replica of its 1911 companion to the left that was orphaned at the time of the creation of Conrail in 1976.]]

An '''orphan bridge''' is a roadway [[bridge]] that crosses over abandoned [[railroad]] [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]] and which is no longer owned or maintained by any railroad.  Examples include the bridges that crossed over predecessor railroads that were conveyed into [[Conrail]] in 1976.  At the time, Conrail argued in U.S. court that these overhead bridges were not part of the rail rights-of-way that were conveyed to it at the time of the merger.  As the railroads that initially built the bridges and maintained them no longer existed, it was argued, successfully, that, in essence, no legal entity owned them and that, as a result, they were "orphan" bridges.

An example of this is the abandoned Conrail bridge which parallels Delaware Avenue and crosses [[U.S. Route 9W]] in [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], [[New York (state)|NY]].

== Biography ==
Oscar Carr was born in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. He graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] and served as a naval officer for three years before returning home to his family cotton farm. Carr credited the "racial militancy" of Governor [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi and Governor [[George Wallace]] of Alabama for spurring his interest in civil rights. Working with state [[NAACP]] leader [[Aaron Henry]], he started an anti-poverty community action group in [[Coahoma County, Mississippi|Coahoma county]].&lt;ref name= newsservice/&gt; Together they also enrolled 6,000 children in the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]].&lt;ref name= livingchurch/&gt;

In 1968, he was co-director — with rights leader [[Charles Evers]] — of the Mississippi presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert Kennedy]].&lt;ref name= newsservice&gt;{{Citation| date = 9 November 1977| title = Church, Rights Leader Oscar Carr Dies| publisher = Episcopal News Service| url = http://episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/ENS/ENSpress_release.pl?pr_number=77364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year he was a key member of the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi delegation which successfully challenged the regular delegation from the state for their seats at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="newsservice"/&gt;

The '''Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme''' ('''PBS''') is a program of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] that provides subsidised [[prescription drug]]s to residents of Australia, as well as certain foreign visitors covered by a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement. The PBS seeks to ensure that Australian residents have affordable and reliable access to a wide range of necessary medicines. The PBS has faced increased scrutiny as its cost has increased. The scheme assumes responsibility for the cost of drugs to patients in the community setting rather than while in hospital which is the responsibility of each state and territory.&lt;ref name="hcd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Health Care Coverage Determinations: An International Comparative Study |last=Harris |first=Anthony |author2=Liliana Bulfone |chapter=Getting value for money: The Australian experience |editor1-last=Jost |editor1-first=Timothy S. |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335225993 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK2ZgsXclioC |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] the PBS is a key component of [[health care in Australia]].

==History==
The PBS was established by the Labor [[Chifley Government]], by the ''Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947'' which commenced on 1 July 1948,&lt;ref name="chp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparative Health Policy in the Asia-Pacific |last=Gauld |first=Robin |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335225101 |pages=108–109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5Iaf6V4uKAC |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a wider plan to create a British-style [[National Health Service]]. The scheme was an extension of the similar [[Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] established in 1919 for Australian servicemen and women who had served in the [[Boer War]] and [[World War I]]. 

Though the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that most of Chifley's health care plans were unconstitutional, the PBS was ruled to be constitutional. Initially, PBS covered approximately 140 lifesaving and disease-preventing drugs. Medicines on the PBS list were free to the consumer until 1960, when a 50&amp;nbsp;cent co-payment was introduced by the [[Menzies Government]].&lt;ref name="chp"/&gt; 

By 2003 the number of drugs included under the scheme had expanded to 601 general products which were marketed as 2,602 different brands.&lt;ref name="chp"/&gt; The scheme was appealing to policy makers because it required no major capital works program and could be implemented immediately without lengthy consultation with the medical profession.&lt;ref name="tpoh"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Price of Health: Australian Governments and Medical Politics 1910-1960 |last=Gillespie |first=James A. |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521523222 |page=210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xvvxGPG3jMC |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
[[File:PBS Medication Tree.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the provision of medication under the PBS, as at 2008]]
PBS is governed by the ''[[National Health Act 1953]]'' and ''National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 (Cth)''. Pharmaceutical benefits under PBS may only be supplied by [[pharmacists]] and medical practitioners approved under the Act. Applications to list a drug on the PBS are administered by the Department of Health. Pharmaceutical benefits under the PBS are administered by [[Medicare Australia]] (formerly the Health Insurance Commission) under the ''Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth)''.

A benefit under PBS is only given on medications which are listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule. The medication may be listed for general use as an unrestricted benefit, or for a specific indication as a restricted benefit. When a PBS medication is dispensed by a pharmacist, the patient pays the patient contribution (subject to concessions and safety nets) and Medicare Australia pays the remainder of the agreed cost of the medication to the pharmacist.&lt;ref&gt;(8 February 2006). [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/08133407/4 Review of Prescription Charges in Western Europe, North America and Australasia]. The Scottish Government.  Retrieved 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a medication is negotiated between the government, through the Department of Health, and the supplier of the drug. The agreed price becomes the basis of the dispensed price of the medication which is negotiated between the government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia under the current Community Pharmacy Agreement. The dispensed price includes the wholesaler's markup, pharmacist's markup, and a dispensing fee. Pharmacies purchase PBS-listed drugs from the wholesaler or supplier, and claim the difference between the dispensed price and the patient co-payment contribution from Medicare Australia.

The PBS is separate to its counterpart, the [[Medical Benefits Schedule]], which provides subsidised medical services such as doctors consultations and diagnostic tests.

===Patient contribution and safety net===
When purchasing a medication under PBS the maximum price a patient pays is the patient contribution (also called a co-payment or out-of-pocket cost), which in 2016 is [[Australian dollar|A$]]38.30 for general patients. For PBS medications costing less than $38.30, the patient pays the PBS dispensed price plus an additional $1.17 safety net recording fee plus an optional pharmacy charge of $4.33 or less, provided that the total charge does not exceed $38.30. Concessional patients - i.e., low-income earners, welfare recipients, [[Health Care Card]] holders, etc. and those covered under the [[Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (RPBS) - pay a patient contribution of $6.20 in 2016. Patient contributions are compulsory and cannot be discounted by pharmacies.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/healthpro/explanatory-notes/front/fee History of PBS Copayments and Safety Net Thresholds]. Department of Health. Retrieved 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety net provisions in PBS reduce patient contributions when singles and families exceed in a calendar year the PBS safety net threshold: when a general patient reaches the general PBS threshold, their co-payment reduces to the concession price for the remainder of that calendar year; while concession patients who reach the concession PBS threshold do not pay anything on PBS medications for the remainder of the year. The PBS safety net is separate from and in addition to the [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare safety nets|Medicare safety nets]].

Changes in patient contributions and the safety net over the years are as follows:&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

===Safety net 20-day rule===
In an effort to limit the cost of PBS by discouraging patients from filling PBS prescriptions earlier than needed, in 2009 the safety net 20-day rule was brought in. Under the rule, a repeat prescription supplied within 20 days of a previous supply of the same medicine will not count towards the PBS safety net threshold.&lt;ref&gt;''National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits – early supply) Instrument 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; If the patient has already reached the safety net threshold, they will be charged the normal patient contribution instead of the reduced safety net amount.

===Brand Premium and generic medicines===
In an effort to limit the cost of PBS, the Australian Government introduced Brand Premiums on medications where cheaper [[generic medicine|generic brands]] were available. The Brand Premium is usually the price difference between the innovator brand and the generic brand. The patient pays the Brand Premium in addition to the normal patient contribution if they decline to purchase the generic brand. The Brand Premium paid does not count toward either safety net threshold and must still be paid even after the threshold is reached.

Pharmacists are allowed to substitute generic brands for prescribed brands if the brands are flagged "a" in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits, and if consent is obtained from the patient and prescriber. The prescriber's consent is always assumed to be granted unless "brand substitution not permitted" is indicated on the prescription.

===Therapeutic Group Premium===
On 1 February 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455940 The effect of the introduction of therapeutic group premiums on patient care]. Australian Government. Retrieved 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; another effort to limit the cost of the PBS involved the introduction of Therapeutic Group Premiums (TGPs) on medications that are priced significantly above the cheapest medication in a defined therapeutic sub-group where the drugs are considered to be of similar safety and efficacy. The TGP is the price difference between the premium brand and the benchmark (base) price for drugs in the class. The patient must pay this TGP in addition to the normal patient co-payment contribution if they have been prescribed such a medication. The TGP paid does not count toward the Safety Net threshold.

However, a prescriber may obtain an exemption from the TGP if:
* [[adverse effects]] occurring with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* [[drug interactions]] occurring with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* drug interactions expected to occur with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* transfer to a base-priced drug would cause patient confusion resulting in problems with compliance.

Such an exemption requires an approved PBS Authority prescription from Medicare Australia.

===Foreign visitors===
PBS subsidies are available only to Australian residents (who generally must produce a Medicare card) and to certain foreign visitors whose countries have entered into a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia. These countries are the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Malta, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Belgium and Slovenia. Eligible foreign visitors must produce a passport to obtain subsidised medications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/about-the-pbs#Who_is_eligible_for_the_PBS About the PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits==
The [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee]] (PBAC) makes recommendations to the Minister for Health and Ageing regarding drugs which should be made available as pharmaceutical benefits, which are listed on the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. The Schedule is published monthly since January 2007, (prior to this it was published three times a year).

In considering a medication for listing on the PBS, the PBAC considers factors including:
* The conditions for which the drug has been approved for use in Australia by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]. The PBAC only recommends the listing of a medicine for use in a condition which is in accordance with the [[Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods]].
* The conditions in which use has been demonstrated to be effective and safe compared to other therapies.
* The costs involved. The PBAC is required to ensure that the money that the community spends in subsidising the PBS represents cost-effective expenditure of taxpayers' funds.
* A range of other factors and health benefits. These factors may include, for example, costs of [[Inpatient care|hospitalisation]] or other alternative medical treatments that may be required, as well as less tangible factors such as patients' quality of life.

Decisions on PBS listing are generally made on a [[health economics]] perspective, using [[cost-effectiveness analysis]].  Cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates the cost and health effects of one technology versus the cost and health effects of another technology, which is usually standard of care. A new technology whose incremental health benefit justifies its additional expense is deemed to be cost-effective and thus reimbursed by PBAC.  Drugs that provide little health benefit at considerable additional expense, such as the [[PDE5 inhibitor]]s (e.g. [[sildenafil]]) and certain expensive cancer [[chemotherapy]] drugs are not listed on the basis of poor cost-effectiveness. The principles that are applied during the evaluation of drugs for PBS listing are described in the PBAC Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;PBAC Guidelines Version 4.4 [http://www.pbac.pbs.gov.au/information/table-of-contents.html] Retrieved 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unrestricted benefits===
Drugs that have unrestricted benefit listing on the PBS are available for general use without being limited to particular indications. Such items are typically those whose use in clinical practice is widely accepted. Examples include [[methotrexate]], [[prednisone]] and [[amoxycillin]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS Online [http://pbs.gov.au] Retrieved 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restricted benefits===
Certain medications listed on the PBS are available only for specific therapeutic indications or to patients meeting specific criteria where the PBAC has deemed that the cost-benefit analysis is favourable only in those indications/patients. These are noted as "restricted benefits" on the Schedule. Medicare Australia places the onus of policing restricted benefits on the prescribers themselves and the pharmacists dispensing (unless the listing is also 'Authority Required'). For example, the COX-2 inhibitor [[celecoxib]] is listed on the PBS as a restricted benefit for the [[symptomatic treatment]] of [[osteoarthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. Prescribers using [[celecoxib]] for other indications are expected to indicate "non-PBS" on the prescription, and/or the pharmacist dispensing the celecoxib should charge the patient the full cost.

===Authority required benefits===
Some PBS medications are restricted and require prior approval from Medicare Australia. These are noted as "authority required benefits" on the Schedule. Again, the PBAC has deemed that the cost-benefit analysis is favourable only under in specific indications/patients under certain circumstances. Authority may be obtained by telephone to Medicare Australia (known as "phone approval") or in writing from an authorised delegate of the Minister for Health. Prescriptions must be written on [[Authority Prescription Form]], and the approval number must be noted on the prescription. Pharmacists cannot dispense the item as a pharmaceutical benefit unless it has been approved by Medicare Australia (indicated by the presence of the approval number).

In obtaining a phone approval, the doctor simply identifies themselves (using their name and provider number), the patient (using their Medicare number), and when asked by the operator, confirms which of the conditions eligible for an authority the patient is suffering from. Medicare normally assumes the doctor's assertion that the condition exists as sufficient. For a written Authority however, evidence of diagnosis and patient eligibility criteria such a pathology test results are usually required.

Some drugs may have Authority Required (Streamlined) status which does not require an explicit approval from Medicare, instead the doctor can use the Authority code found in the published Schedule for a given drug/indication.

==Sustainability==
In its first year, the PBS cost the Commonwealth Government £149,000 (or $7,600,000 in 2009). The PBS now costs the Commonwealth approximately $6.5&amp;nbsp;billion a year to operate, despite consumers contributing around $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in patient co-payments.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} According to a report by the [[Australian Productivity Commission]] the PBS is expected to cost 2.6% of Australia's GDP by 2045 up from 0.7% in 2005.&lt;ref name="oesa"&gt;{{cite book |title=OECD Economic Surveys: Australia 2006 |author=OECD |authorlink=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |year=2006 |publisher=OECD Publishing |isbn=9264026355 |pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBkq0quiWvUC |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further attempts to restrain the growth in costs of the PBS may be needed, however, attempts to increase consumer prices of drugs have always proved politically unpopular. The comparative cost-effectiveness processes of the PBS nonetheless ensure it provides Australian citizens with more equitable access to medicines than in many other developed nations and for many the issue of sustainability of the PBS as a key component of the egalitarian architecture of Australian society is equivalent to asking whether that nation's education system or defence forces are sustainable.{{citation needed|reason=Overtly political|date=April 2015}}

Former federal [[Treasurer]] [[Peter Costello]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] attempted to raise the patient co-payment of PBS medicines by up to 30 per cent in the 2002 Federal Budget, however this measure was blocked in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in which various minor parties held the balance of power. However, in June 2004 the main opposition party, the [[Australian Labor Party]], announced that it would allow the PBS co-payment increases to proceed through the Senate.

===The Grattan Institute Report March 2013===

Grattan Institute Health Program released a report titled  "Australia’s bad drug deal" by Dr Stephen Duckett, in which he states that Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pays at least $1.3 billion a year too much for prescription drugs. New Zealand, which has capped its budget and appointed independent experts to make decisions through the [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency]] (Pharmac), pays a sixth as much as the PBS for the same drugs. Public hospitals in two Australian states pay much lower prices than the PBS. In one case,the prices are just a sixth of PBS prices. In one extreme example the report states that "The price of one drug, Olanzapine, is 64 times higher on the PBS than in Western Australian public hospitals". This report proposes three ways Australia can regain its lost leadership in pharmaceutical pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Duckett.

== Recent changes to the PBS ==
In July 2007 changes to the ''National Health Act 1953 (Cth)'' divided the PBS formulary into an F1 category (for patented, single brand medicines) and an F2 category (for [[generic medicines]]) with reduced reference pricing between them. Academic opinion is divided about the value of these changes and the extent to which they arose from industry lobbying drawing strength from Annex 2C of the [[AUSFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Lofgren H.

'''Pierre Joxe''' (born 28 November 1934 in Paris) is a former French Socialist politician and has been a member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]] since 2001.

A graduate of the ''[[Ecole nationale d'administration]]'', he joined the [[Court of Audit of France]] in the 1960s. Whereas his father, [[Louis Joxe]], was Justice Minister of [[Charles de Gaulle]], Pierre Joxe entered politics as a follower of [[François Mitterrand]], first in the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]], then (from 1971) in the renewed [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). Considered as one of the closest allies of the PS leader, he was elected as a deputy for the [[Saône-et-Loire]] ''département'' in 1973. He presided over the regional council of [[Burgundy]] from 1979 to 1982.

In 1981, when Mitterrand was elected [[President of France]], Joxe became Minister of Industry for only one month, before he became leader of the Socialist group in the [[French National Assembly]]. Then, he joined the cabinet as [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] from 1984 to the Socialist defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 legislative election]]. Re-appointed leader of the PS parliamentary group again, he became the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] after Mitterrand had won a second presidential term in 1988. He was the author of a new law code for [[Corsica]]. In 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], he served as [[Minister of Defence (France)|Defense Minister]].

During March 1993, Joxe gave up politics to lead the [[Court of Audit of France]]. Then, he was nominated to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]  (2001–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/le-conseil-constitutionnel/le-conseil-aujourd-hui/les-membres-en-2009/liste-des-membres/pierre-joxe.226.html|title=Pierre JOXE|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nmRhi43W?url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/le-conseil-constitutionnel/le-conseil-aujourd-hui/les-membres-en-2009/liste-des-membres/pierre-joxe.226.html|archivedate=24 February 2010|publisher=[[Constitutional Council of France]]|language=French|accessdate=24 February 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sons, Benoît Joxe and Baptiste Joxe, both from his third marriage.

'''''Quong Wing v R'''''&lt;ref&gt;(1914), 49 S.C.R. 44&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision where the Court upheld a provincial law that discriminated against the [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]].

Quong Wing was a naturalized Canadian citizen, originally from [[China]], who ran a restaurant in [[Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]]. In 1912, he attempted to hire two white women, Mabel Hopham and Nellie Lane, to work as waitresses.  Consequently, he was charged and convicted under a provincial statute, ''An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities'',&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities'', Statutes of Saskatchewan 1912, c. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited white women or girls from working in businesses owned by "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinamen]]".

Wing appealed, arguing that the law was outside the power of the province as laws related to morality were considered criminal matters which is the exclusive authority of the federal government. As well, he argued that the law did not intend to include naturalized citizens.

The Supreme Court held in a four to one decision that the law was valid. The Court interpreted the word "Chinaman" as including all those born in China regardless of subsequent nationality.

Justice [[John Idington]], alone in dissent, was the only one concerned with the justification of the law and held the law to be invalid on the basis that citizenship was a matter of federal jurisdiction and so ''ultra vires'' of provincial powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7862">'''Ralph Borsodi''' (1886 – October 26, 1977&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' obituary has October 27 as his death date. Obituary, ''New York Times'', 11 November 1977, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[agrarianism|agrarian]] theorist and practical experimenter interested in ways of living useful to the modern family desiring greater self-reliance (especially so during the [[Great Depression]]). Much of his theory related to living in rural surroundings on a modern [[Homestead principle|homestead]] and was rooted in his [[Georgist]] beliefs.

==Life and work==
Born in New York City, he spent the earliest years of his life in Manhattan. His father was a publisher who had connections in the advertising field, and Ralph worked in this business as a boy. By the age of 22, Borsodi was personally testing the idea of moving "[[Back-to-the-land movement|back to the land]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Rebecca Kneale. ''At Home In Nature: Modern Homesteading and Spiritual Practice in America'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He had fully embraced the concept of [[simple living]] by 1920. Borsodi was influenced by the reformer [[Bolton Hall (activist)|Bolton Hall]] (1854–1938), a friend of his father's; Hall introduced Borsodi to the ideas of the economist [[Henry George]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Timothy. ''The Quest for Utopia in Twentieth-Century America: 1900-1960'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Borsodi was also influenced by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Shi, David. ''The Simple Life'', University of Georgia Press, 2001 p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]], [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], and [[Laurance Labadie]].&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/laurance.shtml James J. Martin's biography of Laurance Labadie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612141213/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/laurance.shtml |date=2011-06-12 }} states that his colleague, Mrs. Loomis, recognized the historical continuity of the ideas dating back to [[Josiah Warren]], [[Lysander Spooner]], and [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Borsodi is chiefly known for his practical experiments in self-sufficient living during the 1920s and 1930s, and for the books he wrote about these experiments. ''The Distribution Age'' (1927), ''This Ugly Civilization'' (1929), and ''Flight from the City'' (1933) are his best known works.&lt;ref&gt;Shi, pp. 228-9&lt;/ref&gt; He established a [[School of Living]] in [[Rockland County, New York]] during the winter of 1934–1935. Before long about 20 families began attending regularly from [[New York City]], spending the weekends at the school. Some commentators claim Borsodi’s books inspired "hundreds of thousands of people" to follow his example during the Great Depression. In 1948 Borsodi self-published, even doing his own typesetting, ''Education and Living'' a two-volume work designed to suggest a  curriculum for the ongoing School of Living. In 1950, Borsodi moved to the Town of [[Melbourne Village, Florida|Melbourne Village]], whose founders had been influenced by his teachings.  Mildred Loomis, his most devoted student, continued the work of the School of Living into the 1970s when it was headquartered at [[Heathcote Community]] in [[Freeland, Maryland]].

With Bob Swann, Borsodi created a [[land trust]] that functioned as an economic, [[banking]], and [[Credit (finance)|credit]] institution, probably influenced by the ideas of [[Josiah Warren]].&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Called the Independence Foundation, Inc., Borsodi intended it as a new and ethical way of making low-cost, cooperatively shared credit available to people who wanted to build homesteads in the community. This institution made it possible to provide people access to land without their having to pay outright for property in the beginning.

Borsodi spent decades analyzing the ills of modern society and imagining remedies for the problems. His 1968 work, published in India, and titled ''Seventeen Universal Problems of Man and Society'', catalogued his research and can be considered the beginning of a modern taxonomy of human problems and solutions. His followers felt he usually was working at solving problems at least 20 years before most analysts realized the problem existed. For example, it is said he predicted the [[inflation]] of the 1970s some thirty years before it came. One of his interests was in [[Local currency]], and he started an experiment with such a currency in his home area, [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]; however, the project came to an early end with Borsodi's failing health. He created a commodity-backed bartering currency called the Constant, reminiscent of [[Josiah Warren]]'s "labor notes" at the [[Cincinnati Time Store]]. These appeared first as paper notes, but in 1974, coin-like pieces, called Globes, were minted and sold in 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce .999 silver denominations. The non-profit organization that sponsored them was the International Foundation for Independence, Inc., but the Globes were minted and sold by an organization called Arbitrage International.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Borsodi died in Exeter, New Hampshire in October 1977, survived by his wife Clare and two sons - Edward M. and Ralph W. - by his first wife Myrtle Mae Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''New York Times'', 11 November 1977, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Borsodi was cited as an important modern critic and creative thinker by [[Helen Nearing|Helen]] and [[Scott Nearing]] in such writings as ''Living the Good Life'', a book sometimes credited as being the [[clarion call]] of the [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1970s. J.I. Rodale, who founded ''Organic Gardening and Farming'' magazine got his introduction to organic gardening at Borsodi's Dogwood Acres Homestead, as did the Keene family, founders of Walnut Acres organic food catalog. Borsodi was also a significant influence on the American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Daniel (2007-03-12) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/enemies-of-the-state/], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Borsodi's texts can be found in the Social Criticism section of the Soil and Health Online Library.

On 20 September 2017, the civil judge Andrés Fraga determined that in the company Fleg Trading Ltd, of the Bahamas, Mauricio Macri only accepted the position of director for which he was appointed to the sole and only effect of designating a replacement and resigning, and that in Kagemusha he did not even accept tacitly the position of director for which he was appointed by Francisco Macri. The ruling adds that neither of the two companies he was a shareholder, that he did not receive any dividends or profits, did not participate in the business decisions or in any business, nor was he the owner or co-owner of any current bank account of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2064793-la-justicia-despego-a-mauricio-macri-de-los-panama-papers|title= La Justicia despegó a Mauricio Macri de los Panamá Papers |website=[[La Nación]] |language=Spanish |access-date= 6 November 2017  |date= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after initial reports of Sigmundur Davíð's resignation, the Prime Minister's office in Iceland issued a statement to the international press saying that Sigmundur Davíð had not resigned, but rather stepped aside for an unspecified amount of time and would continue to serve as the Chairman of the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]].&lt;ref name="Iceland PM not quite gone"&gt;

=== Indonesia ===

Finance Minister, Bambang P.S. Brodjonegoro, immediately responded quickly to the leaked data of tax evasion "Panama Papers" by instructing the Directorate General of Taxation (DGT) to follow up the findings. Leaked investment data originating from Panama law firm, Mossack Fonseca, attracted Bambang's attention because they can be a source of new information about the potential tax that has not been traced.

"I've asked Mr Ken (Dwijugiasteadi), Director General of Taxation, please let's study the data known as Panama Papers", he said at the headquarters of the DGT, Tuesday (5/4).

Finance Minister once said there is potential for the property of the taxpayer around Rp 4,000 trillion, which has not been affected by the tax. He specifies, around Rp 1,400 trillion, is a property that is not taxed, and remitted to the DGT, while the remaining Rp 2,700 trillion, a rich Indonesian deposits in banks abroad.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Indonesia [http://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20160405115243-78-121772/menkeu-tugaskan-dirjen-pajak-telusuri-temuan-panama-papers/ "Menkeu Tugaskan Dirjen Pajak Telusuri Temuan Panama Papers"], April 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===

Some 600 Israeli companies and 850 Israeli shareholders are listed. Among the Israeli names found in the leaked documents are: top attorney [[Dov Weissglass]], who was the bureau chief of the late prime minister [[Ariel Sharon]]; [[Jacob Engel]], a businessman active in the African mining industry; and [[Idan Ofer]], a member of one of Israel's wealthiest families, according to ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.712914 |title=Israel to Probe Hundreds Implicated by Panama Papers |work=Haaretz.com |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tareq Abbas, a son of [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the president of the [[Palestinian Authority]], was also revealed to hold $1 million in shares of an offshore company associated with the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.713347|title=Panama Papers: Leaks Reveal Abbas' Son's $1m Holding in Company With Ties to Palestinian Authority|author=|date=|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weissglass' name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in May 2012, according to ''Haaretz'', and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a [[Vienna]] bank.

Weissglass and Halkin told ''Haaretz'' that the company "was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation... [the] company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |title=600 Israeli companies, 850 shareholders listed in Panama data leak |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristóteles Núñez, who is in charge of the government's tax administration, [[:es:Servicio de Administración Tributaria|Servicio de Administración Tributaria]], said that people involved in the Panama Papers case can still make tax declarations and pay taxes on their investments. Being Mexican and having foreign investments or bank accounts is not a crime, but having income and not declaring it is illegal. If the concealment of income from Panama Papers-related investments is categorized as tax evasion, fines of up to 100% of the omitted tax payment can result, as well as three months to nine years imprisonment for a "tax crime".&lt;ref name= AristApr416&gt;

The Procuraduría de la Nación announced that it will open an investigation concerning the international journalistic investigation "Panama papers", where Mossack Fonseca is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/investigara-mossack-fonseca/23931813 |title=MP investigará a Mossack Fonseca&amp;nbsp;– El Siglo |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of the Presidency, Alvaro Alemán categorically rejects that Panama is considered a tax haven and ruled that no permit is used the country as a "scapegoat", thus reacting to the scandal "Panama Papers" and the subsequent re-registration by France in the list of tax havens. Alemán criticized vigorously the statements made by the Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) José Ángel Gurría and Minister of Finance of France, Michael Sapin and considered as disrespectful and irresponsible, especially when publications speak of a total of 21 jurisdictions, but only lash out at Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Panama-Papers-Francia-ParaisoFiscal-OCDE_0_4453804624.html |title=Panamá se defiende y califica de 'irrespetuosas' declaraciones de la OCDE |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alemán explained that talks have started with the French ambassador in Panama, with whom the issue will be discussed preliminarily and establish avenues of understanding to clarify the situation being implicated the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Panama-Papers-Francia-ParaisoFiscal-OCDE_0_4453804624.html |title=Panamá se defiende y califica de 'irrespetuosas' declaraciones de la OCDE |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panama Papers are a very serious issue for Panama because it affects in an "unfair" manner the country's image and is not the result of an investigation, but is a "hack". This was stated on April 5, by Adolfo Linares, president of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama (Cciap).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Panama-Papers-difamacion-escandalo_0_4453804578.html |title='Panama Papers', una campaña de difamación al país: Adolfo Linares |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Colegio Nacional de Abogados de Panama (CNA) urged the Panamanian government to sue anyone who has affected the country's image with the massive leak of documents linking the Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca with the creation of companies to move capital evading taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nextvpanama.com/noticias/gremio-de-abogados-insta-gobierno-panameno-demandar-por-dano-de-imagen-33991 |title=Gremio de abogados insta a Gobierno panameño demandar por daño de imagen |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224026/http://www.nextvpanama.com/noticias/gremio-de-abogados-insta-gobierno-panameno-demandar-por-dano-de-imagen-33991 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Political analyst Mario Rognoni said that Panama is the most affected in the whole scandal 'Panama Papers'. He said the world is pointing to Panama as a tax haven and will depend on the policies adopted by the authorities.
On the government of President Juan Carlos Varela, he believes he might be involved if he tries to cover up the responsibility of those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/panama-sale-afectado/23932073 |title=Panamá sale afectado |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist Rolando Gordon said this hurts the country that has just emerged from the gray list of FATF. The US could ask Panama to modify the law, he said.
He explained that at this time is seen as a scandal, but will each country, especially Panama to conduct investigations and determine whether it is true that illegal or improper acts were committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/repercucion-economica/23932074 |title=Repercución económica |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panama's Lawyers Movement  listed as a 'cyber bullying or international cyberterrorism' scandal called 'Panama Papers'. In a press conference, the guild primarily condemned the attack on the country brand 'Panama'.

The documents leaked indicated that [[Sergei Roldugin]], a professional [[Cello|cellist]] described by [[Novaya Gazeta]] as [[Vladimir Putin]]'s best friend and the godfather of his eldest daughter, had acquired assets worth at least $100 million, including a 12.5% stake in Video International, Russia's largest television advertising firm.&lt;ref name="Guardian Putin"/&gt; It was also revealed that Roldugin had acquired these assets in what the ''[[BBC]]'' described as "suspicious deals".&lt;ref name="BBC News 2016 ppp"&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama Papers: Putin associates linked to 'money laundering' |website=BBC News |date=April 3, 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35918845 |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin spokesperson [[Dmitry Peskov]] said that Western mainstream media reporting of the Panama Papers was engaged in "Putinophobia".

Initially, aside from few independent outlets, Russian media entirely ignored the leak. ''Channel 1'' and ''Rossiya 1'', both state owned, did not mention the Panama Papers at all on April 4, when the story broke. When an opposition politician asked why the media was ignoring the story, [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov|Dmitry Kiselev]], head of ''[[Rossiya Segodnya]]'', refused to discuss or comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7325384/russian-state-media-mostly-ignore-panama-papers-putin|title=Russian State Media Mostly Ignore Panama Papers|author=|date=|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that some coverage was given to the story it was often done in the middle of the night, and focused exclusively on international celebrities rather than the links to Putin's circles found in the papers.&lt;ref name=atl/&gt; Coverage of the leak began to appear after Peskov's reaction, but generally focused on Peskov's comments rather than discussing the information in the Panama Papers.&lt;ref name=atl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/russia-panama-papers/476952/|title=The Panama Papers in Russia|author=Tom Balmforth|date=|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ukrainian President [[Petro Poroshenko]] ran for office in 2014, he pledged to sell his candy business ([[Roshen]]) if elected, but leaked documents indicate that on August 21, 2014 he instead had Mossack Fonseca set up offshore holding company Prime Asset Partners Ltd in the [[British Virgin Islands]] and moved his company there, roughly two months after the election.The move had the potential to save him millions of dollars on his Ukrainian taxes.&lt;ref name=Poroshenko/&gt; Records in Cyprus show him as the firm's only shareholder.&lt;ref name=Poroshenko2&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-ukraine-petro-poroshenko-secret-offshore-firm-russia|author=Luke Harding |title=Ukraine's leader set up secret offshore firm as battle raged with Russia |work=Guardian |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poroshenko denied any wrongdoing and a spokesman said the offshore company had no active assets and was a legitimate corporate restructure aimed at helping to sell Poroshenko's [[Roshen|Roshen group]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 2016"/&gt; Analysts in Ukraine responded that the secretive way Poroshenko set up these accounts was certain to undermine trust in him, [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc|his party]] and Ukraine itself.&lt;ref name="KyivPost"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anything To Hide?: Revelations undercut trust in Poroshenko |date=April 7, 2016 |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/anything-to-hide-revelations-undercut-trust-in-poroshenko-411582.html|publisher=Kyiv Post|author=Oksana Grytsenko|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|United States as a tax haven}}
President [[Barack Obama]] was critical of Caribbean tax havens in his 2008 election campaign.&lt;ref name="Hockney2014"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mike |last=Hockney |title=All the Rest Is Propaganda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BGFdCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT168 |date=September 12, 2014 |work=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-326-01638-8|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the United States implemented the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]]; the law required financial firms around the world to report accounts held by US citizens to the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

Former Secretary of State and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Presidential front-runner [[Hillary Clinton]] condemned "outrageous tax havens and loopholes ... in Panama and elsewhere".&lt;ref name=CBSafl&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-attacks-sanders-china-in-speech-to-union/ |title=Hillary attacks Sanders, China in speech to union | author=Hannah Fraser-Chanpong | accessdate=April 24, 2016 |date=April 6, 2016 |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a [[Pennsylvania AFL–CIO]] event. Clinton added that "some of this behavior is clearly against the law, and everyone who violates the law anywhere should be held accountable", but it was "scandalous how much is actually legal".&lt;ref name=CBSafl /&gt; Clinton promised that "We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America."&lt;ref name=CBSafl /&gt;

The US on the other hand refused the [[Common Reporting Standard]] set up by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], alongside [[Vanuatu]] and [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="SwansonApr5"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=How the U.S. became one of the world's biggest tax havens|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-u-s-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens/|accessdate=April 23, 2016|work=Washington Post|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the US receives tax and asset information for American assets and income abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries, in other words has become attractive as a tax haven.

==== Panama Free Trade Agreement ====

The [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Panama Free Trade Agreement]],&lt;!-- Majority of sources use phrase "Panama Free Trade Agreement --&gt; supported by Obama and Clinton, has been accused of enabling the practices detailed within the Panama Papers through regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mindock|first1=Clark|title=Panama Papers: Obama, Clinton Pushed Trade Deal Amid Warnings It Would Make Money Laundering, Tax Evasion Worse|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076|work=International Business Times|date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Obama administration official said the argument has "zero merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mauldin|first1=William|last2=Viswanatha|first2=Aruna|title=Sanders Says U.S. Helped Panama as a Tax Haven But Skips Over Tax Pact|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370|accessdate=April 24, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cassidy of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' says the Panama Free Trade Agreement actually forced Panama to release information to the American regulatory authorities on "the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, and other persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names|title=Panama Papers: Why Aren't There More American Names?|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=April 5, 2016|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing leaked diplomatic cables, ''Fortune'' writer Chris Matthews speculated that Obama and Clinton may have supported the agreement, after opposing it while campaigning for office, because it was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for Panamanian support of US efforts against drug trafficking. In any event, he notes, while it is true that the agreement abolished limits on fund transfers between the US and Panama, the Obama administration insisted that the two countries first sign a [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information and Exchange Agreement]] as well, which facilitated the exchange of tax information between the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |title=Panama Papers: Why Did Clinton and Obama Flip Flop on Trade with Panama |first=Chris |last=Matthews |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 | work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After the leak ====

President Barack Obama addressed the overseas shell companies listed by the leak in a press conference: "It's not that they're breaking the laws," he said, "it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boland-Rudder |first1=Hamish |last2=Holmes |first2=Allan |last3=Chittum |first3=Ryan |title=Impact of Panama Papers rockets around the world; U.S. officials react cautiously |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=Center for Public Integrity |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034506/https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archivedate=May 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no leader in the US was mentioned in the Panama Papers, Obama said that "Frankly, folks in America are taking advantage of the same stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Revesz|first1=Rachael|title=Obama says Americans are doing the same Panama Papers tax avoidance as everyone else |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html|accessdate=April 23, 2016|work=The Independent|date=April 5, 2016|location=New York, United States|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senators [[Sherrod Brown]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] have requested that the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] investigate any US-linked companies that appeared in the leaks, and members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for [[New York (state)|the state of New York]] ([[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] representative [[Carolyn Maloney]] – a high-ranking member of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]] – and [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] representative [[Peter T. King]]&lt;ref name=Cura&gt;[http://curacaochronicle.com/economy/ny-banks-ordered-to-provide-information-on-panama-dealings/ "NY banks ordered to provide information on Panama dealings"]. ''Curaçao Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;) have introduced the ''Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act'', a proposed bill which would: &lt;blockquote&gt;...ensure that persons who form corporations or limited liability companies in the United States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations or limited liability companies, in order to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations and limited liability companies for criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in detecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct involving United States corporations and limited liability companies, and for other purposes.&lt;ref name=Cura/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the ''[[Fair Observer]]'': "The law contains many reasonable exemptions, including public corporations (who already have registers of beneficial owners); churches and other non-profits; and owners of businesses with more than 20 employees, $5 million in annual revenues and a physical presence such as an office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What the Panama Papers Have To Do With America|url=http://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/what-panama-papers-have-to-do-america-32329/|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=Fair Observer|date=11 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill has faced resistance from the [[National Association of Secretaries of State]], who are concerned about loss of tax revenue and the burden of regulation.&lt;ref name="SwansonApr5"/&gt; NASS has also called for "existing solutions" being used to combat the issue, saying that "federal legislation won't work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Company Ownership|url=http://www.nass.org/nass-initiatives/nass-company-formation-task-force/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429012250/http://www.nass.org/nass-initiatives/nass-company-formation-task-force/|archivedate=2016-04-29|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=National Association of Secretaries of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Mossack]] testified under oath that M.F. Corporate Services (Nevada) Ltd. had no affiliation with the Panamanian Mossack Fonseca, but the Panama Papers show that it was in fact a wholly owned subsidiary and tried to hide the relationship, ordering emails and other computer footprints deleted.&lt;ref name=icijnev&gt;{{cite news | url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160403-mossack-fonseca-offshore-secrets.html |title=Panamanian Law Firm Is Gatekeeper To Vast Flow of Murky Offshore Secrets: Files show client roster that includes drug dealers, Mafia members, corrupt politicians and tax evaders — and wrongdoing galore | first=Martha M.|last=Hamilton |date=April 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016| work=ICIJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21696997-thinking-investigating-firm-mentioned-panama-papers-read-keys |title=Unlocking Mossack Fonseca: The key's in Sin City| date=April 16, 2016 |accessdate= April 23, 2016 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was fighting an order that it turn over the details of 123 shell companies created by an associate of a former [[President of Argentina]].&lt;ref name=icijnev /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303847804579481762029605186 |title=Hedge Fund Seeks Assets in Nevada in Battle Over Argentine Debt: NML Takes Aim at Associate of Cristina Kirchner and Her Late Husband |work=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |date=April 7, 2014 |first1=Shane |last1=Romig |first2=Santiago |last2=Pḗrez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manhattan US Attorney [[Preet Bharara]] has opened a criminal investigation on matters related to the Panama Papers and sent a letter April 3 to the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) saying his office "would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/110445-160420-us-opens-criminal-probe-linked-to-panama-paper-revelations-icij |title=US opens criminal probe linked to Panama Paper revelations: ICIJ |author=AFP |work=i24 News |date=April 20, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICIJ received many such requests from many countries and ICIJ Director Gerard Ryle has said its policy is not to turn over any materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160412-global-tax-officials-meeting.html |first=Martha M.|last=Hamilton |title=Global joint investigation to be proposed at special tax meeting|date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Americans ====

[[McClatchy Newspapers]], the only participating US news organization in the investigation, found four Americans with offshore shell companies named in the documents. All had previously been either accused or convicted of financial crimes such as fraud or tax evasion.&lt;ref name=SeattleUS&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Kevin G. |last2=Taylor |first2=Marisa |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/americans-including-a-bellevue-man-show-up-in-panama-papers/ |title=Americans, including a Bellevue man, show up in Panama Papers |publisher=Seattle Times |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three reasons have been suggested to explain the paucity of Americans in the leak:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35966612 |title=Panama Papers: Where are the Americans? |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shell companies can be created in the United States,
* major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands instead
* US laws like the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) and the [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information Exchange Agreements]] (TIEAs) of 2010 have meant that the "tax evasion game [was] principally over for American taxpayers."

Asked about the paucity of American individuals in the documents, digital editor of ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]],'' Stefan Plöchinger, said via Twitter: "Just wait for what is coming next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everyone is freaking out about the Panama Papers—but the biggest fallout is yet to come |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/04/panama-papers-offshore-tax-havens-are-getting-their-day-spotlight |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=Mother Jones |date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plöchinger later clarified that he was just advocating not jumping to conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/04/why-are-there-no-us-people-in-the-panama-papers-5794114/ |title=Why are there no US people in the Panama papers?|date=April 4, 2016|first=Jen|last=Mills|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City|New York]]'s Department of Financial Services has asked 13 foreign banks, including [[Deutsche Bank AG]], [[Credit Suisse Group AG]], [[Commerzbank AG]], [[ABN Amro Group NV]] and [[Societe Generale|Societe Generale SA]], for information about their dealings with Mossack Fonseca. The banks are not accused of wrongdoing but must provide telephone logs and records of other transactions between their New York branches and the law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-20/ny-regulator-asks-banks-for-records-linked-to-panama-papers-firm |title=New York Wants Foreign Banks to Hand Over Panama Records |first1=Greg |last1=Farrell |first2=Tom |last2=Schoenberg |first3=Katherine |last3=Chiglinsy| date=April 20, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of at least 200 American passports – indicating that their owners applied for banking services – have been discovered in the Papers, but no US politicians have yet been named in the leak.&lt;ref name=SeattleUS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Power Players"&gt;{{cite news| title = Panama Papers: The Power Players| publisher = [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] |url= https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/| accessdate = April 3, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160404042238/https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/ |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of a few Americans are however mentioned:
* Puerto Rican recording artist Ramón Luis Ayala, better known as [[Daddy Yankee]], appears in the leaked documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fusion.net/story/288251/panama-papers-leak-celebrities-list-of-names/ |title=Here are the most famous celebrities with ties to the huge Panama Papers leak |first1=Danielle |last1=Wiener-Bronner |first2=David |last2=Matthews |author3=Fusion Investigative Unit|date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEO and then Chairman of [[Citibank]] (1998-2006) [[Sanford Weill]] appears in the documents as sole shareholder of April Fool, a company based in the British Virgin Islands that managed a yacht of the same name 2001-2005. Weill's second company, Brightao, includes Chinese and American investors and holds share in a Chinese insurance and risk-management firm, Mingya Insurance Brokers.
* Jerry Slusser, a fundraiser for Republican [[Mitt Romney]], initially said he did not recall opening an offshore company, but then called his accountant and said it was for an investment in Hong Kong that eventually showed a loss. He declined to provide further detail.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite news|url=

Josmel Velásquez, brother of a security official under the late [[Hugo Chávez]], was arrested April 15 trying to catch a flight out of the country due to an offshore company revealed by the Panama Papers.

== WikiLeaks ==

Icelandic investigative journalist and [[WikiLeaks]] spokesperson [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]] has called for the Panama Papers to be published in full online. Hrafnsson, who worked on [[Cablegate]] in 2010, said the withholding of documents is understandable to maximise the impact, but said that in the end the papers should be published in full for the public to access.&lt;ref name="BelfastTelegraphWikiLeaks"&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: WikiLeaks calls for data leak to be released in full |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/panama-papers/panama-papers-wikileaks-kristinn-hrafnsson-calls-for-data-leak-to-be-released-in-full-34601909.html |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrafnsson's comments were reinforced by a [[Twitter#Features#Tweets|tweet]] from WikiLeaks which criticized the decision of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|ICIJ]] to not allow full and transparent access to the Panama Papers, stating that, "If you censor more than 99% of the documents you are engaged in 1% journalism by definition."&lt;ref name="carbonated.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonated.tv/news/wikileaks-panama-papers-us-government-fund-vladimir-putin|title=Vladimir Putin Would Love WikiLeaks' Theory About The Panama Papers|work=Carbonated.TV|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408015714/http://www.carbonated.tv/news/wikileaks-panama-papers-us-government-fund-vladimir-putin|archivedate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks's position was, in turn, criticized, as the decision to disclose the documents at once would not have been the right one as far as "journalistic ethics" were concerned.&lt;ref name="carbonated.tv"/&gt; WikiLeaks also argued via a [[Twitter#Features#Tweets|tweet]] that the connection between the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] and the American government would undermine the integrity of the news leak;&lt;ref name="carbonated.tv"/&gt; this position was also, in turn, criticized as a theory which "Vladimir Putin would love."&lt;ref name="carbonated.tv"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1797">'''Scottish Assessors''' (the '''Scottish Assessors Association''', SSA) is a voluntary, non-statutory association of [[Assessor (property)|land valuation assessors]] and their senior staff in [[Scotland]]. The association encourages a consistent approach to the administration of [[valuation (rates)|valuation]], [[council tax]] and [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom|electoral registration]].

Founded in 1975, in conjunction with the abolition of the [[Scottish counties]], Scottish Assessors is the successor to the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors of Scotland'', founded in 1957, and the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors'', founded in 1886.

The SAA liaises with the [[Valuation Office Agency]] of England and Wales, the [[Valuation Office]] (Oifig Luachála) of Ireland, and the [[Land and Property Service]] in Northern Ireland.

==Assessors==
Scottish [[Assessor (property)|Assessors]] are independent public officials who decide the rateable value of property listed on a local valuation roll. They must be members of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] and work under the umbrella body, the Scottish Assessors Association.

A '''security agency''' is a [[governmental organization]] which conducts [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] activities for the [[internal security]] of a [[nation]]. They are the domestic cousins of foreign [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], and typically conduct [[counterintelligence]] to thwart other countries' foreign intelligence efforts. For example, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) is the internal intelligence, security and [[law enforcement]] agency, while the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) is an external intelligence service, which deals primarily with intelligence collection overseas. A similar relationship exists in Britain between [[MI5]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].

The distinction, or overlap, between security agencies, [[Law enforcement agency#natpol|national police]], and [[gendarmerie]] organizations varies by country. For example, in the United States, one organization, the FBI, is a national police, an internal security agency, and a counterintelligence agency. In other countries, separate agencies exist, although the nature of their work causes them to interact. For example, in France, the [[National Police (France)|Police nationale]] and the [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie nationale]] both handle policing duties, and the [[Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur]] handles counterintelligence.

Likewise, the distinction, or overlap, between [[military]] and [[civilian]] security agencies varies between countries. In the United States, the FBI and CIA are civilian agencies, although they have various [[paramilitary]] traits and have professional relationships with the U.S.'s [[military intelligence]] organizations. In many countries all intelligence efforts answer to the military, whether by official design or at least on a [[de facto]] basis. Countries where various military and civilian agencies divide responsibilities tend to reorganize their efforts over the decades to force the various agencies to cooperate more effectively, integrating (or at least coordinating) their efforts with some unified directorate. For example, after many years of turf wars, the member agencies of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence community]] are now coordinated by the [[Director of National Intelligence]], with the hope to reduce [[stovepiping]] of information.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], for example, intelligence operations relevant to internal security are conducted by the military ([[Directorate of Intelligence (Ireland)|G2]]) and police ([[Special Detective Unit|SDU]]), rather than civilian agencies.

Security agencies frequently have "security", "intelligence" or "service" in their names. Private organizations that provide services similar to a security agency might be called a "security company" or "security service", but those terms can also be used for organizations that have nothing to do with intelligence gathering.

==Security agency vs. secret police==

There is debate about whether some security agencies should be characterized as secret police forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The extent to which security agencies use domestic covert operations to exert political control varies by country and political system.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Such operations can include surveillance, infiltration, and disruption of dissident groups, attempts to publicly discredit dissident figures, and even assassination or extrajudicial detention and execution.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Security agencies are constrained in some countries by a mesh of judicial and legislative accountability, whereas in others they may answer only to a single leader or executive committee.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Small hydro''' is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale suitable for local community and industry, or to contribute to [[distributed generation]] in a regional electricity grid.&lt;ref name=Thesis&gt;{{cite web |last=Crettenand |first=N. |year=2012 |title=The facilitation of mini and small hydropower in Switzerland: shaping the institutional framework. With a particular focus on storage and pumped-storage schemes |work= Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). PhD Thesis N° 5356 |url= http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/176337?ln=en |publisher=Infoscience.epfl.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a small hydro project varies, but a generating capacity of 1 to 20 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is common. In contrast many hydroelectric projects are of enormous size, such as the generating plant at the [[Three Gorges Dam]] at 22,500 megawatts or the vast multiple projects of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].  In India, hydro projects up to 25 MW station capacities have been categorized as Small Hydro Power (SHP) projects.&lt;ref&gt;https://mnre.gov.in/small-hydro&lt;/ref&gt;

Small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a national electricity grid, or in areas where a national grid does not exist.

==Description==
The use of the term "small hydro" varies considerably around the world, the maximum limit is usually somewhere between 10 and 30 MW. While a minimum limit is not usually set, the US National Hydropower Association specifies a minimum limit of 5 MW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/2012_Hydropower_Roadmap.pdf pg17&lt;/ref&gt;  The "small hydro" description may be stretched up to {{nowrap|50 MW}} in the United States, Canada and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf |title=Power Sector |publisher=International Renewable Energy Agency |date=2012-06-00 |accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small hydro can be further subdivided into mini hydro, usually defined as 100 to 1,000 [[kilowatt]]s (kW), and [[micro hydro]] which is 5 to 100&amp;nbsp;kW. Micro hydro is usually the application of hydroelectric power sized for smaller communities, single families or small enterprise. The smallest installations are [[pico hydro]], below 5&amp;nbsp;kW.

Since small hydro projects usually have correspondingly small civil construction work and little or no reservoir, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro.

==Growth==

According to a report by REN21, during 2008 small hydro installations grew by 28% over year 2005 to raise the total world small hydro capacity to 85 [[gigawatt]]s (GW). Over 70% of this was in China (with 65 GW), followed by Japan (3.5 GW), the United States (3 GW) and India (2 GW).&lt;ref name="REN21-2006"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121733/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006, accessed 2007-05-16&lt;/ref&gt; Global growth is expected to be 2.8% annually until the mid-2020s when capacity will be about 150 gigawatts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3572050&lt;/ref&gt;

China planned to electrify a further 10,000 villages between 2005 and 2010 under their [[China Village Electrification Program]], including further investments in small hydro and [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref name="REN21-2006" /&gt; By 2010, China had 45,000 small hydro installations, especially in rural areas, producing 160 Twh annually.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf pg12&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of the world's potential small hydro power was found in Asia; however, the report noted, "It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/article.asp?id=471|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2016|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy-l.iisd.org/news/unido-icshp-launch-small-hydropower-knowledge-sharing-portal|title=UNIDO, ICSHP Launch Small Hydropower Knowledge Sharing Portal|publisher=Sustainable Energy Policy and Practice|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energias-renovables.com/articulo/small-hydropower-a-promising-technology-for-rural-20130514|title=Small Hydropower, a promising technology for rural electrification|publisher=www.energias-renovables.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mountains and rain forests of [[British Columbia]], Canada there are a great many sites suitable for hydro development. However environmental concerns towards large reservoirs after the 1980s halted new dam construction. The solution to coping with increased demand was to offer contracts to [[Independent power producers in British Columbia|independent power producers]], who have built 100 [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run of the river]] projects under 50 MW. Power production without reservoirs varies dramatically, but older conventional dams retain or release water to average out production though the year. In 2014 these independent producers generated 18,000 GWh from 4,500 MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/acquiring_power/meeting_energy_needs/how_power_is_acquired.html|title=About Independent Power Projects|publisher=|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206095445/https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/acquiring_power/meeting_energy_needs/how_power_is_acquired.html|archivedate=6 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generation ==
{{main|hydroelectricity}}
[[File:HKO_Transmission_02.JPG|thumb|Historic [[Ottenbach Small Hydro]] with original equipment of 1920 in [[Ottenbach, Switzerland]], still running for guided visits]]
[[File:Hongping-Power-Station-5425.jpg|thumb|Hongping Power station, in Hongping Town, [[Shennongjia]], has a design typical for small hydro stations in the western part of China's [[Hubei]] Province. Water comes from the mountain behind the station, through the black pipe seen in the photo]]

Hydroelectric power is the generation of electric power from the movement of water. A  hydroelectric facility requires a dependable flow of water and a reasonable height for the water to fall, called the [[Hydraulic head|head]]. In a typical installation, water is fed from a reservoir through a pipe into a [[hydro turbine|turbine]]. The water flowing through the turbine causes a [[electrical generator]] to rotate, converting the motion into electrical energy.

Small hydro may developed by constructing new facilities or through re-development of existing dams whose primary purpose is flood control, or irrigation. Old hydro sites may be  re-developed, sometimes salvaging substantial investment in the installation such as penstock pipe and turbines, or just re-using the water rights associated with an abandoned site. Either of these cost saving advantages can make the return on investment for a small hydro site well worth the use of existing sites.

== Project design ==

Many companies offer standardized turbine generator packages in the approximate size range of 200&amp;nbsp;kW to 10 MW. These "water to wire" packages simplify the planning and development of the site since one vendor looks after most of the equipment supply. Because non-recurring engineering costs are minimized and development cost is spread over multiple units, the cost of such package systems is reduced.  While synchronous generators capable of isolated plant operation are often used, small hydro plants connected to an electrical grid system can use economical [[induction generator]]s to further reduce installation cost and simplify control and operation.

Small [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|"run of the river"]] projects do not have a conventional dam with a reservoir, only a [[weir]] to form a headpond for diversion of inlet water to the turbine. Unused water simply flows over the weir and the headpond may only be capable of a single day's storage, not enough for dry summers or frozen winters when generation may come to a halt. A preferred scenario is to have the inlet in an existing lake. 

Countries like India and China have policies in favor of small hydro, and the regulatory process allows for building dams and reservoirs. In North America and Europe the regulatory process is too long and expensive to consider having a dam and a reservoir for a small project.

Small hydro projects usually have faster environmental and licensing procedures, and since the equipment is usually in serial production, standardized and simplified, and the civil works construction is also reduced, the projects may be developed very rapidly. The physically smaller size of equipment makes it easier to transport to remote areas without good road or rail access.

One measure of decreased environmental impact with lakes and reservoirs depends on the balance between stream flow and power production. Reducing water diversions helps the river's ecosystem, but reduces the hydro system's [[return on Investment]] (ROI). The hydro system design must strike a balance to maintain both the health of the stream and the economics.

The '''Socialist Revolutionary Party''', or '''Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries''' (the '''SRs'''; {{lang-ru|Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры}}, ''esery'') was a major [[political party]] in early 20th century [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. 

A key player in the [[Russian Revolution]], the SRs' general ideology was [[revolutionary socialism]] of [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] forms. After the [[February Revolution]], it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|Russia's first-ever democratic elections]] (to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]), but the [[October Revolution]] had changed the political landscape and the [[Bolsheviks]] disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1978/lenin3/ch03.html|author=Tony Cliff|title=The Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly|publisher=Marxists.org|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions. The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs and which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader [[Alexander Kerensky]], was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] and subsequent persecution.

== History ==
=== Prior to the Russian Revolution ===
The party's ideology was built upon the philosophical foundation of Russia's [[Narodniks|Narodnik]]–[[populism|populist]] movement of the 1860s–1870s and its worldview developed primarily by [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Pyotr Lavrov]]. After a period of decline and marginalization in the 1880s, the Narodnik–populist school of thought about social change in Russia was revived and substantially modified by a group of writers and activists known as ''neonarodniki'' (neo-populists), particularly [[Viktor Chernov]]. Their main innovation was a renewed dialogue with Marxism and integration of some of the key Marxist concepts into their thinking and practice. In this way, with the economic spurt and industrialization in Russia in the 1890s, they attempted to broaden their appeal in order to attract the rapidly growing urban workforce to their traditionally peasant-oriented programme. The intention was to widen the concept of the people so that it encompassed all elements in society that opposed the [[Tsar]]ist regime.

The party was established in 1902 out of the Northern Union of Socialist Revolutionaries (founded in 1896), bringing together many local socialist revolutionary groups established in the 1890s, notably the Workers' Party of Political Liberation of Russia created by [[Catherine Breshkovsky]] and [[Grigory Gershuni]] in 1899. As primary party theorist emerged [[Viktor Chernov]], the editor of the first party organ, ''Revolutsionnaya Rossiya'' (''Revolutionary Russia''). Later party periodicals included ''Znamia Truda'' (''Labor's Banner''), ''Delo Naroda'' (''People's Cause'') and ''Volia Naroda'' (''People's Will''). Party leaders included Gershuni, Breshkovsky, [[Andrei Argunov]], [[Nikolai Avksentiev]], [[Mikhail Gots]], [[Mark Natanson]], Rakitnikov (Maksimov), [[Vadim Rudnev]], [[Nikolay Rusanov]], [[Ilya Rubanovich]] and [[Boris Savinkov]].

The party's program was [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]]—it garnered much support among Russia's rural [[peasant]]ry, who in particular supported their program of land-socialization as opposed to the Bolshevik programme of land-nationalisation—division of land to peasant tenants rather than the collectivization in state management. The party's policy platform differed from that of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP)—both [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] and [[Mensheviks|Menshevik]]—in that it was not officially [[Marxism|Marxist]] (though some of its ideologues considered themselves such). The SRs believed that the labouring peasantry as well as the industrial proletariat would be the revolutionary class in Russia. Whereas RSLDP defined class membership in terms of ownership of the means of production, Chernov and other SR theorists defined class membership in terms of extraction of surplus value from labour. On the first definition, small-holding subsistence farmers who do not employ wage labour are—as owners of their land—members of the petty bourgeoisie whereas on the second definition they can be grouped with all who provide, rather than purchase, labour-power and hence with the proletariat as part of the labouring class. Nevertheless, Chernov considered the proletariat as vanguard and the peasantry as the main body of the revolutionary army.&lt;ref&gt;Hildermeier, M., ''Die Sozilrevolutionäre Partei Russlands''. Cologne 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904-kamf.jpg|thumb|''Kampf un kempfer'', a [[Yiddish]] pamphlet published by the SRs exile branch in [[London]], 1904]]
The party played an active role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] and in the [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]]s. Although the party officially boycotted the first [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] in 1906, 34 SRs were elected while 37 were elected to the second Duma in 1907. The party also boycotted both the third and fourth Dumas in 1907–1917. In this period, party membership drastically declined and most of its leaders emigrated from Russia.

A distinctive feature of party tactics until about 1909 was its heavy reliance on assassinations of individual government officials. These tactics were inherited from SRs' predecessor in the populist movement, People's Will, a conspiratorial organization of the 1880s. They were intended to embolden the "masses" and intimidate ("terrorize") the Tsarist government into [[concession (politics)|political concessions]]. The [[SR Combat Organization]] (SRCO), responsible for assassinating government officials, was initially led by Gershuni and operated separately from the party so as not to jeopardize its political actions. SRCO agents assassinated two Ministers of the Interior, [[Dmitry Sipyagin]] and [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich]], the Governor of Ufa N. M. Bogdanovich and many other high-ranking officials.

In 1903, Gershuni was betrayed by his deputy, [[Yevno Azef]], an agent of the [[Okhrana]] secret police, arrested, convicted of terrorism and sentenced to life at hard labor, managing to escape, flee overseas and go into exile. Azef became the new leader of the SRCO and continued working for both the SRCO and the Okhrana, simultaneously orchestrating terrorist acts and betraying his comrades. Boris Savinkov ran many of the actual operations, notably the assassination attempt on Admiral [[Fyodor Dubasov]].

However, terrorism was controversial for the party from the beginning. At its 2nd Congress in [[Imatra]] in 1906, the controversy over terrorism was one of the main reasons for the defection of the [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists|SR Maximalists]] on the left and the [[Popular Socialists (Russia)|Popular Socialists]] on the right. The Maximalists endorsed not only attacks on political and government targets, but also economic terror (i.e. attacks on landowners, factory owners and so on) whereas the Popular Socialists rejected all terrorism. Other issues also divided the defectors from the PSR as Maximalists disagreed with the SRs' strategy of a two-stage revolution as advocated by Chernov, the first stage being popular-democratic and the second labour-socialist. To Maximalists, this seemed like the RSDLP distinction between bourgeois-democratic and proletarian-socialist stages of revolution. Maximalism stood for immediate socialist revolution. Meanwhile, the Popular Socialists disagreed with the party's proposal to socialise the land (i.e. turn it over to collective peasant ownership) and instead wanted to nationalise it (i.e. turn it over to the state). They also wanted landowners to be compensated while the PSR rejected indemnities).

In late 1908, a Russian Narodnik and amateur spy hunter [[Vladimir Burtsev]] suggested that Azef might be a police spy. The party's Central Committee was outraged and set up a tribunal to try Burtsev for slander. At the trial, Azef was confronted with evidence and was caught lying, therefore he fled and left the party in disarray. The party's Central Committee, most of whose members had close ties to Azef, felt obliged to resign. Many regional organizations, already weakened by the revolution's defeat in 1907, collapsed or became inactive. Savinkov's attempt to rebuild the SRCO failed and it was suspended in 1911. Gershuni had defended Azef from exile in Zürich until his death there. The Azef scandal contributed to a profound revision of SR tactics that was already underway. As a result, it renounced assassinations ("[[individual terror]]") as a means of political protest.

With the start of [[World War I]], the party was divided on the issue of Russia's participation in the war. Most SR activists and leaders, particularly those remaining in Russia, chose to support the Tsarist government mobilization against Germany. Together with the like-minded members of the Menshevik Party, they became known as ''oborontsy'' ("defensists"). Many younger defensists living in exile joined the French Army as Russia's closest ally in the war. A smaller group, the internationalists, which included Chernov, favored the pursuit of peace through cooperation with socialist parties in both military blocs. This led them to participate in the [[Zimmerwald Conference|Zimmerwald]] and [[Reichenbach im Kandertal|Kienthal]] conferences with Bolshevik emigres led by Lenin. This fact was later used against Chernov and his followers by their right-wing opponents as alleged evidence of their lack of patriotism and Bolshevik sympathies.

=== Russian Revolution ===
{{main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:1917PartiyaSoz-Rev.jpg|thumb|200px|1917 SRs election poster whose caption in red reads партия соц-рев (in Russian), short for Party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries; the banner bears the party's motto {{lang|ru|В борьбе обретешь ты право свое}} ("Through struggle you will attain your rights"); and the globe bears the slogan {{lang|ru|земля и воля}} ("land and freedom"), expressing agrarian socialist ideology of the party]]
The February Revolution allowed the SRs to return to an active political role. Party leaders, including Chernov, returned to Russia. They played a major role in the formation and leadership of the soviets, albeit in most cases playing second fiddle to the Mensheviks. One member, [[Alexander Kerensky]], joined the Provisional Government in March 1917 as Minister of Justice, eventually becoming the head of a coalition socialist-liberal government in July 1917, although his connection with the party was tenuous. He had served in the [[Duma]] with the [[Trudoviks]], breakaway SRs that defied the party's refusal to participate in the Duma.

After the fall of the first coalition in April–May 1917 and the reshuffling of the Provisional Government, the party played a larger role. Its key government official at the time was Chernov who joined the government as Minister of Agriculture. Chernov also tried to play a larger role, particularly in foreign affairs, but he soon found himself marginalized and his proposals of far-reaching agrarian reform blocked by more conservative members of the government. After the failed Bolshevik uprising of July 1917, Chernov found himself on the defensive as allegedly soft on the Bolsheviks and was excluded from the revamped coalition in August 1917. The party was now represented in the government by Nikolai Avksentiev, a right-wing defensist, as Minister of the Interior.

This weakening of the party's position intensified the growing divide within it between supporters of the coalition with the Mensheviks and those inclined toward more resolute, unilateral action. In August 1917, [[Maria Spiridonova]], leader of the Left SRs, advocated scuttling the coalition and forming an SR-only government, but she was not supported by Chernov and his followers. This spurred the formation of the left-wing faction and its growing support for cooperation with the Bolsheviks. The Left SRs believed that Russia should withdraw immediately from [[World War I]] and they were frustrated that the Provisional Government wanted to postpone addressing the land question until after the convocation of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] instead of immediately confiscating the land from the landowners and redistributing it to the peasants.

Left SRs and Bolsheviks referred to the mainstream SR party as the "Right SR" party whereas mainstream SRs referred to the party as just "SR" and reserved the term "Right SR" for the right-wing faction of the party led by [[Catherine Breshkovsky]] and Avksentiev.&lt;ref&gt;Following this pattern, Soviet authorities called the trial of the SR Central Committee in 1922 the "[[1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries|Trial of the Right SRs]]". Russian emigres and most Western historians used the term "SR" to describe the mainstream party while [[Soviet historians]] used the term "Right SR" until the fall of Communism in the USSR.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary issues motivating the split were the war and the redistribution of land.

At the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets#Second Congress|Second Congress of Soviets]] on 25 October, when the Bolsheviks proclaimed the deposition of the Provisional government, the split within the SR party became final. The Left SR stayed at the Congress and were elected to the permanent [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] executive (while initially refusing to join the Bolshevik government) while the mainstream SR and their Menshevik allies walked out of the Congress. In late November, the Left SR joined the Bolshevik government, obtaining three ministries.

=== After the October Revolution ===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
In the [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|election to the Russian Constituent Assembly]] held two weeks after the Bolsheviks took power, the party still proved to be by far the most popular party across the country, gaining 40% of the popular vote as opposed to the Bolsheviks' 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeanhistory.about.com/od/russiaandukraine/a/Social-Revolutionaries-Srs.htm|author=Robert Wilde|title=Social Revolutionaries (SRs)|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks disbanded the Assembly in January 1918 and after that the SR became of less political significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Constituent-Assembly-Russian-government|title=Constituent Assembly|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Left SRs became the coalition partner of the Bolsheviks in the Soviet government, although they resigned their positions after the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (the peace treaty with the Central Powers that ended Russia's participation in World War I). A few Left SRs like [[Yakov Blumkin|Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin]] joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

Dissatisfied with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, two [[Cheka|Chekists]] who were left SRs assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Count [[Wilhelm von Mirbach|Wilhelm Mirbach]] early in the afternoon on 6 July.&lt;ref name=Felshtinsky&gt;{{cite book|first=Yuri|last=Felshtinsky|title=Lenin and His Comrades: The Bolsheviks Take Over Russia 1917-1924|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York|isbn13=9781929631957|date=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the assassination, the left SRs attempted a "[[Left SR uprising|Third Russian Revolution]]" against the Bolsheviks on 6–7 July, but it failed and led to the arrest, imprisonment, exile and execution of party leaders and members. In response, some SRs turned again to violence. A former SR, [[Fanny Kaplan]], tried to assassinate Lenin on 30 August. Many SRs fought for the [[White movement#White Army|Whites]] or [[Green armies|Greens]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] alongside some Mensheviks and other banned moderate socialist elements. The [[Tambov Rebellion]] against the Bolsheviks was led by an SR, [[Alexander Antonov (politician)|Aleksandr Antonov]]. However, after [[Alexander Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]] was installed as "Supreme Leader" of the White Movement in November 1918, he expelled all [[Marxism|Marxists]] from the ranks. As a result, many SRs placed their organization behind White lines at the service of the Red Guards and the Cheka. Later, many Left SRs became Communists.

Following Lenin's instructions, a [[1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries|trial of SRs was held in Moscow in 1922]], which led to protests by [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Albert Einstein]] among others. Most of the defendants were found guilty, but they did not plead guilty like the defendants in the later show trials in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Woitinsky, W. ''[http://www.readanybook.com/ebook/the-twelve-who-are-to-die-the-trial-of-the-socialists-revolutionists-in-moscow-280036]''. Berlin: 1922. p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In exile ===
The party continued its activities in exile. A Foreign Delegation of the Central Committee was established and based in [[Prague]]. The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner.

'''Toll tin''' was a term historically used in [[tin]] mining in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].  The holder of a set of [[tin bounds]] was required to pay the freeholder of the land on which the bounds had been pitched a portion, called toll tin,  of the tin ore (or [[black tin]]) extracted.

Toll tin became due as soon as the ore was broken from the ground and, although some freeholders may have taken it in this form, it is likely that others opted for the more practical approach of taking it as a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the refined tin (or [[white tin]]).

Toll tin was not the only way in which a miner's share of the tin extracted was reduced&amp;nbsp;— he was also required to pay a tax to the crown on the refined tin known as [[tin coinage]] before the tin could legally be sold.

'''United States Customs and Border Protection''' ('''CBP''') is the largest [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], and is the country's primary [[border control]] organization. It is charged with regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. regulations, including trade, [[customs]], and immigration. CBP is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cbp.gov/about About CBP]" U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Retrieved April 10, 2018. {{Usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/04/17/written-testimony-us-customs-and-border-protection-house-homeland-security News]" Homeland Security. April 17, 2012. Retrieved April 10, 2018. {{Usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a workforce of more than 45,600 sworn federal agents and officers.

==Organization==

===Overview===
CBP has a workforce of over 58,000 employees, including officers and agents, agriculture specialists, aircraft pilots, trade specialists, mission support staff, and canine enforcement officers and agents.
*More than 21,180 CBP Officers inspect and examine passengers and cargo at over 300 ports of entry.
*Over 2,200 CBP Agriculture Specialists work to curtail the spread of harmful pests and plant and animal diseases that may harm America's farms and food supply or cause bio- and agro-terrorism.
*Over 21,370 [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] Agents protect and patrol {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of border with Mexico and {{convert|5000|mi|km}} of border with Canada.
*Nearly 1,050 Air and Marine Interdiction Agents prevent people, weapons, narcotics, and conveyances from illegal entry by air and water.
*Nearly 2,500 employees in CBP revenue positions collect over $30 billion annually in entry duties and taxes through the enforcement of trade and tariff laws. In addition, these employees fulfill the agency's trade mission by appraising and classifying imported merchandise. These employees serve in positions such as import specialist, auditor, international trade specialist, and textile analyst.
*The primary goal of the CBP Canine Program is terrorist detection and apprehension. The CBP Canine Program is critical to the mission of the Department of Homeland Security: "To Protect the Homeland." The program conducts the largest number of [[working dog]]s of any U.S. federal [[law enforcement agency]]. [[Police dog|K-9]] teams are assigned to 73 commercial ports and 74 Border Patrol stations throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/canine-program|title=Canine Program |publisher=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/canine-program/history-3|title=Canine Program History|publisher=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 328&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/about/leadership-organization/executive-assistant-commissioners-offices POA]&lt;/ref&gt; officially designated ports of entry and an additional 14 pre-clearance locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry/operations/preclearance|title=Preclearance Locations|publisher=CBP.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Middle East]], [[Bermuda]], and the [[Caribbean]]. CBP is also in charge of the [[Container Security Initiative]], which identifies and inspects foreign cargo in its mother country before it is to be imported into the United States.

In addition the CBP has legal jurisdiction to conduct some activities up to 100 miles (161 km) inwards from any land or sea border.  This can include operating interior checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone|title=The Constitution in the 100-Mile Border Zone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBP assess all passengers flying into the U.S. for terrorist risk via the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF) and systems such as [[Advance Passenger Information System]] (APIS), United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology ([[US-VISIT]]), and the Student and Exchange Visitor System ([[SEVIS]]). CBP also works with the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] to screen high-risk imported food shipments in order to prevent [[Bioterrorism|bio-terrorism]] and [[agro-terrorism]].

Through the [[Container Security Initiative]], CBP works jointly with host nation counterparts to identify and screen containers that pose a risk at the foreign port of departure before they are loaded on board vessels bound for the U.S. CSI is implemented in 20 of the largest ports in terms of container shipments to the U.S., and at a total of 58 ports worldwide.

The [[Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection]] (SENTRI) program allows pre-screened, low-risk travelers from Mexico to be processed through dedicated lanes. [[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS]] is a similar program on the country's northern border with Canada. Along both borders, CBP has implemented the [[Free and Secure Trade]], which uses [[transponder]] technology and pre-arrival shipment information to process participating trucks as they arrive at the border. An agreement with Canada allows CBP to target, screen, and examine rail shipments headed to the U.S.

==Enforcement powers==
[[File:PHL DNC305 (28482015210).jpg|thumb|right|Scanning a delegate bus entering the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]]]
CBP has the authority to search outbound and inbound shipments, and uses targeting to carry out its mission in this area. Under Section 596 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930|Tariff Act]], CBP is required to seize and forfeit all merchandise that is stolen, smuggled, or clandestinely imported or introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1595a.html|title=19 U.S. Code § 1595a – Forfeitures and other penalties|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBP is also required to seize and forfeit controlled substances, certain contraband articles, and plastic explosives that do not contain a detection agent. In conjunction with the [[Department of State]] and the [[Bureau of the Census]], CBP has put in place regulations that require submission of electronic export information on [[U.S. Munitions List]] and for technology for the Commerce Control List. CBP uses advance information from the [[Automated Targeting System]] and the [[Automated Export System]] to identify cargo that may pose a threat. CBP also works with the Departments of State and Defense to improve procedures on exported shipments of foreign military sales commodities.

Merchandise may also be seized and forfeited if:

*Its importation is restricted or prohibited because of a law relating to health, safety or conservation;
*The merchandise is lacking a federal license required for the importation;
*The merchandise or packaging is in violation of copyright, trademark, trade name, or trade dress protections;
*The merchandise is intentionally or repetitively marked in violation of [[country of origin]] marking requirements; or
*The imported merchandise is subject to quantitative restrictions requiring a visa or similar document from a foreign government, and the document presented with the entry is counterfeit.

===Civil penalties===
Section 1592 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]] is the basic and most widely used customs penalty provision for the importation of goods.  It prescribes monetary penalties against any person who imports, attempts to import, or aids or procures the importation of merchandise by means of false or fraudulent documents, statements, omissions or practices, concerning any material fact.  Penalties may be applied even in situations where there is no loss of revenue.

Section 1592 infractions are divided into three categories of culpability, each giving rise to a different maximum penalty:

*''Fraud'', an act or omission done intentionally to defraud the United States.  The maximum civil penalty for a violation is the domestic value of the merchandise in the entry or entries concerned.
*''Gross negligence'', an act or omission with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and a disregard of section 1592 obligations. The maximum civil penalty is the lesser of the domestic value of the merchandise or four times the loss of revenue (actual or potential). If the infraction does not affect revenue, the maximum penalty is 40% of the dutiable value of the good.
*''Negligence'', involving a failure to exercise due care in ascertaining the material facts or in ascertaining the obligations under section 1592. The maximum civil penalties are the same for gross negligence, except the lesser of ''twice'' the domestic value of the merchandise or twice the loss of revenue is used. The penalty cannot exceed 20% of the dutiable value.
The [[Customs Modernization Act]] amended section 1592 to apply existing penalties for false information to information transmitted electronically and allows Customs to recover unpaid taxes and fees resulting from 592 violations. It also introduced the requirement that importers use "reasonable care" in making entry and providing the initial classification and appraisement, establishing a "shared responsibility" between Customs and importers, thus allowing Customs to rely on the accuracy of the information submitted and streamline entry procedures. To the extent that an importer fails to use reasonable care, Customs may impose a penalty.

US Customs Agriculture Specialist Officers are allowed to issue civil penalties in accordance with CFR 7 &amp; 9.

===Criminal penalties===
In addition to the civil penalties, a criminal fraud statute provides for sanctions to those presenting false information to customs officers, with violators facing a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, or a $5,000 fine, or both, for each violation involving an importation or attempted importation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8 U.S. Code § 542 – Entry of goods by means of false statements|publisher=Legal Information Institute|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/542|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===U.S. Customs Service===
{{Main|United States Customs Service}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:US Customs.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs Inspectors, late 19th century]] --&gt;
Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the [[American Revolutionary War]], the First [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[George Washington]] signed on July 4, the [[Tariff of 1789]], which authorized the collection of [[duty (economics)|duties]] on [[imports]]. Four weeks later, on July 31, the fifth [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789–1901|act of Congress]] established the [[United States Customs Service]] and its [[ports of entry]].

For nearly 125 years, the U.S. Customs Service was the primary source of governmental funds, which paid for the nation's early growth and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about/history|title=CBP Through the Years – U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=CBP|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases include the [[Louisiana]] and [[Oregon]] territories; [[Florida]], Alaska, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; funding the [[National Road]] and the [[Transcontinental Railroad]]; building many of the United States' [[lighthouse]]s; and the [[U.S. Military]] and [[U.S. Navy|Naval]] academies.

In March 2003, the Customs Service was renamed the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, and its structure split to form parts of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] as the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division.

===U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:INS 1924.jpg|thumb|Immigration inspectors, c. 1924]] --&gt;
Shortly after the [[American Civil War]], some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to rule in ''[[Chy Lung v. Freeman]]'' in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17109431320863199074&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Immigration Act of 1891]] established an Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. This office was responsible for admitting, rejecting, and processing all immigrants seeking admission to the United States and for implementing national immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.uwb.edu/guides/usimmigration/26%20stat%201084.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Immigrant inspectors", as they were then called, were stationed at major U.S. [[port of entry|ports of entry]] collecting manifests of arriving passengers. A "head tax" of fifty cents was collected on each immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/our-history/agency-history/early-american-immigration-policies|title=Early American Immigration Policies|work=USCIS|accessdate=April 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s primary interest in immigration was protecting American workers and wages – the reason it had become a federal concern in the first place. This made immigration more a matter of commerce than revenue; hence, in 1903, Congress transferred the Bureau of Immigration to the newly created [[Department of Commerce and Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cbp.gov/about/history/legacy/immigration-history U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service – Populating a Nation: A History of Immigration and Naturalization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220233531/http://www.cbp.gov/about/history/legacy/immigration-history |date=2014-12-20 }}'', cbp.gov, Retrieved December 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], Congress attempted to stem the flow of immigrants, still mainly coming from Europe, by passing laws in [[Emergency Quota Act|1921]] and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]] limiting the number of newcomers by assigning a quota to each nationality based upon its representation in previous [[U.S. census]] figures. Each year, the [[U.S. State Department]] issued a limited number of [[visa (document)|visas]]; only those immigrants who had obtained them and could present valid visas were permitted entry.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] from the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 1940.

===Reorganization (2003 to present)===
[[Image:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers (CBPO)]]
CBP Became an official agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] on March 1, 2003, combining employees from the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (specifically the Plant Protection Quarantine inspectors),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/safeguarding/downloads/implementation_reports/year3report.pdf|title=Safeguarding Implementation – Nearing the Finish|date=September 2003|work=[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (specifically, immigration inspectors and the [[United States Border Patrol]]), and the [[United States Customs Service]].  This transformation was led by former Commissioner [[Robert C. Bonner]].

[[W. Ralph Basham]] was nominated to the post of Commissioner by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/wbasham-bio.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Basham had 28 years of experience as a law enforcement manager, including serving as the head of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]. He had also served as the chief of staff for the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. It is the largest federal law enforcement agency that works closely with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).

In 2007, the [[U.S. Border Patrol]] joined two units, the [[Border Patrol Tactical Unit]] (BORTAC) and the [[Border Patrol, Search, Trauma and Rescue|Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit]] (BORSTAR), to form the U.S. Border Patrol's Special Operations Group (SOG),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Border%20Patrol%20Special%20Operations%20Group.pdf Special Operations Group PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318214228/http://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Border%20Patrol%20Special%20Operations%20Group.pdf|date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in El Paso, Texas. BORTAC and BORSTAR direct their nationally dispersed assets from the SOG, providing the U.S. Border Patrol with immediate tactical and emergency response assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/operations/special-operations|title=Special Operations – U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=CBP|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBP officers have full law enforcement powers on and off duty. CBP officers defend against terrorist intrusion by identifying high risk individuals who are attempting to enter into the United States; stop criminal activities – such as [[drug trafficking]], [[child pornography]] (including on computers, cell phones, and other electronic media), [[weapons trafficking]], and [[money laundering]] – by inspecting vehicles and trucks; and prevent the illegal entry of individuals, the smuggling of prohibited goods, and other customs and immigration violations. Officers are armed with [[Heckler &amp; Koch P2000]] pistols chambered in [[.40 S&amp;W]], expandable [[baton (law enforcement)|batons]], x26 [[Taser]]s and oleoresin capsicum [[pepper spray]]. In accordance with Public Law 110-161, CBP officers are covered under special law enforcement retirement, and all candidates must be referred for selection for this position before reaching their 40th birthday.

Import Specialists&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp/which-cbp-career/import-specialist Import Specialist PDF] Retrieved April 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; work side by side with law enforcement officers and legal professionals. They are responsible for classifying and appraising a portion of the billions of dollars’ worth of commercially imported merchandise that enters the U.S. every year. They determine which products may legally enter the country by enforcing laws protecting public health and safety, intellectual property rights and fair trade practices. They may also play a key role in criminal enforcement team investigations of smuggling, commercial fraud, and counterfeiting.

Import Specialists have the authority to issue penalties and fines, to seize prohibited or suspect cargo and to participate in negotiations and legal prosecution. Occasionally, Import Specialists may be given short-term assignments overseas as part of a multi-agency team. Responsibilities could include investigating foreign manufacturing facilities for violations involving child labor, product safety or other areas of concern to the U.S. Seven weeks of paid specialized training enable Import Specialists to develop an expert knowledge of import and export trends, commodities, and industries, as well as complex international trade agreements. CBP Import Specialists perform their mission at more than 300 ports of entry located at airports, seaports and land borders throughout the United States and along the Canadian and Mexican borders.

The U.S. Border Patrol Agent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp/which-cbp-career/border-patrol-agent|title=CBP Careers - Border Patrol Agent|publisher=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to Officer) is a federal law enforcement agent &lt;u&gt;actively patrolling&lt;/u&gt; a U.S. border to prevent persons from entering or leaving the United States without government permission. Agents detect and prevent the smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States, along with apprehending those people found to be in violation of immigration laws. Agents work to lower crime and improve the quality of life in border communities. In some areas, Agents are deputized or have peace-officer status and use it to enforce local and state/territory laws. More than 20,000 Border Patrol Agents safeguard nearly 6,000 miles of land border the United States shares with Canada and Mexico, and more than 2,000 miles of coastal waters.
[[File:CPB UAS Sample Surveillance Video 02282008 .theora.ogv|thumbnail|right|Border Surveillance video captured by a UAS (likely along the Mexican border).]]
One of the most important activities for a United States Border Patrol Agent is "line watch". This involves the detection, prevention and apprehension of [[terrorist]]s, illegal aliens and smugglers of both aliens and contraband at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor systems, aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks, marks and other physical evidence. Some of the major activities are farm and ranch check, traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.

All agents complete a 13-week paid "Basic Academy" training at the U.S. Border Patrol Academy in [[Artesia, New Mexico]].  Training includes such topics as immigration and nationality laws, physical training (PT), weapons and marksmanship. For those needing Spanish language instruction, an additional 8 weeks may be required beyond the 65 days of Basic Academy training.  Border Patrol Agents must be willing to work overtime and varying shifts under arduous conditions, and be proficient in the carry and use of firearms.  They may also be sent on temporary assignments on short notice, or on permanent reassignments to any duty location.  All new agents begin their careers along the Southwest border, where a working knowledge of Spanish is required.

**'''Marine Interdiction Agents (MIA)'''&lt;br /&gt;Marine Interdiction Agents are either the vessel commander or a crew member aboard an AMO vessel.&lt;ref name="AMOAnnual2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp/which-cbp-career/air-and-marine/marine-interdiction-agent|title=CBP Careers – Marine Interdiction Agent|publisher=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMO is the world's largest civilian aviation and maritime law enforcement organization. Its mission is to protect the American people and nation's critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of air and marine assets to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. Air and Marine Interdiction Agents are endowed with the authority to enforce Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) and Title 19 (Customs) of the United States Code in addition to the general law enforcement powers bestowed upon federal law enforcement agents.

This specialized law enforcement capability allows AMO to make significant contributions to the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to those of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. AMO is uniquely positioned to provide direct air and maritime support to multiple agencies and to ensure the success of border protection and law enforcement operations between ports of entry, within the maritime domain and within the nation's interior. To accomplish its mission, AMO employs over 1,200 Federal Agents at 70 locations, operating more than 260 aircraft of 26 different types, and approximately 300 maritime vessels. It is one of the major operational components within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Office of Field Operations (OFO) and the United States Border Patrol (USBP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/air-sea|title=CBP Air and Sea Security |publisher=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employee morale===
[[Image:CBP Officers pay tribute 2007.jpg|thumb|A color guard composed of CBP officers and USBP agents at a Washington, D.C. ceremony in May, 2007.]]

In July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS (which includes CBP) was last or near to last in every category including

*36th on the job satisfaction index
*35th on the leadership and knowledge management index
*36th on the results-oriented performance culture index
*33rd on the talent management index

The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within DHS. Based on the survey, the primary concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, and the inability of leadership to generate high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization and complaints from the traveling public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7chicago.com/|title=abc7chicago.com - ABC7 WLS Chicago and Chicago News|publisher=ABC 7 Chicago|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136|title=DHS memo reveals agency personnel are treated like &amp;quot;human capital&amp;quot; - the narcosphere|publisher=NarcoSphere|date=January 31, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, CBP Commissioner W. Ralph Basham announced to employees that the agency would be conducting 125 different focus groups in 12 different cities around the country to better understand their concerns as expressed in the Human Capital Survey. The agency is also going to give employees who are not a part of that focus group process an intranet virtual focus group where they can express their views and their concerns. The commissioner stated: "We are looking at this very seriously. We want to hear from the employees, we want to hear from these focus groups, we want to drill down on this survey." As 2011, more than four years after this statement was made, these focus groups have never been reported to have been held, nor have any plans been reported for them to be held in the future.

A November 2007 [[Government Accountability Office]] report showed that low staffing, training, and overwork is a large problem within CBP, and an average of 71 officers leave the service every two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/13/AR2007111302007.html|work=The Washington Post|title=One Tired, Under-Trained, Overworked Face at the Border|author=Barr, Stephen|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/department-homeland-security-annual-employee-survey|title=DHS Annual Employee Surveys|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polygraphing===
In 2011, the [[United States Congress]] mandated that applicants to CBP jobs undergo [[polygraph]] testing. The agency polygraphs about 10,000 applicants annually. From the start of the polygraphing until August 16, 2013, over 200 confessions of wrongdoing had been made. Many of the applicants confessed that they had close associations with drug traffickers or that they were directly involved in smuggling of drugs and illegal immigrants. The agency accused ten applicants of using countermeasures. As part of the "Operation Lie Busters", the name of the crackdown on polygraph countermeasures, all ten were not selected for employment.&lt;ref name=TaylorWootsonPolyFeds&gt;Taylor, Marisa and Cleve R.

==Weapons==
CBP Officers primary sidearm is the [[H&amp;K P2000]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/hk-p-2000-40-defends-the-homeland/|title=HK P-2000 .40 Defends the Homeland|date=January 24, 2008|publisher=Tactical Life|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; double action LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) pistol in [[.40 S&amp;W]] caliber. It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).  Like many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[Remington Model 870]] is the standard pump-action shotgun. The CBP issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to CBP specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical "ghost-ring" rear sight. CBP uses the [[.223 Remington|.223]] caliber Colt [[M4 Carbine|M4 Carbine (M4A1)]] as the standard long gun for CBP Officers assigned to its aviation and maritime interdiction units, the CBP Border Patrol, the CBP Special Response Teams.

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2018}}
{{see also|United States Border Patrol#Criticisms|Criticism of the United States government#Criticism of agencies}}

[[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' reported that CBP radiation-detection equipment at ports is better at detecting kitty litter than dangerous weapons, and that U.S. borders are so porous that congressional investigators carrying simulated nuclear materials have walked across unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17969438|author=Fessler, Pam|title=DHS Still Dogged by Questions over Effectiveness|department=Morning Edition|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=January 14, 2008|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled "''DHS Decision-Making: Competence or Character?''", James Giermanski states that the fundamental problem within CBP is that the agency has weak and sometimes flawed management. He says that DHS and CBP suffer from "seriously flawed decision-making", citing the "door only" policy, radio frequency identification technology, and lack of focus on exports which contain bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2122485/build-ci-sdlc/dhs-decision-making--competence-or-character-.html|title=Decision-Making: Competence or Character?|author=Gradijan, Dave|publisher=CSO|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency's practice of performing internal document checks on buses and trains running entirely within U.S. territory has been called "coercive, unconstitutional, and tainted by racial profiling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernstein, Nina|title=Border Sweeps in North Reach Miles Into U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/nyregion/30border.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of International Trade]] found that CBP improperly classified merchandise when it had untrained chemists testifying before the court. The court found that there were errors in the laboratory reports, that CBP destroyed the evidence, and the tests used by the chemist did not meet any [[Daubert standard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/SlipOpinions/Slip_op00/00-9.pdf ''THOM S. ZANI D/B/A WHOLESALE ART &amp; FRAME LTD., Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES, defendant''.] Retrieved April 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a federal court case for unlawful removal,{{specify|date=March 2016}} CBP and [[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys cited the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (04-473), which ruled that CBP employees do not have protection from retaliation by CBP managers under the First Amendment of the Constitution. The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation. In response to the Supreme Court decision of ''Garcetti v. Ceballos'', the House of Representatives passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007, and the Senate passed its version of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] (S. 274), which has significant bipartisan support.

In 2005, a merger of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] and CBP was considered, following a review at the request Senator [[Susan Collins]] (R-ME) chairwoman of the [[Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]], that found morale and operational issues with ICE and the overlapping responsibilities within the two agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2005/feb/16/20050216-123422-2436r/|title=Merger of ICE, CBP considered|accessdate=April 10, 2018|work=The Washington Times|date=February 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian author and marine biologist [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]] accused customs officers of assaulting him and throwing him in jail for the night of December 1, 2009 when he was returning to Toronto from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doctorow, Cory|title=Dr Peter Watts, Canadian science fiction writer, beaten and arrested at US border |url=http://boingboing.net/2009/12/11/dr-peter-watts-canad.html|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watts was tried before a jury and was found guilty of obstructing a federal officer. In April 2010 he was given a suspended sentence, and a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nickle, David|work=The Devil's Exercise Yard|title=Peter Watts is Free|url=http://davidnickle.blogspot.com/2010/04/peter-watts-is-free.html|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to immigration laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TRAC immigration web site|title=Aggravated Felonies and Deportation |url=http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/155/|year=2006|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watts' felony conviction prevents him from re-entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ashby, Madeline|publisher=Tor.com|title=Sometimes, we win.|url=http://www.tor.com/2010/04/27/sometimes-we-win/|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 report by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and [[University of Chicago Law School]]'s International Human Rights Clinic alleged that there was pervasive physical, verbal, sexual and psychological abuse of immigrant minors by DHS and CBP officials over the period 2009-2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/23/613907893/aclu-report-detained-immigrant-children-subjected-to-widespread-abuse-by-officia|title=ACLU Report: Detained Immigrant Children Subjected To Widespread Abuse By Officials|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs and Border Protection denied the allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''United and Cecil Club''' ('''U&amp;C''') is a British [[dining club]] with close links to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Formed in 1949 following the merger of the United Club and the Cecil Club, the club is the seventh-largest donor to the Conservatives, and focuses its donations on [[marginal seat]]s. Club members have been accused of taking advantage of a loophole in [[Political funding in the United Kingdom|political fundraising]] laws to donate large sums to the Conservatives without declaring them.&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-dining-club-secretively-channels-hundreds-of-thousands-of-pounds-of-funding-by-anonymous-9380723.html |title= Tory dining club secretively channels hundreds of thousands of pounds of funding by anonymous wealthy donors |author= Oliver Wright |date= 16 May 2014 |accessdate= 22 February 2017 |newspaper= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The two forerunners to the U&amp;C were both formed in the 1880s following the death of the unifying figure [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The Constituencies Union, which later became the United Club, was formed in 1881 to raise funds for Conservatives in difficult constituencies, while the National Review and Cecil Club was formed in 1882 by supporters of the Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]] to publish the journal ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Sources"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sources in British Political History 1900-1951 |page=107 |author= P. Jones, J. Sinclair, C. Cook, Jeffrey Weeks |volume=6 |year=1985 |isbn= 134917825X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These served as bastions of conservatism during the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] eras, but following the [[Second World War]] were merged by [[Winston Churchill]], who served as president of both.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmstnprv/431/43106.htm |title= Written evidence received by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards |author= Bernard Jenkin |date=29 March 2007 |accessdate= 22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The membership of the club is private. However, in response to a question from the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]] in 2007, the club declared that it had around 400 members, who each paid membership fees of £100 annually.&lt;ref name="evidence"/&gt; The club meets once a month while Parliament is in session for a total of eight dinners a year, and four of those dinners take place in the private banquet halls at the House of Commons. Dinners include a speech from a senior Conservative politician, and speakers have included [[John Major]] and [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref name="evidence"/&gt;

These dinners were subject to a complaint in 2006 from Labour MPs [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] and [[Kevan Jones]], who alleged that they constituted the illegal use of House of Commons facilities for party fundraising. An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that the meals at the Commons were charged at cost, and that the club's fundraising activities were restricted to events outside Parliament.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmstnprv/431/43104.htm |title= Complaints about alleged misuse of Parliamentary dining facilities |author= Philip Mawer |date= 29 March 2007 |accessdate= 22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's official headquarters are registered by the Electoral Commission at a stables in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]], but in the parliamentary register at a riding school in [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref name="TBIJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2014-07-05/low-profile-united-cecil-club-funnels-cash-to-conservative-must-win-marginals |title= Low profile United &amp; Cecil Club funnels cash to Conservative must-win marginals|publisher=Bureau of Investigative Journalism |author= Tom Warren, Nick Mathiason, Victoria Parsons |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate= 22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations==
An investigation by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]] found that the U&amp;C was the biggest donor to Conservative candidates in the ten most marginal seats in the country.&lt;ref name="TBIJ"/&gt; Between 2010 and 2014, its largest donations were in the marginal seats of [[Weaver Vale (UK Parliament constituency)|Weaver Vale]], [[Bury North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bury North]], [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] and [[Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheadle]], all of which were won or held by the Conservatives at the 2015 election.&lt;ref name="TBIJ"/&gt; The club also raised funds for the [[Scottish Conservative Party]] during campaigning for the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|2014 Scottish independence referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/revealed-tory-hq-to-keep-scotland-1118287|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=23 February 2017|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|author=Keith McLeod|title=Revealed: Tory HQ to keep Scotland in the union is being run from house in Haywards Heath, Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, the club gave £712,230.63 to the Conservatives during the 2010–2015 Parliament,&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/?currentPage=1&amp;rows=10&amp;query=United%20and%20Cecil%20Club%20&amp;sort=AcceptedDate&amp;order=desc&amp;tab=1&amp;open=filter&amp;et=pp&amp;et=ppm&amp;et=tp&amp;et=perpar&amp;et=rd&amp;date=Received&amp;from=2010-05-06&amp;to=2015-05-07&amp;prePoll=false&amp;postPoll=true&amp;optCols=CampaigningName&amp;optCols=AccountingUnitsAsCentralParty&amp;optCols=IsSponsorship&amp;optCols=RegulatedDoneeType&amp;optCols=CompanyRegistrationNumber&amp;optCols=Postcode&amp;optCols=NatureOfDonation&amp;optCols=PurposeOfVisit&amp;optCols=DonationAction&amp;optCols=ReportedDate&amp;optCols=IsReportedPrePoll&amp;optCols=ReportingPeriodName&amp;optCols=IsBequest&amp;optCols=IsAggregation|title=Donations|website=Electoral Commission|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the seventh-largest donor to the party.&lt;ref name="Indie"/&gt;

Under [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] rules, all donations of over £1,500 to a local party need to be publicly declared. However, donations to members' associations – groups like the U&amp;C whose memberships are primarily or exclusively members of a single party – only need to be declared above £7,500, even these donations are subsequently directed to local parties. The [[Alliance for Lobbying Transparency]] criticized this as deliberate exploitation of a loophole allowing donors to make large donations to the Conservatives – and, through the dinners, meet with senior Conservative politicians – while remaining anonymous.&lt;ref name="Indie"/&gt;

The '''Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps''', known as '''XPCC''' or '''Bingtuan''' for short, is a unique economic and [[Paramilitary forces of China|paramilitary]] organization in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]. The XPCC has administrative authority over several medium-sized cities as well as settlements and farms in Xinjiang. It has its own administrative structure, fulfilling governmental functions such as healthcare and education for areas under its jurisdiction. The [[Government of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] directly administers all these cities (as opposed to subordinating them to any prefectures). The Autunomous Region Government in Urumuqi does not usually interfere in the day-to-day administration of these areas {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

The XPCC also participates in economic activities, and is known as the '''China Xinjian Group'''&lt;ref name="ix" /&gt; ({{lang|zh-hans|中国新建集团}}). It has a number of publicly traded subsidiaries.

== History ==
{{main|Migration to Xinjiang}}

The XPCC draws from the traditional Chinese ''[[tuntian]]'' system, a policy of settling military units in frontier areas so that they become self-sufficient in food, and similar policies in the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Rossabi"/&gt; Construction corps were set up for several sparsely populated frontier regions, including [[Heilongjiang]], [[Inner Mongolia]], and [[Xinjiang]].  The newly founded People's Republic of China also had the problem of what to do with many former non-[[Communist]] soldiers who had been removed from economic production for many years.  Ideas about settling such soldiers on the land had been common in China for many years. The Chinese government formed the XPCC from soldiers from the (Communist) First Field Army, former [[Kuomintang]] soldiers&lt;ref name="Rossabi"/&gt; and soldiers from the local [[Ili National Army]].&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt; The XPCC itself was founded in October 1954, comprising 175,000 military personnel based in Xinjiang, led by [[Tao Zhiyue]] as its first commander-in-chief.

The XPCC was initially focused on settling, cultivating, and developing sparsely populated areas, such as the fringes of the [[Taklimakan Desert]] and [[Gurbantunggut Desert]], under the principle of "not competing for benefits with the local people".&lt;ref name="ix"/&gt; It also served as a [[reserve force]] for the military in Xinjiang, although they were not called upon, since relations with the [[Soviet Union]] were good in the early years of the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossabi" /&gt; The ranks of the XPCC were also joined by many youth, both male and female, from other parts of China, to balance out its sex ratio and include members with better education backgrounds. In 1962, after the [[Sino-Soviet split]], rioting occurred in [[Ghulja|Yining]] and 60,000 ethnic minorities living across the border fled to the [[Soviet Union]]. The Chinese government feared that the Soviet Union was trying to destabilize China&lt;ref name="Rossabi"/&gt; and start a war.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt; The XPCC was ordered to cultivate the farms of those who fled.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt; By 1966 the XPCC had a population of 1.48 million.

The XPCC, together with many other governmental and party organizations, was severely damaged by the chaos of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In 1975 it was abolished completely, with all of its powers transferred to the government of [[Xinjiang]] and regional authorities.&lt;ref name="ix"/&gt;

After the [[Soviet Union]] invaded neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, and the [[Islamic mujahid movement]] gained force, fears of Soviet encirclement and Islamic fundamentalism lead to the re-establishment of the XPCC in 1981&lt;ref name="ix"/&gt; as well as the cultivation of frontier lands and economic development.

== Organization ==
The XPCC is administered by both the central government of the [[China]] as well as the government of [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region. It has sub-provincial powers on par with [[sub-provincial city|sub-provincial cities]].&lt;!--, and its economic and social development are administered separately from that of Xinjiang. (unsourced statement removed)--&gt; The Party Secretary of Xinjiang serves as the "executive political commissar" of the XPCC, while the XPCC's own party chief usually concurrently serves as the political commissar of the XPCC and acts as its highest day-to-day authority.  The area and population of the XPCC are generally given as part of Xinjiang's total figures, but the GDP of the XPCC is generally listed separately.

The XPCC is subdivided into [[division (military)|divisions]], then [[regiment]]s. It is headquartered at [[Urumqi]]. Each XPCC division corresponds to a [[prefecture of China|prefecture]]-level administrative division of Xinjiang, and are in themselves sub-prefectural in rank.

The XPCC itself, as well as each individual division, is headed by three leaders: a first [[political commissar]], a political commissar, and a commander. The [[Party Committee Secretary]] of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region is the first political commissar of XPCC ''ex officio'' and the first political commissars of each XPCC division is likewise the committee secretary in each of the corresponding prefecture-level divisions.

In addition to regiments, the XPCC also administers regiment-level farms and ranches.

At the end of the 20th century, the military role of the XPCC has been diluted, being given instead to the [[Xinjiang Military District]], a part of the current [[Western Theater Command]] that includes all of western China. At present, the military personnel of the XPCC are mostly reservists or militia.

== Administrative structure ==
The XPCC consists of 14 divisions which are then subdivided into 185 regiment-level entities (including regiments, farms, and ranches), scattered throughout Xinjiang, mostly in previously unpopulated or sparsely populated areas.

The divisions are:

In May 1953, the PLA's 25th, 26th and 27th Divisions from the [[9th Corps (People's Republic of China)|9th Corps]] were reorganized as 7th, 8th and 9th Agriculture Construction Division of the XPCC, respectively.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Settlements ===
The XPCC has built ten medium-sized cities during its history, and now controls nine of them. The governments of these cities are [[:zh:师市合一|combined entirely]] with the division that controls them. For example, the division headquarters is the same entity as the city government, the division political commissar the same person as the city committee secretary, the division commander the same person as the city's mayor, and so forth. Nine XPCC-administered cities are nominally listed as "[[county-level city|sub-prefectural-level cities]]" of [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Administrative Region, but the government of Xinjiang is usually not involved in the administration of these cities.

== Demographics ==
37 ethnic groups are represented in the XPCC, the largest of which are the [[Han (people)|Han]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Hui people|Hui]], and [[Mongols in China|Mongol]]. Muslims, numbered at 250,000, are the largest religious group represented, while there exist smaller populations of Buddhists, Protestants, and Catholics.&lt;ref name="ix"/&gt; While the Han have been the largest group of XPCC workers, their relative numbers have seen a decline: from 1980 to 1993 the overall membership of the XPCC remained constant, while Han membership declined from 90% to 88%.&lt;ref name="Rossabi"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Governing China's Multiethnic Frontiers|first=Morris|last=Rossabi|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|year=2005|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 13% (2002) of the population of the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region are connected to the XPCC.

== Economy ==

The XPCC is currently focused on economic development as its stated primary goal. With the continued opening up of the [[Economy of China|economy]], the XPCC has created many publicly traded subsidiary companies involved in the production and sale of a variety of products. When involved in such economic activities, the XPCC uses the name "China Xinjian Group".

The primary economic activity of the XPCC remains [[agriculture]], including [[cotton]], [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, food crops, [[vegetable oil]]s, [[sugar beet]]s, and so forth. Important products are [[cotton]], [[tomato]]es, [[ketchup]], [[Korla]] [[pear]]s, [[Turpan]] [[grape]]s, [[wine]], and so forth. The XPCC has a mix of [[factory farming]] and smaller farms.

During its history, XPCC established a large amount of mining and mining-related industries, most of which have subsequently been handed over to the Xinjiang government. Currently the XPCC is primarily engaged in food- and agriculture-related industries.

The XPCC is also involved in a variety of tertiary industries, including trade, distribution, real estate, tourism, construction, even insurance.
