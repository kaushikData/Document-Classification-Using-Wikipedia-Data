'''Adams Filmi Oy''' (previously '''Adamsin Filmitoimisto''') was a Finnish film production company. Founded in 1912 by [[Abel Adams]] (1879–1938), the company was later merged with [[Fenno-Filmi]] which eventually became [[Fennada-Filmi]]. The [[Finnish Broadcasting Company]] bought Fennada-Filmi in 1982. When Adams Filmi Oy, O.Y. Kinosto and Ky Kino Savoy merged in 1986, a new film company Finnkino was born.

After Abel Adams suddenly died in 1938, his wife became the head of the company. Their daughter Felicia Adams took over the charge in 1958. Valuable film material was lost in a fire in 1959, including three early films by [[Teuvo Tulio]].

The '''American Association for Women Radiologists''' (or '''AAWR''') is a [[professional association]] founded in 1981 as a resource for "professional socialization" for women in a male-dominated field of [[radiology]].

AAWR’s role model is [[Marie Curie]], extraordinary scientist, mother and teacher.

The main goals of the association were to provide a forum for issues unique to women in radiology, [[radiation oncology]] and related professions, to sponsor programs that promote opportunities for women, and to facilitate networking among women radiologists.

'''Candy Jones''', originally known as '''Jessica Arline Wilcox''' (December 31, 1925 – January 18, 1990), was an American fashion model, writer and [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] hostess.

Born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], she was raised and educated in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Flint | first = PB | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D61739F93AA25752C0A966958260 | title = Candy Jones Dies; Ex-Model, Teacher, And Writer Was 64 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 19, 1990 | accessdate = April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, she was a leading model and [[pin-up girl]], and afterward, established a modeling school and wrote several books on modeling and fashion. In 1972, Jones married the popular radio show host [[Long John Nebel]] (he was her second husband), and became the co-host of his all-night talk-show on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] in New York City. The show dealt with [[paranormal]], [[UFO]], and [[conspiracy theory]] claims.

Jones controversially claimed to be a victim of [[Project MKULTRA]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] mind-control program, in the 1960s.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Candy Jones was born to a well-off family. Jones reported vivid, conscious memories of [[physical abuse]] by her parents and vague memories of sexual abuse in her youth.&lt;ref name= "Bain"&gt;Bain, Donald. (1976)''The Control of Candy Jones'', Chicago: Playboy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; She was shuttled among relatives, and her mother, Jones insisted, often kept her cloistered or locked in dark rooms. As a child, Jones said she had an imaginary friend named Arlene to help through her lonely episodes.

Jones grew into an attractive, statuesque young woman, about {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forteantimes.com/features/profiles/497/candy_jones.html | title = Candy Jones: How a leading American fashion model came to be experimented upon by the CIA mind control team | last = Bennett | first = C | date = July 1, 2001 | accessdate = October 16, 2008 | work = [[Fortean Times]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006205250/http://forteantimes.com/features/profiles/497/candy_jones.html | archivedate = October 6, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing her name, she pursued a career as a fashion model. She was a quick success, becoming a runner up for [[Miss New Jersey]] in the [[Miss America]] contest. Jones was able to parlay this into a hostess job at the main Miss America contest, and a successful career. She was one of the leading pin-up girls of the [[World War II]] era: In one month in 1943, she appeared on 11 magazine covers.

During a lengthy [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tour in the [[Philippines]], Jones fell ill in 1945, and was treated by a doctor who was still alive when Candy publicised her mind-control claims; [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]] gave this doctor the alias "Gilbert Jensen".&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; According to researcher Martin Cannon,&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/abus/controll.htm | title=The Controllers: A new hypothesis of Alien Abduction | publisher=[[Constitution Society]] | accessdate=December 9, 2016 | author=Cannon, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; who interviewed Jones before she died in 1990, the "Marshall Burger" alias in Bain's book who worked with Jensen on the Jones case was actually Dr. [[William S. Kroger]], a psychologist at one time associated with [[UCLA]].

===First marriage===
In 1946, Jones married fashion czar [[Harry Conover]], one of the first model agents. They had three sons, and Jones says she didn't realize Conover was bisexual until some years into their marriage. She recognized some people might consider this naive, but Jones insisted her abusive childhood had made her wary of intimate relationships, and though she had many suitors, she was sexually inexperienced when she married.&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; She reported that Conover initiated sexual activities with her very few times, and only when he was intoxicated.

Without notice, Conover disappeared in late 1958. Jones notified police, and Conover's absence made the news. When he returned after a long binge, Jones sued for divorce in 1959. After the divorce, she was left with $36, and considerable debts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretdonttell.com/history/candy/ Candy Jones page] at www.secretdonttell.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones opened a modeling school, and she began appearing regularly on NBC's weekend radio news program ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]''.

===Second marriage and radio career===
On December 31, 1972, Jones married radio host [[Long John Nebel]] after a one-month courtship; they briefly met decades earlier when Nebel was a photographer.&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; Jones was soon the regular co-host of Nebel's popular overnight radio talk show, which usually discussed various [[paranormal]] topics.

===Mind-control claims===
Shortly after their marriage, Nebel said, he noted that Jones exhibited violent mood swings, and at times, seemed to display a different personality. Nebel called this "The Voice ... a look, a few moments of bitchiness."&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; 'The Voice' usually vanished rather quickly, but the change was so drastic from Jones's usually pleasant demeanor that Nebel was startled and distressed.

Colin Bennett writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few weeks after their marriage, [Jones] did tell Nebel that she had worked for the [[FBI]] for some time, adding mysteriously that she might have to go out of town on occasion without giving a reason. This left Nebel wondering whether there was a connection between the 'other' personality within Candy and the strange trips she said she made for the FBI.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nebel began [[hypnosis|hypnotising]] Jones, and uncovered an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]] named "Arlene". Under hypnosis, Jones related a lengthy, elaborate account of her being trained in a [[CIA]] [[mind-control]] program, often at west coast colleges and universities. Jones and Nebel eventually recorded hundreds of hours of these hypnotic sessions.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Jones said she had some conscious memories of her involvement in the mind-control program: it began in 1960, she said, when an old USO acquaintance (an unnamed retired army general) asked to use Jones' modeling school as a mailing address to receive some letters and packages. Jones agreed, she said, out of a sense of patriotism.

Eventually, said Jones, she was asked to deliver a letter to Oakland, California on a business trip she had scheduled. Again, Jones reported she agreed, and was surprised to discover the letter was delivered to the same Dr. Jensen who had treated her in the Philippines nearly two decades earlier. Jones said that Jensen and his associate, Dr. "Marshall Burger" (another alias) offered hefty amounts of cash if she was willing to engage in further plans; in their earlier meetings, Jensen had noted that Jones was an ideal subject for hypnosis. Jones agreed, she said, because her modeling school was faltering, and she wanted to keep her sons in their costly private schools.

During hypnosis sessions, an alternate personality called "Arlene" was reportedly groomed by Jensen, so that Jones would have no memory of Arlene's activities. Jones allegedly made trips to locations as far away as Taiwan. While hypnotized, Jones claimed that she was subjected to painful torture in order to test the effectiveness of the alternate personality. Donald Bain writes, "[Jones] would be a messenger for the agency in conjunction with her normal business trips."

Again with the USO, Jones visited South Vietnam in 1970; she later suspected her visit had some connection to a disastrous attempt to free American [[prisoners of war]] from North Vietnam.

Jones's and Nebel's claims were first made public in 1976 (in [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]]'s ''The Control of Candy Jones'', published by [[Playboy|Playboy Press]]). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a hoaxer of long standing and as he was not above hoaxing his radio audience,&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's past were genuine.&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; Later skeptics{{Who|date=October 2009}} would argue that an alleged [[false memory syndrome]] was a more plausible explanation.

Several years later, Jones' story gained more notice after the public disclosure of [[MK-ULTRA]] in 1977.

Bain&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; reported that associates in Jones' modeling schools asserted that Jones indeed had some puzzling absences – supposed business trips where little or no business seemed to be conducted. Bain&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; also writes that another piece of evidence came forth when "Candy inadvertently held onto a passport of 'Arlene Grant': Candy in a dark wig and dark makeup". Jones says she had no memory of dressing in such an outfit or of posing for a passport in a different name.

Bain&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; also claimed that a tape-recorded message on an answering machine was left on Jones and Nebel's home telephone number on July 3, 1973:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is [[Japan Airlines]] calling on oh-three July at 4.10 p.m. ... Please have Miss Grant call 759-9100 ... she is holding a reservation on Japan Airlines Flight 5 for the sixth of July, [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy]] to Tokyo, with an option on to Taipei. This is per Cynthia that we are calling.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When Jones telephoned the number and asked for Cynthia, she was told that no one of that name worked at the reservations desk.

Additionally, Brian Haughton notes that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was also a letter [Jones] wrote to her attorney, William Williams, to cover herself in case she died or disappeared suddenly or under unusual circumstances; she told him she was not at liberty to reveal exactly what she was involved in. Bain wrote to Williams who corroborated this fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysteriouspeople.com/Candy_Jones.htm A brief history of Candy Jones as spy "Arlene Grant"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bain&lt;ref name= "Bain"/&gt; also notes that in 1971, an article by hypnosis expert [[George Estabrooks]] was published in ''[[Science Digest]]'', wherein Estabrooks openly discussed the successful creation of amnesiac couriers of the type Jones claimed to have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindspring.com/~txporter/scidig.htm Hypnosis Comes of Age], [[George Estabrooks]], ''[[Science Digest]]'', April 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Herbert Spiegel]], a nationally recognized hypnosis expert, wrote the foreword to ''The Control of Candy Jones''.

Candy Jones is the subject of the [[Exit Clov]] song "MK ULTRA."

The story of her mind-control claims was featured in an episode of ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]'' in a segment entitled "Sexy Secret Agent".

==Death==
Jones died of cancer on January 18, 1990 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and had been living in Manhattan.

==History==

The company was founded in 1991 and operated first in [[Africa]] later expanding into the [[Middle East]].

==Operations==
Challenger Limited is a provider of contract oil and gas land [[well drilling]] and work over services. The company owns and operates 25 [[drilling rigs]] in [[Libya]] providing drilling and work-over services for oil, gas, and [[water wells]], with offices in Egypt, [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Workover refers to any kind of oil [[well intervention]] involving invasive techniques, such as [[Slickline|wireline]], [[coiled tubing]] or [[snubbing]]. More specifically though, it will refer to the expensive process of pulling and replacing a [[Completion (oil well)]].

It has an extensive client base, including several [[national oil company|national oil companies]] as well as international corporations such as [[Agip]]/[[Eni]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[Marathon Oil]], [[Veba]] and Verenex Energy. Challenger works as a regular subcontractor to the state-owned [[National Oil Corporation]] of Libya. Challenger is one of the oldest drilling companies in Africa, and particularly in Libya. Since inception, the company has grown every year producing impressive financial results. Challenger is a private company limited by shares registered in the General Registry of the [[Isle of Man]], G.B. It operates as a commercial entity through a network of branches in [[Liechtenstein]], the Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Silicon Valley-San Jose Business Journal: Challenger profile&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Consultants and [[audit]] firms include [[KPMG]] and [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]].

==VC Bank Acquisition==
In 2006, [[Venture Capital Bank]] (VC Bank), a [[Bahrain]]-based [[investment bank]], along with its partner, the U.S. private equity firm [[Global Emerging Markets]] (GEM), acquired a significant stake in Challenger. The acquisition cost roughly $50 million and was co-financed by VC Bank and GEM. This transaction demonstrated that the MENA region contains several attractive, yet obscured, investment opportunities represented in [[privately held companies]] such as Challenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=38374 ''VC Bank Acquires Stake in Challenger''], VC Bank, Nov. 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The investment is beneficial to both parties, allowing Challenger to achieve its growth plan and helping VC Bank to achieve its objectives of supporting companies in the MENA region. Challenger Chairman Hassan Tatanaki said that "amongst alternative financing routes available, Challenger's management decided to partner with VC Bank and GEM to fuel and expedite its capacity expansion plans and its geographical coverage." Tatanaki added that "in the oil sector, with Libya in particular, oil production in the 1970s was more than 3 million bpd compared to today's levels of 1.6 million bpd. With proven [[oil reserves]] of {{convert|41.5|Goilbbl|m3|abbr=on}} of mainly sweet [[light crude oil]] in January 2007, an aggressive plan has been introduced by the Libyan government to enhance production capabilities to 3 million bpd by 2010. Since the lifting of [[International sanctions|sanctions]], exploration concessions have been granted to international exploration companies, which hope to drill 50 exploration wells per year."

VC Bank [[CEO]] Abdullatif Mohammed Janahi added, “our investment in Challenger will help the company snatch the exceptional growth potential in Libya and enter international markets. Soaring oil prices have brought about a supply/demand imbalance of oil rigs worldwide, leading oil and gas companies to spend more on exploration and production. This has, in turn, increased demand for oil drilling contractors such as Challenger.”

'''Cher Wang''' ({{zh|t=王雪紅|p=Wáng Xuěhóng}}; born 15 September 1958) is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]] born in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].

==Education==
Wang studied abroad at [[The College Preparatory School]] in [[Oakland, California]], and went on to receive her bachelor's degree in economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Strain on HTC From Apple Suit Is Likely to Be Long-Term |first=Jonathan |last=Adams |newspaper=New York Times |date= 2010-03-03 |accessdate=2010-03-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/technology/04htc.html?hpw}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1981.

==Career==
She joined [[First International Computer]] (FIC) in 1982.&lt;ref name="Holson"/&gt; Wang and others founded VIA in 1987 and HTC in 1997. In May 2011, [[Forbes]] ranked her with husband Wen Chi Chen as the wealthiest person in Taiwan, with a net worth of US$8.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://blogs.forbes.com/russellflannery/2011/05/25/taiwans-40-richest |title=Taiwan’s 40 Richest |accessdate=2011-05-25 |work= |publisher=Forbes |date= 2011-05-25 |first=Russell |last=Flannery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Wang was named #56 on Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/| title= The World's 100 Most Powerful Women | date=2012-08-22 | accessdate=2013-01-15| work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, she is listed as the 54th most powerful woman in the world by ''Forbes''.&lt;ref name=Forbes14/&gt;

In Oct. 2014, Cher Wang refused to accept the Final Award of the "HKIAC / A11022 arbitration" and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court (Case No.:HCCT40 / 2014) before Judge Mimmie Chan. Wang asserted that the Award was contrary to public policy. VIA product VT3421, an anti-hack chip (also named asTF376) was suspected in assisting the Chinese government of surveilling mobile devices of anti-communist and human rights activists. VIA executive Li Shaolun (Steven S. Lee) admitted in the proceedings that VIA chips did have "back door". The Hong Kong HKIAC sentenced VIA with compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20141210/521320/|title=VIA and Falungon |work=One Magazine (Chinese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2017}} In a hearing before the Justice Mimmie Chan, in the High Court of Hong Kong, she{{who|date=May 2017}} said she believed the Award was in violation of Hong Kong's public order and morals. In June 2015 in she remised the case back to Arbitrator Anthony Neoh. The tribunal upheld the conviction in October 2015, and VIA lost the case for millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/via-corporate/via-financials/taiwan/annual/VIA+annual+report+2015.pdf|title= VIA Annual Report |work=VIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The backdoor of hacking prevention chip VT3421/TF376 cause big issues in Taiwan. 11 Legislative Senators made suggestion to suspend the government procurement of hTC related communication products until the VIA Electronics' VT3421/TF376 hacking control chip backdoor issue should be thoroughly investigated by National Security Bureau and National Communication Committee.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2015, Cher Wang took over the CEO role from Peter Chou and returned to the day-to-day operations of HTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/htc-chairwoman-cher-wang-takes-over-ceo-role-from-peter-chou-i7h8lj38|title=HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang Takes Over CEO Role From Peter Chou|date=2015-03-20|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, HTC and Google announced a US$1.1 billion cooperation agreement, which involved certain HTC employees would join Google, and Google would receive HTC IP through a non-exclusive licensing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.htc.com/us/about/newsroom/2017/2017-09-21-htc-google/|title=Google and HTC Announce US$1.1 Billion Cooperation Agreement|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2017|website=www.htc.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang’s Charity Foundations are holding eight investment companies’ stocks with market value of over US$200 millions. However, only US$ twenty-seven thousand has been donated to charity(0.000135%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.new7.com.tw/NewsView.aspx?i=TXT20160406164208CLP|title= False Charity|work=New7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang suited the reporter with anger and failed the case on Feb. 2018.

==Philanthropy==
In 2011 Wang donated US$28.1 million to help found [[Guizhou]] Forerunner College, a charitable college in southwest China set up by VIA Technologies' non-profit Faith-Hope-Love Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| last=Cheng-yen| first=Han| url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20110924000084&amp;cid=1104| title=HTC's Cher Wang opens vocational school in Guizhou| publisher=Want China Times| date=2011-09-24| accessdate=2013-01-15| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217002905/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20110924000084&amp;cid=1104| archivedate=17 February 2013| df=dmy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The not-for-profit college aims to provide three years of free or low-cost education to students from low-income families. Wang has stated that if the college proves successful she may well set up additional similar institutions in other parts of the country.

Wang has also made significant donations to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], including funding to support and enhance the prestigious American Physical Society's Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize, given to researchers who make considerable contributions to the field of [[condensed-matter physics]].&lt;ref&gt;

Wang and Chen also provide funding to support a collaborative program between the psychology departments at UC Berkeley and [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| last=Anwar| first=Yasmin| url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/07/15/happiness/| title=UC Berkeley psychologists bring science of happiness to China | publisher=US Berkeley News Center | date=2010-07-15 | accessdate=2013-01-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Berkeley-Tsinghua Program for the Advanced Study in Psychology aims to create and support collaborative, psychological research between faculty and students from both universities.

In August 2012 Wang donated 6,000 HTC Flyer tablet PCs to 60 [[Education in Taiwan|high school]]s in Taipei.&lt;ref name="Watch China Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120824000077&amp;cid=1103 | title=HTC's Cher Wang ranked 56th on Forbes' list of powerful women | publisher=Want China Times | date=2012-08-24 | accessdate=2013-01-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704003636/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120824000077&amp;cid=1103 | archivedate=4 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wang is an avid philanthropist who says she prefers to stay out of the limelight despite her many accomplishments.&lt;ref name="Holson"/&gt; She has begun to insert herself in Taiwan politics, however, by supporting Taiwan President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in his bid for re-election&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7e4b45bc-3eb3-11e1-9139-00144feab49a.html#axzz2srsRHX51 "Ma Ying-jeou wins Taiwan election,"] Financial Times, January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and by voicing her support for the [[1992 Consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120114000041&amp;cid=1601 "I back 1992 Consensus as a true Taiwanese, says HTC's Cher Wang,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223929/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120114000041&amp;cid=1601 |date=21 February 2014 }} Want China Times, January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband is [[Wen Chi Chen]], the [[CEO]] of [[VIA Technologies]].

'''''Conquest of the Air''''' is a 1936 [[documentary film]] or [[docudrama]] on the [[history of aviation]], until the early stages of [[World War II]]. The film features historical footage, and dramatic re-creations, of the developments of [[commercial aviation|commercial]] and [[military aviation]]; including the early stages of technology developments in design, propulsion, and air navigation aids. The film was a [[London Films]] production, commissioned by the [[Air Ministry]] of the [[British Government]].

==Production background==
The film was initially commissioned by [[Alexander Korda]] prior to the advent of World War II, and the Air Ministry saw the value in promoting Britain's contribution and leadership in aviation during this period. Some notable footage is featured of the early phases of automated flight, [[Air navigation|navigational equipment]], and the transitions between civil and military developments, including [[heavy bomber]]s; fast [[fighter aircraft]]; and the advent of [[naval aviation]] ([[aircraft carrier]]), plus the initial experiments with vertical rotary flight ([[helicopter]]s).

An updated version was released in 1940 and released in the United States on 20 May 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032354/releaseinfo|title=Conquest of the Air (1936) - Release dates|accessdate=30 June 2010|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cwm Silicon''' (literally ''[[Silicon Valley]]'') is an epithet applied to a region of [[South Wales]] in the far west of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] that attracted much interest and [[inward investment]] from the technology sector in the early 2000s.{{fact|date=October 2010}}

The future of the area as an important technological centre is now uncertain following the closure of its key [[LG (Korea)|LG]] factory in August 2003.{{fact|date=October 2010}} The area is next to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and is a centre for high-technology companies, like much of the [[M4 corridor]].

{{nihongo|'''Cybozu, Inc.'''|サイボウズ株式会社|Saibōzu Kabushikigaisha}} is a [[Tokyo]]-based software company that provides web-based [[groupware]] services including '''Cybozu''' Office and kintone. In addition to the main office in Tokyo, Cybozu also has offices in Matsuyama and [[Osaka]], as well as several overseas subsidiaries in countries including [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref&gt;https://cybozu.vn&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cybozu.cn&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kintone.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kintone.com/build-applications-platform/&lt;/ref&gt; 
The U.S.-based subsidiary, '''kintone Corporation''', is located in [[San Francisco, California]].

== Background ==
In 1997, [[Toru Takasuka]] resigned as the Vice President/Director of [[Matsushita Electric Works]] V-Internet Operations, an in-house venture company he helped to create. Along with partners Yoshihisa Aono and Shinya Hata, he started the software company in [[Matsuyama, Ehime]] with a $200,000 loan from family and friends. The company aimed to produce Japan’s first web-based [[groupware]] products. Cybozu, Japanese for “cyber-kid”, rapidly gained market share in the Japanese market. Within three years the company went public – at that time the fastest company rise to [[IPO]] in the history of Japan’s 2nd section of the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thebridge.jp/en/2013/07/cybozu-to-enter-us-market&lt;/ref&gt; Today Cybozu is the number one groupware producer in Japan. They are currently listed on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Cybozu prides itself on having a corporate culture that enables its employees to have a healthy [[work-life balance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/24/national/social-issues/workforce-shrinks-career-walls-japans-women-crumbling/#.WRkNKVI9y9Y&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Cybozu was listed by Great Place to Work as the number one mid-sized Japanese company for women.&lt;ref&gt;http://hatarakigai.info/ranking/woman/#ranking_02&lt;/ref&gt;

[[multitrack recording]] device introduced by the [[TASCAM]] division of the [[TEAC Corporation]] in 1993. This modular, digital multitrack device uses tape as the recording medium and could record up to eight tracks simultaneously. It also allowed multiple DA-88 devices to be combined to record 16 or more tracks.&lt;ref name=perry2004/&gt; The first models in the series (the TASCAM DA-88, DA-38, DA-98 and Sony PCM-800) recorded at 16-bit resolution. TASCAM later introduced the DA-98HR and DA-78HR, which recorded at 24-bit resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentway.com/definitive-dtrs-guide-chapter-1-equipment-overview] The Definitive Guide to The Tascam DA-88 and DTRS-Format Recorders, Chapter 1: Equipment Overview. Retrieved on 2012-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Audio data was stored in the DTRS (Digital Tape Recording System) format on Hi-8mm video compact cassettes, allowing up to 108 minutes of continuous recording on a single tape.&lt;ref name=summers2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentway.com/definitive-guide-tascam-da-88-dtrs-format-recorders] The Definitive Guide to The Tascam DA-88 and DTRS-Format Recorders. Retrieved on 2012-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the TASCAM DA-88 won the [[Emmy award]] for technical excellence.&lt;ref name=alberts2003/&gt; The affordability and digital format of the DA-88 led to sales of more than 60,000 units by 1999. At that time, it was the biggest product in the history of TASCAM.&lt;ref name=verna1999/&gt;Because of its reliability and durability, the DA-88 and its subsequent fellow units continue to be used by aficionados.

==History==

Docebo was founded in 2005 by Claudio Erba, who continues to lead the company as CEO.&lt;ref name="Silicon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repubblica"/&gt; Erba had previously been working at the [[University of Florence]] as a [[information technology consulting|computer consultant]] when a customer asked for a storage solution for teaching material.&lt;ref name="Lastampa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2013/09/23/tecnologia/docebo-con-il-cloud-elearning-rivoluziona-il-mercato-della-formazione-aziendale-online-I7ZcrY72RtmCgNiNOITtgN/pagina.html|title=Docebo con il "Cloud E-Learning" rivoluziona il mercato della formazione aziendale online|publisher=La Stampa|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage solution evolved into what is now Docebo.&lt;ref name="Lastampa"/&gt;

In 2012, Docebo received its first round of funding from Italian venture capital firm Principia SGR.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repubblica"/&gt; Later that same year, Docebo opened an office in Athens, Georgia.&lt;ref name="Repubblica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lastampa"/&gt;

Docebo's second venture-backed financing round came from Canadian firm Klass Capital in 2016, funding its continued North American expansion with the opening of an office in Toronto, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techvibes.com/2015/02/12/klass-capital-docebo-2015-02-12|title=E-Learning Platform Raises $3 Million from Toronto VC Firm to Enter Canadian Market|website=Techvibes|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Germain Service''' is an 18th-century [[tableware]] set comprising more than a thousand pieces in cast, raised, and chiselled silver, made in the workshop of French silversmith [[François-Thomas Germain]] for the Portuguese royal family. This service is now on permanent exhibition as part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

The service was commissioned by [[Joseph I of Portugal]] in 1756, just after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], in an attempt to renew the splendor of the royal court (as the earthquake had, in the words of Royal Jewel Keeper António Pinto da Silva, "[reduced] ''to ashes all treasure and tapestries of the Royal Household, sparing nothing''"); there were, however, troubles in the consignment of the service: in 1765, Germain declared bankruptcy and the order was left unfinished (which precipitated the Portuguese Crown to start a legal dispute to reclaim the loss of the goods, to no avail).&lt;ref name="Jardim"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jardim |first=Maria do Rosário |date=2012 |title=A Baixela Germain ao serviço da Corte no Reinado de D.

Still, the Germain Service was considered the ''First Service'' of the Crown, to which was added the service confiscated from the [[Duke of Aveiro]] in 1759 (the ''Second Service'') — they both made up "all necessary tableware" for court feasts.&lt;ref name="Jardim"/&gt;

The Germain Service was used publicly for the first time during the ceremonies of the [[Coronations in Europe#Portugal|Acclamation]] of [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]], the daughter of Joseph I, on 13 May 1777.&lt;ref name="Virgolino1777"&gt;{{cite book |last=Virgolino |first=António Pedro |date=1777 |title=Auto do Levantamento e Juramento que os Grandes, Títulos Seculares, Ecclesiasticos, e mais Pessoas que se acharão prezentes fizerão à Muito Alta e Muito Poderoza Rainha Fidelíssima, A Senhora Dona Maria Primeira, Nossa Senhora na Coroa destes Reinos e Senhorios de Portugal; sendo exaltada e coroada sobre o Regio Throno juntamente com o Senhor Rey Dom Pedro Terceiro na tarde do dia treze de Mayo, Anno de 1777 |trans-title=Act of the Accession and Oath that the Grandees, Secular Titled Nobility, Ecclesiastics, and more People in attendance sweared to the Most High and Most Powerful, Most Faithful Queen Maria the First, Our Lady in the Crown of these Kingdoms and Dominions of Portugal; as she was exalted and crowned under the Royal Throne together with King Peter the Third, in the afternoon of the thirteenth of May, in the Year 1777 |url=http://digitarq.arquivos.pt/details?id=4617845 |language=Portuguese |location=Lisbon |publisher=[[Torre do Tombo National Archive|Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo]] - Códices e documentos de proveniência desconhecida, n.º 180 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Germain Service was made part of the [[Ministry of Culture (Portugal)|Ministry of Culture]]'s list of Portuguese National Treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Decreto n.º 19/2006 de 18 de Julho |trans-title= |type=Decree |number=19/2006 |language=Portuguese |date=18 July 2006 |article= |article-type= |page= |url=https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/537265/details/maximized}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Continental Deep Drilling Program''' (in German: '''{{lang|de|Kontinentales Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}'''&lt;ref&gt;literally: "Continental deep-drilling program of the Federal Republic of Germany"&lt;/ref&gt;), abbreviated as the '''KTB''' borehole, was a [[scientific drilling]] project carried out from 1987 to 1995 near [[Windischeschenbach]], Bavaria. The main super-deep borehole reached a depth of 9,101 meters in the [[Continental crust|Earth's continental crust]].

The [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Research]] funded the project with 528 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]  (270 million Euros). The Lower Saxony LBEG mining office (State Office for Mining, Energy and Geology) took the project lead. After the drilling project ended, the German Research Centre for Geosciences used the borehole to install a seismic deep observatory ({{lang|de|Tiefenobservatorium}}) which was active from 1996 to 2001. The [[derrick]] used at the site, one of the largest in the world, remains in place and has become a tourist attraction. The two boreholes were kept open for further scientific research.

== History ==
In October 1986 the German Minister for Research and Technology (Bundesminister für Forschung und Technologie), Dr. H. Riesenhuber, officially announced that the super-deep borehole of the Continental Deep Drilling Program of the Federal Republic of Germany (KTB) would be drilled in the Upper Palatinate area of Northern Bavaria. This site was selected against an alternative proposed site in the Black Forest area based on recommendations made by the [http://www.dfg.de/en/ Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)]. These were based on evaluations of the technical and financial risks by the project management team.  The site recommendation and selection was preceded by a conference held from September{{nbs}}19 to 21, 1986 in Seeheim/Odenwald. Results of the site studies in the Upper Palatinate and the Black Forest were presented and discussed there. Immediately following the conference and evaluation of scientific and technical models and targets, members of the DFG Senate Commission for Geoscientific Interdisciplinary Research voted almost unanimously for the Oberpfalz site. In presenting their decision, the DFG Senate Commission emphasized that while the Upper Palatinate site was favoured in the vote, both locations offered a number of positive research objectives and that both locations were potentially suitable sites for research drilling.

== Results ==
The KTB project utilized several innovations to drill design.  The [[Kola Superdeep Borehole|Kola drilling experiment]] had had problems with high friction that was increased by the vertical instability when drilling to such depths. German scientists designed a new drill head which would maintain direction with a minimal lateral difference. The drill head was also designed to withstand temperatures between {{convert|250|and| 300|°C|°F}}. The original expectations had been that this temperature would be reached at a depth of about 10 to 14&amp;nbsp;kilometers. This is also the reason why the Upper Palatinate site was chosen. The Black Forest site had been considered suitable from a scientific view, but it was expected to have a higher temperature gradient. At the Upper Palatinate location, however, it was hoped to reach the {{lang|de|Erbendorfkörper}} – a deep-lying mass that is believed to be on the boundary of a former continental plate and is identified by its characteristic reflection of seismic waves.

Even though the {{lang|de|Erbendorfkörper}} was not reached, the KTB drilling was widely considered a success. For one thing, the temperature rose much more quickly than expected. This caused discussion and a reformulation of theories about the [[geothermal gradient|temperature gradient]] of very deep drill holes. Other theory changes were also required – it had been expected that the large tectonic pressures and high temperatures would create [[metamorphic rock]]. Unexpectedly the rock layers were not solid at the depths reached. Instead large amounts of fluid and gas poured into the drill hole. Due to the heat and fluids, the rock was of a dynamic nature which changed how the next super-deep drilling needed to be planned.

The experiments at the KTB produced interesting results. The initial seismic tests showed very different recordings compared to those near the surface so that the theories on the source of seismic reflections needed to change. Using the data, the reflections from depth could be interpreted better even when initiated from the surface.

The first experiment, the {{lang|de|"Dipole-Dipole Experiment"}} measured the electric conductibility around the drill hole. This showed lines of graphite spanning through the rocks that allowed the rocks to slide when under sufficient pressure. The second experiment was to exert high pressure in the drill hole such that the rock would start cracking, the {{lang|de|"Integriertes Hydrafrac/Seismik Experiment"}}. The resulting seismic activity was measured at multiple stations in the area. The conclusion was that the overall pressure came from the south, the African tectonic plate at work. The third experiment, the {{lang|de|"Fluid/Hydraulik-Test}}," pumped large amounts of fluid into the rock which proved it to be generally porous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scinexx.de/dossier-detail-56-11.html |title=Was die Wissenschaftler fanden: Ergebnisse der KTB |first=Marcus |last=Anhäuser |work=Scinexx |date=21 December 2001 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These experiences were the foundation of the follow-up project, the [[International Continental Scientific Drilling Program]] (ICDP) founded in 1996. The German scientists of the KTB were also called to help with the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth]] drill hole.

The glass gains its surface strength, ability to contain flaws, and crack-resistance by being immersed in a proprietary, hot potassium salt ion-exchange bath.

Corning experimented with chemically strengthened glass in 1960, as part of a "Project Muscle" initiative. Within a few years they had developed a "muscled glass"&lt;ref name="muscled"&gt;{{cite web | title = Gorilla Glass, the Smartphone's Unsung Hero | work = The New York Times | first = David | last = Pogue | date = December 9, 2010 | url = http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/gorilla-glass-the-smartphones-unsung-hero/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115030748/http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/gorilla-glass-the-smartphones-unsung-hero/ | archivedate = January 15, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed  as ''Chemcor''.

== Manufacture ==
During its manufacture, the glass is [[Toughened glass#Manufacturing|toughened by ion exchange]]. The material is immersed in a [[melting|molten]] [[alkaline]] [[Salt (chemistry)|potassium salt]] at a temperature of approximately {{convert |400|°C|-1}},&lt;ref name=howmade/&gt; wherein smaller [[sodium]] ions in the glass [[ion exchange|are replaced]] by larger [[potassium]] ions from the salt bath. The larger ions occupy more volume and thereby create a surface layer of high [[residual stress|residual compressive stress]], giving the glass surface increased strength, ability to contain flaws,&lt;ref name="untouched"&gt;{{cite web

'''Heli-Logging''', or Helicopter Logging, is a method of logging that uses [[helicopter]]s to remove cut [[tree]]s from [[forest]]s by lifting them on cables attached to a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestry.com/blog/helicopter-logging-heli-Logging/ Heli-Logging] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604093745/http://forestry.com/blog/helicopter-logging-heli-logging/ |date=2009-06-04 }} at Forestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Helicopter [[logging]] is often used in inaccessible areas of forests. Because the use of helicopters reduces the level of infrastructure required to log in a specific location, the method also helps to reduce the environmental impact of logging. It also can increase the productivity in these remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scialert.net/pdfs/jas/2008/3910-3916.pdf An Analysis of Utilizing Helicopter Logging in Turkish Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
Standing Stem Harvesting, a selective harvesting method within Heli-Logging, was invented by Philip Jarman of [[Port Alberni]], British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. 
In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple which was to be operated by a [[Kaman K-MAX|K-Max]] Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted,  jettisonable sled carrying a hydraulic power pack, to operate the grapple.
Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]] designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.

In general, Heli-logging operations rarely use the light-weight, single-engine Kaman, and most operators will select one of three tested heavier twin-engine helicopter types: the 9000hp [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]], the 3900hp MIL 8, and the 4400hp KAMOV Ka-32.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These three types are most suited to Heli-logging because of structural and systems designs, for example, their twin-engine layout, and dual hydraulic systems. Although the S-64 is an excellent and powerful machine, relatively few have been made, certainly less than 50 total.  On the other hand, hundreds of [[Kamov Ka-27|Ka-32]]s have been built, and the [[Mil Mi-8|MIL-8]]s number in the thousands. The Kamov Ka-32A11BC is used for Heli-logging in mountainous areas of western Canada because of its availability and the fact that it is certified in Canada and Europe for commercial operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vih.com/Services/vihhelicopters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Heli-Logging is also known as standing stem harvesting which is based on individual tree selection (ITS).&lt;ref name="Cleaver"&gt;Cleaver, D. 2001. [http://depts.washington.edu/sky2001/proceedings/papers/Cleaver.pdf Standing Stem Harvesting]. The International Mountain Logging and 11th Pacific Northwest Skyline Symposium 2001, 280-284.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection process is done by [[engineers]] and [[Surveying|surveyors]]. The trees are selected based on demand for specific types and grades. Before the selection process is complete the selected trees are bored to check their reliability. The selected trees are then marked and their [[diameters]] are recorded. The diameter of the tree is measured at 1.3 meters above the ground. The sizes of the trees that are selected are controlled by two things. The minimum size is controlled by the economy while the maximum size is controlled by the capacity of the helicopter. Once the trees are selected they are climbed, the limbs are removed and the trees are [[tree topping|topped]]. The length of the tree and the diameter at its top are then recorded. All the recorded data is then entered into a [[database]] which calculates [[volumes]], weights, etc. The selected trees are then partially cut at the stem and supported by wooden wedges. The stem is then grappled by the helicopter and pulled until the wood breaks at the partial cut. The logged trees are then brought by helicopter to a predetermined roadside location or dropped into open water where they are collected.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
Heli-logging is efficient: a single S-64 Skycrane can extract 20 000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (about 15,000 tonnes) of clean, undamaged timber per month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional logging allows the stems to fall. On rocky terrains this often results in damage to the stems that makes them unusable. On steep terrains falling trees can slide downhill and become irretrievable. Heli-logging allows logging to take place in more remote places. It also allows certain trees to be logged that previously could not be due to their proximity to a structure or pipeline.  Logging using helicopters is safer than conventional logging. Falling trees are dangerous for the [[loggers]] as well as for surrounding structures or [[utilities]]. Heli-logging also extends the logging season. This is due to the lack of snow load on a standing stem.

Helicopter logging ground crews will cut, clean, and mark the trees before the helicopter starts to work. Ground crews may be able to prepare fewer than 6 trees per day, and the helicopter will only be needed every few days. Since fewer roads need to be built to the site where the logging is taking place, and trees are extracted vertically, there is reduced damage to the surrounding trees and ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Roberts, Ward and Rollerson done in 2004 shows that post-logging [[landslides]] are more common after conventional cable-based logging than heli-logging. Landslide rates following conventional logging are one and a half times more common than landslide rates following heli-logging.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B., Ward, B., &amp; Rollerson, T. 2004. A comparison of landslide rates following helicopter and conventional cable-based clear-cut logging operations in the Southwest Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Geomorphology, 61, 337-346. Retrieved from Science Direct.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Although there is no direct cost from road construction or expansion, heli-logging incurs high costs. Operation of a helicopter as well as the selection processes and methods increase the cost. The use of a helicopter to transport the stems limits the size and weight of the selected trees more than equipment would using conventional logging.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

The '''Iconoscope''' (from the [[Greek Language|Greek]]: ''εἰκών'' "image" and ''σκοπεῖν'' "to look, to see") was the first practical [[video camera tube]] to be used in early [[television camera]]s. The iconoscope produced a much stronger signal than earlier [[Mechanical television|mechanical designs]], and could be used under any well-lit conditions. This was the first fully electronic system to replace earlier cameras, which used special [[Followspot|spotlights]] or spinning disks to capture light from a single very brightly lit spot.

Some of the principles of this apparatus were described when [[Vladimir Zworykin]] filed two patents for a ''Television system'' in 1923 and 1925.&lt;ref name="US2022450"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparatus is similar to the iconoscope. The image entered through the series of lenses at upper right, and hit the photoelectric cells on the image plate at left. The cathode ray at the right swept the image plate, charging it, and the photoelectric cells emitted an electric charge in variance with the amount of light hitting them. The resulting image signal was carried out the left side of the tube and amplified.]]

==Operation==
[[Image:Iconoscope diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram of iconoscope]]
The main image forming element in the iconoscope was a [[mica]] plate with a pattern of photosensitive granules deposited on the front using an electrically insulating glue. The granules were typically made of silver grains covered with caesium or caesium oxide. The back of the mica plate, opposite the granules, was covered with a thin film of [[silver]]. The separation between the silver on the back of the plate and the silver in the granules caused them to form individual [[capacitor]]s, able to store electrical charge. These were typically deposited as small spots, creating [[pixel]]s. The system as a whole was referred to as a "mosaic".

The system is first charged up by scanning the plate with an [[electron gun]] similar to one in a conventional television display tube. This process deposits charges into the granules, which in a dark room would slowly decay away at a known rate. When exposed to light, the photosensitive coating releases electrons which are supplied by the charge stored in the silver. The emission rate increases in proportion to the intensity of the light. Through this process, the plate forms an electrical analog of the visual image, with the stored charge representing the inverse of the average brightness of the image at that location.

When the [[electron beam]] scans the plate again, any residual charge in the granules resists refilling by the beam. The beam energy is set so that any charge resisted by the granules is reflected back into the tube, where it is collected by the collector ring, a ring of metal placed around the screen. The charge collected by the collector ring varies in relation to the charge stored in that location. This signal is then amplified and inverted, and then represents a positive video signal.

The collector ring is also used to collect electrons being released from the granules in the photoemission process. If the gun is scanning a dark area few electrons would be released directly from the scanned granules, but the rest of the mosaic will also be releasing electrons that will be collected during that time. As a result, the black level of the image will float depending on the average brightness of the image, which caused the iconoscope to have a distinctive patchy visual style. This was normally combatted by keeping the image continually and very brightly lit. This also led to clear visually differences between scenes shot indoors and those shot outdoors in good lighting conditions.

As the electron gun and the image itself both have to be focused on the same side of the tube, some attention has to be paid to the mechanical arrangement of the components. Iconocopes were typically built with the mosaic inside a cylindrical tube with flat ends, with the plate positioned in front of one of the ends. A conventional movie camera lens was placed in front of the other end, focussed on the plate. The electron gun was then placed below the lens, tilted so that it was also aimed at the plate, although at an angle. This arrangement has the advantage that both the lens and electron gun lie in front of the imaging plate, which allows the system to be compartmentalized in a box-shaped enclosure with the lens completely within the case.&lt;ref name="US1691324"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US2021907"/&gt;

As the electron gun is tilted compared to the screen, its image of the screen is not as a rectangular plate, but a [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] shape. Additionally, the time needed for the electrons to reach the upper portions of the screen was longer than the lower areas, which were closer to the gun. Electronics in the camera adjusted for this effect by slightly changing the scanning rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/RCA_CRV-59AAE.htm "1945 RCA CRV-59AAE Iconoscope Camera"], LabGuy's World&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation and storage of photoelectric charges during each scanning cycle greatly increased the electrical output of the iconoscope relative to non-storage type image scanning devices.{{Citation needed|reason=may be obvious but still should have a ref|date=November 2009}} In the 1931 version, the electron beam scanned the granules;&lt;ref name="US2021907"/&gt; while in the 1925 version, the electron beam scanned the back of the image plate.&lt;ref name="US1691324"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Iconoscopes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Two iconoscope tubes.  The type 1849 ''(top)'' was the common tube used in studio television cameras.  The camera's lens focused the image through the tube's transparent "window" ''(right)'' and onto the dark rectangular "target" surface visible inside.  The type 1847 ''(bottom)'' was a smaller version.]]

The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or "camera" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by the Hungarian engineer [[Kálmán Tihanyi]] in the beginning of 1925.&lt;ref name="IEC_Tihanyi"&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=person&amp;item=75 "Kálmán Tihanyi (1897–1947)", ''IEC Techline'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges ("photoelectrons") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in [[Hungary]] in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed "Radioskop".&lt;ref name="Radioskop"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/kalman-tihanyis-1926-patent-application-radioskop/ "Kálmán Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop'"], ''Memory of the World'', United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), 2005, retrieved 2009-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application,&lt;ref name="IEC_Tihanyi"/&gt; Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930,&lt;ref name="abstract1928"&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_V3&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19301111&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=313456A&amp;KC=A Tihanyi, Koloman, ''Improvements in television apparatus''].

Convention date UK application: 1928-06-11, declared void and published: 1930-11-11, retrieved: 2013-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and so he applied for patents in the United States.

[[Zworykin]] presented in 1923 his project for a totally electronic television system to the general manager of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. In July 1925, Zworykin submitted a patent application for a "Television System" that includes a charge storage plate constructed of a thin layer of isolating material ([[aluminum oxide]]) sandwiched between a screen (300 mesh) and a [[colloid]]al deposit of photoelectric material ([[potassium hydride]]) consisting of isolated [[Drop (liquid)|globule]]s.&lt;ref name="US1691324"/&gt; The following description can be read between lines 1 and 9 in page 2: ''The photoelectric material, such as potassium hydride, is evaporated on the aluminum oxide, or other insulating medium, and treated so as to form a colloidal deposit  of potassium hydride consisting of minute globules. Each globule is very active photoelectrically and constitutes, to all intents and purposes, a minute individual photoelectric cell''. Its first image was transmitted in late summer of 1925,&lt;ref name="Burns3"&gt;

The first practical iconoscope was constructed in 1931 by Sanford Essig, when he accidentally left one silvered mica sheet in the oven too long. Upon examination with a microscope, he noticed that the silver layer had broken up into a myriad of tiny isolated silver globules.&lt;ref name="Burns2"&gt;

In 1932, Tedham and McGee under the supervision of [[Isaac Shoenberg]] applied for a patent for a new device they dubbed "the emitron", a [[405-line television system|405-line broadcasting]] service employing the super-emitron began at studios in [[Alexandra Palace]] in 1936, and a patent was issued in the USA in 1937.&lt;ref name="US2077442"&gt;

The iconoscope was presented to the general public in a press conference in June 1933,&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"/&gt; and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year.&lt;ref name="WW33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IEE73"/&gt; Unlike the Farnsworth image dissector, the Zworykin iconoscope was much more sensitive, useful with an illumination on the target between 4[[foot-candle|ft-c]] (43[[lux|lx]]) and 20[[foot-candle|ft-c]] (215[[lux|lx]]). It was also easier to manufacture and produced a very clear image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The iconoscope was the primary camera tube used in American broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it was replaced by the image orthicon tube.&lt;ref name="RCA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AbramsonP18"/&gt;

'''''Litton's Weekend Adventure''''' (originally known as '''''ABC Weekend Adventure''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Block programming|programming block]] that is produced by [[Litton Entertainment]], and airs weekend mornings on the [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The block features [[live-action]] documentary and lifestyle series aimed at a family audience that meet [[E/I|educational programming]] requirements defined by the [[Children's Television Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litton's Weekend Adventure|url=http://www.litton.tv/shows/wa.html|work=Litton Entertainment|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everyday Health"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everyday Health, Inc. and Litton Entertainment Announce New Television Series, "Everyday Health," to Premiere on ABC Affiliates|url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/15047510/everyday-health-inc-and-litton-entertainment-announce-new-television-series-everyday-health-to-premiere-on-abc-affiliates?clienttype=printable|work=[[KFVS-TV]]|publisher=[[Raycom Media]]|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced on May 24, 2011, ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' premiered on September 3, 2011, succeeding the [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] block.&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Orders Saturday Kids Block From Litton |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/05/24/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton |work=TVNewsCheck.com |publisher=NewsCheck Media |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204120253/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton |archivedate=December 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broadcasting&amp;Cable&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC to Premiere ABC Weekend Adventure on Sept. 3|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468736-ABC_to_Premiere_ABC_Weekend_Adventure_on_Sept_3.php|author=Paige Albiniak|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessWire&gt;{{cite news|title=Litton Announces "ABC Weekend Adventure"|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110524007282/en/Litton-Announces-ABC-Weekend-Adventure|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cynopsis&gt;{{cite news|title=Cynopsis: Kids!  05/26/11|url=http://www.cynopsis.com/editions/kids/052611/|work=Cynopsis|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the block is syndicated to ABC stations rather than being part of the network's schedule, ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' does not contain any ABC branding or promotions, and likewise is not promoted directly by ABC on-air or mentioned on the network's website.

==Background==
The block came as a result of ABC's decision in early 2011 to no longer provide [[E/I]] programming as part of its Saturday morning network lineup to its affiliates;&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt; the network had not introduced any new E/I programs for its [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] block since 2008, and those that had been airing on the network at the time of the decision consisted of reruns of [[Disney Channel]] [[sitcom]]s that had first aired on the block between September 2005 and May 2007, all of which were out of production by the time ABC Kids ended its run.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In addition, before [[Haim Saban]] repurchased the rights to the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise from [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney's Q3 boosted by TV operations profit; Power Rangers sale added $43 million to coffers|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneys-q3-boosted-tv-operations-26507|author=Paul Bond|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; several station groups that owned ABC affiliates (such as [[Hearst Television]], which would later acquire a majority stake in Litton Entertainment in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-agrees-to-acquire-majority-ownership-of-tv-program-producer-and-distributor-litton-entertainment|title=Hearst Agrees to Acquire Majority Ownership of TV Program Producer and Distributor Litton Entertainment|website=[[Hearst Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allbritton Communications]]) refused to carry any series from that franchise (or any other non-E/I-compliant shows within the block such as ''[[Kim Possible]]'') or chose to run them only in low-rated early morning timeslots, and had demanded any lineup be fully educational so the stations would not have to purchase E/I programming from syndication distributors.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Most of the major commercial networks began restructuring their [[Children's television series#Saturday morning cartoon blocks|Saturday morning children's program blocks]] (with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] dropping [[4Kids TV|its]] outright) to comply to tightened educational content and advertising regulations in the Children's Television Act; cultural shifts and changes in viewing habits through the migration of younger viewers to cable channels, recordable and streaming media were also affecting viewership of children's lineups carried by broadcast television networks.

As a compromise, the network's affiliate board agreed to instead look for a [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] package that would air exclusively on ABC [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and [[network affiliate|affiliate]] stations. Litton Entertainment was eventually selected by the ABC affiliate board to program the block, beating out two other competitors&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt; as a part of the winning presentation in which Litton suggested counterprogramming the then-usual Saturday morning fare by featuring unscripted and "pro-social programming" aimed at children and teenagers ages 7–17.

==History==
ABC and Litton Entertainment announced the block on May 17, 2011 for a fall 2011 launch,&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt; under the [[working title]] "ABC Weekend Adventure". ABC initially signed deals with its owned-and-operated station group [[ABC Owned Television Stations]], as well as affiliates owned by [[Cox Media Group|Cox Broadcasting]], [[McGraw Hill Financial#Broadcasting|The McGraw-Hill Companies]], [[Newport Television]] and [[Graham Media Group|Post-Newsweek Stations]] to carry the block; these were followed by May 2011 with distribution agreements involving ABC stations owned by [[Belo]], [[Bonten Media Group]], [[Chambers Communications Corporation]], [[Fisher Communications]], [[Gannett Company|Gannett Broadcasting]], [[Hubbard Broadcasting]], [[Journal Communications#Journal Broadcast Group|Journal Broadcast Group]], [[LIN Media|LIN TV Corporation]], [[News-Press &amp; Gazette Company]]&lt;!--- listed in ref as News Post Gazette, but likely refers to News-Press &amp; Gazette. ---&gt;, [[Young Broadcasting]] and [[Weigel Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name=lte/&gt;

The renamed ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' launched on September 3, 2011 with six series: ''[[Jack Hanna]]'s Wild Countdown'', ''[[Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin]]'', ''[[Born to Explore with Richard Wiese]]'', ''[[Culture Click]]'', ''Everyday Health'' and ''Food for Thought with [[Claire Thomas (chef)|Claire Thomas]]'' (originally titled ''The Delicious Adventures of Claire Thomas'' prior to its debut).&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt; Two other series were also initially announced to be in development: the environment-focused ''Agents of Change'' (from producer Mark Koops)&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt; and ''Earth: Angry Planet'';&lt;ref name=lte&gt;{{cite news|title=Litton Entertainment's ABC Station E / I Package Adds New Station Groups|url=http://www.litton.tv/resources/litton51710.pdf|publisher=Litton Entertainment|date=May 17, 2010|format=PDF|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, neither show was picked up to series. When the block debuted, ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' became the first Saturday morning block to present all of its programs in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. On May 2, 2012, ABC and Litton reached an agreement to broadcast ''Weekend Adventure'' worldwide on the [[American Forces Network]], beginning that June.&lt;ref name="American Forces"/&gt;

On September 24, 2012, Litton announced that a television version of Everyday Health's [[YouTube]] series ''[[Recipe Rehab]]'' (one of several web series directly funded by the video sharing website as a part of a premium content initiative) would premiere on the block beginning on October 6, 2012&lt;ref name=adweek-reciperehab&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube Hit Jumps to TV—Albeit Saturday A.M.|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/youtube-hit-jumps-tv-albeit-saturday-am-143966|author=Mike Shields|work=[[AdWeek]]|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the ''Everyday Health'' series.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|title=From YouTube to TV|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444083304578016681980491060|author=Amir Efrati|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everyday Health's New TV Series, "Recipe Rehab," Is First Show From A YouTube Original Channel To Air On Network TV|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/idUS171906+28-Sep-2012+PRN20120928|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=Everyday Health, Inc.|location=New York City|via=[[PR Newswire]]|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2013, Litton launched a competing Saturday morning block for [[CBS]], the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' (which replaced the ''[[Cookie Jar TV]]'' block).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS partners with Litton Entertainment for Saturday teen block|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|author=Meg James|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week on October 4, 2013, the ''Weekend Adventure'' block's "Health and Wellness Hour" (consisting of health and culinary programs that filled the third hour of the block) was discontinued as part of a refocusing towards exclusively wildlife-focused programs,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} with the move, ''Recipe Rehab'' migrated to CBS's ''Dream Team'' block&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Greenbrier chef now stars in 'Recipe Rehab'|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/former-greenbrier-chef-now-stars-recipe-rehab|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently on October 4, 2014, ''Expedition Wild'' moved from ''Weekend Adventure'' to another Saturday morning block produced by Litton that launched on that date, ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on [[The CW]].&lt;ref name=tnc&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Joins with Litton for Sat.

In 2016, two stations disaffiliated from ABC due to varied issues; [[WKPT-TV]] in the [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] region of Tennessee and Virginia, and [[WSVI]] in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], but as the Litton syndication contract for ''Weekend Adventure'' is separate from their expired ABC affiliation agreements, were able to continue to air ''Weekend Adventure'' for the time being. The new Tri-Cities ABC affiliate, [[WJHL-DT2]], used programming from the Fox-associated ''[[Xploration Station]]'' block (which was turned down by [[WEMT]]) and other syndicated programming for their E/I contributions instead. In April 2017, ''Weekend Adventure'' moved to WJHL-DT2 after WKPT voided all of their syndication contracts to become a full-time carrier of [[Cozi TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/api/service/tv/application/25076f91571f5d140157b168367c17b1.pdf|title=WSVI 3rd Quarter 2016 Children's Television Programming Report|date=11 October 2016|publisher=WSVI via [[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/api/service/tv/application/25076ff3571f5c1001577b686ec34118.pdf|title=WJHL 3rd Quarter 2016 Children's Television Programming Report|date=11 October 2016|publisher=WJHL via [[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/api/service/tv/application/25076f91571f5d140157afb476a07eef.pdf|title=WKPT 3rd Quarter 2016 Children's Television Programming Report|date=11 October 2016|publisher=WKPT via [[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Programs featured on ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' are designed to meet federally mandated educational programming guidelines, allowing ABC stations to comply with the three-hour weekly minimum for E/I content defined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="Everyday Health"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Broadcasting&amp;Cable/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessWire/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cynopsis/&gt; However, some ABC stations may carry syndicated educational programs to provide additional E/I content supplementary to the block. Programs aired within the block may be deferred to Sunday daytime slots, or (in the case of affiliates in the [[Western United States]]) Saturday afternoons due to [[breaking news]] or severe weather coverage or, more commonly, regional or select national [[ESPN on ABC|sports telecasts]] (especially in the case of [[ESPN College Football on ABC|college football]] games) scheduled in earlier Saturday timeslots as makegoods to comply with the E/I regulations. Some stations may air the entirety of the ''Weekend Adventure'' block on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] to accommodate local news or other programs of local interest (such as [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] shows, [[real estate]] or lifestyle programs).

'''Mathematical methods''' are integral to the study of '''electronics'''.

==Mathematics in Electronics==
Electronics Engineering careers usually include courses in [[Calculus]] (single and [[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]), [[Complex analysis|Complex Analysis]], [[Differential Equations]] (both [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[Partial differential equation|partial]]), [[Linear Algebra]] and [[Probability]]. [[Fourier Analysis]] and [[Z-transform|Z-Transforms]] are also subjects which are usually included in electrical engineering programs.

==Basic applications==
A number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks.  These include
*[[Faraday's law of induction]]: Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage (emf) to be "induced" in the coil. 
*[[Gauss's law|Gauss's Law]]:  The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity.
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law]]: the sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node or the sum of total current at a junction is zero
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]: the directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a circuit must be zero.
*[[Ohm's law]]: the voltage across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current flowing through it.at constant temperature.
*[[Norton's theorem]]: any two-terminal collection of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.
*[[Thevenin's theorem]]: any two-terminal combination of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.
*[[Millman's Theorem|Millman's theorem]]: the voltage on the ends of branches in parallel is equal to the sum of the currents flowing in every branch divided by the total equivalent conductance.
* See also [[Analysis of resistive circuits]].

Circuit analysis is the study of methods to solve linear systems for an unknown variable.

*[[Circuit analysis]]

==Components==
There are many electronic components currently used and they all have their own uses and particular rules and methods for use.

*[[Electronic components]]

==Complex numbers==
If you apply a voltage across a capacitor, it 'charges up' by storing the electrical charge as an electrical field inside the device. This means that while the voltage across the capacitor remains initially small, a large current flows. Later, the current flow is smaller because the capacity is filled, and the voltage raises across the device.

A similar though opposite situation occurs in an inductor; the applied voltage remains high with low current as a magnetic field is generated, and later becomes small with high current when the magnetic field is at maximum.

The voltage and current of these two types of devices are therefore out of phase, they do not rise and fall together as simple resistor networks do. The mathematical model that matches this situation is that of complex numbers, using an imaginary component to describe the stored energy.

==Signal analysis==
* [[Fourier analysis]]. Deconstructing a [[Wave|periodic]] waveform into its constituent frequencies; see also: [[Fourier theorem]], [[Fourier transform]].
* [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]].
*[[Information theory]]. Sets fundamental limits on how information can be transmitted or processed by any system.

The '''memory controller''' is a digital circuit that manages the flow of data going to and from the computer's [[main memory]].  A memory controller can be a separate chip or integrated into another chip, such as being placed on the same [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] or as an integral part of a [[microprocessor]]; in the latter case, it is usually called an '''integrated memory controller''' ('''IMC''').  A memory controller is sometimes also called a '''memory chip controller''' ('''MCC''')&lt;ref&gt;Comptia A+ Certification Exam Guide, Seventh Edition, by Mike Meyers, in the glossary, bottom of page 1278: "Chip that handles memory requests from the CPU."&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''memory controller unit''' ('''MCU''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ49xcoRb1QC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22memory+controller+unit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkyL88MoE6&amp;sig=C_DgghfJu6NzcYpq0EJdtJnYw7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BH7UVIfgLYryUqGzg9gF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22memory%20controller%20unit%22&amp;f=false|title=Maximizing Performance and Scalability with IBM WebSphere|work=google.com|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|IMC}}History ==
Most modern desktop or workstation microprocessors use an ''integrated memory controller'' (IMC), including microprocessors from [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and those built around the [[ARM architecture]].

Prior to [[AMD K8|K8]] (circa 2003), [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors had a memory controller implemented on their motherboard's northbridge. In K8 and later, AMD employed an integrated memory controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chip-architect.com/news/2001_10_02_Hammer_microarchitecture.html|title=Chip Architect: AMD's Next Generation Micro Processor's Architecture|last=Vries|first=Hans de|website=www.chip-architect.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] (circa 2008), [[Intel]] microprocessors used memory controllers implemented on the motherboard's northbridge. Nehalem and later switched to an integrated memory controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torres|first1=Gabriel|title=Inside Intel Nehalem Microarchitecture|url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/inside-intel-nehalem-microarchitecture/|website=Hardware Secrets|accessdate=7 September 2017|page=2|date=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of [[microprocessors]] that use ''integrated memory controllers'' include [[IBM]]'s [[POWER5]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]'s [[UltraSPARC T1]].

While an integrated memory controller has the potential to increase the system's performance, such as by reducing [[memory latency]], it locks the microprocessor to a specific type (or types) of memory, forcing a redesign in order to support newer memory technologies. When [[DDR2 SDRAM]] was introduced, AMD released new Athlon 64 CPUs. These new models, with a DDR2 controller, use a different physical socket (known as [[Socket AM2]]), so that they will only fit in motherboards designed for the new type of RAM. When the memory controller is not on-die, the same CPU may be installed on a new motherboard, with an updated [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]].

Some microprocessors in the 1990s, such as the DEC [[Alpha 21066]] and HP [[PA-7300LC]], had integrated memory controllers; however, rather than for performance gains, this was implemented to reduce the cost of systems by eliminating the need for an external memory controller.

Some CPUs are designed to have their memory controllers as dedicated external components that are not part of the chipset.  An example is IBM [[POWER8]], which uses external [[Centaur (computing)|Centaur]] chips that are mounted onto [[DIMM]] modules and act as memory buffers, [[L4 cache]] chips, and as the actual memory controllers. The first version of the Centaur chip used DDR3 memory but an updated version was later released which can use DDR4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itjungle.com/2016/10/17/tfh101716-story02/|title=IBM Brings DDR4 Memory To Bear On Power Systems|author=Prickett Morgan|first=Timothy|date=2016-10-17|website=IT Jungle|publisher=|pages=1|format=HTML|accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Memory controllers contain the logic necessary to read and write to [[dynamic random access memory|DRAM]], and to [[memory refresh|"refresh" the DRAM]]. Without constant refreshes, DRAM will lose the data written to it as the [[capacitors]] leak their [[electric charge|charge]] within a fraction of a second (not more than 64 milliseconds according to [[JEDEC]] standards).

Reading and writing to DRAM is performed by selecting the row and column data addresses of the DRAM as the inputs to the [[multiplexer]] circuit, where the [[demultiplexer]] on the DRAM uses the converted inputs to select the correct memory location and return the data, which is then passed back through a multiplexer to consolidate the data in order to reduce the required bus width for the operation.

Bus width is the number of parallel lines available to communicate with the memory cell. Memory controllers' bus widths range from [[8-bit]] in earlier systems, to 512-bit in more complicated systems and video cards (typically implemented as four [[64-bit]] simultaneous memory controllers operating in parallel, though some are designed to operate in "gang mode" where two 64-bit memory controllers can be used to access a [[128-bit]] memory device).

Some memory controllers, such as the one integrated into [[PowerQUICC]] II processors, can be connected to different kinds of devices at the same time, including [[SDRAM]], [[static random-access memory|SRAM]], [[read-only memory|ROM]], and [[memory-mapped I/O]]; each kind of these devices requires a slightly different [[control bus]], while the memory controller presents a common [[system bus]] / [[front-side bus]] to the processor.  Some memory controllers, such as the one integrated into PowerQUICC II processors,
include [[error detection and correction]] hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freescale.com/files/training_pdf/24815_PQ2_MEM_CONTROL_WBT.pdf "Memory Controller"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|SCRAMBLING}}Security ==
A few experimental memory controllers (mostly aimed at the server market where data protection is legally required) contain a second level of address translation, in addition to the first level of address translation performed by the CPU's [[memory management unit]].&lt;ref&gt; This is a security feature in that it allows the Operating System to provide better protection separate from using a bit to deny arbitrary code execution in (System and/or User) RAM memory areas.

[http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ald/pubs/hpca99.pdf "Impulse: Building a Smarter Memory Controller"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory controllers integrated into certain [[Intel Core]] processors also provide ''memory scrambling'' as a feature that turns user data written to the main memory into [[pseudo-random]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Memory Scrambling (in Cryptographic Theory) is supposed to prevent [[Computer forensics|forensic]] and [[reverse-engineering]] analysis based on [[DRAM data remanence]] by effectively rendering various types of [[cold boot attack]]s ineffective. In current practice this has not been achieved. 

However Memory Scrambling has only been designed to address DRAM-related electrical problems. The late 2010s Memory Scrambling Standards do not fix or prevent security issues or problems. The 2010s Memory Scrambling standards are not cryptographically secure, or necessarily open sourced or open to public revision or anlysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ASUS and Intel have their own memory scrambling standards. Currently ASUS motherboards have allowed the user to chose which memory scrambling standards to use [ASUS or Intel] or whether to turn the feature off entirely.

== Variants ==

=== Double data rate memory ===
[[Double data rate]] (DDR) memory controllers are used to drive [[DDR SDRAM]], where data is transferred on both rising and falling edges of the system's memory clock.  DDR memory controllers are significantly more complicated when compared to single data rate controllers {{Citation needed| reason= Why would it be significantly more complicated - provide reliable source if possible | date=April 2018}}, but they allow for twice the data to be transferred without increasing the memory cell's clock rate or bus width.

=== Dual-channel memory ===
[[Dual Channel]] memory controllers are memory controllers where the DRAM devices are separated on to two different buses to allow two memory controllers to access them in parallel. This doubles the theoretical amount of bandwidth of the bus. In theory, more channels can be built (a channel for every DRAM cell would be the ideal solution), but due to wire count, [[Crosstalk (electronics)|line capacitance]], and the need for parallel access lines to have identical lengths, more channels are very difficult to add.

=== Fully buffered memory ===
{{Main|Fully Buffered DIMM}}

Fully buffered memory systems place a memory buffer device on every [[DIMM|memory module]] (called an [[FB-DIMM]] when Fully Buffered RAM is used), which unlike traditional memory controller devices, use a serial data link to the memory controller instead of the parallel link used in previous RAM designs. This decreases the number of the wires necessary to place the memory devices on a motherboard (allowing for a smaller number of layers to be used, meaning more memory devices can be placed on a single board), at the expense of increasing latency (the time necessary to access a memory location). This increase is due to the time required to convert the parallel information read from the DRAM cell to the serial format used by the FB-DIMM controller, and back to a parallel form in the memory controller on the motherboard.

In theory, the FB-DIMM's memory buffer device could be built to access any DRAM cells, allowing for memory cell agnostic memory controller design, but this has not been demonstrated, as the technology is in its infancy.

=== Flash memory controller ===
{{Main|Flash memory controller}}

Many [[flash memory]] devices, such as USB memory sticks, include a [[flash memory controller]] on chip. Flash memory is inherently slower to access than RAM and often becomes unusable after a few million write cycles, which generally makes it unsuitable for RAM applications.

'''NAHBGreen''' is another name for the National Green Building Program of the [[National Association of Home Builders]], an organization based in the United States.

==Overview==

[[Green building]] as a process that incorporates environmental considerations into every aspect of the home building process – from choosing the lot and the house plan to material selection construction of the home and finally, its maintenance and operation. What constitutes "green" construction will vary according to the climate, geography and market preferences of the community in which the home will be built.

NAHB members have been building green homes for years – each one appropriate to the climate, geography and market preferences of the communities where they build. Additionally, these builders certified more than 115,000 homes in local HBA green building programs between 1995 and 2008.

These programs have transformed the market because they are a cooperative effort among builders, designers, environmentalists and elected officials. Green building thrives when builders, developers and remodelers can go green voluntarily, without mandates and overbearing strictures. When that happens, there’s no limit on how green a home can be.

The NAHB National Green Building Program has several component parts:

*National Green Building Certification to the National Green Building Standard and the NAHB Model Green Home Building Guidelines
*The Certified Green Professional educational designation
*The NAHB National Green Building Conference
*The NAHB National Green Building Awards

NAHBGreen homes and projects can come in all sizes, styles and price points – from starter homes to retirement villas. Each one incorporates the hallmarks of green building – energy, water, and resource efficiency, indoor environmental quality and effective lot design.

State and local home builder associations "affiliate" with NAHBGreen by encouraging their members to seek National Green Building Certification and providing educational opportunities for builders, remodelers and consumers. As of June 2009, there were 102 state and local NAHBGreen affiliates.

Working with the International Code Council, NAHB spearheaded the development of the National Green Building Standard for all residential construction and renovation projects. This standard was approved in January 2009 by the American National Standards Institute, making it the benchmark for green homes. The standard development process was the latest in a series of initiatives designed to encourage education, networking and recognition for green builders.

The NAHB Green Building Subcommittee was formed in 1998 and the annual NAHB Green Building Conference was first held in 1999, when the first NAHB National Green Building Awards were given to a select group of builders, remodelers and advocates for their exemplary progress.

In 2005, NAHB introduced the NAHB Model Green Home Building Guidelines, allowing builders to "score" their projects in seven categories: energy efficiency, water efficiency, resource efficiency, indoor environmental quality, global impact, lot and site development and homeowner education. To score a home, builders had to achieve a minimum number of points in each of the seven categories and additional points in the categories of choice. The more points a project achieved across all categories, the higher the level.

In 2006, NAHB introduced the two-day "Green Building for Building Professionals" class. Home builders, remodelers, designers and suppliers immediately filled sessions held in home building associations all over the country.

==National Green Building Certification==

There are two rating systems available to score green projects: The NAHB Model Green Building Guidelines for new single-family homes and the National Green Building Standard for new single-family and multifamily construction, residential remodeling and renovation, and subdivision development.

Both rating systems are used as design tools for building professionals to plan their green projects.  They are also scoring tools, providing the list of green choices made so that inspectors can test and verify the results.  Finally, they are used for certification, so that a third party, the [[NAHB Research Center]], can review the inspector's documentation and certify that the project is authentically green. Builders can apply to certify their homes with both the National Green Building Standard and [[Builders Challenge]] using the free online Green Scoring Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahbgreen.org/ScoringTool.aspx|title=NGBS Green Scoring Tool|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAHBGreen website provides instructions for the scoring tools and certification process. A list of accredited verifiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahbgreen.org/Certification/findverifier.aspx|title=ICC 700 NGBS Certification Resources and Tools - Home Innovation Research Labs|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also provided at the site.

==The Certified Green Professional designation==

The Certified Green Professional &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=1174 Nahb.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626184735/http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=1174 |date=June 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; educational designation helps consumers recognize builders, remodelers and other industry professionals who incorporate green building principles into homes — without driving up the cost of construction. Requirements include 24 hours of classroom instruction, two years of industry experience, adherence to a code of ethics and a commitment to approved continuing education sessions.

More than 3,400 people have earned their CGPs since February 2008 – making it the largest and fastest growing NAHB designation in the history of the University of Housing. Consumers can access a Certified Green Professional at the Builder and Remodeler Online Designation Directory at the program's website.

==The National Green Building Conference==

The annual National Green Building Conference &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahb.org/conference_details.aspx?conferenceID=59 Nahb.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820081738/http://www.nahb.org/conference_details.aspx?conferenceID=59 |date=August 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; features educational seminars focusing on topics including Sales and Marketing, Design, Project Management and Building Science. A Tour of Green Homes includes new single-family homes and remodeling projects in various stages of construction.

You can become a fan of the NAHB National Green Building Conference on Facebook or Linkedin and share your thoughts on green with these online communities.

==The National Green Building Awards==

The National Green Building Awards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahb.org/award_details.aspx?awardID=470 Nahb.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123092359/http://www.nahb.org/award_details.aspx?awardID=470 |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focus upon innovative design and technology, and there is also a special category for affordable green homes.

[[File:John Looney House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dogtrot house]]s are designed to maximise natural ventilation.]]
'''Natural ventilation''' is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using [[HVAC|mechanical systems]]. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of [[pressure]] differences arising from natural forces. There are two types of natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] occurring in buildings: ''wind driven ventilation'' and ''buoyancy-driven ventilation''. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.&lt;ref name=Linden&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = P. F. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.fluid.31.1.201 | title = The Fluid Mechanics of Natural Ventilation | journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume = 31 | pages = 201–238 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = |bibcode = 1999AnRFM..31..201L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called "breathing buildings".

==Process==
The static [[pressure]] of air is the pressure in a free-flowing air stream and is depicted by [[Contour line|isobars]] in [[weather map]]s. Differences in static pressure arise from global and [[microclimate]] thermal phenomena and create the air flow we call [[wind]]. [[Dynamic pressure]] is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q = \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^{2},&lt;/math&gt;

where (using [[International System of Units|SI]] units):

:{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = dynamic [[pressure]] in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]],
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\rho\;&lt;/math&gt; || = fluid [[density]] in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. [[density of air]]),
|-
| &lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = fluid [[velocity]] in m/s.
|}

The impact of wind on a building affects the ventilation and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates through it and the associated heat losses or heat gains. Wind speed increases with height and is lower towards the ground due to frictional drag.

The impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive pressure on the [[windward]] side of a building and negative pressure on the [[leeward]] and sides of the building. Thus, the building shape and local wind patterns are crucial in creating the wind pressures that will drive air flow through its apertures. In practical terms wind pressure will vary considerably creating complex air flows and turbulence by its interaction with elements of the natural environment (trees, hills) and urban context (buildings, structures). Vernacular and traditional buildings in different climatic regions rely heavily upon natural ventilation for maintaining [[thermal comfort]] conditions in the enclosed spaces. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Design==
Design guidelines are offered in [[Building code|building regulations]] and other related literature and include a variety of recommendations on many specific areas such as:
* Building location and orientation
* Building form and dimensions
* Indoor partitions and layout
* [[Window]] typologies, operation, location, and shapes
* Other aperture types ([[door]]s, [[chimney]]s)
* Construction methods and detailing (infiltration)
* External elements (walls, screens)
* [[Urban planning]] conditions

The following design guidelines are selected from the [[Whole Building Design Guide]], a program of the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]]:&lt;ref name=WBDG&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Natural Ventilation|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maximize wind-induced ventilation by siting the ridge of a building perpendicular to the summer winds
* Widths of naturally ventilated zone should be narrow (max 13.7 m [45 feet])
* Each room should have two separate supply and exhaust openings.  Locate exhaust high above inlet to maximize stack effect.  Orient windows across the room and offset from each other to maximize mixing within the room while minimizing the obstructions to airflow within the room.
* Window openings should be operable by the occupants
* Consider the use of clerestories or vented skylights.

==Wind driven ventilation==
Wind driven ventilation can be classified as cross ventilation and single-sided ventilation. Wind driven ventilation depends on wind behavior, on the interactions with the building envelope and on openings or other air exchange devices such as inlets or chimneys. For a simple volume with two openings, the cross wind flow rate can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q = U_{\textrm{wind}}\sqrt{\frac{C_{\textrm{p1}}-C_{\textrm{p2}}}{1/\left(A_{\textrm{1}}^2C_{\textrm{1}}^2\right)+1/\left(A_{\textrm{2}}^2C_{\textrm{2}}^2\right)}}\qquad{}\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm{wind}}&lt;/math&gt; is the far-field wind speed; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the upstream opening; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the downstream opening.

For rooms with single opening, the calculation of ventilation rate is more complicated than cross-ventilation due to the bi-directional flow and strong turbulent effect. The ventilation rate for single-sided ventilation can be accurately predicted by combining different models for mean flow, pulsating flow and eddy penetration.&lt;ref name="H. Wang &amp; Q. Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haojie |author2=Qingyan Chen|title=A New Empirical Model for Predicting Single-Sided, Wind-Driven Natural Ventilation in Buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2012|volume=54|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.07.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean flow rate for single-sided ventilation is determined by

&lt;math&gt; \bar{Q} = \frac{C_{d}\; l\; \sqrt {Cp}\;\int\limits_{z_{0}}^h \sqrt{-\frac{2\;\Delta\;P(z)}{\rho}}\, \mathrm{d}z}{z_{ref}^ {1/7}} \; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where

''l'' = width of the window;

''h'' = elevation of the top edge of the window;

''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = elevation of neural level (where inside and outside pressure balance);

''z''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; = reference elevation where the wind velocity is measured (at 10 m) and

&lt;math&gt; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt; = mean wind velocity at the reference elevation.

The knowledge of the urban climatology i.e. the wind around the buildings is crucial when evaluating the air quality and thermal comfort inside buildings as air and heat exchange depends on the wind pressure on facades. As we can see in the equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD ([[Computational Fluid Dynamics]]) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. [[Windcatcher]]s are able to aid wind driven ventilation by directing air in and out of buildings.

Some of the important limitations of wind driven ventilation:
* Unpredictability and difficulties in harnessing due to speed and direction variations
* The [[Indoor air quality|quality of air]] it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area
* May create a strong draught, discomfort.

==Buoyancy-driven ventilation==
::''(For more details on displacement buoyancy-driven ventilation (rather than mixing type buoyancy-driven ventilation), see [[Stack effect]])''

Buoyancy driven ventilation arise due to differences in density of interior and exterior air, which in large part arises from differences in temperature. When there is a temperature difference between two adjoining volumes of air the warmer air will have lower density and be more buoyant thus will rise above the cold air creating an upward air stream. Forced upflow buoyancy driven ventilation in a building takes place in a traditional fireplace. Passive stack ventilators are common in most bathrooms and other type of spaces without direct access to the outdoors.

In order for a building to be ventilated adequately via buoyancy driven ventilation, the inside and outside temperatures must be different. When the interior is warmer than the exterior, indoor air rises and escapes the building at higher apertures. If there are lower apertures then colder, denser air from the exterior enters the building through them, thereby creating upflow displacement ventilation. However, if there are no lower apertures present, then both in- and out-flow will occur through the high level opening. This is called mixing ventilation. This latter strategy still results in fresh air reaching to low level, since although the incoming cold air will mix with the interior air, it will always be more dense than the bulk interior air and hence fall to the floor. Buoyancy-driven ventilation increases with greater temperature difference, and increased height between the higher and lower apertures in the case of displacement ventilation. When both high and low level openings are present, the neutral plane in a building occurs at the location between the high and low openings at which the internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure (in the absence of wind). Above the neutral plane, the internal air pressure will be positive and air will flow out of any intermediate level apertures created. Below the neutral plane the internal air pressure will be negative and external air will be drawn into the space through any intermediate level apertues. Buoyancy-driven ventilation has several significant benefits: {See Linden, P Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 1999}
* Does not rely on wind: can take place on still, hot summer days when it is most needed.
* Stable air flow (compared to wind)
* Greater control in choosing areas of air intake
* Sustainable method

Limitations of buoyancy-driven ventilation:
* Lower magnitude compared to wind ventilation on the windiest days
* Relies on temperature differences (inside/outside)
* Design restrictions (height, location of apertures) and may incur extra costs (ventilator stacks, taller spaces)
* The quality of air it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area (although this can also be a factor in wind-driven ventilation)

Natural ventilation in buildings can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment this type of ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect, it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example, air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the buoyancy effect, but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets. Therefore, prevailing winds must be taken into account when designing for stack effect ventilation.

==Estimating buoyancy-driven ventilation==
The natural ventilation flow rate for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation with vents at two different heights can be estimated with this equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{S} = C_{d}\; A\; \sqrt {2\;g\;H_{d}\;\frac{T_I-T_O}{T_I}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Assessing performance==
One way to measure the performance of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the [[air changes per hour]] in an interior space.  In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air.  A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a [[tracer gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWilliams|first=Jennifer|title=Review of air flow measurement techniques.  LBNL Paper LBNL-49747.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7532b84f?query=Review%20of%20air%20flow%20measurement%20techniques|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ASTM Standard E741-11: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution|year=2006|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space.  To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant.  Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas.  The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time.  For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"/&gt;

While natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]]. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using [[recuperator]]s.

Ventilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta).

Where:

Theta is ventilation heat loss in W

Cp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K))

Rho is air density (~1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m3)

dT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in °K or °C

Eta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used).

The temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as:

dT=SFP/(Cp*Rho*(1-eta))

Where:

SFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s)

Under typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get:

dT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K

In climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where [[district heating]] is available.

To develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved:

# Providing efficient heat recovery at very low driving pressures.
# Physically or thermally connecting supply and exhaust air streams. (Stack ventilation typically relies on supply and exhaust being placed low and high respectively, while wind driven natural ventilation normally relies on openings being placed on opposing sides of a building for efficient cross ventilation.)

Research aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schultz, J. M., 1993. Naturlig ventilation med varmegenvinding, Lyngby: Laboratoriet for Varmeisolering, DTH. (Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct.

The device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure.

With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.&lt;ref&gt;Calautit, J. K., O'Connor, D. &amp; Hughes, B. R., 2015. A natural ventilation wind tower with heat pipe heat recovery for cold climates. Renewable Energy, I(87), pp. 1088-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems often feature finned [[heat pipe]]s although this limits the theoretical maximum heat recovery efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Gan, G. &amp; Riffat, S., 1999. A study of heat-pipe heat recovery for natural ventilation. AIVC, 477(12), pp. 57-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid coupled run around loops have also been tested to achieve indirect thermal connection between exhaust and supply air. While these tests have been somewhat successful, liquid coupling introduces mechanical pumps that consume energy to circulate the working fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, C. A. &amp; Svendsen, S., 2008. Passive ventilation systems with heat recovery and night cooling. Kyoto, Advanced building ventilation and environmental technology for addressing climate change issues.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, C. A. &amp; Svendsen, S., 2012. Wind- and stack-assisted mechanical, Lyngby: DTU Byg.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some commercially available solutions have been available for years,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Autodesk, 2012. Passive Heat Recovering Ventilation System. [Online]  Available at: sustainabilityworkshop.autodesk.com/project-gallery/passive-heat-recovering-ventilationsystem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ventive.co.uk/|title=Ventive|website=ventive.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimed performance by manufacturers has yet to be verified by independent scientific studies. This might explain the apparent lack of market impact of these commercially available products claiming to deliver natural ventilation and high heat recovery efficiencies.

A radically new approach to natural ventilation with heat recovery is currently being developed at Aarhus University, where heat exchange tubes are integrated into structural concrete slabs between building floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stackhr.com/p/how-it-works.html|title=How it works|website=www.stackhr.com|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable [[Indoor Air Quality]].&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "all spaces intended for human occupancy except those within single-family houses, multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, vehicles, and aircraft."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In the revision to the standard in 2010, Section 6.4 was modified to specify that most buildings designed to have systems to naturally condition spaces must also "include a mechanical ventilation system designed to meet the Ventilation Rate or IAQ procedures [in ASHRAE 62.1-2010].  The mechanical system is to be used when windows are closed due to extreme outdoor temperatures noise and security concerns".&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt; The standard states that two exceptions in which naturally conditioned buildings do not require mechanical systems are when:
* Natural ventilation openings that comply with the requirements of Section 6.4 are permanently open or have controls that prevent the openings from being closed during period of expected occupancy, or
* The zone is not served by heating or cooling equipment.

Also, an authority having jurisdiction may allow for the design of conditioning system that does not have a mechanical system but relies only on natural systems.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In reference for how controls of conditioning systems should be designed, the standard states that they must take into consideration measures to "properly coordinate operation of the natural and mechanical ventilation systems."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;

Another reference is ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in [[low-rise]] Residential Buildings.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "single-family houses and multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, including manufactured and modular houses," but is not applicable "to transient housing such as hotels, motels, nursing homes, dormitories, or jails."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"/&gt;

For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its revisions, its scope has been consistent with its currently articulated purpose, “to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space.”&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;  The standard was revised in 2004 after field study results from the ASHRAE research project, RP-884: developing an adaptive model of thermal comfort and preference, indicated that there are differences between naturally and mechanically conditioned spaces with regards to occupant thermal response, change in clothing, availability of control, and shifts in occupant expectations.&lt;ref name="de Dear"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Dear|first=Richard J.|author2=Gail S. Brager|title=Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings: Revisions to ASHRAE Standard 55.|journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2002|volume=34|issue=6|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition to the standard, 5.3: Optional Method For Determining Acceptable Thermal Conditions in Naturally Ventilated Spaces, uses an adaptive [[thermal comfort]] approach for naturally conditioned buildings by specifying acceptable operative temperature ranges for naturally conditioned spaces.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt; As a result, the design of natural ventilation systems became more feasible, which was acknowledged by ASHRAE as a way to further sustainable, energy efficient, and occupant-friendly design.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;

== Career ==
After graduating from Purdue in 1964, she taught at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Rutgers University]], then joined the faculty of [[American University]] (AU) in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At AU, she served in numerous administrative roles including associate dean for graduate affairs and research, vice provost for academic services, and dean for faculty affairs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2001/09/27/nina-matheny-roscher/de60fe2a-a6ca-49a0-8ba4-1f662715e8f7/|title=Nina Matheny Roscher|date=2001-09-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was active in the university senate, chaired a budget simplification task force, and served as the school's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] faculty representative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1991, she was appointed chair of AU's chemistry department, a position she held until her death in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chemistry research ===
At American University, she continued physical organic chemistry research, including research on sunscreens for [[Johnson &amp; Johnson|Johnson and Johnson]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her primary focus was reactions of [[alcohol]]s with silver and [[bromine]] salts, and she supervised numerous graduate students, more than half of whom were women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docslide.net/documents/acs-1996-national-award-winners-58abf2b062773.html|title=ACS 1996 National Award Winners|last=|first=|date=January 8, 1996|work=C&amp;EN|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They created an apprenticeship program to help show first year female students an interdisciplinary, people-oriented perspective of scientists. The program, funded by a $95,000 grant from the NSF included a seminar course followed by a two-month apprenticeship working with a scientist engaged in science policy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary|first=Gray,|last2=Nina|first2=Roscher,|title=MPWG: Apprenticeship Program for Women in Science as Applied to Public Policy|url=http://grantome.com/grant/NSF/HRD-9632086|journal=Grantome|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1976 to 1981, she administered a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF)-funded reentry program to retrain women with degrees in chemistry or biology who had previously been discouraged from pursuing careers in those fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The program involved a year of intensive coursework in chemistry or [[toxicology]] at American University for 75 women, with an average age of 40, some of whom had been out of school for 15 years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Five years after the program ended, of the 75 participants, nine had received a Ph.D. in chemistry, 25 had earned master's degrees, and eight were in graduate school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Later analysis showed the program had also succeeded in ensuring them job placement in diverse career paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/profession/returning-to-science-it-can-be-done-63609|title=Returning to Science: It Can Be Done|last=Roscher|first=Nina Matheny|date=July 27, 1987|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her work at AU, she held a part-time position as program director of science education for the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]] starting in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houtchens|first=C.J.|date=Winter 1994|title=A Winning Formula|url=http://nia.ecsu.edu/nrts/lhayden/winningformula.html|journal=American University Magazine|volume=Winter 1994|pages=15–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the NSF, she worked in the Instructional Laboratory Improvement Program, then became director of the Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement program in the Division of Undergraduate Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (USEME) in 1988.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Awards and other news|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED317414.pdf|journal=National Science Foundation Annual Report 1989|volume=|pages=67|via=Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She joined the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) in 1960 and was very active in the organization. She served on the ACS Women Chemists Committee from 1974 to 1979 (as chair 1976-1978) and was president of ACS' Washington, D.C. section (the Chemical Society of Washington) in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Historian work ===
She was interested in the history of women in chemistry, and authored the book ''Women Chemists'' for the American Chemical Society in 1995.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Much of her extensive research on female chemists is archived in the Archives of Women in Science and Engineering at [[Iowa State University]]; these "Nina Matheny Roscher Papers" are open for research and commonly cited.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

She also looked to the present and future of women in chemistry, analyzing statistics on disparities in training, retention, and compensation of female scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roscher|first=Nina Matheny|last2=Cavanaugh|first2=Margaret A.|date=October 1987|title=Academic women chemists in the 20th century: Past, present, projections|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed064p823|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|language=en|volume=64|issue=10|pages=823|doi=10.1021/ed064p823|issn=0021-9584|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She compiled a 1990 ACS survey evaluating salaries of members and women's perceptions and satisfaction with their employment situation and opportunities for advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_PU_TupLosC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=nina+roscher&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i5vmiCQS_i&amp;sig=vYMOO68AI1dKOqSJGHCCGrZxNlg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwscHrmovdAhWSNd8KHX9mBbc4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nina%20roscher&amp;f=false|title=Women Scientists in America: Forging a New World Since 1972|last=Rossiter|first=Margaret W.|date=2012-02-21|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421402338|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Roscher's outside interests included landscaping and remodeling of a cabin she owned in Lost River, West Virginia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She died from breast cancer September 19, 2001 at [[MedStar Georgetown University Hospital|Georgetown University Hospital]] at the age of 62.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
In 1996 she received the [[ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1998, she received the [[Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring|Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring]], a yearly award administered by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) which recognizes up to ten "outstanding individual efforts and organizational programs designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics, engineering, and science in kindergarten-12th grade and through the graduate level".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=102914|title=Presidential Awards Honor Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of six chemists to receive the $10,000 grant award that year, which was presented by President [[Bill Clinton]] at a [[White House]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BRENNAN|first=MAIRIN|date=1998-09-21|title=Chemists' mentoring efforts recognized|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cen-v076n038.p012|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|language=en|volume=76|issue=38|pages=12|doi=10.1021/cen-v076n038.p012|issn=0009-2347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phragmites''''' is a genus of four species of large [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[Poaceae|grass]]es found in [[wetland]]s throughout temperate and tropical regions of the world. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, maintained by [[Kew Garden]] in [[London]], accepts the following four species:&lt;ref name=TPL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Phragmites |title=The Plant List: ''Phragmites'' |accessdate=2018-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''[[Phragmites japonicus]]'' &lt;small&gt;Steud.&lt;/small&gt; – Japan, Korea, Ryukyu Islands, Russian Far East
#''[[Phragmites karka]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Anders Johan Retzius|Retz.]]) Trin. ex Steud.&lt;/small&gt; – tropical Africa, southern Asia, Australia, some Pacific Islands

Crép.&lt;/small&gt; (illegitimate name).&lt;ref name=TPL/&gt;

===Subspecies and varieties===
Recent studies have characterised [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] distinctions between the introduced and native stands of ''Phragmites australis'' in North America. The Eurasian phenotype can be distinguished from the North American phenotype by its shorter [[ligule]]s of up to {{Convert|0.9|mm|in|2}} as opposed to over {{Convert|1.0|mm|in|2}}, shorter glumes of under {{Convert|3.2|mm|in|2}} against over {{Convert|3.2|mm|in|2}} (although there is some overlap in this character), and in [[Culm (botany)|culm]] characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

*''Phragmites australis'' subsp. ''americanus'' – the North American genotype has been described as a distinct [[subspecies]], subsp. ''americanus'',&lt;ref name=Saltonstall&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recognition of Phragmites australis subsp. Americanus (Poacaeae: Arundinoideae) in North America.

==Invasive status==
In [[North America]], the status of ''Phragmites australis'' was a source of confusion and debate. It was commonly considered an [[exotic species]] and often [[invasive species]], [[introduced species|introduced]] from Europe. However, there is evidence of the existence of ''Phragmites'' as a [[native plant]] in North America long before European colonization of the continent.&lt;ref name="Saltonstall2002"&gt;Saltonstall, Kristin. 2002. [http://www.pnas.org/content/99/4/2445.full|Cryptic invasion by a non-native genotype of the common reed, ''Phragmites australis'', into North America]. ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]'' 99(4):2445-2449.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the North American native forms of ''P. a.'' subsp. ''americanus'' are markedly less vigorous than European forms. The recent marked expansion of ''Phragmites'' in North America may be due to the more vigorous, but similar-looking European subsp. ''australis''.&lt;ref name=catling&amp;mitrow/&gt;

''Phragmites'' outcompetes native vegetation and lowers the local plant [[biodiversity]]. ''Phragmites'' forms dense thickets of vegetation that is unsuitable [[habitat]] for native [[fauna]]. ''Phragmites'' displaces native plants species such as [[wild rice]], [[Typha|cattails]], and native [[Orchidaceae|wetland orchids]].&lt;ref name="USFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/weeds/common-reed.pdf|title=Common Reed. United States Forest Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phragmites'' has a high above ground biomass that blocks light to other plants allowing areas to turn into ''Phragmites'' [[monoculture]] very quickly. Decomposing ''Phragmites'' increases the rate of marsh accretion more rapidly than would occur with native marsh vegetation.&lt;ref name="USFWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/GOMCP/pdfs/phragmitesQA_factsheet.pdf|title=PHRAGMITES: Questions and Answers. United States Fish and Wildlife Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phragmites australis'' subsp. ''australis'' is causing serious problems for many other North American [[aquatic plant|hydrophyte]] wetland plants, including the native ''Phragmites australis'' subsp. ''americanus''. [[Gallic acid]] released by Phragmites is degraded by [[ultraviolet light]] to produce [[mesoxalic acid]], effectively hitting susceptible plants and seedlings with two harmful toxins.&lt;ref name=issg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=301&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=|title=GISD|first=Upane -|last=www.upane.it|website=www.issg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/553035/ Changing Climate May Make 'Super Weed' Even More Powerful] Newswise, Retrieved on June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phragmites'' is so difficult to control that one of the most effective methods of eradicating the plant is to burn it over 2-3 seasons. The roots grow so deep and strong that one burn is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopinvasivespecies.com/phragmites/phragmites-p|title=Stop Invasive Species - Phragmites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research suggests that goats could be effectively used to control the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30583512|title=The goats fighting America's plant invasion|first=Joanna|last=Jolly|date=3 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural enemies==

Since 2017, over 80% of the beds of ''Phragmites'' in the [[Pass a Loutre Wildlife Management Area]] have been damaged by the invasive "roseau cane scale", ''[[Nipponaclerda biwakoensis]]'', threatening wildlife habitat throughout the affected regions of the WMA.&lt;ref name = "NOLA"&gt;[http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2017/04/scientists_finally_identify_pe.html Scientists identify pest laying waste to Mississippi River Delta wetlands grass]&lt;/ref&gt; While typically considered a noxious weed, in [[Louisiana]] the reed beds are considered critical to the stability of the shorelines of [[wetland]] areas and waterways of the [[Mississippi Delta]], and the die-off of reed beds is believed to accelerate coastal erosion.&lt;ref name = "NOLA" /&gt;

==Growth and habitat==
''Phragmites australis'', common reed, commonly forms extensive stands (known as [[reed bed]]s), which may be as much as {{convert|1|km2|mi2}} or more in extent. Where conditions are suitable it can also spread at {{convert|5|m|ft}} or more per year by horizontal [[runner (botany)|runner]]s, which put down [[root]]s at regular intervals. It can grow in damp ground, in standing water up to {{convert|1|m}} or so deep, or even as a floating mat. The erect stems grow to {{convert|2|-|6|m}} tall, with the tallest plants growing in areas with hot summers and fertile growing conditions.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are long for a grass, {{convert|20|-|50|cm|in}} and {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in}} broad. The [[flower]]s are produced in late summer in a dense, dark purple [[panicle]], about 20&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;cm long. Later the numerous long, narrow, sharp pointed spikelets appear greyer due to the growth of long, silky hairs. These eventually help disperse the minute seeds.

It is a [[helophyte]], especially common in [[alkali]]ne habitats, and it also tolerates [[brackish]] water,&lt;ref name=issg/&gt; and so is often found at the upper edges of [[Estuary|estuaries]] and on other wetlands (such as [[grazing marsh]]) which are occasionally inundated by the sea. A study demonstrated that ''Phragmites australis'' has similar greenhouse gas emissions to native ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''.&lt;ref name="AQB"&gt;Emery, Hollie E. and Fulweiler, Robinson W. 2014. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.01.010 Spartina alterniflora and invasive Phragmites australis stands have similar greenhouse gas emissions in a New England marsh]. ''[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/aquatic-botany/  Aquatic Botany]'' Vol.116 2014(5):83-92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have demonstrated that it is associated with larger methane emissions and greater carbon dioxide uptake than native New England salt marsh vegetation that occurs at higher marsh elevations. &lt;ref name="WTL"&gt;Martin, Rose M. and Moseman-Valtierra, Serena. 2015. [Greenhouse Gas Fluxes Vary Between Phragmites
Australis and Native Vegetation Zones in Coastal Wetlands Along a Salinity Gradient]. ''[https://sws.org/Publications/wetlands-journal.html]'' Vol.35 2015(6):1021-1031.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common reed is suppressed where it is [[Grazing|grazed]] regularly by [[livestock]]. Under these conditions it either grows as small shoots within the grassland sward, or it disappears altogether.

In [[Europe]], common reed is rarely invasive, except in damp [[grassland]]s where traditional [[grazing]] has been abandoned.

==Wildlife in reed beds==
{{Main|Reed bed}}
Common reed is very important (together with other [[Reed (plant)|reed-like plants]]) for wildlife and conservation, particularly in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], where several species of [[bird]]s are strongly tied to large ''Phragmites'' stands.  These include:
*[[Bearded reedling]] (''Panurus biarmicus'')
*[[Reed warbler]] (''Acrocephalus scirpaceus'')
*[[Great bittern]] (''Botaurus stellaris'')
In Australia, reedbeds provide cover for grassbirds (''Megalurus spp''), reed warblers (''Acrocephalus spp''), crakes (''Porzana spp'') and bitterns (''Ixobrychus spp'') and the Australian bittern (''Botaurus poiciloptilus'').

==Uses==

===Cultivation===
''P. australis'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in aquatic and marginal settings such as pond- and lakesides. Its aggressive colonisation means it must be sited with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Phragmites australis''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1443|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phytoremediation water treatment===
{{Main|Constructed wetland}}
''Phragmites australis'' is one of the main wetland plant species used for [[phytoremediation]] water treatment.

[[Waste water]] from lavatories and [[greywater]] from kitchens is routed to an underground septic tank-like compartment where the solid waste is allowed to settle out. The water then trickles through a [[constructed wetland]] or ''artificial reed bed'', where [[bioremediation]] bacterial action on the surface of roots and leaf litter removes some of the [[plant nutrition|nutrients]] in [[biotransformation]].  The water is then suitable for [[irrigation]], [[groundwater recharge]], or release to natural watercourses.

===Thatching===
{{Main|Thatching}}
Reed is used in many areas for thatching roofs.  In the [[British Isles]], common reed used for this purpose is known as ''Norfolk reed'' or ''water reed''.  However "wheat reed" and "Devon reed", also used for thatching, are not in fact reed, but long-stemmed [[wheat]] straw.

In [[Middle East]] countries ''Phragmites'' is used to create a small instrument similar to the [[clarinet]] called a [[sipsi]], with either a single, as in the picture, or double pipes as in bagpipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-ankara-museum-of-anatolian-civilizations-anadolu-medeniyetleri-muzesi-28557878.html hitite musician (second millennia B.C.) playing double sips] i&lt;/ref&gt; The reed of the [[zurna]] is made from the common reed which is flattened after removing its brittle outer glaze and the loose inner membrane, and after softening it by wetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fromnorway.net/yaylas/zurna/zurna_faq.htm#6|title=Norwegian food, recipes from Norway, Norwegian news and link directory fromnorway.net|website=www.fromnorway.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912133009/http://www.fromnorway.net/yaylas/zurna/zurna_faq.htm#6|archivedate=2005-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a double reed with an elliptical opening that vibrates by closing and opening at a high speed.  This is not to be confused with other double reeds like that of the [[oboe]] which uses two reeds made from the [[Arundo donax|giant reed]] leaning against each other.

===Food===
Numerous parts of ''Phragmites'' can be prepared for consumption. For example, the young stems "while still green and fleshy, can be dried and pounded into a fine powder, which when moistened is roasted [sic] like marshmallows." Also, the wheat-like seeds on the apex of the stems "can be ground into flour or made into gruel." Rootstocks are used similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Lee, "A Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants of Eastern and Central North America", page 228, Houghton Mifflin Company, New York City, accessed the sixth of September, 2010.
{{ISBN|0-395-20445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Some other uses for ''Phragmites australis'' and other reeds in various cultures include [[basket]]s, mats, pen tips, and a rough form of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marbleheadconservancy.org/resources/publications/invasive-plants/phragmite/|title=Phragmites|publisher=Marblehead Conservancy Inc. Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the reeds are used as nesting tubes by individuals keeping solitary bees such as [[mason bee]]s.

In [[Egypt]], the longer stems are dried and used as [[fishing pole]]s. It is also used there for fences and cattle pens.

In the [[Philippines]], ''Phragmites'' is known by the local name "tambo".  Reed stands flower in December, and the blooms are harvested and bundled into brooms called "walis".  Hence the common name of household brooms is "walis tambo".

Reeds have been used to make arrows&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Sturtevant]] (1978) ''Handbook of North American Indians: Great Basin'', p. 269, Government Printing Office. {{ISBN|0160045819}}, 9780160045813.&lt;/ref&gt;  and weapons such as [[spear]]s for hunting game.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Unaipon|Unaipon, D.]] (2001) ''Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines'', p. 138, The Miegunyah Press, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-522-85246-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]] it is used to produce [[paper]].

==Legend and literature==
When [[Midas]] had his ears transformed into donkey's ears, he concealed the fact and his barber was sworn to secrecy. However the barber could not contain himself and rather than confiding in another human, he spoke the secret into a hole in the ground. The reeds that grew in that place then repeated the secret in whispers.

[[Moses]] was "drawn out of the water where his mother had placed him in a reed basket to save him from the death that had been decreed by the Pharaoh against the firstborn of all of the children of Israel in Egypt" (Exodus 2:10).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cc.usu.edu/~fath6/Moses.htm usu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the plant concerned may have been another reed-like plant, such as [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]], which is still used for making boats.

One reference to reeds in European literature is Frenchman [[Blaise Pascal]]'s saying that Man is but a 'thinking reed' — ''roseau pensant''. In [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s famous fable ''The Oak and the Reed'' — ''Le chêne et le roseau'', the reed tells the proud [[oak]]: "I bend, and break not" —"''Je plie, et ne romps pas''", "before the tree's fall."

'''The Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI)''' is a [[North Carolina State University]] research and education organization located at the [[North Carolina Research Campus]] in [[Kannapolis]], [[North Carolina]], United States. The institute researches food crops, like [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and the potential health-promoting properties they may convey when consumed.

PHHI is part of the [[North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], which staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; The institute has both research and [[Cooperative Extension]] components. [[Mary Ann Lila]], a [[blueberry]] researcher,&lt;ref name="MAL NYT" /&gt; is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute.&lt;ref name="NCRC" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:PHHI Building Oct2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute building at the N.C. Research Campus, Kannapolis, N.C.]]
N.C. State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the biotech hub.

The program's name was changed to Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order "to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease."&lt;ref name="N.C. Research Campus dedication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Campus institute gets home" /&gt;

As of May 2014, PHHI has about 50 faculty and staff in Kannapolis, not including seasonal staff.&lt;ref name="PHHI employees stat" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== Overview ===

Plants for Human Health Institute researchers study the potential health-promoting properties of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]].&lt;ref name="GrowingMag" /&gt; The institute employs six lead researchers and has plans to expand to 14 researchers.&lt;ref name="WRAL" /&gt;

The institutes mission is to discover and deliver plant-based solutions to improve human health, PHHI researchers target naturally occurring chemical compounds in plants and [[Produce|fresh produce]], known as [[phytochemicals]], some of which convey health-promoting properties when ingested. Institute director, Lila, and other PHHI researchers have done research into  phytochemicals, such as [[anthocyanins]] present in [[blueberries]] and other crops, indicating they provide health benefits against [[cancer]], [[diabetes]] and other [[Chronic disease|chronic human diseases]] when consumed.&lt;ref name="DrOz" /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=yes|date=October 2014}}

In 2013, Lila was a lead researcher in a study involving athletes ingesting blueberry and green tea-infused drinks twice daily during a two-week supplementation period and then for three days of rigorous exercise. Among the results, participants experienced a prolonged spike in their metabolism (up to 14 hours) after exercise.&lt;ref name="berrystudy" /&gt;{{npsn|date= October 2014}}

[[Image:Perkins-Veazie raspberry research.jpg|thumb|left|Penelope Perkins-Veazie, postharvest physiologist with PHHI, evaluates food safety, quality and consumer-appeal characteristics, like flavor and color, for fruits and vegetables.]]

=== Programs ===

Plants for Human Health Institute researchers integrate expertise in [[biochemistry]], [[plant breeding]], [[epigenetics]], [[metabolomics]], [[pharmacogenomics]], [[postharvest physiology]] and [[systems biology]].&lt;ref name="PHHI" /&gt; PHHI research faculty have: 
* Led the team that sequenced the blueberry [[genome]].&lt;ref name="blueberry genome" /&gt; 
* Discovered evidence that plants of the [[Brassicaceae]] family (like [[mustard greens]] and [[kale]]) could increase muscle mass in people suffering from debilitating disease and the effects of aging.&lt;ref name="Plant Steroids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clt Slavko" /&gt; 
* Developed functional food ingredients from health-enhancing plant compounds for undernourished populations in Africa.&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; 
* Created fruit-infused peanut flours to combat peanut allergies.&lt;ref name="Peanuts" /&gt; 
* Established multiple plant breeding programs, including broccoli,&lt;ref name="broccoli" /&gt; cabbage&lt;ref name="cabbage" /&gt; and strawberry.&lt;ref name="strawberry" /&gt;

=== Greenhouse Complex ===

[[Image:PHHI greenhouse complex.JPG|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute greenhouse complex in Kannapolis, N.C.]]The institute operates three [[greenhouses]]. At a cost of $340,000 the greenhouse complex provides about 10,000 square feet of space for plant trials on crops like [[broccoli]] and [[strawberry]], and allow the institute to rent space or collaborate on research with other campus operations and businesses.&lt;ref name="Greenhouses" /&gt;

Researchers also partner with the Piedmont Research Station, a research farm located near [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], N.C., to grow and test [[field crop]]s.&lt;ref name="Cabbage Program" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRS" /&gt;

=== Kannapolis Scholars ===

Funded by a $1 million [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] – Agriculture &amp; Food Research Initiative (USDA-AFRI) the Kannapolis Scholars is a program for [[graduate students]] from multiple disciplines to participate in integrated research. Led by Jack Odle, William Neal Reynolds, Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at N.C. State, the examines issuesin the broad domain of [[functional foods]], [[Bioactive plant food compounds|bioactive food components]] and [[human health]].&lt;ref name="KScholars" /&gt; 30 faculty members from eight universities in North Carolina act from multiple disciplines, including [[food science]], [[nutritional science]], [[plant science]], [[animal science]], [[microbiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolomics]] as mentors to the Kannapolis Scholars. Some are resident at the N.C. Research Campus while others are at the associated university campuses.&lt;ref name="KScholars2" /&gt;

=== Plant Pathways Elucidation Project (P2EP) ===

The Plant Pathways Elucidation Project, or P2EP, is a $1.9 million program that engaging college students from across North Carolina in education and research. Started in June 2013, the program is supported by a consortium of academic and industry organizations, including the Plants for Human Health Institute. The program teams university scientists, industry leaders and college students to explore plant health benefits, prepare student scientists to pursue careers in [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), and create a research [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name="CO-P2EP" /&gt;

The 2014 P2EP summer session includes doctoral candidates and graduate and undergraduate interns from 12 colleges and universities and two high schools in [[Cabarrus County]].&lt;ref name="P2EP" /&gt;

]]
The N.C. Cooperative Extension Service houses a multidisciplinary team at the N.C. Research Campus as part of the Plants for Human Health Institute. The team is an education and outreach component directed toward farm and agribusiness management, communications and marketing, and fresh produce safety.

=== Programs ===

In addition to and in partnership with PHHI research programs, the Cooperative Extension group coordinates educational and outreach efforts, secures grants and delivers practical applications of science-based research to strengthen the agriculture industry in North Carolina.

The N.C. Value-Added Cost Share Program (NCVACS), coordinated by the Cooperative Extension team at PHHI, provides assistance to agricultural operations in the form of cost share awards. The program has awarded more than $1 million to support [[agribusinesses]] in North Carolina since it began in 2009. The N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission funds the program.&lt;ref name="SFN" /&gt;

The N.C. Cooperative Extension component of PHHI is a cooperative development center for the state, supported by the [[USDA Rural Development|U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program]], the group works with producer groups and cooperatives to expand economic activity.&lt;ref name="RCDG" /&gt;

PHHI is home to the N.C. Fresh Produce Safety program, a program of the Cooperative Extension, established to educate fruit and vegetable growers about minimizing [[food safety]] risks. The program's training curriculum addresses [[Good Agricultural Practices|Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs)]].&lt;ref name="FPS" /&gt;

=== History ===

Blake Brown, Hugh C. Kiger Professor in agricultural economics at N.C. State, started the Program for Value-Added and Alternative Agriculture in 2006 with support from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission. The program was originally created to assist the transition of tobacco-farm families to other profitable enterprises after the [[Tobacco Buyout]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="TTFC" /&gt;

As part of N.C. State's development of the N.C. Research Campus, the program relocated to Kannapolis in 2008 as an on-site Cooperative Extension complement to the research personnel and programs with the institute. The program operated under the N.C. MarketReady brand from October 2009 until July 2012.&lt;ref name="N.C. MarketReady name change" /&gt; The program has since dropped the name and been fully integrated into the institute as the N.C. Cooperative Extension component.

== N.C. Research Campus ==
{{main article|North Carolina Research Campus}}
[[Image:N.C. Research Campus aerial image.jpg|thumb|left|The N.C. Research Campus]]
The [[North Carolina Research Campus|N.C. Research Campus]] is a public-private venture including eight universities, one community college, the [[David H. Murdock Research Institute]] (DHMRI), the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and corporate entities that collaborate to advance the fields of human health, [[nutrition]] and [[agriculture]]. It was founded by [[David H. Murdock]], CEO of [[Dole Foods]]. The campus is built upon the former site of the [[Cannon Mills|Cannon Textile Mill]] in [[Kannapolis]], about 30 miles north of [[Charlotte]].

The research campus represents an effort by the state of [[North Carolina]] to revitalize the region following the decline of the [[textile industry]]. The campus is supported mainly through annual funding from the state of North Carolina, federal research grants to university researchers located on the campus, and investment of real estate by Murdock, former owner of the Cannon textile mill that previously occupied the site.

It was announced in November 2013 that two new facilities were breaking ground at the Kannapolis campus, including a 50,000-square-foot data center (DataChambers) and a 100,000-square-foot municipal center (the new Kannapolis City Hall).&lt;ref name="groundbreaking" /&gt;

The Plants for Human Health Institute is housed on the campus in a 105,000-square-foot facility that includes research labs, lab support areas and an Advance II 700 US-2 Magnet [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscope.&lt;ref name="building" /&gt;

== Funding ==
The institute has received $2.1 million in gift donations and $7.8 million in federal and private competitive grants, $1.42 million from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission, $2 million from the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], $780,000 from the [[University of North Carolina]] General Administration, and $1.05 million from commodity groups and other private sponsors. This funding is in addition to state appropriations.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; PHHI research programs have also received significant grant funding support from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt;

A '''production order''' is an order issued within a company to produce a specific quantity of material within a certain timeframe. A production order may be issued pursuant to a [[sales order]], and its issuance triggers a number of events. If components in the [[bill of materials]] are in stock, reservations are generated for those items; if they are not in stock, then [[requisition order]]s may be generated. Requisition orders may also be generated for production that occurs externally to the firm. Planned costs for the order are also generated and capacity requirements are generated for the [[work center]]s.

'''''Promised Land''''' is a 2012 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] and starring [[Matt Damon]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] and [[Hal Holbrook]]. The screenplay is written by Damon and Krasinski based on a story by [[Dave Eggers]]. ''Promised Land'' follows two corporate salespeople who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy [[drilling rights]] from the local residents.

Damon was originally attached to direct the film, but he was replaced by Van Sant. Filming took place mainly in [[Pittsburgh]] from early to mid-2012. During filming and afterward, the film's highlighting of the resource extraction process [[hydraulic fracturing]], known as "fracking," emerged as a topic of debate.

The film had a limited release in the United States on {{nowrap|December 28}}, 2012 and followed with a nationwide expansion on {{nowrap|January 4}}, 2013. The film had its international premiere and received Special Mention Award at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, although the [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2012#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2012]], and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $8 million against a $15 million budget.

==Plot==
Steve Butler has caught the eyes of top management at his employer, Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that specializes in obtaining natural gas trapped underground through a process known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Butler has an excellent track record for quickly and cheaply persuading land owners to sign mineral rights leases that grant drilling rights over to his employer. Butler and his partner Sue Thomason arrive in an economically struggling Pennsylvania farming town whose citizens are proud of having family farms passed from one generation to the next.

Coming from a town and a life very similar to that of the people he is now determined to win over on behalf of Global, Butler tells the story of how his own town died after the local [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] assembly plant closed. The idea of a town surviving solely on family farms being passed down through generations as a viable economy is one that he can no longer accept. He claims to be offering the town its last chance. Butler spends some pleasant after-hours time with Alice, a teacher he meets in a bar.

The community seems willing to accept Global's offer, until an elderly, local high school science teacher, Frank Yates, who happened to be a successful engineer in his working life, raises the question of the safety of fracking during a town meeting. It's decided that the people will vote in a few weeks whether or not to take the offer. After hearing about the vote, Dustin Noble, an unknown environmental advocate, starts a grassroots campaign against Global, motivated by a tale of his family losing its Nebraska dairy farm after the herd died as a result of Global's industry-standard fracking process.

Butler begins to meet a great deal of resistance in town. Noble seems to be winning over nearly everyone, including Alice. One night Butler receives a package from Global that includes an enlarged copy of a photograph of dead cattle on a field that Noble said came from his family's Nebraska farm. The enlargement shows that an object thought to be a silo is,in fact, a lighthouse, which are nonexistent in Nebraska, revealing that Noble fabricated his story and deceived the people. Actually, the picture was from [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where Global is in the midst of a lawsuit over environmental complications that were probably caused by their fracking practices.

Butler informs the town's mayor of the deception, who then informs the rest of the town. He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette. Butler realizes the only way Noble could have known this information is if he were also employed by Global, and that Noble's job had been to discredit the environmental movement and convince the town to vote in favor of Global's offer. He arranged for Butler to receive the "confidential" photos and engineered the entire public relations effort.

At a town meeting the next day, the citizens are prepared to vote on Global's efforts to buy drilling rights to their property. Butler talks to them about how the barn in the picture reminds him of his grandfather's barn. He reveals that Noble has manipulated them and is employed by Global. Butler leaves the meeting to find Thomason on the phone with Global. She tells him he's fired and that she is leaving for New York. Butler walks to Alice's home and she welcomes him in.

==Production==
''Promised Land'' is directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Damon]] and [[John Krasinski]], who are film producers along with [[Chris Moore (film producer)|Chris Moore]]. In interviews, Krasinski and Damon said&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcocreate.com/1682142/matt-damon-and-john-krasinski-on-making-promised-land-a-non-message-message-movie|title=Matt Damon and John Krasinski on Making "Promised Land," a Non-Message Message Movie|date=2013-01-02|newspaper=Co.Create|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the idea for the movie was partially inspired by an investigative series of stories in [[The New York Times]] by [[Ian Urbina]], called "Drilling Down",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/us/DRILLING_DOWN_SERIES.html?_r=0|title=Drilling Down Series - Natural Gas|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; about fracking. The screenplay was based on a story by [[Dave Eggers]]. Krasinski came up with the film's premise and developed the idea with Eggers. They pitched the idea to Damon, suggesting that both Damon and Krasinski would write and star in the film. The project was set up at [[Warner Bros.]] with Damon attached as director in October 2011, in what would have been his directorial debut. Filming was scheduled to begin in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-john-krasinski-250753 | title=Matt Damon to Direct Warner Bros.

In January 2012, Damon stepped down as director due to scheduling conflicts but remained involved with the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-direct-movie-john-krasinski-278781 | title=Matt Damon Won't Direct Movie He Co-Wrote with John Krasinski | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=January 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon contacted Gus Van Sant, who directed him in the 1997 film ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', and Van Sant joined the project as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gus-van-sant-matt-damon-dave-eggers-279168 | title=Gus Van Sant Taking Matt Damon's Place on Dave Eggers Project | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] at Warner Bros., and by February, [[Focus Features]] and [[Participant Media]] acquired rights to produce the film.

Other filming locations in Pennsylvania were [[Alexandria, Pennsylvania|Alexandria]], [[Delmont, Pennsylvania|Delmont]], [[Export, Pennsylvania|Export]], and [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]]. Filming also took place at the Grand Concourse at [[Station Square]] in Pittsburgh. Several hundred extras were hired for the film, and filming lasted for {{nowrap|30 days}}.&lt;ref name="immersed"&gt;{{cite news | last=Vancheri | first=Barbara | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/movies/john-krasinski-and-gus-van-sant-totally-immersed-in-film-shot-here-640468/ | title=John Krasinski and Gus Van Sant totally immersed in film shot in Pittsburgh | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fracking==
{{main|Hydraulic fracturing}}
''Promised Land'' was criticized by the energy industry for its portrayal of the resource extraction process [[hydraulic fracturing]], colloquially known as "fracking".&lt;ref name="lobby"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gilbert | first=Daniel | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443294904578042620641185816 | title=Matt Damon Fracking Film Lights Up Petroleum Lobby | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=October 7, 2012 | accessdate=October 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal was first reported in April 2012 by filmmakers raising funds for the pro-fracking documentary ''[[FrackNation]]''. They said, "''Promised Land'' will increase unfounded concerns about fracking."&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Buford | first1=Talia | last2=Martinson | first2=Erica | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/74884.html | title=Matt Damon to star in 'The Promised Land' anti-fracking movie | work=[[Politico]] | date=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phelim McAleer]], the director of  ''FrackNation'', said [[Dimock Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Dimock, Pennsylvania]] was the likely inspiration for ''Promised Land''. McAleer said despite Dimock families' claims that fracking activity contaminated their water, the state and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] scientists did not find anything wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McAleer | first=Phelim | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/for_his_next_escape_x46uFSONrAaCey67ZzZV0I | title=For his next escape | work=[[New York Post]] | date=September 25, 2012 | accessdate=December 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, [[CNBC]] reported that a group of residents from [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania]] were protesting the film and formed a Facebook group. The group said, "They filmed this movie in our backyard. They told us it would be fair to drilling. It’s not. We’re p*ssed [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Carney | first=John | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49218229/ | title=Matt Damon's Anti-Fracking Film Backed by OPEC Member | work=NetNet | publisher=[[CNBC]] | date=September 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Knapp, one of the organizers of the Facebook group said, "One of the things that really aggravates me, is that they seem to have a very condescending view" of farmers as portrayed in the film.&lt;ref name="drajem" /&gt;

Krasinski, who co-wrote the screenplay and stars in ''Promised Land'', said the film's original premise involved [[wind power]]. Krasinski said wind power was replaced by fracking as a more relevant backdrop based on news coverage in recent years.&lt;ref name="immersed" /&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported, "The procedure has caused concern due in part to the chemicals injected into the wells for drilling, which may taint nearby drinking water." It said Damon had posted in 2010 a [[YouTube]] video to promote the [[Working Families Party]], which works "to prevent risky natural gas drilling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/promised-land-matt-damon-fracking_n_1408501.html | title='Promised Land': Matt Damon's Fracking Film To Highlight Controversial Drilling Process | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Politico]]'' said ''Promised Land'' reflected a trend about fracking since the release of the 2010 documentary film ''[[Gasland]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary]].&lt;ref name="star" /&gt;

Leading up to the film's release, a spokesperson for [[Independent Petroleum Association of America]] said, "We have to address the concerns that are laid out in these types of films." The industry planned to send scientific studies to film critics, to distribute leaflets to film audiences, and to use social media like Facebook and Twitter as a response to the film.&lt;ref name="lobby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Szalai | first=George | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/energy-industry-targets-upcoming-matt-377022 | title=Energy Industry Targets Upcoming Matt Damon Film 'Promised Land' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=October 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the industry launched "direct attacks" at ''Gasland'', it instead sought to portray ''Promised Land'' as "derivative, condescending and cliched". In Pennsylvania, the industry group Marcellus Shale Coalition bought a 16-second onscreen ad to be shown at 75 percent of theaters in the state at the same time ''Promised Land'' was released.&lt;ref name="drajem"&gt;{{cite news | last=Drajem | first=Mark | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/fracker-ad-clashes-on-screen-with-damon-s-promised-land-.html | title=Fracker Ad Clashes on Screen With Damon’s 'Promised Land' | work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | date=January 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Schamus, chief executive of the film's distributor [[Focus Features]] said, "We've been surprised at the emergence of what looks like a concerted campaign targeting the film even before anyone's seen it."&lt;ref name="lobby" /&gt; As the film was released, he said, "Fracking is a great premise for real drama. It represents Americans deeply conflicted about how to deal with these issues." He compared the industry's stealth campaign against the film to the one depicted within the film.&lt;ref name="drajem" /&gt;

==Financing==
[[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative think tank, reported that ''Promised Land'' was financed in part by [[Image Nation Abu Dhabi]], a subsidiary of [[Abu Dhabi Media]], which is wholly owned by the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The foundation said that the UAE, as a member of the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), has "a direct financial interest... in slowing the development of America's natural gas industry" and suggested that its financing of the film "may have an impact on the public's view of the [fracking] practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Markay | first=Lachlan | url=http://blog.heritage.org/2012/09/28/matt-damons-anti-fracking-movie-financed-by-oil-rich-arab-nation/ | title=Matt Damon's Anti-Fracking Movie Financed by Oil-Rich Arab Nation | publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] | date=September 28, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hargreaves | first=Steve | url=http://economy.money.cnn.com/2012/10/01/matt-damon-fracking/ | title=Matt Damon fracking film backed by big OPEC member | work=[[CNN Money]] | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=October 1, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Image Nation said it provided financing to the film as part of an ongoing partnership with [[Participant Media]], "regardless of genre or subject matter".&lt;ref name="lobby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="energy" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Promised Land'' received mixed reviews from critics.'' [[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that most critics felt that the film did not reach its full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gettell | first=Olivia | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-promised-land-movie-reviews-critics-20121228,0,6765373.story | title='Promised Land': Drilling drama lacks depth, critics say | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 52%, based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The earnest and well-intentioned ''Promised Land'' sports a likable cast, but it also suffers from oversimplified characterizations and a frustrating final act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1016837-promised_land/ | title=Promised Land (2013) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=August 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/promised-land | title=Promised Land Reviews | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=January 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[A.O. Scott]] praised ''Promised Land'' as a film that "works" mainly "by putting character ahead of story" and by "inviting the actors to be warm, funny and prickly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=28 December 2012|title=Promised Land with Matt Damon Directed by Gus Van Sant|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/movies/promised-land-with-matt-damon-directed-by-gus-van-sant.html?_r=0|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liam Lacey of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is critical of the film: "Apart from its warm, gentle tone, much about Promised Land simply isn’t good, especially the inconsistencies in the screenplay. After the mood-setting first half, things start to unravel."&lt;ref name="GlobeMail01042013"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Lacey | first = Liam | title = Promised Land: Stellar cast, but the film is a fracking disappointment  | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/promised-land-stellar-cast-but-the-film-is-a-fracking-disappointment/article6907504/ | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe and Mail]] | date = January 4, 2013 | accessdate = 7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">In [[systems science]], a  '''sampled-data system''' is a [[control system]] in which a continuous-time [[plant (control theory)|plant]] is controlled with a digital device. Under periodic [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]], the sampled-data system is time-varying but also periodic; thus, it may be modeled by a simplified discrete-time system obtained by discretizing the plant. However, this discrete model does not capture the inter-sample behavior of the real system, which may be critical in a number of applications.

The analysis of sampled-data systems incorporating full-time information leads to challenging control problems with a rich mathematical structure. Many of these problems have only been solved recently.

'''Shell Eco-marathon''' is a world-wide energy efficiency competition sponsored by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. Participants build automotive vehicles to achieve the highest possible [[fuel efficiency]]. There are two vehicle classes within Shell Eco-marathon: Prototype and UrbanConcept. There are three energy categories within Shell Eco-marathon: battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and internal combustion engine (gasoline, diesel, or ethanol). Prizes are awarded separately for each vehicle class and energy category. The pinnacle of the competition is the Shell Eco-marathon Drivers' World Championship, where the most energy efficient UrbanConcept vehicles compete in a race with a limited amount of energy.

Shell Eco-marathon competitions are held around the world with nine events as of 2018. The 2018 competition season includes events held in Singapore, California (US), Paris (France), London (UK), Istanbul (Turkey), Johannesburg (South Africa), Rio de Janeiro (Brasil), India (TBD), and China (TBD). Participants are students from various academic backgrounds including university teams such as past finalists [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/duke-electric-vehicles-team-hits-hollywood|title=Duke Electric Vehicles Team Hits Hollywood - Duke Pratt School of Engineering|author=|date=|website=Pratt.Duke.edu|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-engineering-supermileage-team-wins-shell-eco-marathon-detroit|title=U of T Engineering supermileage team wins Shell Eco-marathon in Detroit|author=|date=|website=University of Toronto News|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/shell-ecomarathon/americas/results-and-awards.html|title=Results and awards|author=|date=|website=www.Shell.com|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, over 5,000 students from over 700 universities in 52 countries participated in Shell Eco-marathon. The digital reach of Shell Eco-marathon is estimated to be several million. 

==History==
In 1939, a group of Shell scientists based in a research laboratory in Wood River, Illinois, USA, had a friendly bet to see who could drive their own car furthest on one gallon of fuel. The winner managed a fuel economy of {{Convert|49.73|mpgus|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite contribution |url=http://www.byronwine.com/files/Shell%20P221.pdf |title=Mileage Marathons |last1=Affleck |first1=W. S. |last2=Toft |first2=G. B. |work=Fuel Economy of the Gasoline Engine : Fuel, Lubricants and other Effects |editor1=Blackmore, D.R. |editor2=Thomas, A. |date=1977 |isbn=1349034185 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A repeat of the challenge yielded dramatically improved results over the years:
* {{Convert|149.95|mpgus|abbr=on}} with a 1947 Studebaker in 1949
* {{Convert|244.35|mpgus|abbr=on}} with a 1959 Fiat 600 in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.59fiattestcar.com|title=Home|author=|date=|website=Shell Fiat|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Convert|376.59|mpgus|abbr=on}} with a 1959 Opel in 1973.

A world record was set by a French team in 2003 called [[Microjoule (vehicle)|Microjoule]] with a performance of {{Convert|10705|mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Running on empty |date=2003-07-18 |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2723474/Running-on-empty.html |access-date=20 October 2008 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current record is {{Convert|12665|mpgus|abbr=on}}, set in 2005 by the [[PAC-Car II]]. The world record in diesel efficiency was achieved by a team from the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia (Politechnical University of Valencia, Spain) in 2010 with 1396.8 kilometres per litre. In contrast, the most efficient production [[Diesel engine|diesel]] passenger cars achieve {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on|0}}, and some high-powered sports cars achieve as little as {{Convert|8|mpgus|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Lowest Fuel Economy Models: 2010 Model Year| publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | date = October 19, 2009 | url = http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/overall-low.htm| access-date = 1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current European Shell Eco-marathon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/shell-ecomarathon/europe.html |title=Shell Eco-marathon Europe |publisher=Royal Dutch Shell}}&lt;/ref&gt; record for a combustion engine entry was set in 2004 by the team from Lycée La Joliverie (France) at 3,410&amp;nbsp;km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel. Prototype vehicles using fuel cells are capable of greater energy efficiency. In 2005, a hydrogen-powered vehicle built by Swiss team ETH Zurich achieved a projected 3,836&amp;nbsp;km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel. This is equivalent to the distance between Paris and Moscow.  In 2013, ethanol efficiency world record was set by Toulouse Ingenerie Multidisciplinarie with 3100&amp;nbsp;km of a single litre of ethanol. This is equivalent to the distance between Toulouse and Istanbul.

==Event==
The Eco-Marathon has different classes of competition according to the energy source used: [[Fuel cell]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel]] and [[Autogas|LPG]].  During the competition, cars must attain an average speed of at least 15&amp;nbsp;mph (23&amp;nbsp;km/h) over a distance of 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km). The course is typically a motor racing track or closed off city streets. The fuel is strictly measured out for each entrant at the start and end of the course. The difference is used to calculate the vehicle's average fuel consumption. Solar-powered vehicles are not eligible for the grand prize for fuel efficiency.

In 2017, more than 100 student teams from many countries across the Americas competed in the Shell-Eco Marathon Americas to a crowd of over 20,000 throughout the competitions at the [[Cobo Center]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/make-the-future-detroit-featuring-shell-eco-marathon-americas-to-shed-light-on-bright-energy-ideas-and-innovations-that-address-the-worlds-energy-challenge-300382594.html |title=Make The Future Detroit, Featuring Shell Eco-Marathon Americas To Shed Light On Bright Energy Ideas And Innovations That Address The World's Energy Challenge |author=Shell Oil Company |date=21 December 2016 |publisher=PR Newswire |access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrants==
The top performing vehicles are purpose designed for high efficiency. Some vehicles use a coast and burn technique whereby they briefly accelerate from 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph (from 16 to 32&amp;nbsp;km/h) and then switch the engine off and coast until the speed drops back down to 10&amp;nbsp;mph (16&amp;nbsp;km/h). This process is repeated resulting in average speed of 15&amp;nbsp;mph for the course. Typically the vehicles have:
* [[Automobile drag coefficients]] (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) below 0.1
* [[Rolling resistance]] coefficients less than 0.0015
* Weight without driver under 45&amp;nbsp;kg
* Engine efficiency under 200 [[Brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] (cc/bhp/hr)

The vehicles are highly specialized and optimized for the event and are not intended for everyday use. The designs represent what can be achieved with current technology and offer a glimpse into the future of car design based on minimal environmental impact in a world with reduced oil reserves.  The work of the participants can be used to show ways manufacturers could redesign their products.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Origin ==

The term ''Silicon Alley'' was derived from the long established [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]]. It was originally centered in the [[Flatiron District]], in the vicinity of the [[Flatiron Building]] at [[Fifth Avenue]] near [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], straddling [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name = "Indergaard_2004_p3"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Indergaard | first1 = Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = Silicon Alley: The Rise and Fall of a New Media District | date = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-93571-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k96SAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themidtowngazette.com/2013/10/startups-move-to-co-shared-offices-amid-high-real-estate-prices/|title=Startups move to co-shared offices amid high real estate prices | first = Karim | last =  Lahlou | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The Midtown Gazette | accessdate = 20 August 2014 | date = 30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon Alley initially also used to extend to [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]], a neighborhood in [[Brooklyn]]. [[Columbia University]] and [[NYU]]'s leaderships were especially important in the alley's early development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NYC Start-ups: Growth of Silicon Alley | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-zabusky/nyc-tech-start-up_b_3185826.html | date = 30 June 2013 | work = The Huffington Post | first = Jonathan | last = Zabusky | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term Silicon Alley may have originated in 1995 by a New York staffing recruiter, Jason Denmark, who was supporting clients in the newly dubbed technical hub in downtown Manhattan; in an effort to attract candidates who, at that time, were focusing on positions in Silicon Valley, he posted in public [[usenet]] postings of Object Technology Developers, job ads with the Silicon Alley label. "Subject: NYC - silicon ALLEY" shows up in an internet post by Jason Denmark on February 16, 1995; another Jason Denmark post on June 16, 1995, is "Subject: SILICON 'ALLEY' POSITIONS."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first publication to cover Silicon Alley was @NY, an online newsletter founded in the summer of 1995 by [[Tom Watson (journalist)|Tom Watson]] and [[Jason Chervokas]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The first magazine to focus on [[venture capital]] opportunities in Silicon Alley, AlleyCat News co-founded by Anna Copeland Wheatley and Janet Stites, was launched in the fall of 1996.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Courtney Pulitzer branched off from her @The Scene column with @NY and created Courtney Pulitzer's Cyber Scene and her popular networking events Cocktails with Courtney. [[First Tuesday (networking forum)|First Tuesday]], co-founded by [[House of Grimaldi|Vincent Grimaldi de Puget]] and [[John Grossbart]], became the largest gathering of Silicon Alley, welcoming 500 to 1000 venture capitalists and entrepreneurs every month.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was an initiative of law firm [[Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal|Sonnenschein]] and the [[Kellogg School of Management]], as well as other corporate founders, including [[Accenture]] (then Andersen Consulting), AlleyCat News and [[Merrill Lynch]]. [[Silicon Alley Reporter]] started publishing in October 1996.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was founded by [[Jason Calacanis]] and was in business from 1996 to 2001. @NY, print magazines, and the attending media coverage by the larger New York press helped to popularize both the name, and the idea of New York City as a [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] center.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1997, over 200 members and leaders of Silicon Alley joined NYC entrepreneurs, Andrew Rasiej and Cecilia Pagkalinawan to help wire [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] to the Internet. This response and the Department of Education's growing need for technology integration marked the birth of [[Making Opportunities for Upgrading Schools and Education]] (MOUSE), an organization that today serves tens of thousands of underserved youth in schools in five states and over 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Dot-com bust ==

The rapid growth of internet companies during the 1990s, known as the [[Dot-com bubble]], came to a rapid halt during the [[early 2000s recession]]. During this economic contraction, many internet companies in Silicon Alley folded. The recession also affected publications that covered the sector. After the dot-com bust, the ''Silicon Alley Reporter'' was rebranded as ''Venture Reporter'', in September 2001, and sold to [[Dow Jones]]. Self-financed AlleyCat News ceased publication in October 2001.&lt;ref name = "Fergal_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.builtinnyc.com/2015/10/12/where-exactly-or-was-silicon-alley | title = The mysterious origins of the term Silicon Alley revealed | first = Fergal | last = Gallagher | name-list-format = vanc | work = Built In NYC | date =  4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==

A couple of years after the dot-com bust, Silicon Alley began making its comeback with the help of NY Tech Meetup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oremus|first1=Will|title=New Tech City |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_next_silicon_valley/2013/12/new_york_city_tech_boom_how_it_became_the_silicon_valley_of_the_east.html |website=[[Slate.com|Slate]] |accessdate=25 March 2017 |language=English|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NextNY.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of [[Cornell University]] and [[Technion-Israel Institute of Technology]] to build a US$2 billion [[graduate school]] of [[applied science]]s on [[Roosevelt Island]], with the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/nyregion/cornell-and-technion-israel-chosen-to-build-science-school-in-new-york-city.html | first = Richard | last = Pérez-Peña | name-list-format = vanc | title = Cornell Alumnus Is Behind $350 Million Gift to Build Science School in City |work=The New York Times|date = 19 December 2011 | accessdate =  1 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/12/nyc-chooses-cornell-technion-build-tech-campus | title = 'Game-changing' Tech Campus Goes to Cornell, Technion | first = Anne | last = Ju | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Cornell University | date = 19 December 2011 | accessdate = 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2013, [[Google]]'s second largest office is located in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/downloads/pdf/2013report.pdf|title=p.26, The 2013 Report|publisher=NYC Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment|accessdate = 23 August  2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon Communications]], headquartered at 140 [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]] in Lower Manhattan, was in 2014 in the final stages of completing a US$3 billion [[fiberoptic communication|fiberoptic telecommunications]] upgrade throughout New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/06/verizon-will-miss-deadline-to-wire-all-of-new-york-city-with-fios/|title=Verizon will miss deadline to wire all of New York City with FiOS | first = Jon | last = Brodkin | name-list-format = vanc | work = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 9 June 2014 |accessdate = 27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This revival was not restricted to Lower Manhattan, but was spread throughout New York City.  Hence "Silicon Alley" has been considered by some observers to be an obsolete term.&lt;ref name = "Fergal_2015" /&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2013/06/smarsh_an_archivist_for_the_in_1.html|title= Smarsh, An Archivist for the Information Age |first=Mike |last=Rogoway |date=June 13, 2013 |publisher=The Oregonian |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founder, Stephen Marsh, believed that the financial industry needed a better way to archive, store, and regulate its data as regulations required.&lt;ref name = "AE"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/04/21/story6.html?b=1208750400%252525255E1622377 |title=Smarsh expects to double revenue to $10M |publisher=Portland Business Journal |first=Aliza |last=Earnshaw |date=April 20, 2008 |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, the company relocated its headquarters to Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref name =Vinny&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2013/11/dell_sells_its_majority_stake.html| title=Dell Sells its Majority Stake in Smarsh to Investment Fund Toba Capital |first=Mike |last = Rogoway |publisher = The Oregonian |date = November 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company used its social media archiving tools to assist with a study on the use of social media by adolescents. Smarsh was contracted by [[CNN]] to host a secure server where social media use by participating students was monitored and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/05/health/being-13-teens-social-media-study/|title=Why Some 13-Year-Olds Check Social Media 100 Times a Day|publisher=CNN |date=October 13, 2015 |first=Chuck |last=Hadad |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anderson Cooper 360°]] special report, ''#Being13: Inside the Secret World of Teens'', was released in October 2015, and won an [[Emmy Award]] in the News and Documentary category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emmyonline.com/news_37th_winners|title=National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Announces Winners at the 37th Annual News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards|date=September 21, 2016|access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured Financial Messaging System''' (SFMS) is a secure messaging standard developed to serve as a platform for intra-bank and inter-bank applications. It is an [[India]]n standard similar to [[SWIFT]] (Society for World-wide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) which is the international messaging system used for financial messaging globally.

SFMS can be used for secure communication within the bank and between banks. The SFMS was launched on December 14, 2001 at [[IDRBT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.idrbt.ac.in/sfms.html |title= Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the definition of message structures, message formats, and authorization of the same for usage by the financial community.{{cn|date=May 2015}} SFMS has a number of features and it is a modularized and web enabled software, with a flexible architecture facilitating centralized or distributed deployment. The access control is through Smart Card based user access and messages are secured by means of standard encryption and authentication services conforming to ISO standards.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

The intra-bank part of SFMS is used by banks to take full advantage of the secure messaging facility it provides.{{cn|date=May 2015}} The inter-bank messaging part is used by applications like [[electronic funds transfer]] (EFT), [[real time gross settlement]] systems (RTGS), delivery versus payments (DVP), centralized funds management systems (CFMS) and others. The SFMS provides  [[application program interfaces]] (APIs), which can be used to integrate existing and future applications with the SFMS.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Several banks have integrated it with their core or centralized banking software.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Sump pump AC.jpg|thumb|right|A small submersible AC sump pump with a [[garden hose]] connector]]
A '''sump pump''' is a [[pump]] used to remove water that has accumulated in a water-collecting [[sump]] basin, commonly found in the [[basement]]s of homes.  The water may enter via the perimeter drains of a [[basement waterproofing]] system, funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water, if the basement is below the water table level.

Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness where the [[water table]] is above the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] of a home. Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal [[storm drain]] or a [[dry well]].

Pumps may discharge to the [[sanitary sewer]] in older installations. Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the [[building code|plumbing code]] or municipal bylaws, because it can overwhelm the municipal [[sewage treatment]] system. Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges into the sewer.

Usually hardwired into a home's electrical system, sump pumps may have a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] backup. The home's pressurized water supply powers some pumps, eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable water, potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem. Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm.

There are generally two types of sump pumps—'''pedestal''' and '''submersible'''. In the case of the pedestal pump, the motor is mounted above the sump—where it is more easily serviced, but is also more conspicuous. The pump impeller is driven by a long, vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump. The submersible pump, on the other hand, is entirely mounted inside the sump, and is specially sealed to prevent electrical [[short circuit]]s. There is debate about which variety of sump pump is better. Pedestal sump pumps usually last longer (25 to 30 years) if they are installed properly and kept free of debris. They are less expensive and easier to remove. Submersible pumps will only last 5 to 15 years. They are more expensive to purchase but can take up debris without clogging.&lt;ref name="pedestalbenefits1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sump-pump-info.com/pedestal-sump-pump.html |title=Pedestal Sump Pumps |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pedestalbenefits2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basementhealthpros.com/sump-pumps-the-differences-between-common-pump-models/ |title=Sump Pumps: The Differences Between Common Pump Models |publisher=Basement Health Pros |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control [[water table]]-related problems in surface soil. An [[artesian aquifer]] or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation. As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable. These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout. They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.

==Components==
Modern sump pump components in the United States are standardized. They consist of:
* A plastic, metal, or concrete container forming a sump basin, approximately 2 feet (0.6 m) across and 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 1 m) deep, 15 to 25 U.S. gallons (60 to 100 litre) capacity;
* A sump pump, either 1/3 or 1/2 horsepower (200 or 400 W), either battery or mains powered (or both).

==Pump selection==
Selection of a sump pump may consider:
* Automatic vs. manual operation&amp;nbsp;– pump may be controlled automatically by a level switch.
* Power&amp;nbsp;– Sump pump motive power will vary from 1/4 horsepower to multiple horsepower.
* Head pressure&amp;nbsp;– The [[hydraulic head]] pressure of a sump pump describes the maximum height that the pump will move water. For instance, a sump pump with a 15 feet (4.6&amp;nbsp;m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6&amp;nbsp;m) before it completely loses flow.
* Power cord length&amp;nbsp;– Running a more powerful electrical motor a long distance from the main service panel will require heavier gauge wiring to assure sufficient voltage at the motor for proper pump performance.
* Phase and voltage&amp;nbsp;– Sump pumps powered from the AC mains are available with single-phase or three-phase induction motors, rated for 110–120, 220–240, or 460 volts. Three-phase power is typically not available in residential locations.
* Water level sensing switch type&amp;nbsp;– Pressure switches are fully enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types attached to the end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.
* Backup system and alarm for critical applications.

==Backup components==
A secondary, typically battery-powered sump pump can operate if the first pump fails. A battery-powered secondary pump will have a separate battery and charger system to provide power if normal supply is interrupted. 

Alternative sump pump systems can be driven by municipal water pressure. Water-powered [[ejector pump]]s have  a separate pump, float and check valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphaplumbing.biz/residential-plumbing-services/basepump-water-powered-backup-sump-pump/|website=Alpha Plumbing |title=Basepump Water-Powered Backup Sump Pump |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The float controlling a backup pump is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, the main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. An ejector pump can also be connected to a garden hose to supply high-pressure water, with another hose to carry the water away.  Although such ejector pumps waste water and are relatively inefficient, they have the advantage of having no moving parts and offer the utmost in reliability.

If the backup sump system is rarely used, a component failure may not be noticed, and the system may fail when needed. Some battery control units test the system periodically and alert on failed electrical components.

A simple, battery-powered water alarm can be hung a short distance below the top of the sump to sound an alarm should the water level rise too high.

==Maintenance==
[[File:Pedestal pump.jpg|120px|thumb|Illustration of a typical pedestal-type sump pump.]]
Sump basins and sump pumps must be maintained. Typical recommendations suggest examining equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due to higher water table, water drainage, or weather conditions should be examined more frequently. Sump pumps, being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, which could lead to a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basement-repair.com/basement/basement-sump-pumps.html |title=Sump Pumps |publisher=Basement-repair.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining a sump pump and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris should be removed to increase efficiency and extend the life of the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the discharge line opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed discharge line can force a sump pump to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown (Date unknown). [http://www.basement-repair.com/basement/basement-sumppump-problems.htm Basement Troubleshooting Guide: Failing Sump Pumps].&lt;/ref&gt;

Float switches are used to automatically turn the sump pump on when water rises to a preset level. Float switches must be clear of any obstructions within the sump.  A float guard can be used to prevent the float switch from accidentally resting on the pump housing, and remaining on. As mechanical float switches can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly.

If left in standing water, pedestal pumps should be manually run from time to time, even if the water in the sump isn't high enough to trip the float switch. This is because these pumps are incapable of removing all the water in a sump and the lower bearing or bushing for the pump impeller shaft tends to remain submerged, making it prone to corrosion and eventually freezing the drive shaft in the bearing. In the alternative, a pedestal pump that is expected to remain idle for an extended time should be removed from the sump and stored out of water, or the sump should be mopped out to bring the level of the remaining water well below the lower shaft bearing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7200">[[File:Muirhead automatic telegraph syphon receiver (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol V, 1903).jpg|thumb|Muirhead syphon recorder]]
The '''syphon''' or '''siphon recorder''' is an obsolete [[electromechanical]] device used as a receiver for submarine [[telegraph]] cables invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Underwater-web/uw-bold-and-cautious-05.htm|title=The Underwater Web: Cabling the Seas a Smithsonian Institution Libraries Exhibition|website=www.sil.si.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It automatically records an incoming [[telegraph]] message as a wiggling ink line on a roll of paper tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=3DfeAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA604#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Submarine Telegraphs|last=Bright|first=Charles|date=2014-03-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108069489|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a trained [[telegrapher]] would read the tape, translating the pulses representing the "dots" and "dashes" of the [[Morse code]] to characters of the text message.

The syphon recorder replaced Thomson’s [[mirror galvanometer]] as the standard receiving instrument for submarine telegraph cables, allowing long cables to be worked using just a few volts at the sending end. The disadvantage of the mirror galvanometer was that it required two operators, one with a steady eye to read and call off the signal, the other to write down the characters received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Instruments/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy - Early Cable Instruments|website=atlantic-cable.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use spread to ordinary telegraph lines and [[radiotelegraphy]] [[radio receiver]]s.   A major advantage of the syphon recorder was that no operator has to monitor the line constantly waiting for messages to come in. The paper tape preserved a record of the actual message before translation to text, so errors in translation could be checked.

== How it works ==
[[File:Syphon recorder mechanism 1922.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram of a siphon recorder mechanism from 1922]]

The siphon recorder works on the principle of a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]]. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]] so it can turn freely.&lt;ref name="The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century" &gt;{{ cite book | title = The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century | year = 1900 | last = Byrn | first = Edward | publisher = Munn &amp; Co. | location = New York | edition = 1900 | ref = Kennedy, Electrical Installations, 1903 | pages = 36–37 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41538/41538-h/41538-h.htm#SecIV_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread.  From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape.  The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen.  Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by [[siphon]] action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, Electrical Installations, 1903, Syphon recorders" &gt;{{ cite book | series = Electrical Installations | title = Syphon Recorders | year = 1903 | last = Kennedy | first = Rankin | authorlink = Rankin Kennedy | publisher = Caxton | location = London | volume = Vol. V | edition = 1903 five-volume | ref = Kennedy, Electrical Installations, 1903 | pages = 79–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current from the telegraph line is applied to the coil.  The pulses of current representing the [[Morse code]] "dots" and "dashes" flowing through the coil create a [[magnetic field]] which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, creating a [[torque]] which causes the coil to rotate slightly about its vertical suspension axis.  The wire linkages cause the siphon support plate to rotate about its horizontal axis, swinging the siphon tube across the paper tape.  This draws a displacement in the ink line on the tape as long as the current is present in the coil.  Thus the ink line on the tape forms a graph of the current in the telegraph line, with displacements representing the "dots" and "dashes" of the Morse code.  An operator knowing Morse code later translates the line on the tape to characters of the text message, and types them onto a telegram form.

== Kelvin's electrostatic syphon ==
[[File:Radiotelegraph syphon recorder tape 1922.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Example of transatlantic radiotelegraph message recorded on paper tape by a siphon recorder at RCA's receiving center in New York City in 1920.]]  
[[File:Syphon recorder output.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Due to poor transmission quality of long telegraph lines the paper tape was often hard to read.&lt;ref name="The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century"/&gt;]]
The siphon and an ink reservoir are together supported by an [[ebonite]] bracket, separate from the rest of the instrument, and insulated from it. This separation permits the ink to be electrified to a high potential while the body of the instrument, including the paper and metal writing tablet, are grounded, and at low potential.  The tendency of a charged body is to move from a place of higher to a place of lower potential, and consequently the ink tends to flow downwards to the writing tablet.  The only avenue of escape for it is by the fine glass siphon, and through this it rushes accordingly and discharges itself upon the paper.  The natural repulsion between its like-electrified particles causes the shower to issue in spray.  As the paper moves over the pulleys a delicate hair line is marked, straight when the syphon is stationary, but curved when the siphon is pulled from side to side by the oscillations of the signal coil.

Power to pull the roll of paper tape through the syphon recorder was usually supplied by one Froment's [[mouse mill motor]]s. These also drove an [[electrostatic machine]] to generate the electricity to power the syphon.

== Muirhead's vibrating recorder ==
[[File:Muirhead syphon recorder mechanism (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol V, 1903).jpg|thumb|Muirhead mechanism]]
A simpler mechanism was developed by [[Alexander Muirhead]]. This used a vibrating pen to avoid the same problem of the ink sticking to the paper.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, Electrical Installations, 1903, Syphon recorders" /&gt;  The recording pen was suspended on a thin wire, vibrated by an electromagnet mechanism similar to that of an [[electric bell]], to break contact with the paper.

A '''telecommunications relay service''', also known as '''TRS''', '''relay service''', or '''IP-relay''', or Web-based relay service, is an operator service that allows people who are [[deaf]], [[hearing impairment|hard of hearing]], [[Deafblindness|deafblind]], or have a [[speech disorder]] to place calls to standard [[telephone]] users via a keyboard or assistive device. Originally, relay services were designed to be connected through a [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|TDD]], [[teleprinter|teletypewriter]] (TTY) or other assistive telephone device. Services gradually have expanded to include almost any [[real-time text]] capable technology such as a [[personal computer]], [[laptop]], [[mobile phone]], [[PDA]], and many other devices. The first TTY was invented by deaf scientist [[Robert Weitbrecht]] in 1964. The first relay service was established in 1974 by Converse Communications of Connecticut.

[[Image:Relay-screen.png|right|A typical relay service conversation.]]

==Types of services available==
Depending on the technical and physical abilities and physical environments of users, different call types are possible via relay services.

===TTY to voice/voice to TTY===
Once the most common type of TRS call, TTY calls involve a call from a deaf or hard-of-hearing person who utilizes a TTY to a hearing person. In this type of call, typed messages are relayed as voice messages by a TRS operator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''relay agent'' (agent)), and vice versa.  This allows callers who are unable to use a regular telephone to be able to place calls to people who use a regular  telephone and vice versa. When the person who is hearing is ready for a response, it is customary to say "go ahead" or "GA" to indicate that it is the TTY (teletypewriter) user's turn to talk and "stop keying",  "SK", or "ready to hang up" when ending the call and vice versa. This mode of communication has largely been superseded by other modes of communications, including the utilization of IP relay, VPs, VRS, and VRI.

===Voice carry over===
A common type of call is ''voice carry over'', VCO. This allows a person who is hard of hearing or deaf but can speak to use their voice while receiving responses from a person who is hearing via the operator's typed text. There are many variations of VCO, including two-line VCO and VCO with privacy.

====VCO with privacy====
The operator will not hear the VCO user's voiced messages and the VCO user does not need to voice GA. The operator will hear the person who is hearing, and the person who is hearing must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the VCO user's turn. The VCO user does not need to voice GA, because the VCO user types it or presses the "VCO GA" button on the VCO phone when it's the voice user's turn to talk.

====Two-line VCO====
Two-line VCO allows a VCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator, who in turn calls the VCO user on a second telephone line, which serves as the voice line. The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person. This method is frequently used by people who are hard of hearing and like to use some of their residual hearing as well not having to say "go ahead". With two-line VCO, the VCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other. VCO with Privacy cannot be used with two-line VCO, because the operator, VCO user, and hearing person are on a three-way call.

===Hearing carry over===
A less common call type is ''hearing carry over'' (HCO). HCO allows a person who is speech-disabled but can hear to use their hearing while sending responses to a person who is hearing via the HCO user's typed text. The operator voices the HCO user's typed messages, and then the HCO users picks up the handset and listens to the other voice user's response. There are many variations of HCO, including two-line HCO and HCO with privacy.

====HCO with privacy====
The operator will not hear the voice user's voiced messages and the voice user does not need to voice GA. The operator will voice for the person who is Speech-Disabled, and the person who is Speech–Disabled must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the voice user's turn. The voice user does not need to voice GA, because the HCO user can hear when the voice user finishes talking.

====2-line HCO====
Similar to 2-line VCO, 2-line HCO allows an HCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator, who in turn calls the HCO user on a second telephone line, which serves as the voice line. The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person. This method is frequently used by people who are Speech-Disabled and like to use some of their residual speech as well not having to type "GA". With 2–Line HCO, the HCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other. HCO with Privacy cannot be used with 2–Line HCO, because the operator, HCO user, and hearing person are on a three–way call.

===Speech to speech===
{{main|STS Relay}}
Speech to speech (STS) exists for people who have speech disabilities. A specially–trained STS TRS operator revoices what the person with a speech disability says. STS is often used in combination with VCO for people who are deaf and have somewhat understandable speech, as well as two–Line HCO users. STS enables people with speech disabilities to call others (able-bodied speakers and other people with speech disabilities). It also enables people without speech disabilities to call people with speech disabilities. Anyone can call 711 in the U.S. and ask for Speech to Speech. STS is also available in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden.

Many STS users have Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, ALS, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or stroke.  Other users stutter or have had a laryngectomy. STS also helps speech synthesizer users, users of [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] (AAC.)  AAC users can set their device next to a speakerphone.  They ask the STS CA set up the call, negotiate the menu, introduce the call explaining AAC and then go into the background.  This enables AAC users to communicate independently once the other party is on the line. For more information visit [http://www.speechtospeech.org].

===Deafblind variation===
Telebraille also exists for people who are [[Deafblindness|deafblind]] with the use of a TTY with a [[braille]] or regular keyboard and a refreshable braille display or LVD (Large Visual Display). A relay call of a user who is deafblind is directly related to a relay call of a TTY user, however, the text transmission speed is often reduced to increase the ability of the user who is deafblind to comprehend the moving braille on the braille TTY or large print on the LVD. Telebraille relay operators must be familiar with Braille contractions that users who are deafblind may use. Some TTY users with mobile disabilities may prefer to use a Telebraille, due to the smaller keyboard, regardless of a sight disability or lack thereof.

=== Captioned telephone ===  &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closed captioning]] --&gt;

'''Captioned telephone''' is a hybrid communication method that enables people who are hard of hearing, [[Manualism and oralism|oral deaf]] or [[Post-lingual hearing impairment|late–deafened]] to speak directly to another party on a telephone call.&lt;ref&gt;Verizon information brochure GT016707SS-WS&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a [[telephone]] that displays real-time captions of what the hearing party speaks during a conversation. The captions are displayed on a screen embedded in the telephone base. A captioned telephone can also function exactly like a VCO by switching the device to VCO mode, for example, to communicate with an HCO user directly, without relay. Captioned telephone services can be provided in traditional telephone environments as well as in VOIP environments.

Captions are created by a communications assistant using a computer with voice recognition software. The communications assistant listens to and revoices the hearing party's side of the conversation into the microphone of a headset. A voice recognition program creates the captions and they are sent out to the captioned telephone where they are read by the user.

====IP CTS====

Prior to 2005, captioned telephone service was only available to people in states that had captioned telephone service as part of their state relay program. In 2005, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] made IP CTS a part of the federally mandated services. 

IP CTS Requires an internet connection to deliver the captions to the user. Most also rely on their regular land-line telephone for the audio portion of the call, but some configurations of IP CTS allow the use of VOIP to carry the call audio. IP CTS has allowed captioned telephone service to be provided on smartphones and tablets.

====Two–line captioned telephone====
Captioned telephone can also be used with two lines. This is especially useful for users who prefer to give out their home phone number alone, instead of both the captioning service number and the toll-free captioning service number or for users who prefer to turn captions on and off anytime during the call. 2–Line captioned telephone can also be used with other relay services. For example, STS can be used with a 2–Line captioned telephone, for captioned telephone users with speech disabilities. 2–Line captioned telephone is only available to people in states that have 2–Line captioned telephone as part of their relay service or federal employees/contractors and American Indians.&lt;ref name="Authorized users of FR"&gt;{{Cite web

====Web-based captioned telephone====
Web-based captioned telephone enables telephone calls to be placed with captions, by utilizing the World Wide Web browser window of a computer or smart phone. It is similar to a traditional captioned phone call except the user's own telephone equipment is used, whilst the captions are viewed online instead of in the captioned telephone display screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.captel.com/webcaptel.php |title=CapTel - WebCapTel |accessdate=2007-01-29 |author= (Ultratec)|authorlink= |date=2006-05-08 |publisher=Ultratec, Inc. |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variations===
Many other call type variations are possible, including VCO to VCO, HCO to HCO, HCO to TTY, and VCO to TTY. Fundamentally, relay services have the ability to connect any two callers with different abilities over the telephone network. Voice callers in the United States can now access the service with a universal number: 711.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=711 for Telecommunications Relay Service |url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/711-telecommunications-relay-service |website=fcc.gov |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=22 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717122107/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/711-telecommunications-relay-service |archivedate=July 17, 2014 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the number is dialled, the caller will receive instructions to complete the call to reach deaf callers.

===IP relay service or Web-based text relay services===
IP relay services are also called Web-based text relay services in Europe. These services provide functionality similar to [[TDD/TTY]] relay services, replacing the telephone line and TDD/TTY devices with an Internet connection and software running on a computer or smartphone .

When using an IP relay service for an emergency call like [[9-1-1|911]] or [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]], the relay operator will ask for the street address, city, and state from which the call is originating. If this information is not provided then the relay operator will be unable to complete the emergency call.

Most IP relay services support many types of technologies, such as [[Web browser]], [[mobile phone]] app, [[text messaging]], [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Text over IP]] (ToIP). Support for many technologies has made it possible to use almost any generic connected device to use a relay service, such as a [[personal computer]], [[laptop]], [[mobile phone]], [[PDA]], or other device capable of utilizing the connection methods provided by an IP relay provider.

===Video relay service===
{{Main|Video Relay Service}}

Video relay service (VRS) allows people who use [[sign language]] to place phone calls by [[Manual communication|signing]] instead of typing.  The VI (video [[interpreter]]) uses a webcam or videophone to voice the deaf, hard-of-hearing or, speech-disabled person's signs to a hearing person and sign the hearing person's words to the deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired person.

===Video remote interpreting===
{{Main|Video Remote Interpreting}}

Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) allows deaf or hard-of-hearing people who use sign language to communicate with hearing people in the same room. VRI addresses one limitation to VRS, which is that VRS cannot be used if the hearing person is in the same room with the deaf or hard-of-hearing person. VRI has proven to be useful for deaf or hard-of-hearing people in business meetings, doctor appointments, minor surgical procedures, and court proceedings.

==Accessibility==
As much of the TRS system, particularly the Internet Relay Services, is open for public use; it is possible for anyone with the proper equipment to place calls. This includes people who are not members of the original intended user group, who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impaired. Some such users have noted its usefulness in making long-distance or local calls free of charge and without a telephone. Some providers have implemented long-distance billing, which bills long-distance calls just like a regular telephone. Providers defend the accessibility even to people who have neither hearing nor speech disabilities as a necessary evil. This is because the principle of "transparency" — the belief that the operator and the mechanics of relay should generally go as unnoticed as possible in the call — requires that relay be as easy to use as a normal telephone, which does not require any kind of verification for hearing people to use. Leaders in the deaf community defend this decision and generally retain strong support among service users with hearing and speech disabilities.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

==Fraudulent uses in the United States==
The open structure of relay services has led to a number of complaints regarding its use as a vehicle for fraud. In 2004, news outlets, such as [[MSNBC]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121104211527/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15937817/ns/nightly_news-nbc_news_investigates/&lt;/ref&gt;, and several newspapers, including the [[Baltimore City Paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Edward Erickson Jr. |title=After News Reports Reveal Widespread Fraud by Users of IP Relay Systems for the Deaf, Companies Mull Changes to the System |url=http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=7042 |publisher=City Paper |date=May 5, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324222337/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=7042 |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;, ran stories of reported abuse of the relay system, such as users from international locations calling businesses in the United States to fraudulently purchase goods. This has also generated numerous complaints, particularly by those who were employed as relay operators, that so-called "[[prank calls]]," where neither user requires the service and the caller is just attempting to have fun with a novel mode of communication. In December 2006, NBC ran another story&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraudwatchers.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-4475.html&lt;/ref&gt; where former operators alleged that "85 to 90 percent" of calls were scams.  Since it is illegal for relay service companies to keep records,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/guides/ip-relay-fraud&lt;/ref&gt; fraudulent users can operate with impunity. Fraudulent calls of both types have been cited as reasons for further relay regulation, and as causes for long hold times that must be endured by many legitimate users. Most businesses legally cannot have relay calls [[call blocking|blocked]] due to the need for legitimate users to be accommodated, although businesses that are repeatedly victimized by pranks and/or scams often stop trusting relay calls or hang up on them because it is difficult to distinguish legitimate users from illegitimate ones; this is another way that the abusers of the service ultimately victimize the legitimate users, in addition to tying up the service from them.

In 2006, the FCC launched a campaign to gather feedback from the various Internet Protocol relay-certified companies operating within the United States to fight the wave of relay scams and pranks being made over the service. As brought up in the FCC's released document,&lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-06-58A1.doc&lt;/ref&gt; users on the IP-based relay services can thus place their calls anonymously, which cannot certify that the user in question really needs operator assistance or not. Furthermore, fraudulent calls of any nature cost millions to the American people yearly (based on the $1.293 per minute fee&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/trs_history_docket.html TRS History Docket&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that is being paid for completed IP-based relay) to various relay providers for successfully completed calls.

Starting in November 2009, to help counter the problem of fraudulent use, the FCC began requiring all users of IP Relay to register their screen names with a default IP Relay provider.  This, along with many IP Relay providers working to educate hearing users of the risks of fraudulent users (making it less lucrative for fraudulent users who no longer have an uneducated population to target), and other efforts has greatly reduced the amount of fraudulent use of the IP Relay system.

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The specific accusations state that [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&amp;T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&amp;T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&amp;T’s call volume. The government’s complaint alleges that AT&amp;T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-civ-357.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Tricouni''' is the brand name of a metal nail used on [[Mountaineering boot|mountain climbing shoes]]. Widely used in the past by [[Mountaineering|mountain climbers]] and soldiers, it offers improved gripping on various surfaces. The Tricouni nail was invented in 1912 by a jeweler from [[Geneva]], Félix-Valentin Genecand, alias "Tricouni" (1878-1957).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.letempsarchives.ch/Default/Skins/LeTempsFr/Client.asp?Skin=LeTempsFr&amp;enter=true&amp;AW=1373144779843&amp;AppName=2 death notices]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (search "Tricouni n'est plus" (without quotation marks) on the ''Journal de Genève'', and access to the death notices of 21.01.1957),  and also his necrology in the ''SAC-Jahrbuch'': "Félix Genecand, genannt "Tricouni" (1878-1957), Louis Seylaz, p. 158 of the french version, or p. 159 of the german version". In the "brief biography" of the external links the indicated year of birth (1879) is incorrect: the ''SAC-Jahrbuch'' gives 1878, and the notice in the ''Journal de Genève'' recalls that he recently celebrated his 78th birthday. &lt;/ref&gt; Genecand was also a well known [[Alps|alpinist]] (several mountains were named after him: [[Mount Genecand]] in [[Antarctica]], [[Tricouni Peak]] in [[Canada]]). Tricouni nails are also referred to as hobnails, boot nails, cleats and shoe studs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smhc.co.uk/objects_item.asp?item_id=32421 | title=Boot nails and shoe studs | date=December 10, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2012 | author=Cooper, Hermione}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tricouni (Brand) | Tricouni]] is now the name of a British luxury fashion house, designing women’s luxury outerwear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9098">The '''turboencabulator''' or '''turbo-encabulator''' (and its later incarnations, the '''retroencabulator''' or '''retro-encabulator''' and '''Micro Encabulator''') is a fictional machine whose alleged existence became an [[in-joke]] and subject of professional humor among [[engineer]]s. The explanation of the supposed product makes extensive use of [[technobabble]].

The gag was popular for many years. The following quote is from the original ''Students’ Quarterly Journal'' article written by J. H. Quick in 1946.  The citation in the later ''Time'' article misspells several of the technical terms. ''General Electric'', ''Chrysler'' and ''Rockwell Automation'' use many of the same words.&lt;ref name="time1" /&gt;
{{quote|1=The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the "up" end of the grammeters.

==History==
[[Image:GE Turboencabulator pg 1.jpg|thumb|right|Page 1 of 1962 description of a turboencabulator "made" by GE]]
[[Image:GE Turboencabulator pg 2.jpg|thumb|right|Page 2 of 1962 description of a turboencabulator "made" by GE]]

The original technical description of the "turbo-encabulator" was written by British graduate student John Hellins Quick (1923-1991). It was published in 1944 by the [[British Institution of Electrical Engineers Students’ Quarterly Journal]] [in an article titled "The Turbo-Encabulator in Industry" by "J.H. Quick, Student"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5328648 ieeexplore.ieee.org]&lt;/ref&gt;] as also noted by consulting firm [[Arthur D. Little]] in a 1995 reprint of Quick's description, and giving Quick's full name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.com/uploads/tx_extprism/1995_q1_29.pdf adl.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written U.S. source may have been in 1946, in an [[Arthur D. Little Industrial Bulletin]]. An early popular American reference to the turbo-encabulator appeared in an article by New York lawyer Bernard Salwen in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on April 15, 1946. Part of Salwen's job was to review technical manuscripts. He was amused by the jargon and passed on the description from the Arthur D. Little pamphlet.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886972,00.html| title=For Nofer Trunnions| last=Salwen|first=Bernard| date=15 April 1946| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' got with the gag, featuring the device in a May 6, 1946 issue, described as "An adjunct to the turbo-encabulator, employed whenever a barescent skor motion is required."&lt;ref name="Time-May-6-1946"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886980,00.html|title=Letters, May 6, 1946|date=May 6, 1946|accessdate=March 8, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later a response to reader mail on the feature appeared in the June 3, 1946 issue:
{{quote|If the sackful of mail we have received from you is any indication, the story of "The Turbo-Encabulator in Industry" struck many a responsive chord. Aside from those of you who wanted to be reassured that TIME hadn't been taken in, we received the customary complaints about using too much technical jargon for the layman, observations such as "My husband says it sounds like a new motor; I say it sounds like a dictionary that has been struck by lightning"; suggestions that it "might have come out of the mouth of [[Danny Kaye]]," and plaintive queries like: "Is this good?" Wrote one bemused U.S. Navyman: "It'sh poshible." To some the turbo-encabulator sounded as though it would be a "wonderful machine for changing baby's diapers." A reader from Hoboken assumed that it would be on sale soon in Manhattan department stores. Many of you wrote in to thank us for illuminating what you have long wanted to tell your scientist friends."&lt;ref name="Time-June-3-1946"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,797787,00.html|title=Letters, Jun. 3, 1946|date=June 3, 1946|accessdate=March 8, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1962 a turboencabulator data sheet was created by engineers at [[General Electric]]'s Instrument Department, in [[West Lynn, Massachusetts]]. It quoted from the previous sources and was inserted into the General Electric Handbook.&lt;ref name="ge1"&gt;''[http://www.rfcafe.com/miscellany/humor/ge-turbo-encabulator.pdf Turboencabulator]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The turboencabulator data sheet had the same format as the other pages in the G.E. Handbook.  The engineers added "Shure Stat" in "Technical Features", which was peculiar only to the Instrument Department, and included the first known graphic representation of a "manufactured" Turboencabulator using parts made at the Instrument Department.

In {{Circa|1977}} [[Bud Haggart]], an actor who appeared in many industrial training films in and around Detroit, performed in the first film realization of the description and operation of the "Turboencabulator", using a truncated script adapted from Quick's article.  Bud convinced director Dave Rondot and the film crew to stay after the filming of an actual [[GMC Trucks]] project training film to realize the Turboencabulator spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

In {{Circa|1988}} the former [[Chrysler Corporation]] "manufactured" the Turboencabulator in a video spoof, with Haggart reprising his role from the GM film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

The '''Ursa tension leg platform''' is an oil platform with a [[Tension-leg platform|tension leg]] structure located at {{coord|28.154027|-89.103553}} about {{convert|130|mi|km}} southeast of [[New Orleans]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  It is operated by [[Shell Oil Company]]. It has a total height from the seabed to its top of {{convert|4285|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/ursa/ |title=Ursa |publisher=Offshore Technology |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shell Oil Company|Shell Oil]] is the operator of the project with 45.39%. [[BP|BP Exploration &amp; Production Inc]] has 22.69% while [[Exxon Mobil|Exxon Mobil Corp]] and [[ConocoPhillips]] each have 15.96%.

The discovery well was drilled in 1991, with [[Sonat|Sonat's]] Discoverer Seven Seas [[drillship]], on Mississippi Canyon block 854. Construction was finished in 1998.

The Ursa Tension Leg Platform was replaced as the tallest man-made structure in the world by the [[Magnolia Tension-leg Platform]].

A '''vajazzle''' (also spelled '''vagazzle''') is a form of genital decoration, formed by the application of crystal ornaments on the shaved [[mons pubis]] of a woman. The process is known as '''vajazzling''', a [[portmanteau]] of "[[vagina]]" and "bedazzle". The phenomenon was popularized by actress [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], who devoted a chapter in her book ''[[The Day I Shot Cupid]]'' to vajazzling.&lt;ref name="Hewitt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Love Hewitt|title=The Day I Shot Cupid: Hello, My Name Is Jennifer Love Hewitt and I'm a Love-aholic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2eQ0T3ZCUpYC|date=23 March 2010|publisher=Voice|isbn=978-1-4013-4112-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a promotional interview on a US talk show in January 2010, she encouraged the female members of her audience "to vajazzle their vajayjays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/13/jennifer-love-hewitt-beda_n_421751.html|title=Jennifer Love Hewitt Bedazzled Her Privates (VIDEO)|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2010-03-18|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vajazzle became the most searched term on Google for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2808541/Jennifer-Love-Hewitt-vagazzles-her-lady-bits.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Cara | last=Lee | title=Jen 'vagazzles' her lady bits |date=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the concept was popularized when beautician [[Amy Childs]] appeared in the television show ''[[The Only Way Is Essex]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amy Childs - 100% Me|first=Amy|last=Childs|year=2015|publisher=Bonnier Publishing Ltd|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dWcmCwAAQBAJ|isbn=9781910536483}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, an Internet [[rating site]] for vajazzling called Rate My Vajazzle had been set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vajazzing and Pejazzling: Tall Glass of Shame|date=26 May 2011|website=Fierce and Nerdy|url=http://fierceandnerdy.com/vajazzling-and-pejazzling-tall-glass-of-shame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotion Online: Theorizing Affect on the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiZvBAAAQBAJ|first1=J.|last1=Garde-Hansen|first2=K.|last2=Gorton|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781137312877|chapter=Chapter 6: The Hate and Shame of Women's Bodies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
