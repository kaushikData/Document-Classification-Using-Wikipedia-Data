The '''2013 Singapore cyberattacks''' were a series of [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] attacks initiated by the [[hacktivist]] organisation [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], represented by a member known by the online handle "The Messiah". The cyber attacks were partly in response to web censorship regulations in the country, specifically on news outlets.  On 12 November 2013, James Raj was charged in Singapore court as the alleged "The Messiah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/suspected-messiah-hacker-charged-court|title=Suspected ‘Messiah’ hacker charged in court|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 1 June, a new set of web censorship regulations drafted by the [[Media Development Authority]] became effective in Singapore. Under the new rules, &lt;blockquote&gt;websites with at least 50,000 unique visitors from Singapore every month that publish at least one local news article per week over a period of two months ... will have to remove 'prohibited content' such as articles that undermine 'racial or religious harmony' within 24 hours of being notified by Singapore's media regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[AsiaOne]]|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/digital1/singapore-threatened-over-internet-freedom|title=Singapore threatened by "Anonymous" hacker group|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During the introduction of these new rules, government officials stated that they "do not impinge on internet freedom".&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1345309/anonymous-newspaper-hack-puts-singapore-alert|title=Anonymous activists hack Singapore newspaper over internet freedom|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a hacker group called Anonymous thought differently and during October 31, they released a video stating their threats against the Singaporean government for their new legislation "restricting Internet freedom with its new Internet framework".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.challenge.gov.sg/print/feature/after-the-cyber-attacks|title=After the Cyber Attacks|last=Magazine|first=Challenge|website=www.challenge.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
[[File:Anonymous-hacked-straits-times-blog-post.jpg|thumbnail|300px|The hacked version of Irene Tham's [[The Straits Times]] blog]]
Following his hack attack on the [[PAP Community Foundation|People's Action Party's Community Foundation's]] webpage, Anonymous member The Messiah hacked into the official website of the [[Ang Mo Kio|Ang Mo Kio Town Council]], to exemplify the fact that it was very vulnerable to cyber attacks. Site administrators were quick to lock the site and a police report was made.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yahoo!|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/ang-mo-kio-town-council-website-hacked-102124881.html|title=Police investigating Ang Mo Kio Town Council website hacking|date=28 October 2013|last=Tan|first=Jeanette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upset with "the Government's new licensing rules imposed on websites", a purported member of Anonymous went on to upload a four-minute-long video on YouTube, in which he, wearing the signature [[Guy Fawkes]] mask, threatened to "bring down key infrastructure in Singapore".&lt;ref name="ST 1"/&gt; He also urged Singaporeans to don red and black on 5 November, as well as black out their Facebook profile pictures. In the video, he made reference to The Messiah, who he called "one of [Anonymous'] comrades".&lt;ref name="ST 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|url=http://www.stasiareport.com/the-big-story/asia-report/singapore/story/singapore-government-agencies-alert-after-hackers-threaten|title=Singapore government agencies on alert after hackers threaten attacks|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Straits Times]]'' news reporter Irene Tham decided to post a critique of The Messiah's video on her blog on the newspaper's official website. The hacker then hit back by hacking into the blog, defacing the report's title with the words "Dear ST [Straits Times]: You just got hacked for misleading the people!". In justification, The Messiah opined that Tham had misconstrued his speech. He also noted that Tham "conveniently modif[ied] the sentence 'war against the Singapore government' into 'war against Singapore'." He enjoined Tham to either apologise within two days or resign from her job, to atone for her "blasphemous lies".&lt;ref name="CNA 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/anonymous-hacker-targets/870412.html|title="Anonymous" hacker targets Straits Times website|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, in an email to [[Yahoo|Yahoo Singapore]], The Messiah said &lt;blockquote&gt;we reached out to our comrades from other fractions [sic] who together with us performed [[DNS poisoning]] on the .gov.sg sites, taking them down for a period of time. But there must have also been some patching that was done as some of our favourite point of entries into their networks seemed to be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hacker 'The Messiah' claims attack on Singapore govt sites, repeats 'Anonymous' cyber threat|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/hacker--the-messiah--claims-attack-on-singapore-govt-sites--repeats-%E2%80%98anonymous%E2%80%99-cyber-threat-090023141.html|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=Yahoo! News Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 3 November, the website of the [[Seletar Airport]] was hacked. Its webpage replaced with a black and green background with an image in the middle resembling a skull wearing a hood. The site resumed normal operations 30 minutes after the hack was first noticed.&lt;ref name="CNA 2"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/seletar-airport-website/873144.html|title=Seletar Airport website hacked|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of Singaporean entertainer Ridhwan Azman were hacked. According to posts from the compromised account, this was in retaliation for "dissing the legion". Apart from this incident, Anonymous did not carry out any other major activity, contrary to its promise to ignite a massive protest on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Techinasia|url=http://www.techinasia.com/singapore-movie-actor-disses-anonymous-hacked-twitter/|title=Singapore movie actor disses Anonymous, gets hacked on Twitter|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, the hacktivists, Mohammad Azhar Bin Tahir and Mohammad Asyiq Bin Tahir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Business Times|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singaporean-jailed-for-hacking-prime-ministers-office-website|title=Singaporean jailed for hacking Prime Minister's office website|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, hacked into and vandalised a subpage on the website of Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]], following Lee's vow to bring The Messiah and his accomplices to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yahoo!|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-pms-website-hacked-anonymous-175123528.html|title=Singapore PM's website hacked by Anonymous|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the webpage of [[Istana (Singapore)|the Istana]] was also hacked by Copycats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Channel News Asia]]|url=http://healthticket.blogspot.com/2013/11/subpages-on-pm-lees-and-istana-websites.html|title=Subpages on PM Lee's and Istana websites compromised|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November, the websites of 13 schools, which were hosted on a single server, were reportedly defaced between 3:30pm to 5pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Channel News Asia]]|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/websites-of-13-schools/893806.html|title=Websites of 13 schools defaced|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
News of the cyberattacks were picked up by disparate news outlets from around the world, including the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'',&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheney|first=Satish|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/singapore-strait-times-hacked-anonymous_n_4188248.html|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=Singapore's Straits Times Allegedly Hacked By Anonymous|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Time|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/01/hacker-group-anonymous-targets-singapore-with-cyber-attack-over-censorship/|title=Hacker Group Anonymous Targets Singapore with Cyber Attack Over Censorship|date=1 November 2013|last=Stout|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/11/02/spore-straits-times-hack.aspx|title=Singapore Straits Times website hacked by Anonymous for alleged misreporting|first=Yiliang|last=Tan|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]]|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/01/singapore-govt-alert-after-hackers-threaten-attacks.html|title=Singapore govt on alert after hackers threaten attacks|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the hacking of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council's website, Member of Parliament [[Ang Hin Kee]] dubbed it as "malicious", promising to boost the page's security system.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1"/&gt;

After the release of the YouTube video, the Government IT Security Incident Response Team immediately released an alert to all the Singaporean government agencies. The [[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore]] responded in an official statement, "We are aware of the video, and the police are investigating the matter."&lt;ref name="ST 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24768053|title='Anonymous' hack Singapore newspaper's website|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Singapore Press Holdings]] (SPH), of which ''The Straits Times'' is a subsidiary, promptly took down the blog which was hacked into and filed a complaint to the police.&lt;ref name="CNA 1"/&gt;

Singaporean politician and Deputy Chairman of Singapore's Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, [[Baey Yam Keng]], offered, "We do not know what the hacker's capabilities are, so it's important for us to take this very seriously." Bertha Henson, who operates [[Breakfast Network]], a Singaporean news outlet, felt that The Messiah's action would "make the government seem right, that we [independent website operators] are just troublemakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=First Post|url=http://www.firstpost.com/tech/anonymous-hacks-singapore-newspaper-straits-times-1206475.html|title=Anonymous hacks Singapore newspaper Straits Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst observing counter-terrorism drill Exercise Highcrest, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged to hunt down the team responsible for the cyberattack, stating, "It is not a laughing matter. It's not just anything goes, and you're anonymous, therefore there's no responsibility. You may think you are anonymous. We will make that extra effort to find out who you are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Channel News Asia]]|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/govt-will-spare-no-effort/876922.html|title=Govt will spare no effort to bring cyber-attackers to justice: PM Lee|last=Loh|first=Dylan|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''468 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Barbatus and Priscus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 286 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 468 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''A Low Hum''' is the ongoing project founded by photographer and music impresario Blink (born [[Ian Jorgensen]]), and is based in [[Wellington, New Zealand]]. Under the umbrella A LOW HUM, Blink organises tours, releases records, makes music videos, organises one-off events/festivals and publishes magazines and books. As of 2009, A Low Hum has organised and supported tours for over seventy musical acts from New Zealand, USA, Australia and beyond.

In 2006, tours occurred every month and comprised between two and four rising Kiwi bands who played venues and gigs in about a dozen New Zealand locales along the way. In conjunction with each tour, A Low Hum published an A5 magazine, usually including a feature album or EP (often unreleased material by bands) and a music compilation CD with songs by local and international acts.

In 2006, A Low Hum also began publishing "Local Knowledge", a comprehensive guide for bands wanting to tour New Zealand and engage with the music industry.

In 2007, A Low Hum entered new territory as the producer of a major new live music festival, ''Camp A Low Hum'' (CALH), held on a large rural campsite close to [[Wainuiomata]], 30 minutes drive north of Wellington. Attended by an intimate 350 campers, 49 bands performed 3, 4 and 5 February . In 2008 the festival spanned a total of four days featuring over 60 bands and doubling in audience numbers to around 700, according to Blink, the maximum capacity. The 2009 event sold out a month before the event, though capacity was limited to only 800 people. The 2010 event has been renamed ''Campus A Low Hum'' and has relocated to an unused agricultural college outside the town of Bulls in the North Island. Regarding changes to the format of the festival, Blink has said: &lt;blockquote&gt;
I have retained everything that was special about the Camp A Low Hum philosophy: intimate performances, small crowds, multiple environments, renegade performances, no band announcements, multiple performances by bands, spontaneous party action – and taken it bak 2 skool and added a whole bunch of new concepts to make it a brand new experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alowhum.com/camp-a-low-hum/ |title=A Low Hum &amp;#124; Calh |publisher=Alowhum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, after having released music for a few years in conjunction with its magazine, A Low Hum ventured further into the territories of a traditional record label by starting a monthly subscription-based CDR singles club and releasing albums by local New Zealand artists, [[Disasteradio]], [[Over the Atlantic]] and [[The Enright House]].

in 2008, A Low Hum released a trilogy of free digital download EPs by up and coming NZ recordings artists; Secret Knives, Mount Pleasant and Red Steers

In 2009 Blink from A Low Hum tour managed Disasteradio around the World as well as worked on the next phase of his music festival series, renamed to '''Campus A Low Hum'''

In 2010 Blink is working on a documentary of the first three Camps, and is working on the follow-up to his 2006 book "Local Knowledge"
April 2010, As reported by the Creative Freedom Foundation, A Low Hum announced it has ditched CDs for future releases and is planning on mainly only releasing Mp3s with accompanying artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713005424/http://creativefreedom.org.nz/2010/04/a-low-hum-ditches-cds-in-favour-of-artwork-wmp3s/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Blink released his follow-up to "Local Knowledge", titled "D.I.Y Touring the World" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.alowhum.com/diy-touring-the-world.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The print edition is sold out, but the digital edition is still available from the A Low Hum website.

In November 2011, A Low Hum organised and promoted the Flying Nun 30th Anniversary celebrations with 30 huge shows across the country in one month. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/utr/more/NID/4311/Flying-Nun-Announce-More-30th-Anniversary-Shows.utr&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 to 2014 Blink ran Wellington live music venue "Puppies" which was on the corner of Tory and Vivian Streets. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/blogs/blog-on-the-tracks/8679429/In-praise-of-Puppies&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, A Low Hum ran "Square Wave Festival", an electronic music festival &lt;ref&gt;https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nat-music/audio/2576616/squarewave-festival&lt;/ref&gt; featuring 70 artists &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmdyBpuNsu8&lt;/ref&gt; playing 30 shows throughout New Zealand in 6 venues throughout November&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/7248/Square-Wave-Festival-Lineup-Announced.utr&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 after closing Puppies, Blink, now returning to using his birth name released another book titled "The Problem with Music in New Zealand and How To Fix It and Why I started and ran Puppies" &lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/6xjkn6/the-music-scene-according-to-blink&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/8412/Book-Review-The-Problem-With-Music-in-New-Zealand.utr&lt;/ref&gt;, the book received widespread&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alowhum.com/reviews1.html&lt;/ref&gt; press in NZ and one of the essays bought about a response from APRA/AMCOS NZ who published their response on their website. &lt;ref&gt;http://apraamcos.co.nz/news/2014/july/apra-amcos-response/&lt;/ref&gt;

After eight such festivals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/collections/u/music-festivals-and-events/camp-a-low-hum&lt;/ref&gt;, in 2014, A Low Hum finished Camp A Low Hum with a final event &lt;ref&gt;http://lumiere.net.nz/index.php/camp-a-low-hum-an-obituary/&lt;/ref&gt; at Camp Wainui in Wainuiomata, Wellington &lt;ref&gt;http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/one-last-trip-to-camp-a-low-hum&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander of Abonoteichus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀβωνοτειχίτης}} ''Alexandros ho Abonoteichites''), also called '''Alexander the Paphlagonian''' ({{circa|105|170}} CE), was a [[Greece|Greek]] mystic and [[oracle]], and the founder of the [[Glycon]] cult that briefly achieved wide popularity in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] world. The contemporary writer [[Lucian of Samosata|Lucian]] reports that he was an utter fraud – the god Glycon was supposedly constructed out of a glove puppet. The vivid narrative of his career given by Lucian might be taken as fictitious but for the corroboration of certain coins of the emperors [[Lucius Verus]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrma Nummorum veterum'', ii. pp. 383, 384&lt;/ref&gt; and of a statue of Alexander, said by [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] to have stood in the forum of [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexander the Paphlagonian|volume=1|page=567}} This cites:

Lucian describes him as having swindled many people and engaged, through his followers, in various forms of thuggery.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander the False Prophet," translated with annotation by A. M. Harmon, Loeb Classical Library, 1936. [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of Lucian's venom against Alexander is attributed to Alexander's hate of the [[Epicureans]]. Lucian admired the works of [[Epicurus]], a eulogy of which concludes the piece, and whether or not Alexander was the master of fraud and deceit as portrayed by Lucian, he may not have been too different from other oracles of the age, when a great deal of dishonest exploitation occurred in some shrines.&lt;ref name=nutall&gt;Nuttall Costa, Charles Desmond, ''Lucian: Selected Dialogues'', p. 129, Oxford University Press (2005), 0-199-25867-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Not much is known about the early life of Alexander. He apparently worked in travelling medicine shows around Greece and might have been a prophet of the goddess [[Soi (goddess)|Soi]] or a follower of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]. In Lucian, his partner in profession is given as one Cocconas of [[Byzantium]]. After a period of instruction in medicine by a doctor who also, according to Lucian, was an impostor, in about 150 CE he established an oracle of Aesculapius at his native town of [[Abonoteichus]] (''femin''.: Ἀβωνότειχος; later [[Ionopolis]]), on the [[Euxine]], where he gained riches and great prestige by professing to heal the sick and reveal the future.&lt;ref&gt;Masson, John, ''Lucretius, Epicurean and Poet'', pp. 339-340, John Murray (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CatholicEnc&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before 160 CE Alexander formed a cult around the worship of a new snake-god, Glycon, and headquartered it in Abonoteichus. Having circulated a prophecy that the son of [[Apollo]] was to be born again, he contrived that there should be found in the foundations of the temple to [[Aesculapius]], then in course of construction at Abonoteichus, an egg in which a small live [[snake]] had been placed. In an age of superstition no people had so great a reputation for credulity as the Paphlagonians, and Alexander had little difficulty in convincing them of the second coming of the god under the name of Glycon. A large tame snake with a false human head, wound round Alexander's body as he sat in a shrine in the temple,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurther, David, ''Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of the Category of Macician'', in Schäfer, Peter and Kippenberg, Hans Gerhard, ''Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium'', p. 115, BRILL (1997), {{ISBN|90-04-05432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave "autophones", or oracles unasked.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The numerous questions asked of the oracle were answered by Alexander in metrical predictions. In his most prosperous year he is said to have delivered nearly 80,000 replies, concerning bodily, mental, and social afflictions, for each of which he received a [[drachma]] and two [[Obolus|oboli]].&lt;ref name=CatholicEnc /&gt;

Healing instructions were commonly combined with [[oracle]]s, but Alexander did more; he instituted [[mystery cult|mysteries]] like those of [[Eleusis]]. Through the cult Alexander achieved a certain level of political influence – his daughter married [[Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus]], the governor of the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. He found believers from [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] to [[Rome]] through pretended arts of soothsaying and magic and was revered and consulted as a prophet by many notable individuals of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Neander, Johann August W, ''General history of the Christian religion and Church'' (1850), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Antonine Plague|plague of 166]] a verse from the oracle was used as an [[amulet]] and was inscribed over the doors of houses as a protection and an oracle was sent, at [[Marcus Aurelius]]' request, by Alexander to the Roman army on the [[Danube]] [[Marcomannic Wars|during the war]] with the [[Marcomanni]], declaring that victory would follow on the throwing of two lions alive into the river. The result was a great disaster and Alexander had recourse to the old quibble of the [[Delphic oracle]] to [[Croesus]] for an explanation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His main opponents were [[Epicurean]]s and [[Early Christianity|Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergurson, Everett, ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity'', p. 218, (2003), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8028-2221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian's account of Alexander represents the Christians—along with the Epicureans—as the special enemies and as the principal objects of his hate: Epicureans had too little religion or superstition to give in to a religious pretender; and the Christian faith was too deep-rooted to dream of any communion with Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Rainy, Robert D. D., ''The Ancient Catholic Church: From the Accession of Trajan to the Fourth General Council, (A.D. 98-451)'', p. 32, Charles Scribner's Sons (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucian's own close investigations into Alexander's methods of fraud led to a serious attempt on his life. The whole account gives a graphic description of the inner working of one among the many new oracles that were springing up at this period. Alexander had remarkable beauty and the striking personality of the successful charlatan, and must have been a man of considerable intellectual abilities and power of organization. His usual methods were those of the numerous oracle-mongers of the time, of which Lucian gives a detailed account: the opening of sealed inquiries by heated needles, a neat plan of forging broken seals, and the giving of vague or meaningless replies to difficult questions, coupled with a lucrative blackmailing of those whose inquiries were compromising.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Alexander died of [[gangrene]] of the leg in his seventieth year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Modern scholarship ==
Scholars have described Alexander as an oracle who perpetrated a hoax to deceive gullible citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: A Critical Edition'', p. 175, Oxford University Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-19-825060-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Marmin W., ''The Ancient Mysteries: A Sourcebook'', p. 43, University of Pennsylvania Press (1999), {{ISBN|0-8122-1692-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a [[false prophet]] and charlatan who played on the hopes of simple people. He was said to have "made predictions, discovered fugitive slaves, detected thieves and robbers, caused treasures to be dug up, healed the sick, and in some cases actually raised the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander the False Prophet'', ch. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Stephen A. Kent]], in a study of the text, compares Lucian's Alexander to the "[[malignant narcissist]]" in modern psychiatric theory, and suggests that the "behaviors" described by Lucian "have parallels with several modern cult leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Kent. "Narcissistic Fraud in the Ancient World: Lucian's Account of Alexander of Abonoteichus and the Cult of Glycon," ''Ancient Narrative'' (University of Groningen), Vol. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Freckelton has noted at least a surface similarity between Alexander and [[David Berg]], the leader of a contemporary religious group, the [[Family International|Children of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Freckelton. "'Cults' Calamities and Psychological Consequences," ''Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'', 5(1), pp. 1-46. {{DOI|10.1080/13218719809524918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemistry ==
αMT is tryptamine with a [[methyl]] [[substituent]] at the [[alpha carbon]]. This alpha substitution makes it a relatively poor [[Substrate (chemistry)#Biochemistry|substrate]] for [[monoamine oxidase A]], thereby prolonging αMT's half-life, allowing it to reach the brain and enter the central nervous system. Its chemical relation to tryptamine is analogous to that of [[amphetamine]] to [[phenethylamine]], amphetamine being α-methylphenethylamine. αMT is closely related to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] (5-hydroxytryptamine) which partially explains its [[mechanism of action]].

==Synthesis==
The synthesis of αMT can be accomplished through several different routes, the two most widely known being the Nitroaldol Condensation between [[indole-3-carboxaldehyde]] and [[nitroethane]] under [[ammonium acetate]] catalysis and the condensation between indole-3-acetone and [[hydroxylamine]] followed by reduction of the obtained ketoxime with [[lithium aluminum hydride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shulgin|first1=Alexander|title=TIHKAL|url=https://erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal48.shtml|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pharmacology ==
αMT acts as a relatively balanced [[reuptake inhibitor]] and [[releasing agent]] of the main three [[monoamines]]; [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]],&lt;ref name="pmid17223101"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai F, Nonaka R, Satoh Hisashi Kamimura K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 132–7 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(06)01381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a non-[[binding selectivity|selective]] [[serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]].&lt;ref name="pmid18057721"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nonaka R, Nagai F, Ogata A, Satoh K | title = In vitro screening of psychoactive drugs by [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in rat brain membranes | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 2328–33 |date=December 2007 | pmid = 18057721 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.30.2328| url = http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.2328?from=PubMed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MAOI activity===
αMT has been shown as a [[reversible reaction|reversible]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) ''[[in-vitro]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Arai | first1 = Y. | last2 = Toyoshima | first2 = Y. | last3 = Kinemuchi | first3 = H. | doi = 10.1254/jjp.41.191 | title = Studies of monoamine oxidase and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase.

In rats the potency of αMT as an MAO-A inhibitor in the brain was approximately equal to that of [[harmaline]] at equimolar doses.{{refn|group=note|MAOI potency was comparable at 7 µM/kg, equivalent to 1.5mg/kg of Harmaline and 1.2mg/kg of αMT. At 70µM/kg αMT was a much less effective MAOI than harmaline.&lt;ref name=alkylated&gt;{{Cite journal

A typical dose of harmaline for MAO inhibition is 150&amp;nbsp;mg,&lt;ref name=tihkal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal13.shtml |title=Shulgin, A (1997) ''TIHKAL'' |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  higher than any typical αMT dose&lt;ref name='erowid dose'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt_dose.shtml | title = AMT Dosage | accessdate = 2013-10-16 | date = 2011-02-02 | publisher = [[Erowid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; so αMT's MAOI activity at typical doses will be significant but not total. The danger rises exponentially as αMT doses approach 150&amp;nbsp;mg due to increased monoamine release and increased MAO inhibition.{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

== Dosage and effects ==

With 20–30 milligrams, [[euphoria]], [[empathy]], and [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] effects become apparent and can last as long as 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilcox | first1 = J. | title = Psychoactive Properties of Alpha-Methyltryptamine: Analysis from Self Reports of Users | doi = 10.1080/02791072.2012.704592 | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 274–276 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23061328| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dose exceeding 40&amp;nbsp;mg is generally considered as strong.

Reported [[side effect]]s include [[anxiety]], restlessness, [[muscle tension]], [[trisma|jaw tightness]], [[pupil dilation]], [[tachycardia]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]], among other effects that might commonly be attributed to [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[MDMA]], such as open-eye visuals, closed eye visuals and an altered state of mind.&lt;ref name="urlErowid Online Books : TIHKAL - #48 a-MT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlErowid AMT Vault : Effects"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt_effects.shtml | title = Erowid AMT Vault : Effects | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of some reported experiential similarities to MDMA, the chemicals are structurally unrelated; αMT is a tryptamine while MDMA is a [[phenethylamine]].

Like many other [[serotonin releasing agent]]s, αMT's analogue [[Alpha-Ethyltryptamine|αET]] has been shown to produce long-lasting serotonergic neurotoxicity at very high doses.&lt;ref name="pmid1722753"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang XM, Johnson MP, Nichols DE | title = Reduction in brain serotonin markers by alpha-ethyltryptamine (Monase) | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 200 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–90 |date=July 1991 | pmid = 1722753 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(91)90686-K| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that αMT could cause the same neurotoxicity.

'''''Anne and Emmett''''' is a play by American [[Janet Langhart|Janet Langhart Cohen]]. It explores an imaginary conversation between [[Emmett Till]], an African American, and [[Anne Frank]], a German Jew, which takes place in ''Memory,'' a non-specific afterlife or alternate dimension. They were killed as young teenagers because of racial persecution. The play recounts the lives of the Till and Frank, comparing and contrasting the events in their lives and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anneandemmett.com/play/synopsis |title=Synopsis &amp;#124; Anne &amp; Emmett |publisher=Anneandemmett.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707144435/http://anneandemmett.com/play/synopsis| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hacking}}
'''Anonymous''' is a  [[decentralization|decentralized]] international [[hacktivist]] group that is widely known for its various [[DDoS]] [[cyber attacks]] against several [[governments]], government institutions and [[government agency|government agencies]], [[corporations]], and the [[Church of Scientology]].

Anonymous originated in 2003 on the [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an [[anarchy|anarchic]], digitized [[global brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/AnonymousWorldvoce|title=Anonymous Official|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |publisher=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |title=Serious Business: Anonymous Takes On Scientology (and Doesn't Afraid of Anything) |last=Landers |first=Chris |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |archivedate=June 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Oltsik | title = Edward Snowden Beyond Data Security | date = December 3, 2013 | url = http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/84381 |publisher=Network World | accessdate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous members (known as &lt;em&gt;Anons&lt;/em&gt;) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rosie | last = Waites | title = V for Vendetta masks: Who | date = October 20, 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate = October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may not always be the case as some of the collective prefer to instead cover their face without using the well-known mask as a disguise. Some anons also opt to mask their voices through [[voice changer]]s or [[text-to-speech]] programs.

In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized [[online community]] acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal and primarily focused on entertainment (or [[lulz]]). Beginning with [[Project Chanology]] in 2008—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the [[Church of Scientology]]—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]; and corporations such as [[PayPal]], [[MasterCard]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], and [[Sony]]. Anons have publicly supported [[WikiLeaks]] and the [[Occupy movement]]. Related groups [[LulzSec]] and [[Operation AntiSec]] carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities.  Some actions by members of the group have been described as being [[Anti-zionism|anti-Zionist]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the U.S., U.K., Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, India, and Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters"&lt;ref name="Krupnick"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_18686764 |title=Freedom fighters or vandals?

Internal dissent is also a regular feature of the group.{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p = 1678}} A website associated with the group describes it as "an Internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives".{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p = 1678}} [[Gabriella Coleman]] writes of the group: "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't even bother to leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/what-its-like-to-participate-in-anonymous-actions/67860/ |title=What It's Like to Participate in Anonymous' Actions |author=Coleman, Gabriella |date=December 10, 2010 |work=The Atlantic |publisher= |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GJw0WdUd?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/what-its-like-to-participate-in-anonymous-actions/67860/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet censorship and control and the majority of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Arab Spring]].{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p = 1682}} Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 92}}

Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. [[Parmy Olson]] and others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; Olson writes, "There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt."{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 58–59}} Some members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = x}} Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective;{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p = 1679}} British journalist

The group's few rules include not disclosing one's identity, not talking about the group, and not attacking media.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 7}} Members commonly use the tagline "We are Anonymous.

=== 4chan raids (2003–2007) ===
{{main article|4chan}}
&lt;!--DO NOT mention any names of living individuals unless they were EXPLICITLY stated in the Fox 11 report per [[WP:BLP]]--&gt;
[[File:Anonymous Fox 11.jpg|thumb|[[KTTV]] Fox 11 investigative report on Anonymous. The report focused on what were then contemporary instances of Internet bullying by Anonymous.&lt;ref name="foxnewsanonreport" /&gt;]]
The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on [[imageboard]]s, particularly the /b/ board of [[4chan]], dedicated to random content. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a "Forced_Anon" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 28}} As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an [[Internet meme]].&lt;ref name="whipple"&gt;{{cite news|last=Whipple |first=Tom |title=Scientology: the Anonymous protesters. |work=The Times |location=UK |date=June 20, 2008 |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163346/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users of 4chan's /b/ board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids. In a raid on July 12, 2006, for example, large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site [[Habbo Hotel]] with identical avatars; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the digital hotel's pool, stating it was "closed due to fail and AIDS".{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 49}} Future LulzSec member [[Topiary (hacktivist)|Topiary]] became involved with the site at this time, inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via [[Skype]].{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 48}}{{efn|Topiary was later revealed to be Jake Davis, a teenager living in the [[Shetland Islands]] of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34661100.html |title=Two-year term for Shetland hacker |date=May 17, 2013 |work=The Herald |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Due to the growing traffic on 4chan's boards, users soon began to plot pranks offline using [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC).{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 50–52}} These raids resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous, a report by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] station [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, California in the U.S. The report called the group "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and an "Internet hate machine".&lt;ref name="foxnewsanonreport"&gt;{{cite news|author=Shuman, Phil |title=FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous{{'-}} |url=http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=3894628&amp;version=7&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1 |publisher=[[KTTV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) |work=MyFOX Los Angeles |date=July 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522123812/http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=3894628&amp;version=7&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1 |archivedate=May 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 57–58}}

=== Encyclopedia Dramatica (2004–present) ===
{{main article|Encyclopedia Dramatica}}
Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DiGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to [[livejournal]], but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for parody and other purposes.&lt;ref name="assclown" /&gt; The [[not safe for work]] site celebrates a [[Counterculture|subversive]] "[[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] culture", and documents [[Internet memes]], [[cyberculture|culture]], and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, "raids", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of [[Internet communities]] that are accused of [[self-censorship]] in order to gain prestige or positive coverage from traditional and [[Old media|established media outlets]]. Journalist [[Julian Dibbell]] described Encyclopædia Dramatica as the site "where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend."&lt;ref name="assclown"&gt;{{citation | last = Dibbell | first = Julian | title = The Assclown Offensive: How to Enrage the Church of Scientology | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology?currentPage=all | publisher = Wired Magazine | accessdate= November 27, 2009 | date = September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also played a role in the anti-[[Scientology]] campaign of [[Project Chanology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Julian |last=Dibbell |date=2008-07-11 |chapter=Sympathy for the Griefer: MOOrape, Lulz Cubes, and Other Lessons From the First 2 Decades of Online Sociopathy |title=GLS Conference 4.0 |publisher=Games, Learning and Society Group |location=Madison, Wisconsin |url=http://hosted4.mediasite.com/mediasite/Viewer/?peid=9d1cf257-52ff-4704-9cb5-37de2ecca35b |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064724/http://hosted4.mediasite.com/mediasite/Viewer/?peid=9d1cf257-52ff-4704-9cb5-37de2ecca35b |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }} Project Chanology "mention" begins approximately 27:45 minutes into the presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Chanology (2008) ===
{{main article|Project Chanology}}
[[File:Message to Scientology.ogv|thumb|300px|"[[Message to Scientology]]", January 21, 2008]]
Anonymous first became associated with [[hacktivism]]{{efn|A portmanteau of "hacking" and "activism"}} in 2008 following a series of actions against the [[Church of Scientology]] known as Project Chanology. On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog [[Gawker]] posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] praised the religion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D8U6KGQG0.html |title=Cruise bio hits stores as video clip of actor praising Scientology makes it way to Internet |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church responded with a [[cease-and-desist letter]] for violation of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15129123.html |title=Tom Cruise's Scary Movie; In Church Promo, the Scientologist Is Hard to Suppress |author=Tucker, Neely |date=January 18, 2008 |work=Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending [[black fax]]es designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching [[DDoS]] attacks against its websites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 63–65}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-174076065.html |title=Fair game; Scientology |date=February 2, 2008 |work=The Economist |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DDoS attacks were at first carried out with the [[Gigaloader]] and [[JMeter]] applications. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead to a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their [[IP address]]es.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 71–72, 122, 124, 126–29}} Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 206}}&lt;ref name="Anon1012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/anonymous-101-part-deux/all/ |title=Anonymous 101 Part Deux: Morals Triumph Over Lulz |author=Norton, Quinn |date=December 30, 2011 |work=Wired |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNd5B6lC?url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/anonymous-101-part-deux/all/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Payback (2010) ===
By the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased. A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called "moralfags" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls).{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 93–94}} By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 102}}

In September 2010, however, Anons became aware of [[Aiplex Software]], an Indian software company that contracted with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites used by copyright infringers, such as [[The Pirate Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11371315 |title=Activists target recording industry websites |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 27, 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 102}} Coordinating through IRC, Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex's website for a day. Primarily using LOIC, the group then targeted the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), successfully bringing down both sites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 103}} On September 19, future LulzSec member Mustafa Al-Bassam (known as "Tflow") and other Anons hacked the website of Copyright Alliance, an anti-infringement group, and posted the name of the operation: "Payback Is A Bitch", or "Operation Payback" for short.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 104}} Anons also issued a press release, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another.

In November 2010, the organization [[WikiLeaks]] began releasing [[United States diplomatic cables leak|hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]]. In the face of legal threats against the organization by the U.S. government, [[Amazon.com]] booted WikiLeaks from its servers, and [[PayPal]], [[MasterCard]], and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] cut off service to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11935539 |title=Anonymous hacktivists say Wikileaks war to continue |date=December 9, 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 3, 2013 |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GLEmtNFt?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11935539 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Payback then expanded to include "Operation Avenge [[Julian Assange|Assange]]", and Anons issued a press release declaring PayPal a target.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 110}} Launching DDoS attacks with the LOIC, Anons quickly brought down the websites of the PayPal blog; [[PostFinance]], a Swiss financial company denying service to WikiLeaks; [[EveryDNS]], a web-hosting company that had also denied service; and the website of U.S. Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], who had supported the push to cut off services.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 110–11}}

On December 8, Anons launched an attack against PayPal's main site. According to Topiary, who was in the command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the [[botnet]]s of two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 115–18}} Security researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the "zombie computers" of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the attack.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 117}} Topiary states that he and other Anons then "lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership.

[[File:AnonymousOccupy.jpg|thumb|A member holding an Anonymous flier at [[Occupy Wall Street]], a protest that the group actively supported, September 17, 2011]]
In the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify. Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as [[Operation Tunisia]] in support of [[Arab Spring]] movements. Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers from government surveillance, while fellow future LulzSec member [[Hector Xavier Monsegur]] (alias "Sabu") and others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web-hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian government websites, taking them offline. Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer's computer to hack the website of Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]], replacing it with a message from Anonymous.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 141–45}} Anons also helped Tunisian dissidents share videos online about the uprising.&lt;ref name="AJ19511"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/201151917634659824.html |title=Anonymous and the Arab uprisings |author=Ryan, Yasmine |date=May 19, 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNSzc9Ez?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/201151917634659824.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Operation Egypt, Anons collaborated with the activist group [[Telecomix]] to help dissidents access government-censored websites.&lt;ref name="AJ19511" /&gt; Sabu and Topiary went on to participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, and Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 148}}

Tflow, Sabu, Topiary, and Ryan Ackroyd (known as "Kayla") collaborated in February 2011 on a cyber-attack against [[Aaron Barr]], CEO of the computer security firm [[HBGary Federal]], in retaliation for his research on Anonymous and his threat to expose members of the group. Using a [[SQL injection]] weakness, the four hacked the HBGary site, used Barr's captured password to vandalize his Twitter feed with racist messages, and released an enormous cache of HBGary's e-mails in a [[torrent file]] on Pirate Bay.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 10–24}} The e-mails stated that Barr and HBGary had proposed to [[Bank of America]] a plan to discredit WikiLeaks in retaliation for a planned leak of Bank of America documents,{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 200}} and the leak caused substantial public relations harm to the firm as well as leading one U.S. congressman to call for a congressional investigation.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 161, 164}} Barr resigned as CEO before the end of the month.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p = 164}}

Several attacks by Anons have targeted organizations accused of homophobia. In February 2011, an open letter was published on AnonNews.org threatening the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], an organization based in [[Kansas]] in the U.S. known for picketing funerals with signs reading "God Hates Fags".{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 176–77}} During a live radio current affairs program in which Topiary debated church member [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]], Anons hacked one of the organization's websites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 178–88}} After the church announced its intentions in December 2012 to picket the funerals of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] victims, Anons published the names, phone numbers, and e-mail and home addresses of church members and brought down GodHatesFags.com with a DDoS attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/anonymous-vows-to-destroy-westboro-baptist-church-over-sandy-hook-picket-plans/ |title=Anonymous vows to ‘destroy’ Westboro Baptist Church over Sandy Hook picket plans |date=December 17, 2012 |work= |publisher=The Raw Story |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNRaFNcS?url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/anonymous-vows-to-destroy-westboro-baptist-church-over-sandy-hook-picket-plans/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacktivists also circulated petitions to have the church's tax-exempt status investigated.&lt;ref name="RT121712"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/westboro-church-anonymous-group-233/ |title=Hacktivists strike Westboro Baptist Church over Newtown tragedy |date=December 17, 2012 |publisher=RT |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNRgykuW?url=http://rt.com/usa/westboro-church-anonymous-group-233/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Anons hacked the site of Ugandan Prime Minister [[Amama Mbabazi]] in retaliation for the [[Parliament of Uganda]]'s consideration of [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|an anti-homosexuality law]] permitting capital punishment.&lt;ref name="BBC81612"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19281664 |title=Uganda prime minister hacked 'over gay rights' |date=August 16, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNS8YurR?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19281664 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Anons launched a series of attacks against [[Sony]] in retaliation for trying to stop hacks of the [[PlayStation 3]] game console. More than 100 million Sony accounts were compromised, and the Sony services [[Qriocity]] and [[PlayStation Network]] were taken down for a month apiece by cyberattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28794321.html |title=Sony caught up in cyber war with indignant hackers: ; Company with security once considered 'robust' now dealing with constant breaches |agency=Associated Press |date=May 30, 2011 |work=Charleston Daily Mail |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Anons launched an attack against [[Bay Area Rapid Transit#Shooting of Charles Hill|BART]] in [[San Francisco]], which they dubbed #OpBart. The attack, made in response to the killing of Charles Hill a month prior, resulted in customers' personal information leaked onto the group's website.&lt;ref name="bart"&gt;{{cite web|title=BART website hacked, customer info leaked|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-website-hacked-customer-info-leaked-2335175.php|website=SFGate|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anons launched Operation Darknet in October 2011, targeting websites hosting [[child pornography]]. In particular, the group hacked a child pornography site called "[[Lolita City]]" hosted by [[Freedom Hosting]], releasing 1,589 usernames from the site. Anons also said that they had disabled forty image-swapping pedophile websites that employed the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/391379/20121005/93-year-old-australian-faces-pedophilia-charges.htm#.UYXHPLXqmSo |title=93-Year-Old Australian Faces Pedophilia Charges in Thailand |author=Hernandez, Vittorio |date=October 5, 2012 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNW3XZC9?url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/391379/20121005/93-year-old-australian-faces-pedophilia-charges.htm#.UYXHPLXqmSo |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Anons leaked the names of users of a suspected child pornography site in OpDarknetV2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47435855/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/anonymous-attacks-suspected-pedophiles-again/#.UYXHMrXqmSo |title=Anonymous Attacks Suspected Pedophiles Again |author=Liebowitz, Matt |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNWBsX23?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47435855/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/anonymous-attacks-suspected-pedophiles-again/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous launched the #OpPedoChat campaign on Twitter in 2012 as a continuation of Operation Darknet.

In 2012, Anonymous launched Operation Anti-Bully: Operation Hunt Hunter in retaliation to Hunter Moore's revenge porn site, "Is Anyone Up?"

Operation Oklahoma was a Mutual Aid effort responding to the 2013 flash floods and wind storms in the United States.

==== Operation Safe Winter ====
Operation Safe Winter was an effort to raise awareness about homelessness through the collection, collation, and redistribution of resources.

The project to support those living on the streets while causing division in its own online network has been able to partner with many efforts and organizations not traditionally associated with Anonymous or online activists.

AnonOps admin [[Christopher Weatherhead]] (alias "Nerdo"), a 22-year-old who had reportedly been intimately involved in organising DDoS attacks during "Operation Payback",&lt;ref name="Anonymous jailed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Anonymous hackers jailed for cyber attacks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/24/anonymous-hackers-jailed-cyber-attacks|accessdate=April 30, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was convicted by a UK court on one count of conspiracy to impair the operation of computers in December 2012.

== Analysis ==
Evaluations of Anonymous' actions and effectiveness vary widely. In a widely shared post, blogger Patrick Gray wrote that private security firms "secretly love" the group for the way in which it publicises cyber security threats.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp = 309–310}}  Anonymous is sometimes stated to have changed the nature of protesting,&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman" /&gt; and in 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it one of the "[[Time 100|100 most influential people]]" in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In 2012, [[Public Radio International]] reported that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] considered Anonymous a potential national security threat and had warned the president that it could develop the capability to disable parts of the U.S. power grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/government/nsa-declares-anonymous-a-threat-to-national-security-8559.html |title=National Security Agency calls hacktivist group 'Anonymous' a threat to national security |date=February 27, 2012 |publisher=Public Radio International |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNedLTUQ?url=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/government/nsa-declares-anonymous-a-threat-to-national-security-8559.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, CNN reported in the same year that "security industry experts generally don't consider Anonymous a major player in the world of cybercrime" due the group's reliance on DDoS attacks that briefly disabled websites rather than the more serious damage possible through hacking. One security consultant compared the group to "a jewelry thief that drives through a window, steal jewels, and rather than keep them, waves them around and tosses them out to a crowd ... They're very noisy, low-grade crimes."&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt; In its ''2013 Threats Predictions'' report, [[McAfee]] wrote that the technical sophistication of Anonymous was in decline and that it was losing supporters due to "too many uncoordinated and unclear operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threat-predictions-2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=2013 Threats Predictions |publisher=McAfee |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNeGDEao?url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threat-predictions-2013.pdf |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Cluley, a security expert for [[Sophos]], argued that Anonymous' actions against child porn websites hosted on a [[darknet]] could be counterproductive, commenting that while their intentions may be good, the removal of illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/24/anonymous_fight_child_abuse_network/|title=Anonymous shuts down hidden child abuse hub|last=Leyden|first=John |date=October 24, 2011|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some commentators also argued that the DDoS attacks by Anonymous following the January 2012 [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] protests had proved counterproductive. Molly Wood of [[CNET]] wrote that "[i]f the SOPA/PIPA protests were the Web's moment of inspiring, non-violent, hand-holding civil disobedience, #OpMegaUpload feels like the unsettling wave of car-burning hooligans that sweep in and incite the riot portion of the play."&lt;ref name="CNET12"&gt;{{cite news | last = Wood | first = Molly | authorlink = Molly Wood | date = January 19, 2012 | title = Anonymous goes nuclear; everybody loses? | publisher = CNET | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/ | accessdate =January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight Silverman of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' concurred, stating that "Anonymous' actions hurt the movement to kill SOPA/PIPA by highlighting online lawlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jonsson |first=Patrik |date=January 21, 2012 |title=SOPA: Feds go after Megaupload as Congress reviews anti-piracy bills |work=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/sopa-feds-go-after-megaupload-congress-reviews-anti-piracy-bills |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123214325/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/sopa-feds-go-after-megaupload-congress-reviews-anti-piracy-bills |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Internet Institute]]'s Joss Wright wrote that "In one sense the actions of Anonymous are themselves, anonymously and unaccountably, censoring websites in response to positions with which they disagree."&lt;ref name="BBC120"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kelion | first = Leo | date = January 20, 2012 | title = Hackers retaliate over Megaupload website shutdown |publisher=BBC News | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16646023 | accessdate =January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriella Coleman]] has compared the group to the [[trickster]] [[archetype]]&lt;ref name="Anon101"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/11/anonymous-101/all/ |title=Anonymous 101: Introduction to the Lulz |author=Norton, Quinn |date=November 8, 2011 |work=Wired |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNcSyUDx?url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/11/anonymous-101/all/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that "they dramatize the importance of anonymity and privacy in an era when both are rapidly eroding. Given that vast databases track us, given the vast explosion of surveillance, there's something enchanting, mesmerizing and at a minimum thought-provoking about Anonymous' interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/27/peeking-behind-the-curtain-at-anonymous-gabriella-coleman-at-tedglobal-2012/ |title=Peeking behind the curtain at Anonymous: Gabriella Coleman at TEDGlobal 2012 |author=Walters, Helen |date=June 27, 2012 |publisher=TED |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GNcKZidr?url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/27/peeking-behind-the-curtain-at-anonymous-gabriella-coleman-at-tedglobal-2012/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what good Anonymous had done for the world, [[Parmy Olson]] replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some cases, yes, I think it has in terms of some of the stuff they did in the Middle East supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quinn Norton of ''Wired'' wrote of the group in 2011:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will confess up front that I love Anonymous, but not because I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's character V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change and the need for change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.&lt;ref name="Anon101" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Landers assessed the following in 2008:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anonymous is the first internet-based super-consciousness. Anonymous is a group, in the sense that a flock of birds is a group. How do you know they’re a group? Because they’re travelling in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caneppele |first1=Stefano |first2=Francesco |last2=Calderoni |date= 2013-10-30|title=Organized Crime, Corruption and Crime Prevention |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UTG8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq="420chan" |location= |publisher= |page=235 |isbn=978-3-319-01839-3 |access-date=28 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Motherboard. Retrieved 2016-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Wired calls the "Omegas", a fictitious hacker group in the show, "a clear reference to the Anonymous offshoot known as [[LulzSec]]."&lt;ref name="wired_lulzsec"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Australian Super Six Touring Car Series''', known originally as the '''Australian Saloon Car Series''', is an [[Australia]]n [[motor racing]] series for drivers of Group 3K Saloon Cars.&lt;ref name=SaloonSportRegs&gt;[http://www.camsmanual.com.au/sportregs/2010_Aust_SaloonCar_Series_SportRegs.pdf 2010 Australian Saloon Car Series – Sporting Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; The Saloon Car category was devised as a low cost amateur sedan racing formula which would potentially replace the ageing HQ Holden category. The original regulations were focused around large Australian sedans of early 1990s vintage with eligibility limited to [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]] and [[Holden VP Commodore|VP]] series [[Holden Commodore]]s and the [[Ford EA Falcon|EA]] and [[Ford EB Falcon|EB]] series [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]]s.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout&gt;[http://www.salooncars.net.au/about.asp Saloon Car Racing – A Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations limited the cars to six cylinder versions rather than the V8 engined models, as the latter might make the category too similar to [[Commodore Cup]]. The cars are slightly modified from their road going versions, with an emphasis on safety for racing.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt;

The Saloon Car category made its debut at the [[2000 Adelaide 500]] meeting in what was the first round of a three round series.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt; The annual series was officially sanctioned by the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] from 2002 &lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt; and state level series have also evolved in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The category has been particularly successful in Western Australia.

The first major change in the category regulations saw an update in vehicle eligibility for the 2006 season with the [[Holden VT Commodore]] and the [[Ford AU Falcon]] models added to the field.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt; The newer models proved instantly more competitive and the older cars soon slipped down the field and were relegated to class results or state level series. 

In the same year the series was granted “National Championship” status by the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] and officially became the '''Australian Saloon Car Championship'''.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;2006 Australian Saloon Car Championship – Sporting Regulations&lt;/ref&gt; After a second year as a Championship in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;2007 Supaloc Australian Saloon Car Championship – Sporting Regulations&lt;/ref&gt; it reverted to its “National Series” status for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Australian Saloon Car Series – Sporting Regulations&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the series was rebranded under the title of Australian Super Six Touring Car Series.

The category’s most successful driver has been Bruce Heinrich who has won the national series five times, including the two Australian Saloon Car Championship titles.&lt;ref name=SaloonAbout/&gt;

The '''beguine''' is a [[dance]] and music form, similar to a slow [[rhumba]]. It was popular in the 1930s, coming from the islands of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where in local [[Creole language|Creole]] ''Beke'' or ''Begue'' means a White person, and ''Beguine'' is the female form. It is a combination of [[Latin dance|Latin folk dance]] and French [[ballroom dance]], and is a spirited but slow, close dance with a roll of the hips.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

After [[Cole Porter]] wrote the song "[[Begin the Beguine]]", the dance became more widely known beyond the Caribbean. The song was introduced in Porter's ''[[Jubilee (musical)|Jubilee]]'' (1935).

In 1984 Italian pop music duo [[Al Bano and Romina Power]] released the song "Al ritmo de beguine (Ti amo)" from their album ''Effetto amore''.

In the early years motorcyclists roughed it in tents in little more than a pasture, however over the years the Buffalo Chip Campground installed electricity, drilled wells, installed flush toilets, shower houses, RV sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/business/bikers-choosing-vip-treatment/article_7dcf12a0-2fb7-58b1-9d71-c81b0e12fddd.html |title=Bikers choosing VIP treatment |publisher=Rapidcityjournal.com |date=2012-08-05 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabins, turned a pond into a swimming hole called the "Bikini Beach", added 3 more stages, numerous bars, multiple food services, a convenience store, laid asphalt, erected the iron "Welcome Home Biker" entrance gates and an 8-ton buffalo sculpture with the letters "CHIP" cut out of its center 30' above Hwy 34 at the corner of the Sturgis Buffalo Chip's property.

==Marriage to John McCain==
{{See also|Early life and military career of John McCain}}

=== Marriage and family ===
Shepp met John McCain again when he was stationed at the Naval Air Basic Training Command at Pensacola in 1964, and after her divorce from Swanson, the two began dating.&lt;ref name="timberg-68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander-32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo100608"/&gt;   Her future husband frequently took training flights from Florida up to Philadelphia to see her on weekends.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

On July 3, 1965, Shepp and McCain married in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="dmr-mccain"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=caucus&amp;template=detail&amp;candidate=mccain |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090213090634/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=caucus&amp;template=detail&amp;candidate=mccain |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |title=John McCain |6=&lt;!--work=Iowa Caucuses '08--&gt; |newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]] |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony was held at the home of the family that owned the well-known [[Old Original Bookbinder's]] seafood restaurant in Philadelphia; one of the Bookbinder family members was a close friend of Shepp from college.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

Following the wedding, McCain's new husband adopted her two children.&lt;ref name="timberg-70"/&gt; Together, they had a daughter, Sidney, born in September 1966.&lt;ref name="nyt122707"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/us/politics/27mccainkids.html |title=Bridging 4 Decades, a Large, Close-Knit Brood |author=Steinhauer, Jennifer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apart during Vietnam War ===
John McCain was shot down over [[North Vietnam]] on October 26, 1967; he would remain a [[prisoner of war]] for five and a half years.&lt;ref name="az-pow"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter3.html |title=John McCain Report: Prisoner of War|author=Nowicki, Dan &amp; [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her husband's captivity, McCain raised their children in [[Orange Park, Florida]], with the assistance of friends and neighbors in the Navy-oriented community.&lt;ref name="spt072008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article708671.ece | title=John McCain: From Orange Park to White House? | author=Leary, Alex | newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | date=July 20, 2008 | accessdate=July 21, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721145501/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article708671.ece | archive-date=July 21, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She sent frequent letters and packages to him,&lt;ref name="spt072008" /&gt; few of which the North Vietnamese let through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McCain | first=John | authorlink=John McCain |author2=[[Mark Salter]]  | title=[[Faith of My Fathers]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | year=1999 |location=New York | isbn=0-375-50191-6}} p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  She became active in the POW/MIA movement,&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; while those around her wore [[POW bracelet]]s with her husband's name and capture date engraved on them.&lt;ref name="spt072008" /&gt;

While visiting family and friends in the Philadelphia area on [[Christmas Eve]] 1969, McCain skidded and crashed into a telephone pole as she was navigating an icy, snowy, isolated portion of [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] near [[Gulph Mills, Pennsylvania]], driving alone.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt; She was thrown from her car into the snow, going into [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]];&lt;ref name="timberg-100"/&gt; she thought she would never be seen and would die there.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;  Hours later she was found and taken to [[Bryn Mawr Hospital]].&lt;ref name="timberg-100"/&gt;  She suffered two smashed legs, a [[broken pelvis]], broken arm, and a [[ruptured spleen]].&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;  She spent six months in the hospital and underwent 23 operations over the following two years in order to rebuild her legs with rods and pins, and had extensive [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt;&lt;ref name="az-return"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter4.html |title=John McCain Report: Back in the USA |author=Nowicki, Dan and [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time her daughter stayed with her parents in Landsdowne while her sons stayed with friends in Florida.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

McCain did not tell her husband about the accident in her letters, believing he already had enough to worry about.&lt;ref name="timberg-100" /&gt; The [[U.S. State Department]] contacted her surgeon the next day with a warning; as the doctor later said: {{cquote|They told me [the person I had operated on] was Carol McCain, her husband is a prisoner of war in Hanoi, and her father-in-law [is] supreme commander of the Pacific Fleet. They said don't give any info to anyone, because they were concerned that he would be subjected to more torture.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt; }} Businessman and POW advocate [[Ross Perot]] paid for McCain's medical care.&lt;ref name="Kristof"&gt;{{cite news

=== Reuniting and divorce ===
McCain and her husband were reunited upon his release from captivity on March 14, 1973.&lt;ref name="nyt031573"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/politics/20080203_MCCAIN_TIMELINE/content/pdf/19730315.pdf |format=PDF | title=P.O.W.

Following her husband's return from Vietnam, the McCains became frequent guests of honor at dinners hosted by [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 119–122.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two couples became friendly.&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; McCain was the [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]] director for [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|Reagan's 1976 presidential campaign]] as he sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/102508/met_348091277.shtml | title=The McCain Connection: His family moved to Orange Park in 1966; The following years profoundly shaped the presidential candidate's future | author=Kerr, Jessie Lynne | publisher=''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'' | date=October 25, 2008 | accessdate=October 25, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921100724/http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/102508/met_348091277.shtml | archive-date=September 21, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her husband's assignments as executive officer, then commanding officer, of [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7]] attack squadron [[Attack Squadron 174 (United States Navy)|VA-174]] at [[Naval Air Station Cecil Field|NAS Cecil Field]]&lt;ref name="lat041408"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/14/nation/na-mccainsquadron14 | title=McCain has long relied on his grit | author=Vartabedian, Ralph | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=April 14, 2008 | accessdate=May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the couple leading an active social life.&lt;ref name="bg083108"/&gt;  Such engagements included entertaining other naval personnel at their Orange Park home and [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida|Ponte Vedra]] beach house.&lt;ref name="bg083108"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/08/31/taking_command___the_mccain_way/?page=full | title=Taking command - The McCain way | author=Helman, Scott | publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' | date=August 31, 2008 | accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCain's marriage, however, began to falter due to her husband's partying away from home and [[affair|extramarital affairs]].&lt;ref name="az-arizona"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html |title=John McCain Report: Arizona, the early years |author=Nowicki, Dan and [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |publisher=''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband's next assignment was to the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's [[Office of Legislative Affairs (United States Navy)|Office of Legislative Affairs]].&lt;ref name="timberg-126"&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 126–128.&lt;/ref&gt; The McCains separated briefly, then reunited.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; His job was aided by the social life the couple conducted, entertaining Navy, government, and other persons three to four nights a week at their [[Alexandria, Virginia]], home.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she worked for Congressman [[John H. Rousselot]].&lt;ref name="wapo123086"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/123419722.html?dids=123419722:123419722&amp;FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Dec+30%2C+1986&amp;author=By+Donnie+Radcliffe+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;desc=Christmas+Card+Presidents | title=Christmas Card Presidents | author=Radcliffe, Donnie | work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=December 30, 1986 | authorlink=Donnie Radcliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, the McCains were still living together.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt;

In April 1979, John McCain began a relationship with [[Cindy Hensley|Cindy Lou Hensley]], an [[Arizona]] special education teacher and [[Hensley &amp; Co.]] heiress.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; McCain's  husband pushed to end their marriage, and friends described her as being in shock.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; The McCains stopped cohabitating in January 1980; he filed for divorce in February 1980,&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; which she accepted.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; When asked by a friend what had gone wrong, she said, "It's just one of those things."&lt;ref name="Kristof"/&gt; The uncontested divorce became official in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]] on April 2, 1980.&lt;ref name="alexander-92"&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ex-husband would later state that he felt the demise of his marriage was due to his "selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine."&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt;  Regarding her divorce, McCain said, "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else."&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt; John McCain's biographer [[Robert Timberg]] wrote, however, "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on."&lt;ref name="timberg-125"&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Perot gave his own assessment of the McCain divorce: "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [Carol McCain] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [Cindy McCain] and the rest is history."&lt;ref name="limp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827/ |title=When Ross Perot Calls... |author=Alter, Jonathan |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610071832/http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827/ |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}  By the time Perot's statement was made, Perot had run into severe conflict with McCain's soon-to-be ex-husband over the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|Vietnam POW/MIA live prisoners issue]].&lt;/ref&gt; McCain's three children were initially upset with their father about the divorce, but later reconciled with him.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt;

=== Amicable relations ===
The divorce settlement afforded McCain full custody of her three children as well as alimony, child support, college tuition for their children, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her continuing medical treatment.&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt; She was sued by her former mother-in-law, [[Roberta McCain]], in 1980 for return of personal property, with the suit settled out of court in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCrgwr3DzPfUx8LnNRNv52h4KgLwD92JA7G00| title=McCain and his mother don't recall old lawsuits | author=Barakat, Matthew | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=August 16, 2008 | accessdate=August 22, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the divorce, McCain remained on good terms with her ex-husband,&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt; supporting him in his subsequent political campaigns.

==Subsequent career==

=== Reagan campaign and administration ===
McCain moved to [[La Mesa, California]], where she lived for several months with the family of top Reagan associate [[Edwin Meese]].&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; She became a personal assistant to [[Nancy Reagan]] in the fall of 1979, working with her as a press assistant on [[United States presidential election, 1980|Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign]],&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt; and then worked on the [[1980 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; She was director of the 1981 Reagan [[inaugural ball]],&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt; and as the Reagan administration began, she handled scheduling for the First Lady and the Reagan children.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt;

In 1981 she became Director of the [[White House Visitors Office]].&lt;ref name="nyt083081"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/us/white-house-tour-leader-courted-and-criticized.html?sec=travel | title=White House Tour Leader Courted and Criticized | author=Gamarekian, Barbara  | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=August 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she planned tours and dealt with the pleas of different groups for the limited slots available.&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; She also dealt with demands from Washington officials, including a dispute about tour slots between Nancy Reagan and [[New York (state)|New York]] Congressman [[Thomas Downey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/nyregion/truce-of-sorts-on-white-house-tours.html | title=Truce, Of Sorts, On White House Tours | author=Weisman, Steven R | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=June 20, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the pressures of her job, she said cheerfully, "I'm always in tears, but I love the job. I'm really having a ball."&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; During the [[early 1980s recession]], she declared that the White House tours were fully booked even when other Washington attractions saw declining attendance; her office processed well over one million visits a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/02/us/white-house-remains-ever-popular.html | title=White House Remains Ever Popular | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=September 2, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a well-liked presence on the Washington social scene.&lt;ref name="nyt101708c"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/us/politics/18cindy.html | title=Behind McCain, Outsider in Capital Wanting Back In |author1=Kantor, Jodi  |author2=Halbfinger, David M. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=October 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1981 and 1986, she greatly expanded the annual [[White House Easter Egg Roll]], adding participatory activities and doubling the size of the crowds attending.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt; The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' likened her "extravaganza-loving" event style to that of [[Cecil B.

=== Private sector ===
She left the White House Visitors Office position in January 1987 to join [[Philadelphia]]-based We the People 200, Inc., which was the organization planning the celebration for the 200th anniversary of the [[United States Constitution]] that year.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pi021987"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB29C3F6146FFAA&amp;p_docnum=2 | title=Bicentennial Group Adds, Loses Staff | author=Naedele, Walter F | publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' | date=February 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named programming director, part of We the People 200's senior management team.&lt;ref name="pi021987" /&gt; The bicentennial project was already troubled by lack of corporate financial sponsorship and persistent internal conflicts; the high salaries of McCain and other senior staff came under some criticism, but were defended by the organization's president as justified based upon age and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29987C60F7ED5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D | title=Painting the Town with Red Ink: Inadequate Funding, Internal Conflict Crippling Fete | author=Flander, Scott | publisher=''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' | date=February 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, McCain retired and moved to a [[bungalow]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; While she has had romantic relationships since her divorce, McCain has not remarried.  A friend of the family, who was interviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2008, recounted McCain's reasoning why she never remarried: "She had a lot of boyfriends. She was going out with one fellow who was so terrific. And I said: 'He's so in love with you. You'll have a terrific life together.' She said, 'No, I don't think so.' She's never fallen in love with anyone else. [John McCain] was a hard act to follow."&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

The '''Clearwater Festival''' (officially '''The Great Hudson River Revival''') is a music and environmental summer festival and America’s oldest and largest annual festival of its kind. This unique event has hosted over 15,000 people on a weekend in June for more than three decades. All proceeds benefit [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]], Inc., a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit [[Environmentalism|environmental]] organization.

The Festival, a celebration for the [[Hudson River]], features singer-songwriters, performers and [[musician]]s offering fun with a purpose — a diverse mix of contemporary, traditional and American Roots music, [[dance]], family-oriented entertainment and [[storytelling]]. In addition to music and dance, a juried craft show, Green Living Expo, working waterfront, environmental education sites, and a Circle of Song featuring audience participation fill out the weekend's schedule.

All behind-the-scenes elements, such as the seven sustainable bio-diesel-powered stages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110617/ENTERTAIN/106170322 "Clearwater looks to new generations"], Times Herald Record, accessed 23 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; recycling of food waste, volunteer meal preparation, and sponsor selection, are done with goals of [[sustainability]] and social responsibility in mind.  Use of [[carpooling]], bicycling, and public transportation are encouraged. The entire festival is wheelchair-accessible and staffed with [[American Sign Language]] interpreters. Clearwater was one of the first festivals to provide ASL interpreters, with 16 interpreters working at the 2011 event. The festival also includes services for the disabled, including 20 on-site wheelchairs and seating in front of every stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2011/06/22/2011-06-22_clearwater_festival_brings_music_to_deaf_fans_with_stageside_signlanguageinterpr.html "Clearwater festival brings music to deaf fans with stage-side sign-language-interpreters"], NY Daily News, accessed 23 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pete Seeger2 - 6-16-07 Photo by Anthony Pepitone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Pete Seeger]] at the 2007 Clearwater Festival]]
The Festival was founded in 1966 by [[Toshi Seeger]] and her husband, folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], who regularly performed at it.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Toshi Seeger, Wife of Folk-Singing Legend, Dies at 91 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/arts/music/toshi-seeger-wife-of-folk-singing-legend-dies-at-91.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=villager&gt;{{cite news |first=Albert |last=Amateau |title=Toshi Seeger, 91, co-founded Clearwater with Pete |url=http://thevillager.com/2013/07/18/toshi-seeger-91-co-founded-clearwater-with-pete/ |work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]] |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rshimpo&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Toshi Seeger, Wife of Pete Seeger, Dies at 91 |url=http://www.rafu.com/2013/07/toshi-seeger-wife-of-pete-seeger-dies-at-91/ |work=[[Rafu Shimpo]] |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who have performed over the years are [[Janis Ian]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Michelle Shocked]], [[Tish Hinojosa]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]],  [[Paul Winter]], [[Odetta]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Dar Williams]], [[The Skatalites]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Toshi Reagon]], [[Christine Lavin]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Joan Osborne]], [[Railroad Earth]], [[Donna the Buffalo]], [[Buckwheat Zydeco]], [[Jonatha Brooke]], [[Drive-By Truckers]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Suzanne Vega]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Peter Yarrow]], [[The Low Anthem]], [[The Felice Brothers]], [[Punch Brothers]], [[Toubab Krewe]], [[the Foremen]], and [[Justin Townes Earle]].

In 2009, the Festival celebrated several auspicious occasions, including the 40th anniversary of the launch of the sloop ''Clearwater'', the 90th birthday of [[Pete Seeger]] and the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]’s voyage up the river on the [[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]. Fittingly, festival performers included some longtime folk-centric Clearwater traditions as well as many new artists who made their first appearance at the festival. First-timers in 2009 included veteran vocal group [[The Persuasions]], [[Grace Potter &amp; The Nocturnals]], psychedelic rock band [[Dr. Dog]], [[Elvis Perkins|Elvis Perkins in Dearland]] and [[Carl Newman|A.C. Newman]], as well as singer-songwriters [[Alejandro Escovedo]] and [[Allison Moorer]], plus bluegrass/jam band acts [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and [[Cornmeal (band)|Cornmeal]].

Emphasizing the importance of the [[Hudson River]] to the Festival, [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] has added a number of river front activities such as kayaking and rowboating, and rides on the tall ships [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater|The Clearwater]], [[Mystic Seaport|The Mystic Whaler]], and The Woody Guthrie.

==History of the festival==
The Festival has its origins in the Sloop Clearwater itself. To raise money to build the Sloop, [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] founders [[Pete Seeger]] and friends held a series of small fundraising concerts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollmagazine.com/jun10/currentPDF.pdf "Walking the Talk, Singing the Song"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724004747/http://www.rollmagazine.com/jun10/currentPDF.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}, Roll Magazine, p. 16, accessed 04 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hudson River Valley]] and at Sandy Hook in New Jersey, and passed a banjo around the crowd to collect donations. By 1978, the concerts had evolved into a land-based Festival at [[Croton Point]] Park, which hosted the Festival for a decade, until pollution problems from the park's landfill forced a relocation to a suburban college campus. It was not until 1999 that the Festival was able to move back to the park and the shores of the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearwater.org/festival/aboutfestival.html "Festival Information"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706035219/http://www.clearwater.org/festival/aboutfestival.html |date=2010-07-06 }}, Clearwater Festival website, accessed 04 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 festival, which would have been the 50th anniversary of the festival, was cancelled so that resources could be directed to a substantial restoration of the sloop Clearwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearwaterfestival.org/|website=Clearwater Festival|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival returned in 2017.

==Mission of the festival==
The Great Hudson River Revival is produced by [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]], Inc., a nonprofit, member-supported, environmental organization, to raise funds and consciousness on the plight of the river and the earth, as well as uniting the community around the river.  All proceeds go directly to support Clearwater’s environmental research, education, and advocacy to help preserve and protect the river and its tributaries, as well as communities in the river valley.

The Festival makes possible innovative educational initiatives such as Clearwater’s New Hudson River School, which has helped more than 430,000 young people and over 250,000 adults experience the wonders of the River from aboard the Sloop Clearwater.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2107">The '''Coignard House''' was a prison hospital opened during the [[French Revolution]] to house wealthy prisoners from the various prisons opened as in the course of the [[Reign of Terror]] then underway.

==History==
The location was originally a [[monastery]] of [[canonesses regular]] founded in 1640 by King [[Louis XIII]], named the '''[[Priory]] of [[Our Lady of Victory]] of [[Gulf of Corinth|Lepanto]]''', in honor of the Christian victory over [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.  Its site is in the corner of what is now Boulevard Diderot with Rue de Picpus.  

In 1792 the monastery was confiscated by the French government and the canonesses were forced to disband. In late 1793 the complex was leased by Eugène Coignard and converted into a 150-bed private prison hospital for those prisoners of the Terror who were able to pay for a more comfortable confinement. The majority of the people held there escaped execution. The most notorious prisoner at the Coignard House was the [[Marquis de Sade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picpus.mmlc.northwestern.edu/mbin/WebObjects/Picpus.woa/wa/displayDigitalObject?id=10029|work=Picpus: The Walled Garden of Memory|title= The Maison Coignard at Picpus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former monastery gardens were seized by the city and used to bury the bodies of those executed at a [[guillotine]] set up nearby. The site was later purchased by surviving family members of the aristocracy who were buried in the common graves of the site. Today the cemetery is the [[Picpus Cemetery]].

The '''Comedy Theatre of Budapest''' ({{lang-hu|Vígszínház}}) is a theatre in [[Budapest]]. Starting in the turn of the 19th and 20th century as an opposition to the conservative [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]], it became a pioneer institution of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] drama, and one of the oldest theatres of the city still in operation.

== The building ==

The Vígszínház was designed by architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]] who worked on over 47 state-of-the-art theatre buildings around [[Europe]]. Its construction was financed by the tripartite ownership consisting of Count István [[House of Keglević|Keglevich]], the writer [[Ferenc Szécsi]], and local businessman [[Gábor Faludi]]. I The destined area was a swampland before, but in the next few years it developed into the bourgeois [[Lipótváros]] district. The construction started in 1895 and lasted for one year, finishing on 1 May 1896. With 3 main tracts: the stage, including the flies; the lower seating tract; and the entry hall; the building exemplifies late historicism, featuring large sizes, an elevated driveway and baroque decorations, often using golden coloring. As a distinct feature from contemporary theatres, the Vígszínház featured three rows of box seats, large corridors and public areas supported by several wide stairs to answer the call of rising social life in the rapidly developing Budapest.

[[File:H budapest vigszinhaz 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The Comedy Theatre in 1904]]
Mór Ditrói was the first director, coming from [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]] (today Cluj-Napoca). He also brought his company of young actors, who were unknown to the Budapest audience at the time. They quickly created a unique and modern repertoire differing from the era's classical theatre, that featured both French comedies, contemporary Hungarian (starting the career of [[Ferenc Molnár]], [[Sándor Bródy (writer)|Sándor Bródy]], or [[Jenő Heltai]]), and foreign (like from [[Irwine Shaw]], [[Bertold Brecht]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) dramas. The Vígszínház provided starting ground and home for several of the biggest names of the theatrical world from the turn of the century, like [[Gyula Csortos]], [[Lili Darvas]], [[Lili Muráti]], [[Artur Somlay]], [[Klári Tolnay]] or [[Gyula Kabos]].

In the last days of [[World War II]], Jan 1 1945 the theatre was hit by bombshells, so the company moved to the ''Radius Movie Theatre'' in the Nagymező Street. The repairs began under the supervision of Oszkár Kaufmann. Along with other similar artistic institution, Vígszínház was nationalized in 1949 (before this time, it operated as a private theatre). It reopened in 1951 under the name ''Theatre of the People's Army''. Regaining its original name in 1960, Vígszínház became the main center of contemporary drama again, showing plays from Hungarian authors like Gábor Thurzó, [[Gyula Illyés]], [[István Örkény]], or classical 20th century authors like [[Arthur Miller]] or [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] . In 1973 they premiered the popular ''Képzelt riport egy amerikai popfesztiválról'' ([[An Imaginary Report on an American Rock Festival]]), resulting in several other musical productions under the supervision of [[Gábor Presser]]. The building underwent significant repairs in 1994.

With an average of 350.000 tickets sold each year, Vígszínház is still one of the most successful theatrical venues in Budapest.

== Pesti Színház ==

'''Pesti Színház Theatre''', the chamber theater of [[Vígszínház]], is located in the 5th district. (address: Váci str. 9) Its auditorium’s capacity is 538 persons.

Pesti Színház Theatre was built in 1840, based on the plans of architect [[József Hild]]. Now the building is protected by the law of National Monuments Inspectorate. Initially there was an elegant coffee house with marble columns in the tract opens to the Aranykéz street. The upper floors originally accommodated private apartments, but these were rebuilt for suites of Hotel National. In 1902 a new recostruction program began and the premises of Cinema Corso occupied the ground floor.

In 1936–37 the building was reconstructed again and the auditorium of the Corso Cinema was expanded. In World War II almost the whole building was destroyed. The restoration started only in 1945 and some years later the cinema was renamed to Bartók Hall.

From 1967 Pesti Színház Theatre is the chamber theatre of Vígszínház with the same company. Its a venue for plays with a more intimate atmosphere. The Pesti Színház Theatre also has several English and American successes, musicals and children-plays to its credit. The building was renovated in 2009 in a modern style.

Universities in the United Kingdom, including Oxford and Cambridge, have been targets,&lt;ref name=ToL&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yeung |first1=Peter |last2=Bennett |first2=Rosemary |title=University secrets are stolen by cybergangs |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/university-secrets-are-stolen-by-cybergangs-oxford-warwick-and-university-college-london-r0zsmf56z |work=The Times |date=5 September 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have institutions in the US&lt;ref name=DNI2018/&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Koziol |first1=Michael |title=Major universities hit by data breach affecting thousands of job applicants at top firms |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/major-universities-hit-by-data-breach-affecting-thousands-of-job-applicants-at-top-firms-20180608-p4zkd9.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities are targets for [[cyber espionage]] due to wealth of [[personally identifiable information]] they possess on students, employees, people who buy tickets to sporting events, and, if the university has an [[academic medical center]], on patients treated there; information about research projects with industrial or military application are also targets. The culture of information sharing within universities also makes them easy targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Cadie |title=Hackers next big target: Your kids' college |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/21/hackers-target-colleges-to-steal-personal-data-university-research.html |work=CNBC |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DBT&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roman |first1=Jeffrey |title=Universities: Prime Breach Targets |url=https://www.databreachtoday.asia/universities-prime-breach-targets-a-7865 |work=Data Breach Today |date=February 3, 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Susan |title=Why schools are prime targets for data breaches |url=https://www.wpri.com/back-to-school/why-schools-are-prime-targets-for-data-breaches/1400415386 |work=WPRI |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''death by misadventure''', as recorded by [[coroner]]s and on [[death certificate]]s and associated documents, is one that is primarily attributed to an accident that occurred due to a risk that was taken voluntarily. In contrast, when a [[cause of death]] is listed as an [[Accidental death|accident]] rather than a misadventure, this implies no unreasonable willful risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryant |first=Clifton D. |author-link=Clifton D. Bryant |year=2003 |title=Handbook of Death &amp; Dying |location=Thousand Oaks, California |publisher=Sage Publications |pages=968 |isbn=978-0-7619-2514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misadventure is a legally-defined ''[[manner of death]]'': a way by which an actual ''[[cause of death]]'' (trauma, exposure, etc.) was allowed to occur. For example, a death caused by an illicit [[drug overdose]] may be ruled a [[death]] by misadventure as the user ignored the risks of the drugs. Misadventure is a form of [[unnatural death]], a category that also includes [[accident]], [[suicide]], and [[homicide]].

[[File:Delamination-CFRP.jpg|thumb|Delamination of [[Cfrp|CFRP]] under compression load]]
'''Delamination''' is a mode of failure for [[composite material]]s&lt;ref name="cantwell"&gt;{{cite journal | author=WJ Cantwell, J Morton | title=The impact resistance of composite materials -- a review | journal=Composites | year=1991 | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=347–62 | url= | doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[steel]].&lt;ref name="bramfitt"&gt;{{cite journal | author=B. L. Bramfitt, A. R. Marder | title= A Study of the Delamination Behavior of aa Very Low-Carbon Steel | journal=Metallurgical Transactions A | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Lamination|laminated]] materials, repeated cyclic stresses, impact, and so on can cause layers to separate, forming a [[mica]]-like structure of separate layers, with significant loss of mechanical toughness. Delamination also occurs in reinforced concrete structures subject to reinforcement corrosion, in which case the oxidized metal of the reinforcement is greater in volume than the original metal.  The oxidized metal therefore requires greater space than the original reinforcing bars, which causes a wedge-like stress on the concrete.  This force eventually overcomes the relatively weak tensile strength of concrete, resulting in a separation (or delamination) of the concrete above and below the reinforcing bars.

[[Fiber pull-out]] (another form of failure mechanism) and delamination can occur, in part, due to weak adhesive bonding between the fibers and the polymer matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1 = Serope Kalpakjian| author2 = Steven R. Schmid| title = Manufacturing Engineering and Technology| year = 2001| isbn = 978-0-13-017440-6 }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delamination failure may be detected in the material by its sound; solid composite has bright sound, while delaminated part sounds dull, reinforced concrete sounds solid, whereas delaminated concrete will have a light drum-like sound when exposed to a dragged chain pulled across its surface.  Bridge decks in cold climate countries which use de-icing salts and chemicals are commonly subject to delamination and as such are typically scheduled for annual inspection by chain-dragging as well as subsequent patch repairs of the surface. Other [[nondestructive testing]] methods are used, including embedding [[optical fiber]]s coupled with [[optical time domain reflectometer]] testing of their state, testing with [[ultrasound]], radiographic imaging, and infrared imaging.

Some manufacturers of [[carbon fibre|carbon]] composite [[bicycle|bike]] frames suggest disposing of the frame after a crash, because the impact could have created flaws inside the material.

As there is increasing use of composite materials in aircraft construction (''e.g.'' the [[Boeing 787]] and the [[Airbus A350]]), delamination is an [[air safety]] concern, especially in the tail sections of the airplanes.

For aircraft, satellite, and other critical components, the requirements for quality may be very strict.  Using a test method, such as manual tap testing, to produce audible sounds is not reliable.  Small defects, or those several layers deep, may be very difficult, if not impossible, to detect. The change in pitch becomes slight enough that the human ear cannot resolve it. Using sound is also subjective and dependent on the inspector's quality of hearing as well as judgement.  Any intentional variations in the part may also change the pitch of the produced sound, influencing the inspection.  Some of these variations include ply overlaps, ply count change gores, core density change (if used), and geometry.  While these features can all exist in the same part and sound different from each other, none are defects.  Inspection methods such as ultrasound, infrared thermography, shearography, and radiography produce quantifiable results and all have much higher resolution capability than manual tap testing. 

Delamination is also exhibited in Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printed components.

Rigorous mathematical tools allowing also for design on numerical stable and convergent algorithms are nowadays developed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1 = T.Roubicek| author2 = M.Kruzik| author3 =  V.Mantic | author4 = C.G.Panagiotopoulos | author5 =  R.Vodicka| author6  = J.Zeman| title = Delamination and adhesive contacts, their mathematical modeling and numerical treatment (To appear as Ch.11 in ‘Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">The '''Donnellan Lectures''' are a lecture series at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], instituted in 1794. The lectures were originally given under the auspices of the School of Hebrew, Biblical and Theological Studies. But since 1987 they have been run on a triennial basis by the Department of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Philosophy/events/donnellan.htm See] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230105245/http://www.tcd.ie/Philosophy/events/donnellan.htm |date=December 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are no longer theological in nature. They were endowed from the estate of Anne Donnellan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballyd.com/history/annedonnellan.htm  Anne Donnellan], Ballyd.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11470">'''The Duclod Man''' was the title given to a man, identified as '''Robert W. McEwen''', who over two decades generated mystery and speculation by sending out dozens of unusual anonymous letters to college students and posting writings on internet pages. The letters, internet writings, and library bathroom graffiti included the word "duclod" (ostensibly a [[portmanteau]] of '''dual''' and '''closeted''', or a [[bisexual]] person who hides his or her sexuality from both gay and straight people.)  The activity occurred over three decades until his identity was discovered in 2007 by Sarah Aswell, a journalist writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name="article1"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chasing the Duclod Man | author=Sarah Aswell | url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2007/03/12/chasing-duclod-man | work=
 Advocate.com | accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her investigative articles, she calls the duclod man "Richard".

==Graffiti==
Graffiti incorporating the word "duclod" and obscure jokes concerning "two closets" have been seen at [[Grinnell College]] since at least the mid-1970s, often in Burling Library bathrooms.
In the 1980s, the following peculiar graffiti message could be found in one [[Whately, Massachusetts]] restaurant's Men's Room:

'''Q: What is the difference between?'''

'''A: A duclod.'''

'''Q: The same as the difference between?'''

'''A: Two closets.'''

==Letters==
As early as 1992, students at multiple colleges received duclod letters, but most prominently, they were directed towards seniors at [[Grinnell College]] and the [[University of Kansas]]. The letters were sent in groups, during school breaks, from different and seemingly-random parts of the country. The letters were sometimes sent to a student's home address, leading to speculation that the sender intended to "out" the recipient to his or her parents. Because of the nature of the content, it was widely speculated that the sender was targeting students based on their sexual orientation, although apparently straight students received letters as well.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="article3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aswell | first=Sarah | authorlink = Sarah Aswell | title = Campus Mystery, My Search for the Duclod Man | journal = Grinnell Magazine | volume = 40 | pages = 25–29 | date = Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The envelopes contained letters folded up to resemble a homemade greeting card, with childish drawings (men crawling on the ground, toilets, trash cans, and twin closet doors) and strange jokes or messages ("Q: What would a duclod like about the land of the giants? A: Standing in two closets without touching either knob.", "If you like shaving cats, try shaving crayons. It's a good a way as any to practice shaving.", "It takes two hands to handle a duclod", "Actual tombstone inscription: DUCLODS DIE TWICE"). The letters sometimes defined the duclod as "[[bisexual]], [[homophobic]], [[heterophobic]], confused."&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;

==Internet==
Several homemade websites hosted on free services such as [[Geocities]], [[AOL]], or [[Angelfire]] contained content that appeared similar to Duclod Man's letters. The websites contained original writings – usually musings about the [[Natural environment|environment]], technology, politics, [[conspiracy theories]], or [[numerology]]. They also contained jokes, drawings similar to those found in the duclod letters, information about [[organic gardening]], or homemade programs written in [[Visual Basic]]. Visiting his pages would often invoke the '''[[mailto]]:''' protocol to open the visitor's email client, automatically filling it in with dozens of addresses and nonsensical subjects such as "I used to be the Dancing Bear on [[Captain Kangaroo]]", "Don't you EVER tinkle in a glass again", or "You want a slap in the face?" Additionally, the author of these websites exhibited prolific activity on a large variety of message boards and guest books, with postings similar to that, found on his websites.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;  His AOL homepage at [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://members.aol.com/shavescats members.aol.com/shavescats/] is defunct but can be found using the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|wayback machine]] from the [[Internet Archive]].

==Internet pseudonyms==
Richard used the following pseudonyms on his webpages and forum postings:
*Red Kuller
*Pilldown Man
*Chilee Umgum
*Proctor Zhloip
*Chamo Howards
*D. Trapper
*Gordon Craft

==Recurring themes==
Richard expressed particular interest in the following subjects:
*[[Organic gardening]]
*[[Technology]]
*[[Time travel]]
*[[Nazism]]
*[[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] theory
*[[Hollow Earth]] theory
*[[Nazi concentration camps]]
*[[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis|Polar shift]] theory
*[[Christianity]]
*[[Transmutation of species|Transmutation]]s of humans into dogs and half-human half-dog creatures called "garbmuts"
*[[Bear]]s and [[dog]]s
*[[Same-sex marriage]] / [[Bisexuality]]
*[[Politics]]
*[[Domestic violence]], especially battered husbands
*[[Numerology]]
*[[Nostradamus]]
*[[Fad]]s
*[[Toilet humor|Bodily functions]]
*[[Nursery rhymes]]
*[[Terrorism]]

==Discovery==
In March 2007, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Sarah Aswell wrote that she had received a duclod letter years ago, and had tracked Richard down through his series of web pages and forums to a homepage containing an old résumé. Ms. Aswell wrote that she repackaged the duclod letter she had received, along with the message "stop sending letters, Richard." She wrote a follow-up article in the May 2007 issue of ''The Advocate'', claiming that Richard had not stopped sending letters or posting duclod jokes in Internet forums. She wrote in the second article that she decided to find and contact his family, who confronted him and asked him to take down his webpages, which he did.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
It was discovered in the second article that Richard was suspected by his family of having [[autism]]:&lt;ref name="article2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Finding the Duclod Man, part 2 | author=Sarah Aswell | url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2007/05/07/finding-duclod-man-part-2 | work= Advocate.com] | accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
Richard was autistic, the sisters explained. Or, they added, he had a mixture of problems that might be indefinable. He grew up in the 1950s before anyone knew much about such disorders. They hadn’t even heard about autism until Richard was in his 20s. He was intellectually normal, Janis said, maybe even above average, but emotionally he functioned like a 10-year-old. He was much better at communicating through writing than through conversation. He liked numbers and making up words. He was, she said simply, odd.
|Sarah Aswell|''[http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2007/05/07/finding-duclod-man-part-2 Finding the Duclod Man, part 2]''}}

He was also quite reclusive and in failing health. Although Ms. {{sic|hide=y|As|well}} changed the real name of the Duclod Man to the pseudonym "Richard", she left enough correct information in her articles for interested readers to find his correct information, including his name, picture, telephone number, and living address, which were posted on [[Digg]] and [[Metafilter]]. Shortly thereafter, messages such as the following were posted in his website guestbook:&lt;ref name="dreambook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Organic Gardner's Dreambook |author="Richard" |url=http://books.dreambook.com/clackers/pumpkintree.html |work= dreambook.com|accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317225946/http://books.dreambook.com/clackers/pumpkintree.html |archivedate=17 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*''"I am aware of your location ... I am coming for you"''
*''"Thousands of people who sort of hate you know exactly where you live ... I hope someone does something with that address "''
*''"Consider yourself dead, my friend"''
*''"You will have much time to explore the male part of your bisexuality in prison."''
*''"Don't forget to bring some chalk to your trial -- so you can mark off the days until you're paroled."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Richard removed his webpages, he posted an apology, which read, in part:&lt;ref name="exc"&gt;{{cite web |title=I Went Postal |author="Richard" |url=http://www.users.bigpond.com/pmurray/exchristian/Stories/0473.html |work= bigpond.com] |accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610042110/http://www.users.bigpond.com/pmurray/exchristian/stories/0473.html |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
I now fail to see the value of being human. I always got told the same things time after time and I just can't see any meaning to it. Some have told me I would never become a man. I always looked for others to feel superior to and really thought I could build myself up by putting others down, but it just doesn't work that way over the long haul, and I'm sorry for the pain I caused to others including Sarah Aswell (not sure I spelled it right) by going postal the way I did. Very remorseful. I was hurting people more than I realized. Don't blame my parents for all of this because I don't.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My health is now failing and I don't have much longer to live anyway. I just don't get over things ...  In case anybody is thinking of doing me in, if we meet, I want to save him the trouble by doing it myself. I could easily do it with all the pills I have. I would also rather be dead than to go to any kind of prison. I may have Hell to pay, but even in the Lake of fire (the 2nd -- or maybe 3rd, but supposedly last and final death), I don't think anything burns away to nothing.

'''Energy''' was a techno-music event (see [[rave]]) taking place after the [[Street Parade]] in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]]. It is considered the largest indoor event of its nature in the country. In 2010, around 14,000 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20min.ch/life/musik/story/12671423 (German) 20 Minuten Online. Retrieved September 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Hosted by Music journalist Arnold Meyer, fifa event organiser Hans-Jürg Rufener and record label owner Thomas Bischofberger, Energy began as a party after the first [[Street Parade]] in 1992 in what was an industrial warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g26.ch/texte_lifestyle_20.html (German) g26 Lifestyle&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Energy attracted more visitors than the Street Parade itself until 1994, when the parade sharply gained popularity due to the nation- and world-wide [[word-of-mouth]] of the Energy after-party.
[[Hallenstadion]] in [[Zürich]] replaced the warehouse as the Energy venue from 1993-2003.

As one of the first events of its kind in Europe it attracted thousands of tourists from Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and others. Likewise, Energy parties arose in these countries in large clubs. Since 2001 an Energy ticket also encompassed other clubs and locations in Zürich, promoting a more diverse event.

=== NRJ lawsuit ===

The organizers of Energy faced a lawsuit against the French [[NRJ Radio]] in 2003 due to the planned launch of a radio station, NRJ/Energy Zürich. The Zürich supreme court ruled in favor of the Energy Rave promoter Zürich, then both parties found an arrangement; radio ENERGY/NRJ bought the company from the Energy rave promoter containing the registered "energy" trade mark in Switzerland. In the same time a licence agreement between both parties allowed to continuation of the party.

===Changing venues and popularity===

Hallenstadion underwent construction in 2004 causing the event to be moved to Eventhalle 550 in [[Oerlikon (Zürich)|Oerlikon]]. Thereafter, business decisions led to the event being moved to the much smaller Maag-Arena in [[District 5 (Zürich)|Zürich's fifth district]] in 2006 and 2007; the original rave-concept seemed to fade.
Nevertheless, in 2008 the event managed to make a [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback]] including a fresher commercial concept involving international artists. It returned to Hallenstadion, where with the help of long-term contracts, the event continued until 2010.

Today the event is managed by Glamourama GmbH in Zürich, wherein two original organizers participate.

==Music==

Since 1992 almost every important artist in the techno- and house-scene has played at Energy; a total of over 1000 DJs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyparty.ch/ Energy Party (Two Decades-One Era)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hallenstadion]] the leading genre is performed in the main arena, surrounded by several other 'floors' which focus on various music styles. Until 2007, trance was perceived as the dominant genre with which Energy gained popularity. Since 2008, electro, techno, and house music have been incorporated more into the main arena program and trance has taken a more subtle part in these surrounding floors.

===Importance in the Swiss techno scene===

Due to its popularity and widespread reputation in Europe, early-starting DJs have had opportunities to perform at the event and thus find their way into a professional DJ career (see [[:de:DJ Energy|DJ Energy]] on German-language Wikipedia).

==The Future of Energy==

In September 2010, the homepage of the event stated that it would be back in 2011 "with a different and renewed Energy party concept".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyparty.ch/ Energy Party (Energy 10-The Final)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetparade2010.sts-entertainment.de/energy.html (German) STS Entertainment. Retrieved September 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy has since confirmed that it will continue the event as '''Energy 2011 - The Comeback!''' on August 13, 2011, in the [[Hallenstadion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyparty.ch/ Energy Party (Energy 10-The Final)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetparade2010.sts-entertainment.de/energy.html (German) STS Entertainment. Retrieved November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The website hints towards the popularity and success of the party being the cause for another "go-ahead" of Energy.

Energy 13 was the last party of the series, taking place on Saturday 10 August 2013 in Hallenstadion, with headliner [[David Guetta]] and special guest [[DJ Tatana]].

'''''Even Dwarfs Started Small''''' ({{lang-de|Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen}}) is a 1970 West German [[comedy-drama]] film written, produced, and directed by [[Werner Herzog]].

==Plot==
A group of dwarfs confined in an institution on a remote island rebel against the guards and director (all dwarfs as well) in a display of mayhem. The dwarfs gleefully break windows and dishes, abandon a running truck to drive itself in circles, engineer [[food fight]]s and [[cock fight]]s, set fire to pots of flowers, kill a large pig, torment some blind dwarfs, and perform a mock [[crucifixion]] of a monkey.
==Cast==
* [[Helmut Döring]] as Hombré

* [[Paul Glauer]] as Erzieher

* [[Gisela Hertwig]] as Pobrecita

* [[Hertel Minkner]] as Chicklets

* [[Gertrud Piccini]] as Piccini

* [[Marianne Saar]] as Theresa

* [[Brigitte Saar]] as Cochina

* [[Gerd Gickel]] as Pepe

* [[Erna Gschwendtner]] as Azucar

==Production==
The film was shot on the [[Canary Islands]], at [[Lanzarote]]. The film was produced during the same time period as Herzog's ''[[Fata Morgana (1972 film)|Fata Morgana]]'' and ''[[The Flying Doctors of East Africa]]'', and there are visual and thematic connections between the three works. Notably, the goggles worn by the blind dwarfs are the same style as the goggles which several people wear in ''Fata Morgana''.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt;

During the filming, Herzog gave some strange direction to elicit particular performances from the actors. In directing one dwarf who continually struggled not to laugh, Herzog repeatedly told the actor that he must not laugh, but then made funny faces at him as soon as he started filming.&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt;

While filming the scene where a van drives in circles with no one at the wheel, one of the actors was run over, but immediately stood up uninjured. During the flower burning scene, the same actor caught fire and Werner Herzog raced over and beat the fire out. The actor only had minor injuries from the fire. After these two accidents, Herzog promised the actors that if they made it through the rest of filming without any more injuries he would jump into a [[cactus]] patch and allow the actors to film him doing so. The film was finished without any further injuries and the director made good his promise and dived into the cacti. Herzog has said, "Getting out was a lot more difficult than jumping in."&lt;ref name="hh"&gt;{{cite book | last = Herzog | first = Werner | title = Herzog on Herzog | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-571-20708-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Les Blank]] documentary ''[[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe]]'', Herzog can be seen limping slightly as he exits an airplane, presumably from the cacti incident. The vehicle-in-circles scene was inspired by an incident that occurred when Herzog worked as a steward at the [[Oktoberfest|Munich Oktoberfest]] as a young man. Part of his duty was ensuring that drunk patrons did not attempt to drive their cars home, so when a drunk man insisted that he was capable of driving, Herzog got into his car with him, placed the steering wheel on full lock, then got out of his car. The man passed out and the car continued to drive in a circle until it ran out of [[petrol]].

The '''Eyemouth disaster''' was a severe [[European windstorm]] that struck the south-eastern coast of [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], specifically [[Berwickshire]], on 14 October 1881. One hundred and eighty-nine fishermen, most of whom were from the village of [[Eyemouth]], were drowned. Many citizens of Eyemouth call the day '''Black Friday'''.

A [[donation]]-led relief fund was established to provide financial security to families who had lost members to the storm. The response was significant, bringing in over £50,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1881|2015|r=-4}}}} in 2015).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf New Research Paper 2005 template&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326045820/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortress of [[Caesarea]] fell to the [[Mamluk]]s in 1265.  In 1251, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] had fortified the city, ordering the construction of high walls (parts of which are still standing) and a deep moat. However, strong walls could not keep out the Mamluk sultan [[Baybars]], who ordered his troops to scale the walls in several places simultaneously, enabling them to penetrate the city.

{{About|the sociological phenomena||The Folk Devils}}
'''Folk devil''' is a person or group of people who are portrayed in [[folklore]] or the [[mass media|media]] as outsiders and [[deviant]], and who are blamed for [[crime]]s or other sorts of social problems; see also: ''[[scapegoat]]''.

The pursuit of folk devils frequently intensifies into a mass movement that is called a [[moral panic]].  When a moral panic is in full swing, the folk devils are the subject of loosely organized but pervasive campaigns of hostility through gossip and the spreading of [[urban legend]]s. The mass media sometimes get in on the act or attempt to create new folk devils in an effort to promote controversy. Sometimes the campaign against the folk devil influences a nation's politics and [[legislation]].

== Concept ==
The concept of the folk devil was introduced by [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] in  1972, in his study ''[[Folk Devils and Moral Panics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, S. (1973). Folk Devils and Moral Panics. St Albans: Paladin&lt;/ref&gt; which analysed media controversies concerning [[Mods and Rockers]] in the [[United Kingdom]] of the 1960s.

Cohen’s research was based on the media storm over a violent clash between two youth subcultures, the mods and the rockers, on a bank holiday on a beach in England, 1964. Though the incident only resulted in some property damage without any serious physical injury to any of the individuals involved, several newspapers published sensationalist articles surrounding the event. 
Cohen examined articles written about the topic and noted a pattern of distorted facts and misrepresentation, as well as a distinct, simplistic depiction of the respective images of both groups involved in the disturbance.  He articulated three stages in the media's reporting on folk devils:

# Symbolisation: the folk devil is portrayed in one singular narrative, their appearance and overall identify oversimplified to be easily recognizable.
# Exaggeration: the facts of the controversy surrounding the folk devil are distorted, or fabricated all together, fueling the “moral crusade”.
# Prediction: further immoral actions on the part of the folk devil are anticipated.

In the case of the mods and rockers, increased police presence the following year on the bank holiday led to another occurrence of violence. Cohen noted that the depiction of mods and rockers as violent, unruly troublemakers actually led in itself to a rise in “deviant behaviour” by the subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Labelling Theory and the Media: Moral Panics." North Wales 14-19 Network. N.p., 6 Oct. 2012. Web. 13 Nov. 2014. &lt;http://www.14-19nw.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=8805&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic and modern cases ==
The basic pattern of agitations against folk devils can be seen in the history of [[witchhunt]]s and similar manias of persecution; the histories of predominately [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] European countries present examples of adherents of the rival Western Christian faith as folk devils; [[minorities]] and [[immigrants]] have often been seen as folk devils; in the long history of [[anti-Semitism]], which frequently targets [[Jew]]s with allegations of dark, murderous practices, such as [[blood libel]]; or the Roman [[persecution of Christians]] that blamed the military reverses suffered by the [[Roman Empire]] on the Christians' abandonment of [[paganism]].

In modern times, political and religious leaders in many nations have sought to present atheists and secularists as deviant outsiders who threaten the social and moral order.&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Barry|title=Christians, Muslims and Jews urged to unite in a war against atheists|url=http://freethinker.co.uk/2010/10/30/christians-muslims-and-jews-urged-to-unite-in-a-war-against-atheists/|accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=The Freethinker|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of folk devils may reflect the efforts of powerful institutions to displace social anxieties.

Another example of [[Religious discrimination|religious]] and [[ethnic discrimination]] associated with Cohen's folk devil theory would be [[Islamophobia]], the discrimination of [[Muslim]]s and those perceived as being [[Middle Eastern]] in origin. Post-[[9/11]] reactions by Western countries stereotyped Muslims as violent, hateful, and of possessing fanatical [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] ideology. The group was depicted as posing a threat to social peace and safety in the Western world, and was subject to much hostility politically, from the media and from society.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Natour, Ryan J. "Folk Devils and the Proposed Islamic School in Camden." Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies 24.4 (2010): 573-85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columbine as a case study ==

In a 2014 study,{{cn|date=January 2017}} the media reaction to the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]] was applied to Cohen’s folk devil theory.

On April 20, 1999, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], two students from [[Columbine High School]] in [[Columbine, Colorado]], went on a [[Spree killer|shooting spree]] which resulted in the deaths of 15 people. News reports in the weeks following the tragedy labelled the shooters as being “obsessed” with gothic subculture, and suggested a link between Harris and Klebold’s alleged identification with gothic subculture and their acts of violence.

In their attempt to make sense of the Columbine shootings, journalists and other media commentators linked [[Goth subculture|goths]] to terrorism, [[Charles Manson|Charles]] and [[Marilyn Manson]], [[self-mutilation]], hostage-taking, gang culture, the [[Branch Davidians|Waco cult]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Satanism]], mass murder, [[War crimes in the Kosovo War#Ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing]] in [[Kosovo]], suicide, the Internet, [[video games]], [[skinhead music]], white extremism, and [[Adolf Hitler]].

The ABC news program [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]] aired a special entitled “The Goth Phenomenon” in which it reinforced claims that the shooters were heavily submerged in goth culture, and suggested that individuals of gothic subculture were to blame for homicidal activity in the past. 
The hostility and hysteria over the perceived ‘evil’ goth culture amplified in the years following the shooting. Goths were stereotyped in the media as being perpetuators or supporters of violence donned in black trench coats. Several high schools across the United States banned black trench coats and other apparel perceived as being linked to goth culture. Some police departments in the United States labelled gothic subculture as being “gang-based”, and as something that should be subjected to “increased police surveillance”. From the time of the Columbine shooting until 2003, there were reports of individuals sporting what was seen as gothic dress being interrogated, ticketed and arrested. In 2002, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Sam Graves]] caused [[Blue Springs, Missouri]] to be granted US$273,000 to combat the “new gothic threat”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/black-hole/Content?oid=2173559|title=Black Hole|work=[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]|date=June 3, 2004|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9322#.VchJUUseSRU|title=The Cure for bad behaviour?|work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=April 29, 2002|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/92029/under-cut|title=Under-Cut|author=Michael Crowley|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 24, 2002|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The backlash against goth subculture after the Columbine shooting draws many parallels to Stanley Cohen’s research on the mods and rockers, two other youth [[subculture]]s cast as folk devils by society. In both instances the groups were portrayed in one distinct, dumbed-down image, ostracized, stripped of any redeeming qualities, and blamed for wrongdoings in society.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Richard. "The Gothic Folk Devils Strike Back! Theorizing Folk Devil Reaction in the Post-Columbine Era." Journal of Youth Studies 13.3 (2010): 403-22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horse and Bamboo Theatre''' or '''Horse + Bamboo Theatre''' is a British theatre company founded in 1978 by [[Bob Frith]]. The company works using masks and visual, puppet, physical, music-based forms rather than text. It works internationally as well as from The Boo in [[Waterfoot, Rossendale]], [[Lancashire]], UK. Since 2012 the emphasis of its work has been increasingly in serving its local community.

== Origins ==
[[File:bomasmall.jpg|frame|120px|left|'Boma' from 'Harvest of Ghosts' 1998 by Sam Ukala/Bob Frith]] Frith taught in the early 1970s at Manchester School of Art (later [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]). Unhappy with the prevailing abstraction of the period he experimented with extending purely visual forms to include live performance and music, influenced by [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Red Grooms]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]], and working with groups of his students. At the Bede Gallery, [[Jarrow]], he worked on a large-scale project with his friend [[Dave Pearson (painter)|Dave Pearson]], filmmakers and artists, and including the musician [[Alan Price]], as well as engineers from the local shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;Palmers Yard, V Rea,  pub. The Bede Gallery, Jarrow, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 70s he met [[Welfare State International|Welfare State]] and worked with that company for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers of the Imagination, Coult/Kershaw, Methuen 1983, {{ISBN|0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed Horse + Bamboo Theatre in 1978, with a group of ex-students, musicians and members of Matrogoth Theatre from [[Leiden]], Netherlands.

After 2000 Frith worked closely with Alison Duddle, originally of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] from [[Minneapolis]] on the majority of the company's productions.&lt;ref&gt;Horse + Bamboo Theatre 2002, Neville, pub. Horse and Bamboo Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2016 Duddle left the company, and Frith retired in March 2018.

== Name ==
The name derives from the use of [[horse]]s to pull a [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] of vehicles when touring, which was a central feature of the company's work from 1979 to 1999. This grew from their commitment to taking their work to rural communities, and using the horses and horse-drawn wagons to attract an audience. Bamboo, due to its lightness and strength, was the main structural timber used in the early horse-drawn touring sets, and was also used to make puppets and music instruments.

Horse + Bamboo now tours in a more conventional manner, but its roots in rural touring are maintained through tours with small, flexible shows that lend themselves to community venues, and the development of ''the Boo'', that serves as a centre and venue for the company's local community in Pennine Lancashire. In this regard Horse + Bamboo has much in common with [[Kneehigh Theatre]], who maintain a locally based presence in [[Cornwall]] in addition to their wider touring work.

The company is based in a building in [[Waterfoot, Rossendale]], [[Lancashire]], originally the Liberal Club, but which is now called 'The Boo'. This was the name, a diminutive form of 'Horse and Bamboo', by which the company was commonly known locally.

== Productions ==
Horse + Bamboo Theatre creates its own material, occasionally in collaboration with other artists and writers, with the majority of its productions made by the core team of artists. Its hallmark is in creating sustained theatrical narratives without the use of dialogue, as well as the use of full-head [[masks]] and [[puppetry]]. [[Film]], [[music]] and [[dance]] are often integrated within the company's productions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work that they create is uncompromising in terms of artistry and subject matter. The artistic directors Bob Frith and Alison Duddle create work to which they bring the passion of great artists - emotionally powerful, beautiful to look at, laced with humour and pathos that reaches out to audiences, and one more thing that is quite difficult to describe. It is a roughness, an absence of slick polish and finish in the design. A deliberate roughing of the edges which contrasts with the beautiful precision of the performance and the soundscoring. Watching and being involved in a Horse and Bamboo performance, we as the audience aren't allowed to forget that this is an event that is being hewed from the wood, metal, paper, cloth, paint and bodies of flesh and blood in front of our eyes. It brings the moment into focus for us.&lt;br&gt;

Horse and Bamboo isn't a puppetry company, but it does use puppets. From what I've seen, puppets are mixed in for either stylistic or semiotic reasons, or both at the same time. &lt;ref&gt;Adam Bennett, Animations, Puppet Centre Trust 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Touring ===
For the first two decades Horse + Bamboo toured using horse-drawn transport. These productions started as outdoor shows, and moved into a marquee after four years. Eventually the company began to create shows that played in village halls and other community centres. The performers walked about 400 miles each season, living in tents and cooking on open fires. Horse-drawn touring took place in England, Scotland, Ireland, Hungary and Slovakia. Now the company tours its productions throughout the UK, and has also toured in [[Spain]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], and [[Belgium]]. For a while the company also used the ''pPod'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/1045 "pPOD, Horse + Bamboo Theatre", at ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk] Accessed 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; a portable structure designed by Magma Architecture&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/a-tent-structure-for-a-mobile-theatre/136048.article Susan Dawson "A TENT STRUCTURE FOR A MOBILE THEATRE", 3 November, 2005, at architectsjournal.co.uk] Accessed 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; which can be set up in 90 minutes and seat up to 35 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Slavid |first1=Ruth |title=Micro: Very Small Architecture |date=2007 |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |isbn=9781856694957 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davey |first1=Peter |title=Engineering For a Finite Planet: Sustainable Solutions by Buro Happold |date=2009 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Basel |isbn=3-7643-7220-6 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A co-production (with [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]]) of ''Company of Angels'' toured the [[United States]] between 2003 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Horse + Bamboo Theatre website - A History of Touring http://www.horseandbamboo.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Angus McPhee, from the Horse + Bamboo theatre production 'Angus, Weaver of Grass' 2012.jpg|thumb|Shot from production. Mask by Bob Frith; performer Mark Whitaker.]]
Significant Horse + Bamboo Theatre touring productions include ''The Woodcarver Story''(1982); ''Dance of White Darkness'' (1994), about [[Maya Deren]] in [[Haiti]]; ''Harvest of Ghosts'' (1999) created with [[Sam Ukala]], the Nigerian playwright;&lt;ref&gt;African Theatre in Development/Banham, Gibbs, Osofisan/pub. Indiana Univ., James Currey 1999/{{ISBN|0 85255 599 7}}; {{ISBN|978-0-253-21341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Company of Angels'' (2002) about the life of [[Charlotte Salomon]].&lt;ref&gt;A Widening Field p 269/Tufnell, Crickmay/Dance Books 2004/{{ISBN|1 85273 096 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company toured an epic production ''Veil'' in 2008 that contrasts the lives of two young women, one an [[Iraq]]i, the other brought up in [[Europe]], and is set across two generations.&lt;ref&gt;Veil by Bob Frith. pub. Blurb 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9558841-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In The Shadow of Trees'' was written and designed by Bob Frith for the [[Royal Exchange Theatre]] Studio in [[Manchester]]. Directed by Associate Director, Alison Duddle, it won the Best New Play at the [[Manchester Evening News|M.E.N.]] Awards in 2006 and subsequently toured, despite being created especially for the Royal Exchange. Duddle has since adapted and directed a number of other productions aimed at young audiences, including ''Red Riding Hood'' and ''The Nightingale''.

In 2009 the company created ''Little Leap Forward'', a production in collaboration with [[Barefoot Books]] adapted by Alison Duddle from the book by [[Guo Yue (musician)|Guo Yue]] and Clare Farrow which opened at the Manchester Royal Exchange. Guo Yue created new music for the production that was integrated into the score by Musical Director, [[Loz Kaye]].  They also devised ''Deep Time Cabaret'', part of the 'Valley of Stone' project inspired by the landscape of Rossendale, its geology and industry. The production was unusual for the company in hardly using masks at all, and complex use of projected images and video. In 2012 and again in 2013 the company toured ''Angus - Weaver of Grass'' about the Scottish Outsider Artist [[Angus MacPhee]] throughout the [[Hebrides]] and Highland Regions of [[Scotland]] (image to right).

From 2012 onwards the touring programme has much reduced as a result of changes to arts funding. The emphasis for the company is now on working within the local East Lancashire community, and centred at The Boo. Some touring continues, notably ''Theatre Ballads'' which combines live folk music with puppetry and video; ''The Moonwatcher'', a collaboration between Bob Frith and the poet [[Shamshad Khan]], which grew out of work with the local South Asian heritage communities; and small theatre-for-one projects.

=== The Boo ===
Horse + Bamboo is based at a building known as ''The Boo'', in Waterfoot, Rossendale which is used as centre and venue for regular arts events and the development of visual theatre. In 2015 the building was renovated and improved, and now has a 110-seat theatre, a studio space, and better facilities for public events. As well as being a rehearsal and workshop space for the company, the building is the base for a programme of projects working with the local community. The Boo hosts an annual summer puppet festival, and has close links with the local visual arts community. Horse + Bamboo Theatre has a long history of producing community projects both in its home community of Rossendale, and beyond - for example the ''Good Friday Parade and Service'' at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1994 and 1996. 

The building is also used by other artists and theatre companies both as a place to research and develop new visual theatre work, sometimes in a mentoring partnership with Horse + Bamboo, and as a centre for running their own events and workshops. The Boo has a regular programme of family puppet-based theatre shows, bringing in touring companies. It also hosts occasional live music, film and comedy events.

=== Guided Imagery ===
Horse + Bamboo has also been influential in its work with people who have [[special needs]] through its ''Guided Imagery'' programme. This programme, started in 1982, uses a large-scale built environment and performance space through which small and intimate groups journey, and interact with, a highly sensory environment. These 'performances' last several hours, and are notable in blurring the gap between performer and audience. These productions were precursors to the immersive theatre developed by [[Punchdrunk]] and others. Since 2014 the company has utilised many of the techniques developed for this work on a new strand of theatre work for very young children, frequently pre-toddlers.

=== Different Moons ===
In 2013 Horse + Bamboo started a project working with the South Asian community in [[Rossendale]], particularly [[Haslingden]]. Funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], Different Moons initiated a series of interviews with first-generation immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh. These were transcribed and the stories told were used as a basis for workshops with the second and third generation South Asian heritage community, particularly young people and women. The project has been led mainly by South Asia artists, particularly [[Shamshad Khan]], the [[Manchester]]-based poet. In addition to creative writing the project has created exhibitions, installations, [[mela]]s, and [[mushaira]]s with workshops in [[mehndi]], [[calligraphy]] and [[Papercutting|paper-cut arts]]. In 2015 the company helped open a small meeting place and gallery in [[Haslingden]], called 'Apna' (meaning 'ours' or 'mine' in [[Urdu]]), that provides various opportunities for women mainly from Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage.&lt;ref&gt; 'Different Moons: Poems, Letters &amp; Stories' pub. 2016 Horse + Bamboo &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://differentmoons.org/home-2/poems/ Different Moons: Poems The writing groups, at differentmoons.org] Accessed 17 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Apna''' has become an independent organisation largely supporting South Asian heritage women, based in Haslingden and managed by Arry Nessa and others, although it still retains links with The Boo.

'''''Horton Hears a Who!''''' is a 1970 television special based on the [[Dr. Seuss]] book of the same name, ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]''. It was produced and directed by [[Chuck Jones]] who previously produced the Seuss special ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' for [[MGM Television]] and first broadcast March 19, 1970 on [[CBS]]. The special contains songs with lyrics by Seuss and music by Eugene Poddany, who previously wrote songs for Seuss' book, ''[[The Cat in the Hat Song Book]]''.

==Plot==
In the Jungle of Nool, Horton the elephant bathes in the watering hole when he sees a small dust speck floating by. He hears a call for help coming from the dust speck and, thinking someone is living on it, saves it from going over a waterfall. Setting it on top of a clover, he discovers it is home to a tiny town called Whoville, home to the microscopic Whos. One of the Whos, scientist Dr. H. Hoovey (replacing the Mayor), communicates with Horton through a device he built to see other worlds outside of the speck. The other Whos, however, only laugh at him, thinking nothing exists beyond their world. Horton promises to protect Whoville from harm, feeling that "a person's a person, no matter how small." The other animals in the jungle — particularly the cynical Jane Kangaroo — think he is crazy, and do not believe in the existence of the Whos.

Thinking Horton's behavior is a problem, Jane sends the Wickersham Brothers to take the clover with the speck from him. They give the clover to the black-bottomed eagle Whizzer McWoff, who flies away with it. Horton pursues McWoff across the mountains below, but the eagle drops the clover into a large field of clovers and leaves Horton to find it. Horton searches frantically through the field, eventually finding his clover, and learns from Dr. Hoovey that Whoville was badly damaged when the clover was dropped. The other Whos, seeing the destruction as proof that Dr. Hoovey was right, rally behind him.

Jane finds Horton with the clover and, with help from the Wickersham Brothers (and their relatives), plans to end Horton's "problem" once and for all and they tie Horton up and pulls him into a cage, intending to boil the dust speck in beezle-nut oil. Horton urges the Whos to make noise to prove their existence, but even with the Whos' shouting and loud instruments, the other animals still hear nothing. Dr. Hoovey searches through town and finds a small Who named JoJo, who is bouncing a yo-yo instead of making noise. He takes JoJo to the top of his tower, where JoJo utters a "Yopp", which breaks through the dust speck and allows the animals to finally hear the Whos and they release Horton and allow him to keep it. The special ends with Dr. Hoovey relaxing in his chair when he sees a small dust speck and hears a call for help coming from it, much to his dismay.

==Home video releases==
The special was frequently included on [[VHS]], [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], [[LaserDisc]] and [[DVD]] releases of ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/reviews2/howthegrinchstolexmas.html |title=DVD Review-Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas |publisher=The Digital Bits |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229204513/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/reviews2/howthegrinchstolexmas.html |archivedate=2011-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on its own DVD on March 4, 2008.

A '''hunt ball''' is an annual affair hosted by a [[Fox hunting|mounted fox hunting]] club, most of which are located in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. These balls are traditionally held around the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]], which is why many American Hunts mark the end of the hunting year. In the [[19th century]], hunt balls were not unlike other country dances. Although not as formal as the London Balls that characterized "[[Season (society)|The Season]]," they were still elegant by local standards.

Today,{{when|date=July 2016}} most hunt balls consist of a cocktail hour, followed by dinner and dancing. They are typically "[[black tie]]" events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/07/hunting.ruralaffairs|title=Welcome to my hunt ball|first=|last=Leanda de Lisle|date=7 December 1999|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although prestigious male members Hunt bigger balls for their enjoyment. They are invited to wear scarlet tail coats produced specifically for hunt ball attendees. Although the dancing was once limited to traditional forms, these days styles vary widely between hunts. At some balls, the dancing is proceeded by an [[auction]] in which items donated by members are sold to raise money for the care and feeding of the hounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amwellvalleyhounds.org/mrs-buxtons-hunt-reports/the-hunt-ball-better-and-better|title=The Hunt Ball - Better and Better!|publisher=amwellvalleyhounds.org|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2016}} Ticket sales for the ball are also an important aspect of [[fundraising]].

While hunt balls are invitational events, they are rarely exclusive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Most hunts are happy to sell additional tickets to members of the community who are interested in being part of the evening.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The '''Kiev Independence Day Parade''' is the main event of the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]], which is celebrated annually in [[Kiev]] on August 24.

== Background of the Parades ==
The first parade in honor of Independence Day was held on [[Khreschatyk Street]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asv.gov.ua/?q=en/news/2015/08/06/consolideted-unit-army-academy-taken-part-preparations-independence-day-kyiv|title=A consolideted unit of the Army Academy is taken part in the preparations for Independence Day in Kyiv {{!}} Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Army Academy|website=www.asv.gov.ua|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the parade included military vehicles for the first time since 1990.

== Expanded summary ==
As Independence Day is the national independence holiday of Ukraine the celebrations in Kiev thus serve as a national event to mark the holiday. The celebrations begin as the parade commander (The commander is usually the Commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces holding the rank of Colonel General) arrives to take his place in the parade and receives the salutes of the Commandant, [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defense University of Ukraine|National Defense University]] and reviews the formations in attendance.

At 10am the President arrives and personnel of the tri-service Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion marches in the formation on Independence Square, carrying the [[Flag of Ukraine]] to be raised and halts just west of the flagpole to render honors, with the massed bands of the Military Music Directorate of the Armed Forces playing music. The flag is raised to the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] (either with the band or a capella) and a [[21-gun salute]] is then fired.

The parade then prepares for its inspection by the Minister of Defense. As the vehicle carrying the Minister approaches the Massed Bands, as the Drum Majors and the Senior Director of Music signal the bands to stop playing the parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be reviewed. The bands then resuming the inspection music, the vehicles of the parade commander and the Minister then inspect the formations of the ground column, which present arms with eyes right. As the vehicles stop upon reaching each battalion and the massed bands pause at the orders of the senior director of music, the Minister then addresses the formations assembled:

::Minister: ''Glory to Ukraine!''&lt;br&gt;Troops: ''Glory to the heroes, sir!''&lt;br&gt;Minister: ''To the service personnel of the (states unit/formation), I greet you on the occasion of the anniversary of the independence of Ukraine!''

A threefold ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Glory]]!'' (Ukrainian: Vam) is the response of the battalions following the greeting. Following the ground column, the parade commander and Minister then inspect the battalions of the crews forming up the mobile column, and then return to the saluting base at Independence Square.

After the review finishes, the President, upon receiving the concluding report from the Defense Minister (who is of [[general of the army]] rank), and the parade being ordered to stand at ease, then addresses the nation. The [[Prayer for Ukraine]] is then played afterwards, after which (in recent years) an awards ceremony is held, wherein distinguished servicemen are honored and new colours received by military, police, civil defence and border guard units. As the linemen and markers take their places afterwards, at the same time the [[colour guard]] formed from the new colours received on this day takes its position in the line behind the tri-service colour guard in readiness for the march past. After the colour guard is formed, the parade commander then orders the parade to commence the march past in review in the following manner:

::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''&lt;br&gt;''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! Slope... arms!''&lt;br&gt;''Eyes to the right, by the left, forward, quick march''!

As the parade forms up, as the PC shouts the ''Ceremonial march past'' order, the parade's armed units execute high port arms and all the unit color guards execute slope arms and then all the contingents advance in review order at this point and halt without a word of command in the middle of the street turning about. After the final command, the Corps of Drums of the Ivan Bohun Military High School beats a cadence to begin the march past segment, preceded by the parade commander's vehicle and followed by the tri-service colour guard, historical colours and the massed colour guard unit. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40178">As with the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the choice of Russia as host of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] had been challenged. Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football and the discrimination against [[LGBT]] people in wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the [[Timeline of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|ongoing conflict in Ukraine]] has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] and support of separatists in [[war in Donbass]]. The then [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]] declined requests for the tournament to be moved.

The 2015 allegations and [[2015 FIFA corruption case|criminal investigations of corruption]], including a [[2015 FIFA corruption case#Swiss criminal inquiry into 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups|Swiss inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup]], intensified the public discussion of the appropriateness of Russia as the World Cup venue. In late May 2015, Russia's president [[Vladimir Putin]] said that he viewed the corruption investigations as an attempt by the U.S. to oust Sepp Blatter from his post as punishment for his support of Russia as host for the 2018 World Cup.&lt;ref name=foul&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Russia cries foul: Fifa arrests 'a conspiracy' says Moscow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32925637|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of corruption==

The English [[The Football Association|FA]], which competed against Russia to host the tournament, was not satisfied by the 42 page summary released by FIFA, in November 2014, of the 350 page [[Garcia Report]], which cleared both Russia and Qatar of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FA Chairman [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-investigation of the claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roan|first1=Dan|title=Greg Dyke: FA demands full report findings into World Cup corruption|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30088006|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his predecessor [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called on all [[UEFA]] nations to boycott the two tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ornstein|first1=David|title=World Cup: Former FA chief David Bernstein calls for boycott|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30077311|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, after the crash of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] for which Western leaders blamed Russia, there were again calls for the tournament to be moved.

[[Nick Clegg]], the then–[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], also stated his belief that due to the crash Russia should be stripped of the World Cup. The Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], did not share this idea, but appreciated the concern.

American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] stopped supplying [[Iran national football team|Iran]]'s FIFA World Cup squad members with football boots just days before their opening match in the World Cup due to the new [[United States sanctions against Iran]].

==Use of Cossacks against protesters== 
"The new Cossacks are part of a broader movement of armed Russian nationalism," said Nikolay Mitrokhin, a senior research fellow at the [[University of Eastern Finland]]. "Most of them fought in the Donbass, and many of them took part in the occupation of Crimea. It would appear that the Kremlin is now thinking about using them in [[Moscow]] in the same way."

[[Don Cossacks]], the volunteer paramilitary soldiers from Southern Russia who fought in [[Donbass]], during the Ukrainian conflict were redeployed this time by the Kremlin to counter protesters and will be used to counter protesters of the World Cup.&lt;ref name="cossacks"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cossacks-russia-moscow-putin-rally-demonstration-world-cup-a8348221.html|title=Kremlin deploys Cossacks to Moscow for first time in a century to suppress protests|date=2018-05-12|work=Independent|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The new Cossacks were figures of fun, with their strange paraphernalia and dubious claims of historical lineage.

They began to receive significant state funding and political support."&lt;ref name="cossacks"/&gt;

=== Mexican homophobic chanting ===
[[File:Ger-Mex (4).jpg|thumb|Mexico's fans at 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia]]
During the Germany versus Mexico group stage match, Mexican fans chanted "puto" at German goalkeeper [[Manuel Neuer]]; "puto" is a homophobic slang for a male sex worker that Mexicans and other South Americans have frequently used to taunt opposing teams.  The origins of the insults against Neuer have been attributed to an incorrect Spanish translation of his statement "it would be good if a professional football player came out because it would help others to do the same", a South American publication concluded that he was gay, which was taken up by many other media and is since widely believed in the Spanish speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/03/manuel-neuer-schalke-manchester-united | title = Love of Jens Lehmann has Manuel Neuer ready to rock Manchester United  | website = The Guardian | date = 3 May 2011 | access-date = 21 June 2018 | first = Marcus | last = Christenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://planoinformativo.com/planodeportivo/68547/manuel-neuer-se-declara-homosexual | title = Manuel Neuer se declara homosexual | language = es | website = planoinformativo.com | date = 2 September 2013 | access-date = 21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/puto-chants-mexico-football-world-cup | title = 'Homophobic and not very clever': why puto chants haunt Mexican football  | website = The Guardian | date = 18 June 2018 | access-date = 21 June 2018 | first = Victor | last = Balta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIFA disciplinary committee fined the [[Mexican Football Federation]] 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,400) for the homophobic chants.  The Mexican Football Federation was earlier sanctioned 12 times including 10 fines for anti-gay slurs during its World Cup qualifying campaign. Mexico's striker [[Javier Hernandez]]  posted on Instagram. "To all Mexican fans in the stadiums, don't shout 'pu--'.

=== Swiss celebrations against Serbia === 
In Switzerland's [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group E#Serbia vs Switzerland|2–1]] win over Serbia, Swiss goalscorers [[Xherdan Shaqiri]] and [[Granit Xhaka]] both celebrated their goals with the [[double-headed eagle]] gesture with their hands. The gesture can be interpreted as a symbol of [[Albanian nationalism]], and both Shaqiri and Xhaka are of [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanian]] heritage. [[Kosovo]], the former Serbian province that unilaterally [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence in 2008]], is a partially recognized country claimed by Serbia. Both [[President of Kosovo|Kosovar President]] [[Hashim Thaçi]] and [[Prime Minister of Albania|Albanian Prime Minister]] [[Edi Rama]] shared their support for the celebration on social media, while it was called "a disgrace" by several Serbian newspapers. FIFA subsequently opened an investigation into the incident on 23 June. While some Serbian supporters booed the players, their general anger after the match was more directed at some debatable referee decisions rather than the goal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FIFA opens disciplinary case over Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka celebrations|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/story/3541617/fifa-opens-disciplinary-case-over-xherdan-shaqiri-and-granit-xhaka-celebrations|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Double eagle' celebration provokes Serbs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44586587|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Switzerland stars Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka under FIFA investigation for 'Albanian Eagle' goal celebration|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2018/6/23/17497726/xherdan-shaqiri-granit-xhaka-goal-celebration-switzerland-serbia-albania-eagle|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=23 June 2018|first=Kim|last=McCauley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2018 Shaqiri and Xhaka were each fined  10,000 [[Swiss franc]]s by FIFA for the celebrations, although a crowd funding start-up in Albania had already raised enough money to cover the fines. Reactions to the fines imposed were mixed, some Albanian and Kosovar fans said the fine would discourage players celebrating their identity, while some Serbian fans thought that the players in question should have been banned from playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal celebration or political statement?

However, Serbian media reported "Belgrade" refers to the name of a pub in Kiev that Vida had frequented, not the capital of Serbia, and that the phrase was used to encourage the pub to have a party &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/sport/432489-croatia-vida-video-fifa-ukraine-belgrade/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Aleksandar Holiga, editor of Croatian website Telesport, has largely downplayed the incident saying "I don't think Vida understood the full meaning and context of what he was saying. Both of them were just doing it because they are close to [[Dynamo Kiev]]. It's something that fans would chant" and that "politically, Croatia doesn't have a perfect relationship with Russia, but then who does in the rest of Europe?"&lt;ref name=blea_Doma&gt;{{Cite web | title = Domagoj Vida: The Controversial Joker Beloved by His Croatian Teammates | last = Fitzpatrick | first = Richard | work = Bleacher Report | date = 10 July 2018 | accessdate = 22 July 2018 | url = https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2785318-domagoj-vida-the-controversial-joker-beloved-by-his-croatian-teammates}}&lt;/ref&gt;   BBC reported that "Ukrainians accused Fifa of siding with Russia and flooded the football body's Facebook page with declarations of "Glory to Ukraine"."&lt;ref name="bbcvida"/&gt; After victory over England on July 11 in an interview to [[Russia 24]] Vida said, speaking Russian, that "he was mistaken" and "apologized to Russian people".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vesti.ru/fifaworldcup/news/883423&lt;/ref&gt; Domagoj Vida received an official warning by FIFA and Ognjen Vukojević has been fined 15,000 Swiss francs and expelled from Croatian team's coaching staff by the [[Croatian Football Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Latest: Official fined, banned; player only gets warning |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/the-latest-croatia-bars-ex-player-from-world-cup-over-video/2018/07/09/5755d6aa-837d-11e8-9e06-4db52ac42e05_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ca0d2d2ec4e5 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group H fair play controversy===
[[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] finished [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] with the same number of points, the same goal difference, the same number of goals scored and a 2–2 draw as their head-to-head record.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44649668 Japan go through but final group game ends in 'mind-boggling farce']&lt;/ref&gt; Japan beat Senegal into second place based on their fair play record, as they had fewer yellow cards (four against six).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The last two matches were played simultaneously. When [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] scored against Senegal to go 1–0 ahead in the 74th minute, Japan went into second ahead of Senegal on the fair play rule. During their last game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], the Japanese team were made aware of their advantageous position with ten minutes left and decided to play a very conservative game. They passed to one another and kept the ball in their own box, seeking to avoid any bookings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; They did not attempt to score, despite being one goal behind.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Poland, for their part were happy to let them do this as they were already winning but had no chance of advancing into the next round.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Some fans at the match booed the players.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://www.news.com.au/sport/football/world-cup/japan-lost-more-than-just-its-match-against-poland/news-story/73e9f194c34e27f895476893455775be "news.com.au" - 'Japan lost more than just its match against Poland']&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match the Japanese manager, [[Akira Nishino (footballer)|Akira Nishino]], said in an interview "I am not too happy about this, but I forced my players to do what I said. It's the World Cup, and sometimes these things can't be avoided."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

However, there was widespread criticism from football figures throughout the world. Comparisons were made to the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] '[[Disgrace of Gijón]]'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/sport/soccer/article/2153083/fifa-world-cup-fair-play-farce-embarrasses-japan-fans-social-media "[[South China Morning Post&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" - Fifa World Cup fair play farce embarrasses Japan fans as social media users slam 'anti-football' tactics.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese social media users also criticised their own team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, others defended the Japanese team and FIFA said it had no plans to drop the fair play rule, despite calls for it to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/no-plans-to-change-fair-play-rule-fifa-10484254 No plans to change fair play rule: FIFA - Channel NewsAsia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the42.ie/senegal-world-cup-fiar-play-fifa-4103082-Jul2018/ Senegal complain to Fifa over fair play rule · The42&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian pension reform ===
On the opening day of the World Cup (June 14) the authorities of Russia announced the extremely unpopular pension reform presuming a substantial increase of the retirement age. Ordinary Russian citizens accused their government and president of trying to hide such information amid the euphoria of the tournament, i.e. to use the event as a cover.&lt;ref name="guardianprot"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/russians-protest-pension-age-rise-announced-during-world-cup |title= Russians protest over pension age rise announced during World Cup |author= S.

===Sexism===
Late in the tournament [[FIFA]] requested that television and photographic coverage of fans at matches should give less emphasis to attractive young women.&lt;ref name="pa20180711"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Press Association |title=FIFA warns TV to cut out cutaways of 'hot' female fans in anti-sexism drive |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/fifa-warns-tv-to-cut-out-cutaways-of-hot-female-fans-in-anti-sexism-drive-854505.html |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Irish Examiner |date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Russian fan shown several times in the telecast of the opening match turned out to be a [[glamour model]].&lt;ref name="pa20180711"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mehta |first1=Ankita |title=Porn star and Russia's hottest World Cup fan Natalya Nemchinova bares it all for Maxim magazine |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/porn-star-russias-hottest-world-cup-fan-natalya-nemchinova-bares-it-all-maxim-magazine-772892 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=International Business Times, India Edition |date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Getty Images]] apologised for publishing a gallery of "the hottest fans at the World Cup".&lt;ref name="Rannard2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rannard |first1=Georgina |title=Is this World Cup still sexist? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-44613542 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of Russian women and female  media personnel being harassed by male fans.&lt;ref name="pa20180711"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rannard2018"/&gt; A Brazilian reporter was commended for upbraiding a man who attempted to kiss her during a live broadcast.&lt;ref name="Rannard2018"/&gt; [[Patrice Evra]] was accused of patronising fellow player-turned-pundit [[Eni Aluko]] after applauding a point made by her during [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patrice Evra criticised for 'patronising' applause of Eni Aluko – video |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2018/jun/17/patrice-evra-criticised-for-patronising-applause-of-eni-aluko-video |website=The Guardian |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burger King social media campaign ====
[[Burger King]] issued an apology for an insensitive advertisement that was launched on the Russian social media outlet [[VKontakte|VK]], promising a payment of $47,000 plus a lifetime supply of Whoppers, for any Russian woman if they were to become pregnant with a child fathered by a World Cup player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2018/06/21/burger-king-apologizes-offensive-russian-world-cup-pregnancy-ad/720668002/|title=Burger King apologizes for offensive Russian World Cup pregnancy ad|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad claimed the women should get "the best football genes" and "ensure the success of the Russian team for generations to come", following the trend of playing on sexist stereotypes that are seen often in Russian ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5318075/burger-king-world-cup-russian-women-pregnancy/|title=Burger King Apologizes for Russian World Cup Pregnancy Ad|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Welcome sign of lowernine.org on El Dorado.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Welcome sign of lowernine.org on El Dorado]]l'''owernine.org''' is a volunteer organization established in 2007 and dedicated to rebuilding New Orleans' historic Lower Ninth Ward after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurricane Katrina]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

lowernine.org was established after the end of [[Emergency Communities]], one of the first nonprofit organizations formed as of the result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title=lowernine.org
  | work=lowernine.org
  | url=http://www.lowernine.org
  | accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of lowernine.org is located in the Holy Cross neighborhood of New Orleans' [[Lower Ninth Ward]].

Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast on August 29th, 2005 and resulting levee breaches in New Orleans flooded 80% of the city. The Lower Ninth Ward was very badly devastated by the storm due to its close proximity to the Industrial Canal levee breach - 100% of the homes in the neighborhood were rendered uninhabitable. Although this area suffered the most devastating repercussions of the storm, the Lower Ninth Ward has lagged behind tremendously in rebuilding compared to other parts of the city. This is a result of poverty and improper action of the state and federal government - particularly at fault was a federally-funded program called Road Home that was found to be discriminatory by a federal court in 2010. 

lowernine.org is a residential construction company that renovates damaged homes and does new home construction for pre-Katrina residents of the Lower Ninth Ward. The organization is dedicated to training local residents and volunteers from across the United States and around the world in residential construction. They provide residents and volunteers with the skills and tools necessary to build homes, from very basic home repair to advanced construction, thus facilitating the return of pre-Katrina residents to their homes and properties. 

lowernine.org offers their services to all pre-Katrina residents of the Lower Ninth Ward, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, physical abilities, religious beliefs, and economic status. While many impediments to recovery were felt across the Gulf Coast Region, and more keenly felt in low-wealth communities, the largest barrier was without a doubt the federally-funded Road Home Program, which was found to be discriminatory in a federal court in 2010. While the program should have helped Lower Ninth Ward residents, its discriminatory nature left homeowners there having to decide between being contractually obligated to rebuild with a fraction of the required funds, and walking away from their properties after selling them to the government. At present, the largest single property owner in the Lower Ninth Ward by far is a self-described "quasi-governmental" city office called the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (NORA). Instead of facilitating the return of the original property owners, NORA has chosen to "award" these properties to favored developers and nonprofit organizations who are building homes to rent or sell - often at full market value. Thus, the proud history of black homeownership there - one of the highest in the nation prior to Hurricane Katrina, has been decimated.

lowernine.org is funded entirely by individual donations and service volunteers. Any New Orleanian present since the levee breaches knows it is volunteers who have rebuilt the city, and that without their dedicated service and generosity, little would have been accomplished. 

To date, lowernine.org has worked with over 10,000 volunteers, and has fully rebuilt 87 homes, completing smaller projects on over 300 more properties. Although any form of service is greatly appreciated, those skilled in carpentry, electrical wiring, and plumbing are sought as volunteers. The Lower Ninth Ward is a place filled with unique and inspiring citizens who deserve to have a sense of community restored back into the place they call home.

The '''Merrimack Valley Christian Film Festival''' is a [[Christian film]] festival in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. The festival typically draws 12,000 to 15,000 people&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/04/04/praise_the_lord_pass_the_popcorn/ |title=Praise the lord, pass the popcorn |last=McDonald |first=Matt |date=April 4, 2004 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is held during [[Holy Week]]. Festival organizer Tom Saab said the festival is among the more popular ones in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/03/20/lawrence_again_hosts_christian_film_fest/ |title=Lawrence again hosts Christian film fest |last=Contreras |first=Russell |date=March 20, 2008 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saab began the festival in 1993 at the now closed Salem Tri Cinemas. For the past eight years, the festival has been held at the [[Showcase Cinemas]] in South Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_073054634.html |title=Christian Film Festival returns with some things old and some new |last=Ford |first=Rosemary |date=March 13, 2008 |work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]] |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one is paid for the festival. Organizers raise around $28,000&amp;ndash;$30,000 to rent the Showcase Cinemas movie theater for the week and to pay for publicity and associated costs. Some Christian schools in the area send all or most of their students to the festival as a field trip.&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt;

'''''Murder in Space''''' is a 1985 [[science fiction]] [[Crime fiction|murder]] [[Whodunit|mystery]] [[television movie]] set in the near future. The crew of an international space mission are on the return leg from [[Mars]] to [[Earth]] when an explosion occurs on the craft ''Conestoga'', shortly after a series of murders starts. The crew of the returning craft are forbidden to return until the murderer is caught.

On its initial premier, the film was shown without the ending and a competition was set for the viewers to solve the mystery of who the murderer or murderers were. The conclusion of the film was shown several days later, with the contestants eliminated one by one until the winner correctly identified the killer or killers. The final 30 minutes of the film was shown at a later date when the mystery was solved.

"'''Nightswimming'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] It was released in 1993 as the fifth single from the group's eighth album ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992). "Nightswimming" is a ballad featuring singer [[Michael Stipe]] accompanied only by bassist [[Mike Mills]] on piano (lyrics and music respectively, but credited to the whole band as usual), a string arrangement by former [[Led Zeppelin]] bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], and a prominent oboe by Deborah Workman in the latter part of the piece. Stipe sings about a group of friends who go [[skinny dipping]] at night, which draws from similar experiences in the band's early days.

==Background and recording==
Bassist [[Mike Mills]] recalled he was playing a piano riff at John Keane's studio in the band's hometown of [[Athens, Georgia]]. While Mills almost discarded the melody, it attracted the interest of singer [[Michael Stipe]]. Mills said, "I never thought it would amount to much because it was just a circular thing that kept going round and round and round. But it inspired Michael."&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;Buckley, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; While the song was not included on ''Out of Time'', the demo recorded during those sessions was used for ''Automatic for the People'', with a string arrangement by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] added to the track.&lt;ref name="remote control"&gt;Fricke, David. "Living Up to ''Out of Time''/Remote Control: Parts I and II". ''Melody Maker''. October 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Mills has also claimed he recorded the piano part at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, on the same piano used by [[Derek and the Dominos]] on the recording of "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]".&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and lyrics==
"Nightswimming" was performed solely by Michael Stipe and Mike Mills; Stipe sings while Mills plays the piano. R.E.M. guitarist [[Peter Buck]] noted that the absence of drummer [[Bill Berry]] and himself from the song was typical of many tracks on ''Automatic for the People'', where one or more band members would not appear on a given song.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, David. "Tune in, cheer up, rock out". ''Q''. October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Mills plays a piano motif he has referred to as "circular" in nature.&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt;

The inspiration for the song has been debated by the band members. Stipe, in a 2001 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article, suggested an origin of the song. "A few years ago, I wanted to write a song about night watchmen, so I hired one to guard the R.E.M. offices in Athens. I bought him a uniform and a flashlight and everything. He turned out to be kind of crazy and called me up in the middle of the night to tell me dirty stories about the Kennedys. I wrote the song about him, but he was so paranoid he said he was going to sue me, so I changed the lyric from 'Night watchman' to 'Nightswimming.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0601-JUNE_STIPE |title=Michael Stipe Has Great Hair |publisher=Esquire |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely in the past, Mills said, "It's based on true events", explaining that in the early 1980s R.E.M. and its circle of friends would go skinny dipping after the Athens clubs closed at night. "We'd go to parties, we'd go to the clubs and we'd go to the Ball Pump, and there would be any number of these same 50 people, so it was a very tight circle of friends."&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt; Peter Buck holds a similar interpretation. However, Stipe has denied that that is the topic of the song; rather, Stipe says the song is about a "kind of an innocence that's either kind of desperately clung onto or obviously lost." Stipe said there are autobiographical elements to the song, but insists most of it is "made up." &lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"Nightswimming" was released as a single in July 1993. The record reached number 27 in the [[United Kingdom]] and number 71 in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Hyden]] wrote for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', "''[[Automatic For The People]]'' might be the most quietly serene rock record about loss ever made. There is no fear in this music; death is the album's main character, but he's presented as a vehicle for self-empowerment ("Try Not to Breathe"), immortality ("[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man On The Moon]]"), and spiritual fulfillment ("[[Find the River]]"). On "Nightswimming", death returns to his home in the past, and memory is revealed as the last light emanating from a star that has burned out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/part-3-so-fast-so-numb-iautomatic-for-the-people-i-72887 |author= Hyden, Steven |authorlink= |date= April 24, 2012 |title= Part 3: So fast, so numb (''Automatic For The People to New Adventures In Hi-Fi'') |publisher= ''[[The A.V.

A cover of the song by [[Dashboard Confessional]] is featured on disc two of their album ''[[A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,2927245,00.html |title=Dashboard Confessional : A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar (2004 Bonus DVD) - Listen, Review and Buy at ARTISTdirect |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cover of the song by British-alternative group [[Gene (band)|Gene]] is featured as a [[B-side]] to their 1997 single "Where Are They Now?".&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r349940|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Where Are They Now?

The song was performed by [[Coldplay]] with [[Michael Stipe]] on their ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' performance.  During the show, [[Chris Martin]] called "Nightswimming" "the best song ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/7663/COLDPLAY-ON-AUSTIN-CITY-LIMITS |title=Coldplay On Austin City Limits On Jambase |publisher=Jambase.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ingrid Michaelson]] created a cover based around using a looper pedal for a charity event at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|A4wiKdjAkoA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was performed by [[Sugarland]]  on their 2009 live album ''[[Live on the Inside]]''.

"Nightswimming" is also included on the [[Stereogum]] Presents... [[Drive XV: A Tribute to Automatic for the People]] with versions by [[The Wrens]] and [[You Say Party! We Say Die!]].

Singer-songwriter Dave Sutula included an a capella version of “Nightswimming” in his sets at Barefoot Landing in [[North Myrtle Beach]], SC in June, 2018 to be included in the [[Rhino Records]] original release tentatively titled “Small Bands, Medium Songs &amp; Big Venues”.

[[File:Lennuliiklust uurimas.jpg|thumbnail|An observer is someone who gathers information about a phenomenon, but does not intervene. (Observing the air traffic in [[Rõuge]], [[Estonia]])]]

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

==Observation in science==
The [[scientific method]] requires observations of [[list of natural phenomena|natural phenomena]] to formulate and test [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].&lt;ref name="Kosso"&gt;{{cite book

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human perception occurs by a complex, unconscious process of [[abstraction]], in which certain details of the incoming sense data are noticed and remembered, and the rest forgotten.    What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H. Freedman |title=The Streetlight Effect |url= |quote= |work=[[Discover magazine]] |date=August 1, 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-08-24 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

__TOC__

== Background ==

===Historical context===
As access to the internet and other information technology has become widespread, there has been a rise in the use of these technologies to bully others, particularly among children and teenagers. This online bullying has been termed [[cyberbullying]], defined as "using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person" by the [[National Crime Prevention Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Bullying Law and Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/|publisher=U.S. Legal Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several cyberbullying cases where the victim committed suicide, states have pursued both educational and legislative approaches to combating the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;For example, after the suicide of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]], a 13-year-old girl that committed suicide in 2006 after suffering ongoing bullying on MySpace, both state and federal laws were proposed [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9962375-7.html A rallying cry against cyberbullying]. CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, over forty-five US states had implemented laws against digital harassment, although many of these were focused on school policies for dealing with bullying and harassment, rather than criminalizing cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006–2010] Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 2010, the Albany County legislature introduced a law that criminalized cyberbullying to fight the growing problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergenstock|first1=Alaina|title=Albany County's Cyber-Bullying Law: Is It Constitutional?|journal=Albany Government Law Review|date=2011|volume=4|issue=4|page=852|url=http://www.albanygovernmentlawreview.org/Articles/Vol04_4/4.4.852-Bergerstock.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facts of the case===
In 2010, the Albany County Legislature introduced the offense of cyberbullying to address "non-physical bullying behaviors transmitted by electronic means[.]"&lt;ref name="albany_law"&gt;[http://www.albanycounty.com/Libraries/Crime_Victims_and_Sexual_Violence_Center/LocalLaw_No_11_for_2010_CyberBullying.sflb.ashx Albany County Local Law] No. 11 of 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 1}} The law defined cyberbullying as &lt;blockquote&gt;any act of communicating or causing a communication to be sent by mechanical or electronic means, including posting statements on the internet or through a computer or email network, disseminating embarrassing or sexually explicit photographs; disseminating private, personal, false or sexual information, or sending hate mail, with no legitimate private, personal, or public purpose, with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm on another person[.]&lt;ref name="albany_law"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 2}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The law made cyberbullying a [[misdemeanor]] offense punishable by up to one year in jail with a $1000 fine.

One month after the law went into effect, the defendant Marquan M., a 16-year-old high school student, created a Facebook page under a pseudonym where he posted photos of classmates accompanied by descriptions of their alleged sexual practices, partners, and other personal information.&lt;ref name="case_ref"&gt;People v. Marquan M., 2014 WL 2931482 (Ct. App. NY July 1, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After a police investigation determined that the defendant was the one responsible for the content, he was charged with cyberbullying under the Albany County law.

=== Procedural history ===
At trial, Marquan M. filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the law violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment because it was overbroad and unlawfully vague.  Specifically, the defendant contended that the law was overbroad because it proscribed protected expression and unlawfully vague because it failed to give fair notice to the public.  Following the City Court's denial of his motion to dismiss, the defendant pleaded guilty, but raised constitutional arguments on appeal.  The County Court affirmed the City Court’s denial of the motion to dismiss and held that the law did not violate the defendant's First Amendment rights.  The county found that while parts of law are invalid, they are nonetheless [[Severability|severable]], rendering the remainder of the law constitutional if interpreted in a restrictive manner.  The New York Court of Appeals granted the defendant leave to appeal.&lt;ref name="case_ref"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court of Appeals ==
In a 5&amp;ndash;2 decision, the court concluded that the law, as drafted, was "overbroad and facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="case_ref"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Basing its decision on the [[Overbreadth doctrine|breadth and vagueness doctrines]], the court concluded that the law is of "alarming breadth" as it criminalized a broad spectrum of protected communications "far beyond the cyberbullying of children."&lt;ref name="case_ref"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While recognizing that a court should strive to save a statute, the court found it could not employ the severance doctrine in a way that would "cure all of the law's constitutional ills." They concluded that it would require an excessive [[Judicial review|judicial revision]], which could result in an unlawful rewriting of a legislative enactment.  Under the First Amendment, free speech is generally protected and may not be restricted by the government except in limited categories and specific types of communication. A law is considered to be overbroad if it "prohibits a real and substantial amount of expression." Because the law criminalizes "any act of communicating ... by mechanical or electronic means ... with no legitimate ... personal ... purpose, with the intent to harass [or] annoy... another person," the court decided the law was overbroad because it includes communications with a much broader scope than bullying minors, such as those communications containing information meant to annoy or embarrass. However, the court stated that "the First Amendment permits the prohibition of cyberbullying directed at children, depending on how that activity is defined," and suggested that a more narrowly drafted law against cyberbullying may be constitutional. 

===Dissent===
The [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]] argued that the provisions found by the court to be unconstitutional could be "severed from the rest of the legislation and that what remains...be interpreted in a way that renders it constitutionally valid."&lt;ref name="case_ref"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Judge Smith argued that the majority opinion was overly concerned with two aspects of the definition of cyberbullying provided by the law. The law forbids communications that have no legitimate purpose and whose intent is "to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm." While the majority opinion argued that the definition was overbroad by criminalizing communications with the intent to annoy, the dissent argued that this language should be interpreted as a "non-exhaustive list of ways" that significant emotional harm could be inflicted, and that it only forbids communications whose intent is to annoy in order to inflict significant emotional harm. The dissent concluded that despite "flaws in the draftmanship of the... law," Albany County had a constitutional right to prohibit communications that have no legitimate purpose, are of private concern, and are intended to inflict significant emotional harm on children.

'''Port Royal''' is a village located at the end of the [[Palisadoes]] at the mouth of the [[Kingston Harbour]], in southeastern [[Jamaica]]. Founded in 1518 by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], it was once the largest city in the [[Caribbean]], functioning as the centre of shipping and commerce in the Caribbean Sea by the latter half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=BBCKingston&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18601357 |title=Jamaica's 'wickedest city' Port Royal banks on heritage
 |last=Davis |first=Nick |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was destroyed by an [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake on June 7, 1692]], which had an accompanying [[tsunami]]. Severe hurricanes have regularly damaged it. Another severe [[1907 Kingston earthquake|earthquake occurred in 1907]].

Port Royal was once home to [[privateer]]s who were encouraged to attack [[Habsburg Spain]]'s vessels at a time when smaller European powers dared not make war on Spain directly. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals. It was a popular homeport for the English and Dutch-sponsored privateers to spend their treasure during the 17th century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing [[letters of marque]] to privateers against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in the later 16th century, many of the crews turned [[pirate]]. They continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates from around the world congregated at Port Royal, coming from waters as far away as [[Madagascar]].

After the 1692 disaster, Port Royal's commercial role was steadily taken over by the nearby town (and later, city) of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Plans were developed in 1999 to redevelop the small fishing town as a heritage tourism destination to serve cruise ships. It could capitalize on its unique heritage, with archaeological findings from pre-colonial and privateering years as the basis of possible attractions.&lt;ref name=BBCKingston/&gt;

==Colonisation of Port Royal==

The [[Taino people|Taino]] Indians occupied this area for centuries before European settlement. They used the area, which they called ''Caguay'' or ''Caguaya'',&lt;ref name=H&amp;H&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higman|first1=B W|title=Jamaican Place Names|year=2009|publisher=[[University of the West Indies Press]]|location=[[Kingston, Jamaica]] |isbn=9789766402174 |edition=1st|author2=Hudson, B J |page=26|format=Softcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqYMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=9789766402174&amp;dq=9789766402174&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AJNFU77fAsi22AWK7oDgAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their fishing expeditions.

===Spanish===
The Spanish first landed in Jamaica in 1494 under the leadership of [[Christopher Columbus]]. Permanent settlement occurred when [[Juan de Esquivel]] brought a group of settlers in 1509. They came in search of new lands and valuable resources, like gold and silver. Instead they began to cultivate and process the sugar cane. Much like the Taino before them, the Spanish did not appear to have much use for the Port Royal area. They did, however, retain its Taino name.&lt;ref name=H&amp;H /&gt;

Spain kept control of Jamaica mostly so that it could prevent other countries from gaining access to the island, which was strategically situated within the trade routes of the Caribbean. Spain maintained control over the island for 146 years, until the English took control following their invasion of 1655.

{{Main|Invasion of Jamaica}}

The town was captured by England in 1655 during the [[invasion of Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Donny L. Hamilton, "Pirates and Merchants: Port Royal, Jamaica," in ''X Marks the Spot: The Archaeology of Piracy,'' ed. Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen, 13–30 (Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1659 two hundred houses, shops and warehouses had been built around the fort; by 1692 five forts defended the port.&lt;ref name="HCinternational-2008-09-08"/&gt;

The English initially called the place ''Cagway'' but soon renamed it as Port Royal.&lt;ref name=H&amp;H /&gt; For much of the period between the English conquest and the 1692 earthquake, Port Royal served as the unofficial capital of Jamaica, while [[Spanish Town]] remained the official capital. In 1872 the government designated [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], the largest city, as the capital.&lt;ref name="HCinternational-2008-09-08"/&gt;

==Defence of the port==
[[File:Port Royal Fort defenses.JPG|thumb|Port Royal Fort defences]]In 1657, as a solution to his defence concerns, Governor Edward D'Oley invited the [[Brethren of the Coast]] to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was made up of a group of pirates who were descendants of cattle-hunting ''boucaniers'' (later anglicized to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town.

These pirates later became legal English [[privateers]] who were given [[letters of marque]] by Jamaica’s governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defence for Port Royal. Spain was forced to continually defend their property, and did not have the means with which to retake its land.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

==17th-century economy==
Spain could not retake the island and, due to pirates, could no longer regularly provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing demand by colonies for manufactured goods, stimulated the growth of Port Royal. Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as "forced trade." Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish, while also sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation.

Nuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the [[University of Edinburgh]], wrote, “Both opponents and advocates of so-called ‘forced trade’ declared the town’s fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers’ needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"&gt;Nuala Zahedieh, "Trade, Plunder, and Economic Development in Early English Jamaica, 1655–89," ''The Economic History Review'' 39, no. 2 (1986): 205–222.&lt;/ref&gt; She added, "A report that the 300 men who accompanied [[Henry Morgan]] to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least £60 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt;

The forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote “...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pawson and David Buisseret, ''Port Royal, Jamaica'' (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of sugar cane. Zahedieh wrote, “The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth £75,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island’s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed £10,000 at this time.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt;

==Climate==
Port Royal has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') with a short dry season from January to April and a lengthy wet season from May to October. Temperatures remain steady throughout the year with the dry season being slightly cooler and range from {{convert|25.5|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|27.7|C|F|1}} in May. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|1345|mm|in|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=783970&amp;cityname=Port+Royal%2C+Kingston+St.+John%2C+Jamaica&amp;units= Climate Summary for Port Royal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piracy in Port Royal==
[[File:Pirate Flag of Rack Rackham.svg|thumb|An 18th-century [[pirate]] flag ([[Calico Jack|Calico Jack Rackham]]).]]
Port Royal provided a [[wikt:safe harbor|safe harbour]] initially for privateers and subsequently for [[pirates]] plying the [[shipping lanes]] to and from [[Spain]] and [[Panama]]. [[Buccaneer]]s found Port Royal appealing for several reasons. Its proximity to [[trade routes]] allowed them easy access to prey, but the most important advantage was the port's proximity to several of the only safe passages or [[strait]]s giving access to the [[Spanish Main]] from the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="HCinternational-2008-09-08"/&gt; The harbour was large enough to accommodate their ships and provided a place to [[careening|careen]] and repair these vessels. It was also ideally situated for launching raids on Spanish settlements. From Port Royal, [[Christopher Myngs]] [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|sacked Campeche]] and [[Henry Morgan]] attacked Panama, [[Portobelo, Panama|Portobello]], and [[Maracaibo]]. Additionally, buccaneers [[Roche Brasiliano]], [[John Davis (buccaneer)|John Davis]] and [[Edward Mansvelt]] used Port Royal as a base of operations.

Since the English lacked sufficient troops to prevent either the Spanish or French from seizing it, the [[Jamaica]]n governors eventually turned to the pirates to defend the city.&lt;ref name=breverton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breverton|first1=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Admiral Sir Henry Morgan: "king of the Buccaneers"|date=2005|publisher=[[Pelican Publishing]]|isbn=1455600148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bASCpcW00jAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1660s the city had, for some, become a [[pirate utopia]] and had gained a reputation as the "[[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] of the New World", where most residents were pirates, cutthroats, or [[prostitute]]s. When [[Charles Leslie (writer)|Charles Leslie]] wrote his history of Jamaica, he included a description of the pirates of Port Royal:

{{quotation|Wine and women drained their wealth to such a degree that [...] some of them became reduced to beggary. They have been known to spend 2 or 3,000 [[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]] in one night; and one gave a [[wikt:strumpet|strumpet]] 500 to see her naked.&lt;ref&gt;The original source of this story is [[Alexandre Exquemelin]]'s ''History of the Bouccaneers of America''. The original text adds: "yes, and many other impieties", so "see her naked" is a euphemism for sex.&lt;/ref&gt; They used to buy a [[butt (volume)|pipe]] of wine, place it in the street, and oblige everyone that passed to drink.}}

The taverns of Port Royal were known for their excessive consumption of alcohol such that records even exist of the wild animals of the area partaking in the debauchery. During a passing visit, famous Dutch explorer [[Jan van Riebeeck]] is said to have described the scenes:

{{quotation|The parrots of Port Royal gather to drink from the large stocks of ale with just as much alacrity as the drunks that frequent the taverns that serve it.}}

There is even speculation in pirate folklore that the infamous [[Blackbeard]] ([[Edward Thatch]]) met a howler monkey, while at leisure in a Port Royal alehouse, whom he named Jefferson and formed a strong bond with during the expedition to the island of [[New Providence]]. Recent genealogical research indicates that Blackbeard and his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch, Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the [[Royal Navy]] aboard HMS ''Windsor'' in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Baylus C.|title=Blackbeard Reconsidered – Mist's Piracy, Thache's Genealogy|date=2015|publisher=North Carolina Office of Archives and History|isbn=978-0-86526-479-3|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Port Royal benefited from this lively, glamorous infamy and grew to be one of the two largest towns and the most economically important port in the [[British Empire|English colonies]]. At the height of its popularity, the city had one [[drinking house]] for every 10 residents. In July 1661 alone, 40 new licenses were granted to [[taverns]]. During a 20-year period that ended in 1692, nearly 6,500 people lived in Port Royal. In addition to prostitutes and buccaneers, there were four [[goldsmith]]s, 44 tavern keepers, and a variety of [[artisans]] and [[merchants]] who lived in 2,000 buildings crammed into {{convert|51|acre|ha}} of real estate. 213 ships visited the seaport in 1688. The city’s wealth was so great that coins were preferred for payment over the more common system of [[barter]]ing goods for services.

Following [[Henry Morgan]]’s appointment as lieutenant governor, Port Royal began to change. Pirates were no longer needed to defend the city. The selling of [[slaves]] took on greater importance. Upstanding citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687, Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Consequently, instead of being a safe haven for pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of [[Execution (legal)|execution]]. Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including [[Charles Vane]] and [[Calico Jack]], who were hanged in 1720. About five months later, the famous woman pirate [[Mary Read]] died in the Jamaican prison in Port Royal. Two years later, 41 pirates met their death in one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The Royal Navy in Port Royal==
[[File:Port Royal.jpg|thumbnail|Remains of the Naval Hospital, rebuilt 1818 by [[Edward Holl]] ]]

Under British rule the [[Royal Navy]] made use of a [[careening]] wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore to serve as a storehouse. From 1675, a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities;&lt;ref name=rmg&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Museums Greenwich research guide|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/library/research-guides/the-royal-navy/research-guide-b5-royal-naval-dockyards}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at [[Port Antonio]] instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: [[cooperages]], workshops, [[sawpit]]s, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there.&lt;ref name=Coad2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=Jonathan|title=Support for the Fleet: architecture and engineering of the Royal Navy's bases 1700–1914|date=2013|publisher=English Heritage|location=Swindon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Royal Naval Hospital]] was also established on land a little to the west of the Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small [[Victualling Yard]] had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and other settlements to take on supplies).&lt;ref name=Coad2013 /&gt;

At the start of the 19th century, a significant amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] serving the fleet in the [[Caribbean]]. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent [[Port Admiral]]'s (later Commodore's) House included a [[watch tower]], to counter the threat of [[privateers]]. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of [[Steam-powered ship|steam-powered vessels]]: the victualling wharf became a [[Coaling station|coaling depot]] in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built.&lt;ref name=Coad2013 /&gt; The Yard continued to expand through to the beginning of the 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing more and more on the [[Causes of World War I|situation in Europe]]) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905.

Many of the Dockyard buildings (most of which were of timber construction) were subsequently demolished or destroyed (some in the [[1907 Kingston earthquake]], others by [[Hurricane Charlie (1951)|Hurricane Charlie]] in 1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust|url=http://www.jnht.com/site_port_royal.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few remain in place, however, including the Naval Hospital complex, some of the steam engineering buildings and a set of officers' houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust|url=http://www.jnht.com/site_admiralty_houses.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a slipway, completed as late as 1904, which (with its accompanying sheds) was designed for housing and launching [[torpedo boats]], stationed there for the Yard's protection. In 2014, it was announced that some of the Historic Naval Hospital buildings would be restored to house a museum as part of a broader Port Royal Heritage Tourism Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica Information Service|url=http://jis.gov.jm/old-naval-hospital-rehabilitated/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthquake of 1692 and its aftermath==

[[File:PortRoyalEarthquakeMap.jpg|thumb|Shoreline changes in the Port Royal earthquake]]
The town grew rapidly, reaching a population of around 6,500 people and approximately 2,000 dwellings, by 1692. As land on which to build diminished, it became common practice to either fill in areas of water and build new infrastructure on top of it, or simply build buildings taller. Additionally, buildings gradually became heavier as the residents adopted the brick style homes of their native England. Some{{who|date=May 2015}} urged the population to adopt the low, wooden building style of the previous Spanish inhabitants, but many refused. In the end, all of these separate factors contributed to the impending disaster.

[[File:Port Royal in Tranquility.jpg|thumb|The fortress]]

On June 7, 1692, a devastating earthquake hit the city causing most of its northern section to be lost - and with it many of the town’s houses and other buildings. Many of the forts were destroyed, as well; [[Fort Charles (Jamaica)|Fort Charles]] survived, but Forts James and Carlisle sank into the sea, Fort Rupert became a large region of water, and great damage was done to an area known as Morgan’s Line.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1975"/&gt;

Although the earthquake hit the entire island of Jamaica, the citizens of Port Royal were at a greater risk of death due to the perilous sand, falling buildings, and the tsunami that followed. Though the local authorities tried to remove or sink all of the corpses from the water, they were unsuccessful; some simply got away from them, while others were trapped in places that were inaccessible. Improper housing, a lack of medicine or clean water, and the fact that most of the survivors were homeless led to many people dying of malignant fevers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Pawson, Michael &amp; Buisseret, David|title=Port Royal, Jamaica |location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake and tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, nearly half the city's population.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Disease ran rampant in the next several months, claiming an estimated 2,000 additional lives.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

&lt;!--Most of the following, down through the paragraph on Mulcahy, should probably be moved to the article on the 1692 Jamaica earthquake. -RoyGoldsmith --&gt;
The historical Jamaica [[earthquake]] of June 7, 1692 can be dated closely not only by date, but by time of day as well. This is documented by recovery from the sea floor in the 1960s of a pocket watch stopped, at 11:43&amp;nbsp;a.m., recording the time of the devastating earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1692_06_07.php|website=Earthquake.usgs.gov|title=Historic Earthquakes|accessdate=April 9, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420104214/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1692_06_07.php|archivedate=April 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;frozen hands on a retrieved watch, the first time in history archaeologists have an (nearly) exact time for an earthquake.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= History Channel|title=Ancient Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earthquake caused the sand under Port Royal to [[soil liquefaction|liquefy]] and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, and the town was built on a layer of some {{convert|65|ft|abbr=out}} of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation on which to build an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but “hot loose sand”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mulcahy, Matthew |title=The Port Royal Earthquake and the World of Wonders in Seventeenth-Century Jamaica|journal= Early American Studies |volume=6|number= 2 |date=2008|pages= 391–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 03.jpg|thumb|left|Ships at Port Royal c. 1820]]

According to Mulcahy, “[Modern] scientists and underwater archaeologists now believe that the earthquake was a powerful one and that much of the damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that is loose, sandy, and water-saturated, increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings sliding into the water, but it is likely{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Underwater archeology, some of which can be seen in the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] show ''Wicked Pirate City,'' reveals the foundations of building underwater, showing there was subsidence, as do comparisons of post-earthquake maps and pre-earthquake maps.

Some attempts were made to rebuild the city, starting with the one third that was not submerged, but these met with mixed success and numerous disasters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  An initial attempt at rebuilding was again destroyed in 1703 by fire.  Subsequent rebuilding was hampered by several [[hurricane]]s in the first half of the 18th century, including [[Storm surge|flooding from the sea]] in 1722, a further fire in 1750, and a major hurricane in 1774, and soon Kingston eclipsed Port Royal in importance. In 1815, what repairs were being undertaken were destroyed in another major fire, while the whole island was severely affected by an epidemic of [[cholera]] in 1850.{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}

==1907 earthquake and more recent history==
[[File:Giddy House.jpg|thumb|Giddy House]]
[[File:Inside the Giddy House.JPG|thumb|Inside the Giddy House]]

A devastating earthquake on January 14, 1907 liquefied the sand spit, destroying nearly all of the rebuilt city, submerging additional portions, and tilting The [[Giddy House]], an artillery storage room built c. 1880 that is today a minor tourist attraction.

Today, the area is a shadow of its former self with a population of less than 2,000 that has little to no commercial or political importance. The area is frequented by tourists, but is in a state of disrepair.  The Jamaican government has recently resolved to further develop the area for its historic and tourist value. This is in part a result of abandonment of plans begun in the early 1960s to develop the town as a cruise ship port and destination.&lt;ref name="cerruti67"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cerruti |first=James |year=1967 |title=Jamaica Goes It Alone |journal=National Geographic |volume=132 |pages=843–873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans stimulated the archaeological explorations on the site which, in turn, led to the suspension of development solely as a port but now included archaeological and other attractions.&lt;ref name="HCinternational-2008-09-08"&gt;{{cite serial|title=Sin City Jamaica|airdate=1998-12-26|network=History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Nautical Archaeology Program at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] began a 10-year underwater archaeological investigation of the portion of Port Royal that sank underwater during the 17th century.  The program focused on an area that had sunk directly into the sea and suffered very little damage. Due to very low oxygen levels, a large amount of organic material could be recovered. The efforts made by the program have allowed everyday life in the English colonial port city to be reconstructed in great detail.&lt;ref&gt;Donny L. Hamilton, "[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/portroyal/PRhist.htm The Port Royal Project: History of Port Royal]," Nautical Archaeology Program, June 1, 2001, . Retrieved March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Port Royal Development Company commissioned [[architectural firm]] [[Jon Jerde|The Jerde Partnership]] to create a master plan for the redevelopment of Port Royal, which was completed in 2000.&lt;ref name=Hamilton-2006/&gt; The focus of the plan is a 17th-century-themed attraction that reflects the city's heritage. It has two anchor areas: Old Port Royal and the King’s Royal Naval Dockyard. Old Port Royal features a cruise ship pier extending from a reconstructed Chocolata Hole harbour and Fisher's Row, a group of cafes and shops on the waterfront.

'''''Shin's Tricycle''''' is a children's book by {{nihongo|Tatsuharu Kodama|児玉辰春|Kodama Tatsuharu}}, first published in Japanese in 1992 as {{nihongo|''Shin-chan no-san rin sha''|伸ちゃんのさんりんしゃ}} and in its English translation in 1995. It relates the true story of {{nihongo|Shinichi Tetsutani|鉄谷伸一|Tetsutani Shinichi}} (Shin), a three-year-old boy who was killed in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]] on August 6, 1945.

==Synopsis==

Kodama, himself a survivor of the bombing of Hiroshima, narrates the story from the point of view of Shin's father, {{nihongo|Nobuo Tetsutani|鉄谷信男|Tetsutani Nobuo}}. Shinichi is playing on his tricycle when the bomb is detonated. Nobuo finds the barely alive Shin still holding onto the tricycle's handlebars and trapped under the rubble of their destroyed home. Nobuo's efforts to save his son are in vain and Shin dies that evening. Nobuo buries Shin with his tricycle.

Forty years later, Nobuo exhumes Shin and his two sisters, who also died in the bombing, in order to give them a proper burial at a cemetery. While digging everything up, a pipe was found, believed to be a part of the tricycle Shinichi had owned. Not long after, they found skeletal remains of two human hands; the remains were identified as Shinichi and his local friend, Kimiko, who had died together with him, holding his hand. Nobuo donated the tricycle to the Hiroshima Peace Museum, where it is currently on display.

==Reception==

On publication, the author's refusal to cushion the horror of the story of ''Shin's Tricycle'' was noted by several reviewers, some stating that the book's graphic content was inappropriate for its intended readers (aged 7 to 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Sture Ragnar Bergwall''' (born 26 April 1950), also known as '''Thomas Quick''' in 1993–2002, is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] man previously believed to have been a [[serial killer]], having confessed to more than 30 [[murder]]s while incarcerated in a mental institution for personality disorders. Between 1994 and 2001, Quick was convicted of eight of these murders. However, he withdrew all of his confessions in 2008, as a result of which his murder convictions were quashed, the final one in July 2013, and he was released from hospital.&lt;ref name="DayObserver"&gt;{{cite news|last=Day |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/thomas-quick-bergwall-sweden-murder |title=Thomas Quick: the Swedish serial killer who never was| periodical=The Observer |date=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fallet Thomas Quick : Att skapa en seriemördare |first=Hannes |last=Råstam |authorlink=Hannes Råstam |year=2012 |language=Swedish |publisher=Ordfront |isbn=978-91-7037--604-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode raised issues about how murder convictions could have been obtained on such weak evidence, and has been called the largest miscarriage of justice in Swedish history. Journalists [[Hannes Råstam]] and Dan Josefsson made TV documentaries and books about the murder cases; they claimed that bad therapy led to false confessions, Dan Josefsson claims that a "cult" like group led by psychologist [[Margit Norell]] manipulated the police and talked Sture Bergwall into false confessions.

==Early life==
Bergwall grew up in Korsnäs with his six siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article340570.ab|title=Han kan inte ha begått morden|work=Aftonbladet|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted his mother's [[maiden name]], Quick, around 1991.&lt;ref name=gq1308&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201308/thomas-quick-serial-killer-august-2013 | title = The Serial Killer Has Second Thoughts: The Confessions of Thomas Quick | first = Chris | last = Heath | work = [[GQ]] | date = August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a history of delinquency (molestations of boys and various assaults and drug use), Quick was sentenced in 1991 for armed [[robbery]].  He also stabbed a man while in outpatient treatment from a psychiatric facility.&lt;ref&gt;{ The Confessions of Thomas Quick }&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confessions and convictions of murder==
{{BLP sources|date=October 2013}}
After the robbery conviction, Quick was confined to care in an institution for the criminally insane. During  [[Psychotherapy|therapy]], he confessed to more than thirty murders committed in Sweden, [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], and [[Finland]] between 1964 and 1993. The therapy sessions were followed by police interviews. One of his confessions led to the solving of an 18-year-old murder considered to be unsolvable, and another to the informal solving of a murder in [[Växjö]] in 1964. This 1964 crime was outside the then 25-year statute of limitations in Sweden, but with the information given by Quick, the case was considered closed.

With no eyewitnesses or technical forensic evidence to connect him to the crimes, Quick was convicted solely on the basis of his own [[Confession (law)|confession]]s while undergoing [[recovered-memory therapy]] on [[benzodiazepines]] followed by police interrogations. Details in the confessions were wildly wrong and Quick relied on hints and body language from his interrogators to guess the answers expected of him. Bergwall/Quick had been researching unsolved murders on microfilm in the [[Royal Library in Stockholm|Royal Library]], [[Stockholm]] when he was on day release&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/thomas-quick-bergwall-sweden-murder  Elizabeth Day ''The Observer, Thomas Quick, the serial killer that never was'' Saturday 20 October 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and confessing to a murder in Norway led to a Norwegian newspaper writing his story. Quick requested back copies including earlier reports of the story from Norwegian journalists and could include details hitherto unknown to the Swedish police that they concluded only the perpetrator knew. Nine-year-old Therese Johannessen had disappeared from Fjell in [[Drammen]] in 1988 and had not been found since. Ten years later Quick was convicted of murdering her. The crucial evidence was the discovery of burnt bone fragments from what should have been a child. In 2012 laboratory tests showed that the supposed bone fragments were composed of wood and glue fused together – probably hardboard. An analysis had not been performed before the evidence was presented to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morgenbladet.no/samfunn/2012/rettsskandalen_thomas_quick#.VKAWvoDgDA|title=Rettsskandalen Thomas Quick|work=Morgenbladet|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of his answers showed that his initial attempts to provide answers to questions concerning, for example murder weapons and birthmarks, were wrong, leading questions were asked in police interviews, and the initial erroneous guesses edited out of the version presented to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/12/02/bernard-porter-and-kajsa-ohrlander/the-thomas-quick-affair/|title=The Thomas Quick Affair «  LRB blog|work=LRB blog|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/dokument-visar-att-aklagare-och-polis-manipulerade-viktiga-bevis/|title=Dokument visar att åklagare och polis manipulerade viktiga bevis|work=DN.SE|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of therapists meant that Quick's early failure to provide anything more than a vague, confused and vacillating picture that gradually sharpened and focused was explained away as the result of repressed memories being retrieved as a result of therapy; e.g. In the judgment for the case of Therese one can read that the psychologist Christianson told the court that "Traumatic events are retained in the memory but there can be protective mechanisms that work in the unconscious to repress their recall." Similar arguments about Quick's "repressed" memories recur again and again in the judgments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/fallet-sture-bergwall-felaktigheter-om-svts-roll/|title=Fallet Sture Bergwall. "Felaktigheter om SVT:s roll"|work=DN.SE|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credibility of Quick's confessions was widely debated in the Swedish media. Critics of these confessions, and the trials, including a policeman involved in one of the investigations, wrote that there was no evidence that tied Quick to any of the murders he had confessed, and that until he could show something he had taken that belonged to one of his victims, the probability was that he was a compulsive liar. In a December 2008 television interview with [[Hannes Råstam]], Quick denied taking part either in any of the murders for which he had been sentenced or in the more than 30 murders he had confessed to.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt;

Because the only evidence to support the convictions were his own confessions, that he now retracted, and nothing else remained on which to base the judgments, Quick changed his lawyer and the eight murder convictions handed down in six trials were all quashed on appeal, the last one in July 2013. Quick, who now reverted to his birth name of Sture Bergwall, was set at liberty after having been confined for more than twenty years in an institution for the criminally insane, with conditions that he refrain from alcohol and narcotics.

Between 1994 and 2001, Quick was convicted of eight murders (in chronological order) at six different [[Judiciary of Sweden#District Courts|District Court]] trials:
*Charles Zelmanovits, [[Piteå]] 1976, sentenced in 1994 – no forensic evidence, except for the confession. Sentence quashed: July 2013
*Johan Asplund, [[Sundsvall]], 1980, sentenced in 2001 – no body, no forensics except for the confession. Sentence quashed: March 2012.
*The Stegehuis couple, Appojaure ([[Gällivare]]) 1984, sentenced in 1996 – no forensics, but Quick gave information regarding facts that had never been disclosed to the public. His confessions were later questioned, as Quick seemed to have been privy to all information before the trial – retrial granted by the Supreme Court. Sentence quashed:  May 2013.
*Yenon Levi, tourist from [[Israel]], Rörshyttan, 1988, sentenced in 1997 – no forensic evidence, but statements included in Quick's testimony such as his incorrect guesses at the murder weapon (in the police interviews, Quick guessed a camping axe, a spade and a car jack before arriving at the correct answer – a wooden club). The incorrect guesses were not mentioned in court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/thomas-quick-bergwall-sweden-murder  Elizabeth Day ''The Observer'' Saturday 20 October 2012 ''Thomas Quick, the serial killer that never was'']&lt;/ref&gt; Sentence quashed: September 2010.
*Therese Johannesen, [[Drammen]], [[Norway]], 1988, sentenced in 1998 – bone fragments presented as forensic evidence turned out to be hardboard. Sentence quashed: March 2011.
*Trine Jensen, [[Oslo]], 1981, sentenced in 2000 – no forensic evidence. Sentence quashed: September 2012.
*Gry Storvik, Oslo, 1985 – no forensic evidence, confession; the semen found in victim did not belong to Quick. Sentence quashed: September 2012.

In Sweden a defendant always gains access to the full police investigation prior to the trial. Quick's lawyer [[Claes Borgström]] has been criticised for failing to protect his mentally disturbed client's objective interest in being judged not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/debatt/dn-debatt-jag-anmaler-mig-sjalv-till-advokatsamfundet/|title=DN Debatt: "Jag anmäler mig själv till advokatsamfundet"|work=DN.SE|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confessions and subsequent withdrawals==
In the years following 1990, when Quick was sentenced to closed psychiatric confinement, he confessed to several well publicised unsolved murders.&lt;ref name="The Local"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/16350/20081215/ "Quick retracts serial murder confessions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218093752/http://www.thelocal.se/16350/20081215/ |date=2008-12-18 }}, The Local - Sweden's News in English, December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His first murder, according to his own accounts, occurred in Växjö in 1964, when Quick was only 14 years old. The victim, Thomas Blomgren, was described by Quick as being the same age but not as strong and tall as himself. At the time of his confession, the murder was already subject to the [[statute of limitations]] which Bergwall/Quick later admitted was a reason for confessing; but later, it transpired that Quick had a watertight alibi. On the day of the murder he was attending his own confirmation with his family at the Pentecostal Church.

The second alleged victim was [[Alvar Larsson]], whom Quick claimed to have murdered at Sirkön in the lake Åsnen outside the town of [[Urshult]]. According to Quick's sister, Quick never left Falun at the time of the murder.

The credibility of Quick's confessions had been widely debated in the Swedish media since 1993, up until 2008, when Quick withdrew all of his confessions.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt; There have been consistent doubts about the reliability of his statements, and some of his confessions have been proven to be fabrications – The two African refugees Quick confessed to murdering in Norway were found to be alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hallandsposten.se/asikter/ledare/1.1722865-ett-fall-for-justitiekanslern|title=Ett fall för justitiekanslern|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DNA sample from a crime in Norway was subsequently found to be a mismatch, and there was no technical forensic evidence to link Quick to any of the crimes. Another dubious circumstance is the fact that no witnesses have ever testified to seeing Quick in the proximity of any of the crime scenes, even though more than 10,000 people were interviewed for intricate details. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Critics of these confessions and the trials claim that Quick never murdered anyone, but that he is a compulsive liar. Among the critics are the parents of a child he confessed to having murdered in the late 1970s. In response to these accusations, Quick himself wrote an article for the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' in 2001 in which he said that he refused to cooperate further with the authorities concerning all open murder investigations. 
[[File:Bergwall and Svensson.jpg|thumb|May 2009: Quick's brother Sten-Owe Bergwall and lawyer [[Pelle Svensson]] with the books they authored, in which they criticise the Swedish authorities' handling of the Thomas Quick cases.]]

In November 2006, Thomas Quick's trials were reported to the Swedish [[Chancellor of Justice]] by retired lawyer [[Pelle Svensson]] on behalf of the parents of a murder victim who wished to have the trials declared invalid. Several principals in the fields of [[law]] and [[psychiatry]], among them Swedish criminologist and television crime commentator  [[Leif G. W. Persson]] and two police officers involved in the investigation of the murders who refused to involve themselves further in the investigations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Av: Ntb |url=http://www.bt.no/innenriks/article317044.ece |title=Visste Quick var uskyldig |publisher=bt.no |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117234326/http://www.bt.no/innenriks/article317044.ece |archivedate=2008-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all claim that Quick has a history of mental illness, but it was unlikely he was guilty of any of the crimes to which he had confessed. The handling of the Quick cases  has been described as the "most scandalous" chapter of Scandinavian crime history, branding it as glaring incompetence, naiveté, and opportunism within the police and judicial system.

Quick withdrew all of his confessions in 2008 during the recording of a TV documentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|epx1X2cuc-U|''Thomas Quick del 1''}} {{sv icon}}. ''Thomas Quick, part 1''Sveriges Television ''Swedish Television''  (hosted on YouTube). At 21 min 57 sec is an interview with [[Gregg McCrary]], FBI security consultant,  in English (Swedish subtitles)&lt;/ref&gt; made by prize-winning investigative journalist [[Hannes Råstam]], who died shortly before his book version was published.

Quick's attorney contended that the prosecution withheld important investigative material from the defence (which the prosecution adamantly denied). Quick's attorney claimed that his client is mentally ill and was being given prescription drugs ([[benzodiazepine]]) when he confessed to the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Stockholm, ''Sweden News'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments were some of the grounds for quashing all the eight murder convictions in six trials and six appeals.

Thomas Quick, now having reverted to his birth name Sture Bergwall, recanted his confessions and requested the [[Svea Court of Appeal]] order a new trial for the murder case of Yenon Levi at Rörshyttan. In December 2009, the court of appeal granted a retrial of the Yenon Levi case. In the judgment, the court found that the lower court had heard that Quick correctly identified the murder weapon. However, information had been withheld from the court that initially, Quick had made many erroneous attempts to identify the murder weapon before finally giving an account that corresponded with police findings.

Quick moved for a judgment of acquittal, and was acquitted in September 2010. Quick's counsel also declared his intention to ask for a retrial of the Therese Johannesen case, claiming that Quick had an alibi for the day when Therese Johannesen was abducted and murdered. SKL (''Statens kriminaltekniska laboratorium'' The Swedish State Forensic  Laboratory) found in March 2010 that two exhibits claimed by the prosecution to be bone fragments were, in fact, pieces of hardboard.  A retrial was granted, and Quick formally acquitted when the prosecutor dropped the charges.

On 30 July 2013, Quick was acquitted of the last of eight murder  convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/49360/20130731/ Sweden drops final 'serial killer' murder charge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801200328/http://www.thelocal.se/49360/20130731/ |date=2013-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;Karl Ritter: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/sture-bergwall_n_3681780.html ''Sture Bergwall Case: Prosecutors Drop Last Remaining Charges Against Suspected Swedish Serial Killer''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803184200/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/sture-bergwall_n_3681780.html |date=2013-08-03 }}.

Sture Bergwall has been released from Säter's institution for the criminally insane and most of the treatment plan has been made confidential and subject to secrecy.

==Film==
A 2015 documentary film, ''The Confessions of Thomas Quick'', recounted Bergwall's life and his murder confessions and retractions, including interviews with Bergwall and other participants in the events. In it Bergwall explained that he made the confessions to gain attention due to profound loneliness. The documentary claims that Bergwall knew little about each murder, but was fed details during questioning, enabling him to build up enough information to persuade people he had carried them out. It also claims that as a result of his confessions Bergwall was given privileged treatment in the hospital, including drugs and therapy on demand, his own office with computer and Internet access, and restaurant meals when going out to visit murder sites, and that this may have encouraged him to continue confessing to more and more crimes.

The 'TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE®' is an annual event organized by [[American Sail Training Association|Tall Ships America]] alternating in a three year cycle between the [[Great Lakes]], the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic]] coasts of [[North America]].

The event draws hundreds of thousands of people to witness beautiful [[tall ship]]s from the age of sail and provides a unique opportunity for the participants to interact with the crews of different vessels in friendly rivalry as they race from port to port.

The series began in 2001 on the Great Lakes and saw vessels from six countries and visited seven [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] ports. Since its launch, the TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE® series has visited dozens of North American cities, bringing millions of spectators down to the waterfront to experience the tall ships and creating a cumulative economic impact of hundreds of millions of dollars for host communities. It has continued to grow every year and is an eagerly anticipated event in the seaside communities that host the vessels (see, for example Philadelphia's [[Summer Sail]] 2007)and beyond. 

Each year, the TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE® series is designated a Marine Event of National Significance by the [[US Coast Guard]]. 

Tall Ships America summer interns maintain a blog about their experiences called the [http://tallshipschallenge.wordpress.com/ Official Blog of the Tall Ships Challenge series]

"'''Tom Dooley'''" is a [[North Carolina]] [[folk song]] based on the 1866 murder of a woman named Laura Foster in [[Wilkes County, North Carolina]], allegedly by [[Tom Dula]]. The song is best known today because of a hit version recorded in [[1958 in music|1958]] by [[The Kingston Trio]]. This version was a multi-format hit, which reached #1 in ''Billboard'' and the ''Billboard'' R&amp;B listing, and appeared in the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Country Music Top 20. It fits within the wider genre of [[Appalachia]]n "sweetheart [[murder ballad]]s".

The song was selected as one of the American [[Songs of the Century]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and [[Scholastic Inc.]] Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.&lt;ref name="Top100"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs|author=Western Writers of America|year=2010|authorlink=Western Writers of America|publisher=American Cowboy|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archivedate=10 August 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local poet named Thomas Land wrote a song about the tragedy, titled "Tom Dooley" (which was how Dula's name was pronounced), shortly after Dula was hanged.&lt;ref name="Fresno State University"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Ballad Index| publisher=Fresno State University| url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/LF36.html| title=Murder of Laura Foster, The [Laws F36]|authors=Waltz, Robert B. &amp; Enge, David G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trimble, Marshall"&gt;{{cite news|work=True West Magazine|title= Ask the Marshall: What is the story behind the folk song 'Tom Dooley?'|author=Trimble, Marshall |date=September 25, 2009 |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/what-is-the-story-behind-the-folk-song-tom-dooley/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''Appalachian Journey'' (1991), folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] inaccurately describes [[Frank Proffitt]] as the "original source" for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appalachian Journey|author=Lomax, Alan|date=1991|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/film%2C128|publisher=[[Anna Lomax Wood#Association for Cultural Equity|Association for Cultural Equity]] |edition=PBS American Patchwork Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are several earlier known recordings, notably the one by [[G. B. Grayson|Grayson]] and [[Henry Whitter|Whitter]] made in 1929, approximately 10 years before Proffitt cut his own recording, the Kingston Trio took their version from [[Frank Warner (folklorist)|Frank Warner]]'s singing. Warner had learned the song from Proffitt, who learned it from his Aunt Nancy Prather, whose parents had known both Laura Foster and Tom Dula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Ronald |date=2002 |title=Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940-1970 |publisher=University Of Massachusetts Press |page=132 |isbn=978-1-55849-348-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1967 interview, [[Nick Reynolds]] of the Kingston Trio recounts first hearing the song from another performer, and then being criticized and sued for taking credit for the song.&lt;ref name=pc18/&gt;

== History ==
In 1866, Laura Foster was murdered. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran [[Tom Dula]], Foster's lover and the father of her unborn child, was convicted of her murder and hanged May 1, 1868. Foster had been stabbed to death with a large knife, and the brutality of the attack partly accounted for the widespread publicity the murder and subsequent trial received.

Anne Foster Melton, Laura's cousin, had been Dula's lover from the time he was twelve and until  he left for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] – even after Anne married an older man named James Melton. When Dula returned, he became a lover again to both Anne, then Laura, then their cousin Pauline Foster.  It was Pauline's comments that led to the discovery of Foster's body and accusations against both Tom and Anne.  Anne was subsequently acquitted in a separate trial, based on Dula's word that she had nothing to do with the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=True West Magazine|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/ask-the-marshall/2948-what-is-the-story-behind-the-folk-song-tom-dooley|title=What is the story behind the folk song 'Tom Dooley?'|author=Trimble, Marshall|date=September 25, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dula's enigmatic statement on the gallows that he had not harmed Foster but still deserved his punishment led to press speculation that Melton was the actual killer and that Dula simply covered for her. (Melton, who had once expressed jealousy of Dula's purported plans to marry Foster, died either in a carting accident or by going insane a few years after the homicide, depending on the version.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}})

Thanks to the efforts of newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', and to the fact that former North Carolina governor [[Zebulon Vance]] represented Dula ''pro bono'', Dula's murder trial and hanging were given widespread national publicity. A local poet, Thomas C. Land, wrote a popular song about Dula's tragedy soon after Dula was hanged, titled "Tom Dooley". This, combined with the widespread publicity the trial received, further cemented Dula’s place in North Carolina legend.&lt;ref name="Fresno State University"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trimble, Marshall"/&gt; Land's song is still sung today throughout North Carolina.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A man named "Grayson", mentioned in the song as pivotal in Dula's downfall, has sometimes been characterized as a romantic rival of Dula's or a vengeful sheriff who captured him and presided over his hanging. Some variant lyrics of the song portray Grayson in that light, and the spoken introduction to the Kingston Trio version&lt;ref name=pc18&gt;{{Gilliland |title=Show 18 – Blowin' in the Wind: Pop discovers folk music. [Part 1] |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19768/m1/ |show=18 |track=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; did the same. Col. James Grayson was actually a Tennessee politician who had hired Dula on his farm when the young man fled North Carolina under suspicion and was using a false name. Grayson did help North Carolinians capture Dula and was involved in returning him to North Carolina, but otherwise played no role in the case.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Dula was tried in [[Statesville, North Carolina|Statesville]], because it was believed he could not get a fair trial in Wilkes County. He was given a new trial on appeal but he was again convicted, and hanged on May 1, 1868. On the gallows, Dula reportedly stated, "Gentlemen, do you see this hand? I didn't harm a hair on the girl's head."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Dula's last name was pronounced "Dooley," leading to some confusion in spelling over the years. The pronunciation of a final "a" like "y"{{clarifyme|date=October 2018}} is an old feature in [[Appalachian English|Appalachian]] speech, as in the term "[[Grand Ole Opry#Name|Grand Ole Opry]]".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The confusion was compounded by the fact that [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III|Dr. Tom Dooley]], an American physician known for international humanitarian work, was at the height of his fame in 1958, when the Kingston Trio version became a major hit.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Recordings ==
{{cleanup|section|reason=see [[WP:SONGCOVER]]|date=January 2018}}
Several notable recordings have been made:

* In 1929, [[G. B.

* [[Frank Warner (folklorist)|Frank Warner]], [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], 1952. Warner, a folklorist, unaware of the 1929 recording, in 1940 took down the song from [[Frank Proffitt]] and passed it to [[Alan Lomax]] who published it in ''Folk Song: USA''.

*[[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] recorded a version on their album ''Dona Got a Ramblin' Mind'' (2006).
*[[Neil Young]] together with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] recorded an eight-minute version on their 2012 album ''[[Americana (Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse album)|Americana]]'' (2012), on which they retitled the song to the proper spelling "Tom Dula" and pronounced it in such a way as to make it a political statement against former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.
*[[Macabre (band)|Macabre Minstrels]] (a side project of the metal band Macabre) recorded a version on their EP ''[[Macabre Minstrels: Morbid Campfire Songs|Morbid Campfire Songs]]'' (2002).

(It was the third song on his album "Seine großen Erfolge 4.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Heino-Seine-Gro%C3%9Fen-Erfolge-4/release/4077845 |title=Heino – Seine Großen Erfolge 4 (Vinyl, LP) |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The chorus of the song is sung by camp counsellors in the horror film, ''Friday the 13th'' (1980), which opens with a flashback to 1958.

===Parodies===

"Tom Dooley" prompted a number of parodies, either as part of other songs or as entire songs. For example:
*[[The Four Preps]] used this song and [[Worried Man Blues]] to make fun of The Kingston Trio in their song ''More Money For You and Me''.
* [[Ella Fitzgerald]] drops an altered line from the song into a recording of "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]"
*The [[Incredible Bongo Band]] recorded the song "Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley, Your Tie's Caught In Your Zipper" (1972).

== In film and television ==

The Kingston Trio hit inspired the film, ''[[The Legend of Tom Dooley]]'' (1959), starring [[Michael Landon]], co-starring [[Richard Rust]]. A [[Western (genre)|Western]] set after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], it was not about traditional Tom Dula legends or the facts of the case, but a fictional treatment tailored to fit the lyrics of the song.

"Tom Dooley" is the name of a season 5 episode of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', in which [[John Cage (character)|John Cage]] sings a version of the song with his Mexican band.

The song was parodied in episode #702 of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. [[Crow T. Robot]], motivated by one actor's resemblance to [[Thomas Dewey]], sang a version beginning "Hang down your head, ''Tom Dewey''."

'''Political war-weariness''' is the [[public]] or political disapproval for the continuation of a prolonged conflict or [[war]]. The causes normally involve the intensity of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]]—financial, [[civilian]], and [[military]]. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to easily leave the conflict yet continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in [[government]] or military leadership and can spark protest and [[anti-war movement|anti-war movements]]. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of [[war crime|war crimes]], which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the [[morale]] of the armed-forces are often affected by war-weariness.

War-weariness is less likely to appear in [[Military dictatorship|military dictatorships]], especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. According to [[Immanuel Kant]], democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, increasing their chance and level of war-weariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Causes War?: An Introduction to Theories of International Conflict|last=Cashman|first=Greg|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=0742566528|location=|pages=234-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''War on Terror''', also known as the '''Global War on Terrorism''', is an international military campaign that was launched by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] after the [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Schmitt/slogan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/politics/26strategy.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Officials Retool Slogan for Terror War|first=|newspaper= New York Times|date=26 July 2005|author=Eric Schmitt|author2=Thom Shanker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The naming of the campaign uses a [[War as metaphor|metaphor of war]] to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] first used the [[Slogans and terms derived from the September 11 attacks|term]] "''war on terrorism"'' on 16 September 2001,&lt;ref name="evilwar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evilwar2" /&gt; and then "''war on terror''" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress.&lt;ref name="whitehousejoint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;  In the latter speech, George Bush stated, "Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them."&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html|title=washingtonpost.com|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with [[al-Qaeda]].  The term was immediately criticised by such people as [[Richard B. Myers]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and more nuanced ones subsequently came to be used by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S.;&lt;ref name="Schmitt/slogan" /&gt; it was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation.&lt;ref name="Ambinder2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Term for the War on Terror |author=Marc Ambinder |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/05/the-new-term-for-the-war-on-terror/56969/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror is over, saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/23/obama-global-war-on-terror-is-over|title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 2014, the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-war-idUSKBN0K60FB20141228|title=U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan ends combat role; thousands of…|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unexpected rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] terror group led to a new operation against terror in the Middle East and South Asia, [[Operation Inherent Resolve]].

[[Criticism of the War on Terror]] focused on morality, efficiency, economics; some, including later president [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/white-house-war-terrorism-over/ White House: ‘War on terrorism’ is over] August 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="declover" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehdefuniv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terrorover" /&gt; objected to the phrase itself as a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003" /&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI" /&gt; and infringe upon human rights. Critics also assert that the term "war" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term "[[War on Drugs]]") since there is no identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Terminology}}Etymology==

[[File:OCO GWOT.jpg|thumb|Letter from Barack Obama indicating appropriation of Congressional funds for "Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism"]]

The phrase "War on Terror" has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the U.S., U.K. and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist, and usually excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by Russia and India. The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror. It has also been known as:

===History of use of the phrase and its rejection by the U.S. government===
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}
In 1984, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], which had significantly expanded the CIA-run [[Operation Cyclone|program of funding]] the [[Mujahideen|Jihadi militants in Afghanistan]], employed the term "war against terrorism" to pass legislation aimed at countering terrorist groups in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] that killed 241 U.S. and 58 French [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |work=Time Magazine |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] called the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing "the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since—the global war on terror,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-says-war-terror-began-911-hezbollah-attack-us-troops-691653|title=Mike Pence says Hezbollah started the war on terror with a 1983 attack in Beirut|date=24 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the U.S. at war with terrorism may have begun on 11 September 2001 when [[Tom Brokaw]], having just witnessed the collapse of one of the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], declared "Terrorists have declared war on [America]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=1419 |title=Breaking News on September 11th |author=[[Matt Lauer]] |author2=[[Katie Couric]] |author3=Tom Brokaw |date=11 September 2001 |website=NBC Learn K-12 |publisher=NBCUniversal Media |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2001, at [[Camp David]], U.S. president George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terrorism'' in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question about the impact of enhanced law enforcement authority given to the [[Mass surveillance in the United States|U.S. surveillance]] agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil.  And we understand.  And the American people are beginning to understand.  This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.  And the American people must be patient.  I'm going to be patient."&lt;ref name="evilwar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505200651/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archivedate=5 May 2010 |title=Kenneth R.

[http://hv.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=006SM3 Greenspun.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.  It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated."&lt;ref name=whitehousejoint&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People] The White House, 20 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnntranscript&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date= 20 September 2001 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the British government announced publicly that it was abandoning the use of the phrase "War on Terror" as they found it to be less than helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Reynolds|first=Paul |date=17 April 2007 |title=Declining use of 'war on terror' |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6562709.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was explained more recently by Lady [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]].

In May 2010, the Obama administration published a report outlining its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]].  The document dropped the Bush-era phrase "global war on terror" and reference to "Islamic extremism," and stated, "This is not a global war against a tactic  —  terrorism, or a religion  —  Islam. We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda, and its terrorist affiliates who support efforts to attack the United States, our allies, and partners."&lt;ref name=declover&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/7772598/Barack-Obama-declares-the-War-on-Terror-is-over.html Barack Obama declares the 'War on Terror' is over: President Barack Obama has rejected George W.

In May 2013, two years after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassination]] of [[Osama bin Laden]], Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term ''global war on terror'' put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. &lt; ... &gt; But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. &lt; ... &gt; From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation  —  and world  —  that we leave to our children.  So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."  &lt; ... &gt; In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. &lt; ... &gt;  Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless "global war on terror," but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war  —  a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″&lt;ref name=whitehdefuniv&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university Remarks by the President at the National Defense University] The White House, 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terrorover&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over |author=Paul D.

===The rhetorical war on terror===

Because the actions involved in the "war on terrorism" are diffuse, and the criteria for inclusion are unclear, political theorist Richard Jackson has argued that "the 'war on terrorism,' therefore, is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson cites among many examples a statement by [[John Ashcroft]] that "the attacks of September 11 drew a bright line of demarcation between the civil and the savage".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials also described "terrorists" as hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without faith, [[Parasitism|parasitical]], inhuman, and, most commonly, evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 62–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans, in contrast, were described as brave, loving, generous, strong, resourceful, heroic, and respectful of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], human rights abuses and other violations of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, "Combating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regime", ''Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights," Vol. 12 (Double Issue), 2008, pp.379–397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

===Precursor to the September 11 attacks===
{{See also|Islamic terrorism|List of Islamist terrorist attacks}}

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced back to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (December 1979 – February 1989). The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, [[Pakistan]], and the People's Republic of China supported the [[Islamism|Islamist]] Afghan [[mujahadeen]] [[guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. A small number of "Afghan Arab" volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including [[Osama bin Laden]], but there is no evidence they received any external assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of Al-Qaeda's Leader|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders (WIFJAJC), sponsored by bin Laden (and later re-formed as al-Qaeda), started forming a large base of operations in [[Afghanistan]], where the Islamist extremist regime of the [[Taliban]] had seized power earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;The group was also responsible for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]].{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224|title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally|date=6 December 2001|author=Megan K.

On 20 September 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt; The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the 11 September attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date=21 September 2001 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601224636/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. refused to provide any evidence.

Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and coalition allies) invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting [[airstrike]] campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, [[Fall of Kabul|fell by mid-November]]. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) [[Battle of Tora Bora|fought within that region]]. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29torabora.html?_r=1 |title=Senate Report Explores 2001 Escape by bin Laden From Afghan Mountains |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Scott |last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/osama-bin-laden-senate-report |title=Rumsfeld let Bin Laden escape in 2001, says Senate report |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, the U.S. and other [[NATO]] and non-NATO forces launched [[Operation Anaconda]] with the goal of destroying any remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]] of Afghanistan.

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the U.S. troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around {{nowrap|12 billion}} in Pakistani Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/01/29/war-on-terror-cost-of-us-taxpayers-patience/#.TtjwPLLNllk |title=Afghan war cost rise tests US taxpayers' patience |publisher=Thenewstribe.com |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=1 June 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=16 June 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=8 May 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |date=3 February 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iran]]. Hussein's regime had proven to be a problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iranian people|Iranians]] and [[Kurds]] in the 1980s.

===Iraqi no-fly zones===

Following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the United States and its allies instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] population—both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War—in Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. U.S. forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet U.S. demands for "unconditional cooperation" in weapons inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down U.S. aircraft.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]]. The Bush administration stated the invasion was the "serious consequences" spoken of in the UNSC Resolution 1441, partially by [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction]]. The Bush administration also [[Iraq War and U.S. Global War on Terror|stated the Iraq war]] was part of the War on Terror; something later [[Criticism of the War on Terror|questioned or contested]].

The first ground attack came at the [[Battle of Umm Qasr]] on 21 March 2003 when a combined force of British, American and Polish forces seized control of the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Nick |last2=McCarthy |first2=Rory |date=23 March 2003 |title=Fierce battle around port |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/24/iraq.rorymccarthy |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=17 March 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Ryan|title=Baghdad or Bust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhjOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|date=4 December 2003|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-020-5|pages=136–137}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|author=Leigh Neville|title=Special Operations Forces in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&amp;pg=PA10|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-826-8|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Baghdad, Iraq's capital city, fell]] to American troops in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein's government quickly dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Beth Norton|author2=Carol Sheriff|author3=David M.

The rebellion, which included [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|al-Qaeda-affiliated groups]], led to far more coalition casualties [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|than the invasion]]. Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's [[Ba'ath]] regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and [[pan-Arabist]]s.

In 2004, the insurgent forces grew stronger. The U.S. conducted attacks on insurgent strongholds in cities like [[Battle of Najaf (2004)|Najaf]] and [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Fallujah]].

In January 2007, President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this "new way forward" and, along with U.S. backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat, has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.

In a major split in the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]] covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began participating in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a [[blitzkrieg]]-like action and combining the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–14)|Iraq insurgency]] and [[Syrian Civil War]] into a single conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/ctc-perspectives-al-baghdadis-blitzkrieg-isils-psychological-warfare-and-what-it-means-for-syria-and-iraq |title=CTC Perspectives: Al-Baghdadi's Blitzkrieg, ISIL's Psychological Warfare, and What it Means for Syria and Iraq |last1=Price |first1=Bryan |last2=Milton |first2=Dan |last3=al-'Ubaydi |first3=Muhammad |date=12 June 2014 |website=Combating Terrorism Center |publisher=United States Military Academy |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Calamur |first=Krishnadev |date=13 June 2014 |title=ISIS: An Islamist Group Too Extreme Even For Al-Qaida |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/13/321665375/isis-an-islamist-group-too-extreme-even-for-al-qaida |newspaper=National Public Radio |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts{{who|date=September 2014}} believe that because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-between-isis-and-al-qaeda-for-supremacy-of-the-global-jihadist|title=The War between ISIS and al-Qaeda for Supremacy of the Global Jihadist Movement – The Washington Institute for Near East Policy|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the U.S. against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by then U.S. President George W. Bush. Musharraf agreed to give the U.S. the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other U.S. administration officials met with Musharraf. On 19 September 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the U.S. if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the U.S., and revealed in his memoirs that he had "war-gamed" the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm|title= Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced U.S. 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=USA Today|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, "the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits won't be allowed to resurface |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=5 December 2003 |first=Rafaqat |last=Ali |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317081424/http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and arrested [[Maulana Masood Azhar]], head of the [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]], and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]], chief of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and took dozens of activists into custody.

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the area.

After the fall of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] still operates there. To this day it is estimated that 15 U.S. soldiers were killed while fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom &amp;#124; Afghanistan |publisher=iCasualties |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406083558/http://icasualties.org/oef/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the [[U.S. Air Force]] for strikes in Pakistan to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a report on drone warfare and [[Airspace|aerial sovereignty]] for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.

In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately {{nowrap|US$9 million}} in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to {{nowrap|US$4.2 billion}}, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

===Baluchistan===
An uprising in [[Baluchistan]] began after Pakistan invaded and occupied the territory in 1948. Various NGOs have reported human rights violations in committed by Pakistani armed forces. Approximately 18,000 Baluch residents are reportedly missing and about 2000 have been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/balochistans-missing-persons/|title=Balochistan's Missing Persons|first=Kiran Nazish, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Enduring Freedom&amp;nbsp;– Trans Sahara===
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara}}

[[File:Northern Mali conflict.svg|thumb]]

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the U.S. and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

The [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in northern Mali]] began in January 2012 with radical Islamists (affiliated to al-Qaeda) advancing into northern Mali. The Malian government had a hard time maintaining full control over their country. The fledgling government requested support from the international community on combating the Islamic militants. In January 2013, France intervened on behalf of the Malian government's request and deployed troops into the region. They launched [[Operation Serval]] on 11 January 2013, with the hopes of dislodging the al-Qaeda affiliated groups from northern Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali conflict: militants killed as French air strikes pound rebel camps|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/mali-crisis-militants-killed-french-jets|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2013|location=London|first=Nick|last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF-HOA. Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE–HORN OF AFRICA |publisher=United States Africa Command |url=http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426223216/http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archivedate=26 April 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Lemonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10504.pdf |title=DOD Needs to Determine the Future of Its Horn of Africa Task Force |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and special operations forces (SOF) and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150).

Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the United States' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counter-terrorism and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], Niger, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include Sudan, where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the al-Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref name="BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |title=Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia has been considered a "[[failed state]]" because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of "law and order" through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On 14 December 2006, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.&lt;ref name="US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |title=U.S. says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On 20 December 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened for the government.

By 26 December, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]]. The ICU then fled to [[Kismayo]], where they fought Ethiopian/TFG forces in the [[Battle of Jilib]].

The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three "terror suspects" from the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] are being sheltered in Kismayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/13/usa.terrorism |work=The Guardian |location=London | title=Secret world of US jails | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=13 June 2004 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006, al-Qaeda deputy leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_20090227.html?_r=1|title= Backgrounder: Al-Shabaab |work=The New York Times|author=Stephanie Hanson|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2007, the U.S. launched the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] by bombing [[Ras Kamboni]] using [[AC-130]] gunships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242460,00.html |title=U.S. Launches Attack on Suspected Al Qaeda Members in Somalia |publisher=Fox News |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106210324/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242460,00.html# |archive-date=6 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2009, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Special Forces]] killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of [[Baraawe raid|Baarawe]]. Witnesses claim that helicopters used for the operation launched from French-flagged warships, but that could not be confirmed.

On 19 March 2011, a multi-state coalition began a military action in Libya, ostensibly to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]].

''NBC News'' reported that in mid-2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|ISIS had about 1,000 fighters in Libya]]. Taking advantage of a power vacuum in the center of the country, far from the major cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, ISIS expanded rapidly over the next 18 months. Local militants were joined by jihadists from the rest of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. The force absorbed or defeated other Islamist groups inside Libya and the central ISIS leadership in Raqqa, Syria, began urging foreign recruits to head for Libya instead of Syria. ISIS seized control of the coastal city of [[Sirte]] in early 2015 and then began to expand to the east and south. By the beginning of 2016, it had effective control of 120 to 150 miles of coastline and portions of the interior and had reached Eastern Libya's major population center, [[Benghazi]]. In spring 2016, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] estimated that ISIS had about 5,000 fighters in its stronghold of Sirte.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/did-obama-defeat-isis-libya-n709001|title=Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya?|publisher=NBC news|date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the indigenous rebel groups who had staked their claims to Libya and turned their weapons on ISIS — with the help of airstrikes by Western forces, including U.S. drones, the Libyan population resented the outsiders who wanted to establish a fundamentalist regime on their soil. Militias loyal to the new Libyan unity government, plus a separate and rival force loyal to a former officer in the Qaddafi regime, [[Battle of Sirte (2016)|launched an assault on ISIS outposts in Sirte]] and the surrounding areas that lasted for months. According to U.S. military estimates, ISIS ranks shrank to somewhere between a few hundred and 2,000 fighters. In August 2016, the [[Military intervention against ISIL#Intervention in Libya|U.S. military began airstrikes]] that, along with continued pressure on the ground from the Libyan militias, pushed the remaining ISIS fighters back into Sirte, In all, U.S. drones and planes hit ISIS nearly 590 times, the Libyan militias reclaimed the city in mid-December.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt; On January 18, 2017, ''ABC News'' reported that two USAF [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] struck two ISIS camps {{convert|28|mi}} south of Sirte, the airstrikes targeted between 80 and 100 ISIS fighters in multiple camps, an unmanned aircraft also participated in the airstrikes. ''NBC News'' reported that as many as 90 ISIS fighters were killed in the strike, a U.S. defense official said that "This was the largest remaining ISIS presence in Libya," and that "They have been largely marginalized, but I am hesitant to say they have been eliminated in Libya."&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt;

[[File:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|The United Kingdom is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]]]

The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On 12 September 2001, less than 24 hours after the 11 September attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., NATO invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] also stated that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, NATO took a broad range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On 22 November 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism, which explicitly states, "[The] EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the "coalition of the willing" countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring Pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (Waziristan War). Supported by U.S. intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorist attacks and failed plots since 9/11==

===Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|al-Qaeda}}

Since 9/11, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated radical Islamist groups have executed attacks in several parts of the world where conflicts are not taking place. Whereas countries like Pakistan have suffered hundreds of attacks killing tens of thousands and displacing much more.
* The [[2002 Bali bombings]] in Indonesia were committed by various members of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], an organization linked to Al-Qaeda.
* The [[2003 Casablanca bombings]] were carried out by [[Salafia Jihadia]], an Al-Qaeda affiliate.
* After the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], Turkey charged 74 people with involvement, including Syrian Al-Qaeda member [[Loai al-Saqa]].
* The [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Spain were "inspired by" Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement has been established.
* The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in the United Kingdom were perpetrated by four [[Homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]], one of whom appeared in an edited video with a known Al-Qaeda operative, though the British government denies Al-Qaeda involvement.
* Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the [[11 April 2007 Algiers bombings]] in Algeria.
* The [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]] in the United Kingdom was carried out by a pair of bombers whose laptops and suicide notes included videos and speeches referencing Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement was established.
* The [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] in the United States was committed by [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], who had been in communication with [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], though the Department of Defense classifies the shooting as an incidence of workplace violence.
* Morocco blames Al-Qaeda for the [[2011 Marrakech bombing]], though Al-Qaeda denies involvement.
* The 2012 [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings]] in France were committed by Mohammed Merah, who reportedly had familial ties to Al-Qaeda, along with a history of petty crime and psychological issues. Merah claimed ties to Al-Qaeda, though French authorities deny any connection.
* To date, no one has been convicted for the 2012 [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi]] in Libya, and no one has claimed responsibility. Branches of Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda affiliates, and individuals "sympathetic to Al-Qaeda" are blamed.
* The gunmen in the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] in Paris identified themselves as belonging to Al-Qaeda's [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|branch in Yemen]].

==Post 9/11 events inside the United States==
&lt;!--Maybe some other title is more appropriate--&gt;
{{main|Patriot Act}}
{{further|Detentions following the September 11 attacks|Aftermath of the September 11 attacks}}

[[File:Liberty.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] helicopter patrols the airspace over New York City]]

In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies that handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the U.S. federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]] for certain male non-citizens in the U.S., requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by ''[[The New York Times]]''). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/double-danger-nsa-surveillance |title=The double danger of the NSA's 'collect it all' policy on surveillance &amp;#124; Rachel Levinson-Waldman &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is being collected and monitored through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On 30 July 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries – First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122043434/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, governing bodies in many communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

[[File:John Walker Lindh Custody.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Walker Lindh]] was captured as an enemy combatant during the United States' [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]]]

In a speech on 9 June 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile, the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by many states. These conventions require states to co-operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft, the physical protection of nuclear materials, and the freezing of assets of militant networks.&lt;ref&gt;Cindy C Combs (2003), Terrorism in the Twenty First Century, (3rd Edition, New Jersey: Pearsons Educ. Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611145715/http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |archivedate=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations, the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name "National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism", which stated that it constituted the "comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense".

On 9 January 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299–128, enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the U.S. Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|date=27 January 2015|website=senate.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 60–38, on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110-53. In July 2012, U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging that the [[Haqqani Network]] be designated a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-cong-votes-for-designating-haqqani-network-as-terror-group/980665/|title= US Cong votes for designating Haqqani network as terror group| date= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that U.S. government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the United States, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Such thwarted attacks include:
* The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
* A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
* The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
* The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]], which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in Washington, D.C., the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
* The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
* The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
* The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
* The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
* The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its forces from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

==Transnational actions==
==="Extraordinary rendition"===

After the September 11 attacks, the United States government commenced a program of illegal "[[extraordinary rendition]]," sometimes referred to as "irregular rendition" or "forced rendition," the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to transferee countries, with the consent of transferee countries.&lt;ref name="54 countries"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of extraordinary rendition is often conducting [[torture]] on the detainee that would be difficult to conduct in the U.S. legal environment, a practice known as [[torture by proxy]].

===Rendition to "Black Sites===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA kidnapping of detainees and their transport to "[[black site]]s," covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report connecting use of such secret detention Black Sites for detainees kidnapped as part of extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). Although some Black Sites have been known to exist inside [[European Union]] states, these detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity with the CIA relocating the detainees. Almost all of these detainees were tortured as part of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" of the CIA.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major American newspapers, such as the "[[The Washington Post]]," have been criticized for deliberately withholding publication of articles reporting locations of Black Sites. The Post defended its decision to suppress this news on the ground that such revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad." However, according to [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journalists who exposed this provided their sources and this information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified such Black Sites are concealed:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

The journalists went on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]].

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==

According to Joshua Goldstein, an [[international relations]] professor at the [[American University]], The Global War on Terror has seen fewer war deaths than any other decade in the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war "Think Again: War"]. ''Foreign Policy Magazine'', 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and operations elsewhere. The [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] and the Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Global Survival give total estimates ranging from {{nowrap|1.3 million}} to {{nowrap|2 million}} casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/study-1-3-million-killed-in-usa-war-on-terror/article/429180|title=Doctors' group says 1.3 million killed in U.S. 'War on Terror'|date=25 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from 2018 by Brown University's [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]] puts the total number of casualties of the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan between 480,000 and 507,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 9, 2018 |title=US 'war on terror' has killed over half a million people: study|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/wars-terror-killed-million-people-study-181109080620011.html|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|location= |access-date=November 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates for regional conflicts include the following:

According to the Costs of War Project at [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs|Brown University's Watson Institute]], the War on Terror will have cost $5.6 trillion for operations between 2001-2018 plus anticipated future costs of veterans' care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Tom|title=America's 'War on Terror' Has Cost Taxpayers $5.6 Trillion|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-war-on-terror-has-cost-taxpayers-5-6-trillion/|accessdate=20 May 2018|publisher=The Nation|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Soufan Group in July 2015, the U.S. government was spending {{nowrap|$9.4 million}} per day in operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-terrorism-in-the-horn-of-africa/|title = TSG IntelBrief: Terrorism in the Horn of Africa|date = 2015-07-28|accessdate = 2015-07-28|website = The Soufan Group|publisher = |location = New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the War on Terror}}

[[File:World Can't Wait J4 Demo.jpg|thumb|Participants in a rally, dressed as hooded detainees]]

Criticism of the War on Terror addressed the issues, morality, efficiency, economics, and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself, calling it a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 March 2003. Retrieved 28 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=13 March 2008|work=Wired |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]) since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2 September 2004 |work=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archivedate=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic; calling it a "war on terror", obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage, [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Guardian]], 28 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also perceived U.S. hypocrisy,&lt;ref name="odom_terrorismtactic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/214721/original/OdomPaper.pdf |title=American Hegemony: How to Use It, How to Lose It by Gen.

==Other Wars on Terror==

In the 2010s, [[China]] has also been engaged in its own War on Terror, predominantly a domestic campaign in response to violent actions by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] separatist movements in the [[Xinjiang conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-war-terror-september-11-uighur-separatism/p4765|title=China's 'War on Terror': September 11 and Uighur Separatism|date=|website=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was widely criticized in international media due to the perception that it unfairly targets and [[persecutes]] [[Chinese Muslims]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinas-war-on-terror-becomes-all-out-attack-on-islam-in-xinjiang/2014/09/19/5c5840a4-1aa7-4bb6-bc63-69f6bfba07e9_story.html|title=China's war on terror becomes all-out attack on Islam in Xinjiang|author=Simon Denyer|date=19 September 2014|website=Washington Post|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in a negative backlash from [[China]]'s predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] population.

[[Russia]] has also been engaged on its own, also largely internally focused, counter-terrorism campaign often termed a war on terror, during the [[Second Chechen War]], the [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus]], and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2093529,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[China]]'s war on terror, [[Russia]]'s has also been focused on [[separatist]] and [[Islamist]] movements that use [[political violence]] to achieve their ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/10-4_Cohen.PDF | title=Russia, Islam, and the War on Terrorism | first=Ariel | last=Cohen | accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
