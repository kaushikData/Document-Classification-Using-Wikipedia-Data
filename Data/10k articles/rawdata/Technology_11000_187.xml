'''Alfa''' was the designation of an Italian [[ballistic missile]] program that started in 1971 under the control of the GRS (Gruppo di Realizzazione Speciale Interforze). Starting as a development effort for a study on efficient solid-propellant rockets, the Alfa rocket was planned as a two-stage rocket. Test launches with an upper stage mockup took place between 1973 and 1975, from [[Salto di Quirra]].&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/lvs/alfa.htm|title=Alfa|publisher=astronautix.com|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alfa was {{convert|6.5|m}} long and had a diameter of {{convert|1.37|m}}. The first stage of the Alfa was {{convert|3.85|m}} long and contained 6 t of solid rocket fuel. It supplied a thrust of 232&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|kN]] for a duration of 57 seconds. It could carry one tonne warhead for a range of 1,600 kilometres (990&amp;nbsp;mi), placing [[European Russia]] and Moscow in range from the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;

[[Italy]] has been active in the space sector since 1957, conducting launch and control operations from the [[Luigi Broglio Space Centre]]. The advanced Scout and [[Vega launcher]]s currently used by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) derive their technological basis partially from Alfa studies.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

A '''bassinet''', '''bassinette''', or '''cradle''' is a [[bed (furniture)|bed]] specifically for [[babies]] from birth to about four months. Bassinets are generally designed to work with fixed legs or casters, while cradles are generally designed to provide a rocking or gliding motion. Bassinets and cradles are distinguished from '''Moses baskets''' and '''carry cots''', which are designed to be carried and sit directly on the floor or furniture. After four months, babies are often transferred to a [[infant bed|crib]] (North American usage) or [[infant bed|cot]] (UK usage). In the [[United States]], however, the [[bedside sleeper]] is the prevalent option, since they are generally bigger, recommended up to 6 months, and often used up to a year.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} 

==Design==
A bassinet is typically a basket-like structure on free-standing legs, often with casters.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ngNLqqYO9oUC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=bassinet+cradle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPquHCt-PJAhXINT4KHdDPDXQQ6AEINjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=bassinet%20cradle&amp;f=false Injury Prevention for Children and Adolescents: Research, Practice, and Advocacy], Karen DeSafey Lille, Ed. 2006. p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; A cradle is typically set in a fixed frame, but with the ability to rock or glide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Use==
Bassinet usage in the United States nearly doubled to 20% from 1992-2006.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Pike, Jodi, and Rachel Y. Moon. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575771/ “Bassinet Use and Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy.”] The Journal of Pediatrics 153.4 (2008): 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 45% of babies up to two months used a bassinet.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; By 5–6 months, however, fewer than 10% of babies sleep in bassinets.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In a hospital environment, a special form of [[Seal (mechanical)|sealed]] bassinet is used in a [[neonatal intensive care unit]].

On many long-haul flights, most airlines provide a bassinet (which is attached to a bulkhead) to adults travelling with an infant, i.e., a child under the age of two. The use of the bassinet is restricted by the infant's size and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flyingwithababy.com/essential-airline-bassinet-information-chart/|title=Airplane Bassinet Seats: A Guide To Airline Bassinet Seat Restrictions|author=|date=1 February 2013|website=flyingwithababy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These need to be requested in advance with the airline. However, most USA and Canadian airlines have bassinet policies with mean they are only allocated at the airport gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp|title=Traveling with children &amp; while pregnant - Special assistance - American Airlines|author=|date=|website=www.aa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qantas"&gt;[http://www.lufthansa.com/us/en/Children-on-board#ancAbT1 Example of airline travel information regarding children and infants], [[Lufthansa]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theblythespirit/1011910419/|title=Flickr|author=|date=|website=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that the [[mattress]] influences [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]] outcomes; a firm mattress lowers SIDS risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720022617/http://www.sidsandkids.org/pdf/october05_statement.pdf SIDS &amp; Kids] Statement on the use of second hand mattresses&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bassinets are designed to rock or swing freely, with many carers finding their child calmed by this action.  The process of lulling the child to [[sleep]] may be accompanied by prerecorded or live performance of [[Lullaby|lullabies]].

==Stationary or portable==
Although there are many variations, they fall generally into two categories:
* light and portable types sometimes called ''Moses baskets''
* [[wikt:sturdy|sturdier]] but less portable cradles

In both cases, they are generally designed to allow the resting baby to be carried from place to place. Within the home, they are often raised on a stand or other surface to reduce back strain when bending over to tend the baby.  Wheeled frames to convert a bassinet into a [[baby transport|pram or baby carriage]] are common.

== Rolling ==
At three or four months of age babies are able to roll over by themselves; this means they could tip the bassinet over, so for safety they must use an [[infant bed]] or [[toddler bed]] instead.

BrainScope Company, Inc. (BrainScope) is a medical neuro-technology firm using [[artificial intelligence]] to assess a variety of neurological conditions, beginning with mild [[traumatic brain injury]] (mTBI), including [[concussion]]. BrainScope was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. 

BrainScope's markets include the military, emergency departments, urgent care and occupational medicine centers, and sports at the collegiate and professional levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/medics-start-using-scanner-that-could-detect-tbi-earlier-1.529566|title=Medics start using scanner that could detect TBI earlier|work=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kvia.com/news/top-stories/umc-uses-new-equipment-for-brain-care/594019007|title=UMC uses new equipment for brain care|last=Olivas|first=Denise|date=2017-07-27|work=KVIA|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
''BrainScope One'' uses artificial intelligence and multi-modality to help clinicians rapidly assess mild head-injured patients for structural and functional brain injuries, including concussions, with a non-invasive handheld device and a disposable headset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Inside-the-head-game-Washburn-among-first-with-new-BrainScope-device-472274093.html|title=Inside the head game: Washburn among first with new BrainScope device|last=Brunner|first=Melissa|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Using [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] (EEG) data collected with a disposable headset, ''BrainScope One'' objective biomarkers both predict the likelihood that a patient's structural brain injury would be visible on a [[CT scan]] and assess the likelihood of brain functional impairment by comparing the patient's brain function to that of non-head injured iindividuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601619/is-this-the-diagnostic-tool-weve-been-waiting-for-in-concussion-testing/|title=This new technology could help clinicians rapidly test for concussions on sidelines and battlefields|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BrainScope One'' also includes neurocognitive tests, performed by the patient on the device, and an extensive library of digitized concussion assessments.

The '''CKUA Radio Network''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] donor-funded community radio network based in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. Originally located on the campus of the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton (hence the UA of the call letters), it was the first public broadcaster in Canada. It now broadcasts from studios in downtown Edmonton, and as of fall 2016 out of a studio in Calgary located at the [[National Music Centre]]. CKUA's primary station is CKUA-FM located on 94.9 FM in Edmonton, and the station operates fifteen rebroadcasters to serve the remainder of the province.

==History==

CKUA was created in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/473940910/ "Mercy - Arden collects half a dozen ARIAs"]. ''Edmonton Journal'', Edmonton, Alberta, May 30, 1994, p. 12 &lt;/ref&gt;  through a provincial grant which allowed the University of Alberta's Extension Department to purchase the licence of CFCK. CKUA was also the first radio station to offer educational radio programming, including music concerts, poetry readings, and university lectures. From 1930 to 1931 the station was an affiliate of the [[CNR Radio]] network.&lt;ref name=ccf&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php?id=125&amp;historyID=56 CKUA History from the Canadian Communications Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; CKUA was operated from 1945 until 1974 by [[Alberta Government Telephones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/listings.php?pt=130&amp;r=59#CKUA-AM CKUA History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010135950/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/listings.php?pt=130&amp;r=59#CKUA-AM#CKUA-AM |date=2006-10-10 }}, Canadian Communications Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crown corporation]], [[Access (TV channel)|Alberta Educational Communications Corporation]] (later known as Access), assumed ownership of the station in 1974.&lt;ref name=ccf/&gt; In 1994, Access sold the CKUA network to the non-profit CKUA Radio Foundation for $10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php?id=1009&amp;historyID=57 CKUA-FM history, Canadian Communications Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the station won an Alberta Recording Industry Award of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/473940910/ "Mercy - Arden collects half a dozen ARIAs"]. ''Edmonton Journal'', Edmonton, Alberta, May 30, 1994, p. 12 &lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 20, 1997 the station went off the air for five weeks due to political squabbles, poor financial management, and attempts at privatization.&lt;ref name="Takach2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geo Takach|title=Will the Real Alberta Please Stand Up?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJSnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252|date=1 December 2010|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-772-6|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station restarted broadcasting on April 25, 1997 after control was given to the public from directors appointed by the provincial government. As of 2005, more than two-thirds of the station's funding came from its listeners in the form of donations.

==Cultural Impact==
CKUA is considered a cultural icon by many musicians throughout Canada.  The station's practice of supporting local, independent, and non-commercial artists has helped launch the careers of such renowned musicians as [[k.d. lang]], [[Jann Arden]], and [[Bruce Cockburn]].  In addition, CKUA has contributed to the careers of [[Arthur Hiller]], [[Robert Goulet]], and [[Tommy Banks]], among others. Throughout the 1930s an early [[radio drama]] series, ''CKUA Players'', was produced out of the station and broadcast throughout [[Western Canada]] by a network of stations.&lt;ref name=drama&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/english-language-radio-drama/ Radio Drama, English Language], ''Canadian Encyclopedia'', accessed January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
CKUA schedules different programs throughout the week and thus can offer many different genres including [[blues]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[R&amp;B]], [[Celtic Music|Celtic]], [[country music|country]], [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], folk, [[hiphop]], [[dance music|dance]], [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]], roots, and [[world music|world]].

==Historic Music Archive==
CKUA's music library boasts one of the largest and most diverse music collections in Canada, with more than 250,000 [[Compact disc|CD]]s and [[Vinyl record#Common formats|LP]]s, including 10,000 [[Gramophone record#Early history|78 rpm]] records, as well as a few [[aluminum disc|aluminium transcription discs]], [[Vinyl record#Common formats|45s]], and other various media formats.

==Broadcast Locations==
CKUA was headquartered in the Alberta Block building on [[Jasper Avenue]] in Edmonton starting in 1955. In October, 2012, CKUA moved into its current location in the Alberta Hotel building, with its first broadcast from the new location on October 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnews.ca/news/294611/ckua-radio-celebrates-new-home-with-ceremonial-record-delivery/ "CKUA Radio celebrates new home with ceremonial record delivery"]. By Caley Ramsay	''Global News'', October 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast technics==
The station's original transmitter was located at 580 [[kHz]] in Edmonton.  It operated at 10,000 watts.  Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial, as well as its transmitter power, it was powerful enough to cover nearly all of Alberta's densely populated area.  It added an FM simulcast in 1947.

Starting in the 1970s, CKUA built a network of 16 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] repeaters across Alberta.  CKUA also broadcasts in western Canada on select cable and satellite providers (such as [[SaskTel]], who carries CKUA across Saskatchewan as a [[Lloydminster]] station).  As of February 29, 1996, CKUA became the first radio station in Canada to [[Internet radio|stream]] their broadcast online, and now has upgraded the service to carry an unlimited number of streams. The station currently has more than 250,000 weekly listeners.

Because of CKUA's extensive coverage, the station was one of only a handful of broadcasters (another being [[CTV Two Alberta]], formerly Access) to carry the Alberta [[Emergency Public Warning System]]. The provincial government-funded programme provided the station with 12% of its annual income until the contract was lost to an Ottawa firm, Black Coral Inc., in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2010/01/12/edmonton-ckua-jobs-cut.html |title=Contract loss forces job cuts at CKUA |date= January 12, 2010|work=www.cbc.ca |accessdate= May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CKUA announced plans to shut down its legacy 580 AM signal, the longest continuously-used AM frequency in Canada, in the spring of 2013.  It would have needed to invest as much as $5 million to upgrade the transmitter site to modern standards, an amount it could not afford.&lt;ref name=AMHistory&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/listings.php?pt=130&amp;r=59&amp;ac=&amp;former=y#CKUA-AM CKUA-AM history] at [[Canadian Communications Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, CKUA did not receive formal approval from the CRTC until September 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-483.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-483], CKUA-FM Edmonton – Deletion of an AM transmitter, ''CRTC'', September 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  AM 580 went off the air on November 21, 2013, the station's 86th anniversary.&lt;ref name=AMHistory/&gt;

'''CNET''' (stylized as '''c|net''') is an American media website that publishes reviews, news, articles, blogs, podcasts and videos on technology and [[consumer electronics]] globally. Founded in 1994 by [[Halsey Minor]] and Shelby Bonnie, it was the flagship brand of CNET Networks and became a brand of [[CBS Interactive]] through CNET Networks' acquisition in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3263|title=CBS Corporation to acquire CNET Networks, Inc.|publisher=CBS Corporation| date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032023/http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3263 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS to buy CNET Networks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9944882-7.html|title= CBS to buy CNET Networks|publisher=CNET|date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailybriefing.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/05/15/cbs-buying-cnet-in-online-push/|title=CBS buying CNet in online push|publisher=CNN|date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517215301/http://dailybriefing.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/05/15/cbs-buying-cnet-in-online-push/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3503 |title=CBS Corporation completes acquisition of CNET Networks; merges operations into new, expanded CBS Interactive Business Unit |publisher=CBS Corporation |date=June 30, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829001159/http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3503 |archivedate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET originally produced content for radio and television in addition to its website and now uses [[new media]] distribution methods through its [[Internet television|Internet television network]], [[CNET Video]], and its podcast and blog networks.

In addition, CNET currently has region-specific and language-specific editions. These include the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan, French, German, Korean and Spanish. According to third-party [[web analytics]] providers, [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] and [[SimilarWeb]], CNET is the highest-read technology news source on the Web, with over 200 million readers per month, being among the 200 most visited websites globally, as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/cnet.com | title=cnet.com Site Overview | publisher=alexa.com | accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/category/news_and_media/technology_news | title=Top 50 sites in the world for News And Media &gt; Technology News | publisher=similarweb.com | accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/website/cnet.com | title=Cnet.com Analytics | publisher=similarweb.com | accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|CBS Interactive}}

===Origins===
[[File:Logo CNET Networks.svg|thumb|left|100px|Logo of CNET Networks prior to acquisition by CBS Interactive]]

In 1994, with the help from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] co-founder&lt;ref name=digitalhollywood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhollywood.com/KeynoteKWendle.html |title=Digital Hollywood Conference |date=September 27, 2000 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103085457/http://www.digitalhollywood.com/KeynoteKWendle.html |archivedate=November 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Wendle and former Disney creative associate Dan Baker,&lt;ref name=cnethistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnetnetworks.com/aboutus/history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406175002/http://www.cnetnetworks.com/aboutus/history.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 6, 2005 |title=CNET Networks – About Us – History |publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=June 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET produced four pilot television programs about computers, technology, and the Internet. [[CNET TV]] was composed of ''CNET Central'', ''The Web'', and ''The New Edge''.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/CNET-to-launch-two-new-TV-shows/2100-1023_3-210413.html CNET]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286315,00.html Entertainment Weekly]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421153829/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C286315%2C00.html |date=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNET Central'' was created first and aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in the [[United States]] on the [[USA Network]]. Later, it began airing on USA's sister network [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] along with ''The Web'' and ''The New Edge''.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"/&gt; These were later followed by [[TV.com]] in 1996. Current ''[[American Idol]]'' host [[Ryan Seacrest]] first came to national prominence at CNET, as the host of ''The New Edge'' and doing various voice-over work for CNET.

In addition, CNET produced another television technology news program called ''News.com'' that aired on [[CNBC]] beginning in 1999.&lt;ref name=cnethistory/&gt;

From 2001 to 2003, CNET operated CNET Radio on the [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]-owned [[KKSF (AM)|KNEW]] (910) in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[WAMG|WBPS]] (890) in [[Boston]] and on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. CNET Radio offered technology-themed programming. After failing to attract a sufficient audience, CNET Radio ceased operating in January 2003 due to financial losses.&lt;ref name="businessjournal"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2003/01/13/daily60.html|title=CNet pulls plug on radio program|publisher=Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal|date=January 16, 2003|accessdate=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions and expansions===
As '''CNET Networks''', the site made various acquisitions to expand its reach across various web platforms, regions, and markets.

In July 1999, CNET acquired the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based company GDT.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Aug-1999-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/880/95013499006969/filing-main.htm|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Aug 6, 1999|publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GDT was later renamed to CNET Channel.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Apr-2002-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/294/0001015577-02-000009.pdf|title=CNET Networks, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Apr 1, 2002 |publisher=secdatabase.com|accessdate=Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, CNET granted the right to Asiacontent to set up CNET Asia and the operation was brought back in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519084953/https://www.joomag.com/magazine/18008833685-activation-key-for-mcafee-antivirus-internet-security-mcafee-internet-security-plus-activation-key-/0134078001493015223|title=18008833685 Activation key for Mcafee Antivirus internet security Mcafee internet security - Plus Activation key -|date=19 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/73673/cnet-ziff-davis_merger_leaves_asiacontent_com_wondering|title=CNET-Ziff-Davis Merger Leaves Asiacontent.com Wondering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, the same time CNET became CNET Networks,&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Jan-2000-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/392/95013400000494/filing-main.htm |title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 24, 2000|publisher= secdatabase.com|accessdate=Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they acquired comparison shopping site [[mySimon]] for $736 million.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Mar-2000-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1730/95013400001832/filing-main.htm|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 10, 2000|publisher=secdatabase.com|accessdate =Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/289951|title=CNET Acquires mySimon|publisher=InternetNews|date=January 20, 2000|accessdate=January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2004, CNET announced that it would acquire [[Webshots]], the leading photography website for $70 million ($60 million in cash, $10 million in deferred consideration),&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Jul-2004-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2997/101557704000046/filing-main.htm|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 21, 2004|publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; completing the acquisition that same month.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Aug-2004-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/25/0001015577-04-000073.pdf|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Aug 9, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com|accessdate=Mar 27, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/cnet-acquires-photo-service-webshots-for-70-million |title=CNET Acquires Photo Service Webshots For $70 Million |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206131702/http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/cnet-acquires-photo-service-webshots-for-70-million |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, James Kim, an editor at CNET, died in the Oregon wilderness. CNET hosted a memorial show and podcasts dedicated to him.

On March 1, 2007, CNET announced the public launch of BNET, a website targeted towards business managers.

On May 15, 2008 it was announced that [[CBS Corporation]] would buy CNET Networks for [[United States dollar|US$]]1.8 billion.&lt;ref name="CBS to buy CNET Networks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-May-2008-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2034/0001193125-08-116630.pdf|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 15, 2008|publisher=secdatabase.com|accessdate=Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3263|title=CBS Corporation to acquire CNET Networks, Inc.|publisher=CBS Corporation |date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032023/http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3263&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2008, the acquisition was completed.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Jul-2008-POS-AM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2813/119312508147399/filing-main.htm|title=CNET Networks, Form POS AM, Filing Date Jul 7, 2008|publisher= secdatabase.com|accessdate=Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former CNET properties are now part of [[CBS Interactive]]. CBS Interactive now owns many [[second-level domain|domain]] names originally created by CNET Networks, including [[download.com]], downloads.com, upload.com, news.com, search.com, [[TV.com]], [[MP3.com|mp3.com]], chat.com, computers.com, shopper.com, [[radio.com]], com.com, and cnet.com.

On September 19, 2013 CBS Interactive launched a [[Spanish language]] sister site under the name CNET en Español.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30677_3-57603575-244/cnet-en-espa-ol-is-here-bienvenidos/|author=Lindsey Turrentine|title=CNET en Español is here. Bienvenidos|publisher=CNET News|date=September 19, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on topics of relevance primarily to Spanish-speaking technology enthusiasts. The site offered a "new perspective" on technology and is under the leadership of managing editor Gabriel Sama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30677_3-57599633-244/meet-the-man-who-will-run-cnet-en-espanol/|author=Lindsey Turrentine|title=Meet the man who will run CNET en Español|publisher=CNET News|date=August 22, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, CNET refreshed its site by merging with CNET UK and vowing to merge all editions of the agency into a unified agency. This merge brought many changes, foremost of which would be a new user interface and the renaming of CNET TV as CNET Video.

==Gamecenter==
CNET launched a website to cover [[video games]], CNET Gamecenter, in the middle of 1996.&lt;ref name=nytimescenter&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://archive.is/bZ98c | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/07/technology/basics-sites-keep-up-with-games-and-gamers.html | title=BASICS; Sites Keep Up With Games and Gamers | author=Olafson, Peter | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 7, 2000 | archivedate=May 23, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', it was "one of the first Web sites devoted to computer gaming news".&lt;ref name=chronicle1&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523184059/https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Heavy-Lifting-Begins-for-Cnet-Dot-com-downturn-2951969.php | url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Heavy-Lifting-Begins-for-Cnet-Dot-com-downturn-2951969.php | title=Heavy Lifting Begins for Cnet | date=February 15, 2001 | author=Fost, Dan | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | archivedate=May 23, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a leading game-focused website;&lt;ref name=eurocnet&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523191403/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_28565 | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_28565 | title=Cnet buys ZDnet | date=July 19, 2000 | author=Vaggabond | work=[[Eurogamer]] | archivedate=May 23, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999, ''[[PC Magazine]]'' named it one of the hundred-best websites in any field, alongside competitors [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]].&lt;ref name=pcmagtop100&gt;{{cite journal | author=Willmott, Don | title=The 100 Top Web Sites | date=February 9, 1999 | volume=18 | number=3 | journal=[[PC Magazine]] | page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gamecenter head Michael Brown, the site received between 50,000 and 75,000 daily visitors by late 2000.&lt;ref name=nytimescenter /&gt; In May 2000, CNET founded the Gamecenter Alliance network to bring Gamecenter and four partner websites, including [[Inside Mac Games]], under one banner.&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811071841/http://reviews.cnet.com/html/aboutcnet/press/2000/051100.html | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/html/aboutcnet/press/2000/051100.html | title=CNET Gamecenter Partners with Premier Gaming Sites to Create Elite Alliance | date=May 11, 2000 | location=[[San Francisco]] | archivedate=August 11, 2004 | publisher=CNET | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an almost $400 million loss at CNET as a result of the dot-com crash, the company ended the Gamecenter Alliance network in January 2001.&lt;ref name=registergc /&gt;&lt;ref name=euroclosure&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523200151/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_30103 | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_30103 | title=CNet culls GameCenter | date=February 7, 2001 | author=Bramwell, Tom | archivedate=May 23, 2018 | work=[[Eurogamer]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, Gamecenter itself was closed in a redundancy reduction effort, as GameSpot was the more successful of the two sites.&lt;ref name=registergc /&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle1 /&gt; Around 190 jobs were cut from CNET during this period,&lt;ref name=euroclosure /&gt; including "at least 20" at Gamecenter, according to the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=chronicle1 /&gt; Discussing the situation, Tom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] reported, "It is thought[...] that very few if any of the website's staff will move sideways into jobs at GameSpot, now the company's other gaming asset."&lt;ref name=euroclosure /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' later noted that Gamecenter was among the "popular video-game news sites" to close in 2001, alongside [[Daily Radar]].&lt;ref name=wapogc&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180523201714/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2001/08/03/magazines-whose-time-has-gone/2cfa9df2-1610-4230-a9ed-85a0be911d5e/# | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2001/08/03/magazines-whose-time-has-gone/2cfa9df2-1610-4230-a9ed-85a0be911d5e/ | title=Magazines Whose Time Has Gone | author=Musgrove, Mike | date=August 3, 2001 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | archivedate=2018-05-23 | deadurl=no | access-date=2018-05-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malware infection in downloads ==
With a catalog of more than 400,000 titles, the Downloads section of the website allows users to download popular software. CNET's download.com provides [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Macintosh]] and mobile software for download. CNET claims that this software is free of [[spyware]], but independent sources have confirmed that this is not the case.  [[Download.com]] not only hosts software with malware, but their own download wrapper contains [[adware]] and bloatware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=5bd70802c051fd95d0d78ac168385cd504705c00526ded2fd5edebdcc32d48f6-1323123804|title=Antivirus scan for 5bd70802c051fd95d0d78ac168385cd504705c00526ded2fd5edebdcc32d48f6 at 2011-12-05 22:23:24 UTC - VirusTotal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seclists.org/nmap-announce/2011/5|title=Nmap Announce: C-Net Download.Com is now bundling Nmap with malware!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/93504-download-com-wraps-downloads-in-bloatware-lies-about-motivations|title=Download.com wraps downloads in bloatware, lies about motivations - ExtremeTech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botcrawl.com/cnet-downloads-a-cesspool-for-privacy-invading-malware/|title=Warning: Download.com (CNET Downloads) A cesspool for privacy invading malware and rogue software - Botcrawl|date=9 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/198622/heres-what-happens-when-you-install-the-top-10-download.com-apps/|title=Here’s What Happens When You Install the Top 10 Download.com Apps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html|title=Download.com Caught Adding Malware to Nmap &amp; Other Software|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute with Snap Technologies ==
In 1998, CNET was sued by Snap Technologies, operators of the education service CollegeEdge, for [[trademark infringement]] relating to CNET's ownership of the domain name Snap.com, due to Snap Technologies [[Cybersquatting|already owning a trademark on its name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa Bowman|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/snap-crackle-popped-cnet-hit-with-suit-over-portal-name/101041|title=Snap!

On October 10, 2006, Shelby Bonnie resigned as chairman and [[chief executive officer|CEO]], in addition to two other executives, as a result of a [[options backdating|stock options backdating]] scandal that occurred between 1996 and 2003.&lt;ref name="CNET-Networks-Oct-2006-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2015/119312506206248/filing-main.htm|title=CNET Networks, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Oct 11, 2006|publisher=secdatabase.com|accessdate= Mar 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also cause the firm to restate its financial earnings over 1996 through 2003 for over $105 million in resulting expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/technology/30options.html|title=CNet Restatement Goes Back to 1996|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=Dec 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission later dropped an investigation into the practice.

In 2011, CNET and CBS Interactive were sued by a coalition of artists (led by FilmOn founder Alki David) for copyright infringement by promoting the download of [[LimeWire]], a popular peer to peer downloading software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Albanesius, Chloe, PCMag.com |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2384913,00.asp |title=CBS, CNET Sued for Copyright Infringement Over LimeWire Distribution |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324042850/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2384913%2C00.asp |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anderson, Nate, Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/05/cnet-sued-over-limewire-blamed-for-internet-piracy-phenomenon.ar|title=CNET sued over LimeWire, blamed for "Internet Piracy Phenomenon"|publisher=Ars Technica|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original suit was voluntarily dropped by Alki David, he vowed to sue at a later date to bring "expanded"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Gustin |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-alki-david-drops-cnet-lawsuit-vows-to-bring-expanded-action/ |title=Alki David Drops CNET Lawsuit; Vows to Bring 'Expanded' Action |publisher=[[PaidContent]] |date=November 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108055848/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-alki-david-drops-cnet-lawsuit-vows-to-bring-expanded-action/ |archivedate=January 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; action against CBS Interactive.

==Hopper controversy==

In January 2013, CNET named [[Dish Network]]'s "Hopper with [[Slingbox|Sling]]" [[digital video recorder]] as a nominee for the [[International CES|CES]] "Best in Show" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS abruptly disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results because the company was in [[Auto Hop|active litigation]] with Dish Network. CNET also announced that it could no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS are in litigation with (which also includes [[Aereo]]). The new vote subsequently gave the Best in Show award to the [[Razer USA|Razer Edge]] tablet instead.&lt;ref name="wsj-hopper"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Recorder Snubbed for CNET Award Over CBS Legal Scuffle|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/01/10/dish-recorder-snubbed-for-cnet-award-over-cbs-legal-scuffle/|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcmag-cnethopper/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-cescbs/&gt;

Dish Network's CEO Joe Clayton said that the company was "saddened that CNET’s staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS’ heavy-handed tactics."&lt;ref name="wsj-hopper"/&gt; On January 14, 2013, editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine addressed the situation, stating that CNET's staff were in an "impossible" situation due to the [[conflict of interest]] posed by the situation, and promised that she would do everything within her power to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted one CNET senior writer, Greg Sandoval, to resign.&lt;ref name=pcmag-cnethopper&gt;{{cite web|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=CNET Picked Dish Hopper as 'Best of CES' ... Until CBS Stepped In|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414276,00.asp |publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision also drew the ire of staff from the [[Consumer Electronics Association]], the organizers of CES; CEO [[Gary Shapiro]] criticized the decision in a ''[[USA Today]]'' [[op-ed]] column and a statement by the CEA, stating that "making television easier to watch is not against the law. It is simply pro-innovation and pro-consumer." Shapiro felt that the decision also hurt the confidence of CNET's readers and staff, "destroying its reputation for editorial integrity in an attempt to eliminate a new market competitor." As a result of the controversy and fearing damage to the show's brand, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (the position has been offered to other technology publications), and the "Best in Show" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.&lt;ref name=verge-cescbs&gt;{{cite web|title=CNET loses CES awards following Dish Hopper controversy; DVR named 'Best In Show'|url= https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/31/3937476/cnet-loses-ces-awards-following-dish-hopper-controversy-dvr-named|publisher=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30966">A device generating linear or rotational motion using [[carbon nanotube]](s) as the primary component, is termed a nanotube [[nanomotor]]. Nature already has some of the most efficient and powerful kinds of nanomotors. Some of these natural [[Molecular motor|biological nanomotors]] have been re-engineered to serve desired purposes. However, such biological nanomotors are designed to work in specific environmental conditions ([[pH]], liquid medium, sources of energy, etc.). Laboratory-made nanotube nanomotors on the other hand are significantly more robust and can operate in diverse environments including varied frequency, temperature, mediums and chemical environments. The vast differences in the dominant forces and criteria between macroscale and micro/nanoscale offer new avenues to construct tailor-made nanomotors. The various beneficial properties of carbon nanotubes makes them the most attractive material to base such nanomotors on.

==History==
Just fifteen years after making the world's first micrometer-sized motor, Dr. Alex Zettl led his group at University of California at Berkeley to construct the [[#First NEMS nanomotor|first nanotube nanomotor]] in 2003. A few concepts and models have been spun off ever since including the [[#Thermal gradient driven nanotube actuators|nanoactuator driven by a thermal gradient]] as well as the conceptual [[#Electron windmill|electron windmill]], both of which were revealed in 2008.

==Size effects==

===Electrostatic forces===
[[Coulomb's law]] states that the electrostatic force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of their distance. Hence, as the distance is reduced to less than a few micrometers, a large force can be generated from seemingly small charges on two bodies. However, electrostatic charge scales quadratically, thereby the electrostatic force also scales quadratically, as the following equations show:

:&lt;math&gt;
C = {{\varepsilon A } \over d} \propto L
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E \propto L^0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
V = E * L = E * L \propto L
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Q = C V \propto L^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F = A * E^2 \propto L^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively

:&lt;math&gt;
F = {{Q_{1} * Q_{2} } \over d^2} \propto {{L^2 * L^2}\over L^2} \propto L^2
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="electrostatic_scaling"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here A is area, C is capacitance, F is electrostatic force, E is electrostatic field, L is length, V is voltage and Q is charge. Despite the scaling nature of the electrostatic force it is one of the major mechanisms of sensing and actuation in the field of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) and is the backbone for the working mechanism of the [[#First NEMS nanomotor|first NEMS nanomotor]]. The quadratic scaling is alleviated by increasing the number of units generating the electrostatic force as seen in [[comb drive]]s in many MEMS devices.

===Friction===
Just as the electrostatic force, the frictional force scales quadratically with size F ~ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Friction]] is an ever plaguing problem regardless of the scale of a device. It becomes all the more prominent when a device is scaled down. In the nano scale it can wreak havoc if not accounted for because the parts of a [[Nanoelectromechanical systems|Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems]] (NEMS) device are sometimes only a few atoms thick. Furthermore, such NEMS devices typically have a very large surface area-to-volume ratio. Surfaces in the nanoscale resemble a mountain range, where each peak corresponds to an atom or a molecule. Friction at the nanoscale is proportional to the number of atoms that interact between two surfaces. Hence, friction between perfectly smooth surfaces in the macroscale is actually similar to large rough objects rubbing against each other.&lt;ref name="friction_madison"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of nanotube nanomotors however, the intershell friction in the multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) is remarkably small. [[Molecular dynamics]] studies show that, with the exception of small peaks, the frictional force remains almost negligible for all sliding velocities until a special sliding velocity is reached. Simulations relating the sliding velocity, induced rotation, inter-shell frictional force to the applied force provide explanations for the low inter-wall friction. Contrary to macroscale expectations the speed at which an inner tube travels within an outer tube does not follow a linear relationship with the applied force. Instead, the speed remains constant (as in a plateau) despite increasing applied force occasionally jumping in value to the next plateau. No real rotation is noticed in nonchiral inner tubes. In the case of chiral tubes a true rotation is noticed and the angular velocity also jumps to plateaus along with the jumps in the linear velocity. These plateaus and jumps can be explained as a natural outcome of frictional peaks for growing velocity, the stable (rising) side of the peak leading to a plateau, the dropping (unstable) side leading to a jump. These peaks occur due to parametric excitation of vibrational modes in the walls of the tubes due to the sliding of the inner tube. With the exception of small peaks, that correspond to the speed plateaus, the frictional force remains almost negligible for all sliding velocities until a special sliding velocity. These velocity plateaus correspond to the peaks in the frictional force. The sudden rise in sliding velocity is due to a resonance condition between a frequency that is dependent on the inter-tube corrugation period and particular phonon frequencies of the outer tube which happen to possess a group velocity approximately equal to the sliding velocity.&lt;ref&gt;

==First NEMS nanomotor==

The first nanomotor can be thought of as a scaled down version of a comparable [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) motor. The nanoactuator consists of a gold plate rotor, rotating about the axis of a [[MWNT#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotube]] (MWNT). The ends of the MWNT rest on a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer which form the two electrodes at the contact points. Three fixed stator electrodes (two visible 'in-plane' stators and one 'gate' stator buried beneath the surface) surround the rotor assembly. Four independent voltage signals (one to the rotor and one to each stators) are applied to control the position, velocity and direction of rotation. Empirical angular velocities recorded provide a lower bound of 17&amp;nbsp;Hz (although capable of operating at much higher frequencies) during complete rotations.&lt;ref name="main_Zettl"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fabrication===

The MWNTs are synthesized by the [[#Arc-discharge evaporation technique|arc-discharge technique]], suspended in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and deposited on degenerately doped silicon substrates with a 1&amp;nbsp;µm of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The MWNT can be aligned according to pre-made markings on the substrate by using an [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) or a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). The rotor, electrodes and the 'in-plane' stators are patterned using electron beam lithography using an appropriately masked photo-resist. Gold with a chromium adhesion layer is thermally evaporated, lifted off in acetone and then annealed at 400&amp;nbsp;°C to ensure better electrical and mechanical contact with the MWNT. The rotor measures 250–500&amp;nbsp;nm on a side. An HF etch is then used to remove sufficient thickness (500&amp;nbsp;nm of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the substrate to make room for the rotor when it rotates. The Si substrate serves as the gate stator. The MWNT at this point displays a very high torsional [[spring constant]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; N m with [[Resonance|resonant frequencies]] in the tens of megahertz), hence, preventing large angular displacements. To overcome this, one or more outer MWNT shells are compromised or removed in the region between the anchors and the rotor plate. One simple way to accomplish this is by successively applying very large stator voltages (around 80 V DC) that cause mechanical fatigue and eventually shear the outer shells of the MWNT. An alternative method involves the reduction of the outermost MWNT tubes to smaller, wider concentric nanotubes beneath the rotor plate.&lt;ref name="main_Zettl" /&gt;

The smaller nanotube(s) are fabricated using the Electrical driven vaporization (EDV) which is a variant of the [[#Electrical-breakdown technique|electrical-breakdown technique]]. Passing current between the two electrodes typically results in failure of the outermost shell only on one side of the nanotube. Current is therefore passed between one electrode and the center of the MWNT which results in the failure of the outermost shell between this electrode and the center. The process is repeated on the opposite side to result in the formation of the short concentric nanotube that behaves like a low friction bearing along the longer tube.&lt;ref&gt;

====Arrays of nanoactuators====
Due to the miniscular magnitude of output generated by a single nanoactuator the necessity to use arrays of such actuators to accomplish a higher task comes into picture. Conventional methods like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allow the exact placement of nanotubes by growing them directly on the substrate. However, such methods are unable to produce very high qualities of MWNT. Moreover, CVD is a high temperature process that would severely limit the compatibility with other materials in the system. A Si substrate is coated with electron beam resist and soaked in acetone to leave only a thin polymer layer. The substrate is selectively exposed to an low energy electron beam of an SEM that activates the adhesive properties of the polymer later. This forms the basis for the targeting method. The alignment method exploits the surface velocity obtained by a fluid as it flows off a spinning substrate. MWNTs are suspended in orthodicholrobenzene (ODCB) by ultrasonication in an aquasonic bath that separates most MWNT bundles into individual MWNTs. Drops of this suspension are then pipetted one by one onto the center of a silicon substrate mounted on a spin coater rotating at 3000 rpm. Each subsequent drop of the suspension is pipetted only after the previous drop has completely dried to ensure larger density and better alignment of the MWNTs (90% of the MWNTs over 1&amp;nbsp;µm long lie within 1°). Standard electron beam lithography is used to pattern the remaining components of the nanoactuators.&lt;ref&gt;

====Arc-discharge evaporation technique====
[[File:Arc discharge nanotube.png|thumb|Figure 1.3: Cartoon showing the basic experimental setup for the arc-discharge technique of large scale carbon nanotube synthesis]]
This technique is a variant of the standard arc-discharge technique used for the synthesis of [[fullerenes]] in an inert gas atmosphere. As Figure 1.3 shows, the experiment is carried out in a reaction vessel containing an [[inert gas]] such as [[helium]], [[argon]], etc. flowing at a constant pressure. A potential of around 18&amp;nbsp;V is applied across two [[graphite]] electrodes (diameters of the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] are 6&amp;nbsp;mm and 9&amp;nbsp;mm) separated by a short distance of usually 1–4&amp;nbsp;mm within this chamber. The amount of current (usually 50–100&amp;nbsp;A) passed through the electrodes to ensure nanotube formation depends on the dimensions of the electrodes, separation distance and the inert gas used. As a result, carbon atoms are ejected from the anode and are deposited onto the cathode hence shrinking the mass of the anode and increasing the mass of the cathode. The black carbonaceous deposit (a mixture of [[nanoparticles]] and nanotubes in a ratio of 1:2) is seen growing on the inside of the cathode while a hard grey metallic shell forms on the outside. The total yield of nanotubes as a proportion of starting graphitic material peaks at a pressure of 500 torr at which point 75% of graphite rod consumed is converted to nanotubes. The nanotubes formed range from 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter and few to several micrometers in length.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are several advantages of choosing this method over the other techniques such as laser ablation and [[chemical vapor deposition]] such as fewer structural defects (due to high growth temperature), better electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, high production rates (several hundred mg in ten minutes), etc.&lt;ref&gt;

====Electrical-breakdown technique====
[[File:Electrical breakdown tubes.png|thumb|Figure 1.4: (A) Graph showing remarkably discrete, constant drops in conductance for the removal of each subsequent carbon shell under constant voltage (B) Images of partially broken MWNTs show clear thinning, with a decrease in radius equal to the intershell spacing (0.34&amp;nbsp;nm) times the number of completed breakdown steps. The two segments of this sample were independently thinned by 3 and 10 shells, as depicted by the color overlays]]
Large-scale synthesis of carbon nanotubes typically results in a randomly varied proportion of different types of carbon nanotubes. Some may be semiconducting while others may be metallic in their electrical properties. Most applications require the use of such specific types of nanotubes. Electrical-breakdown technique provides a means for separating and selecting desired type of nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are known to withstand very large [[Current density|current densities]] up to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; partly due to the strong sigma bonds between carbon atoms. However, at sufficiently high currents the nanotubes fail primarily due to rapid oxidation of the outermost shell. This results in a partial conductance drop that becomes apparent within a few seconds. Applying an increased bias displays multiple independent and stepwise drops in conductance (figure 1.4) resulting from the sequential failure of carbon shells. Current in a MWNT typically travels in the outermost shell due the direct contact between this shell and the electrodes. This controlled destruction of shells without affecting disturbing inner layers of MWNTs permits the effective separation of the nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;

===Principle===
The rotor is made to rotate using electrostatic actuation. An out-of-phase common frequency sinusoidal voltages to two in-plane stators ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', a doubled frequency voltage signal to the gate stator ''S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a DC offset voltage to the rotor plate R are applied as shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{1} = V_{0} sin(\omega t)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{2} = V_{0} sin(\omega t - \pi)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{3} = V_{0} sin(2\omega t + {\pi /2})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
R = - V_{0}
&lt;/math&gt;

By the sequential application of these asymmetrical stator voltages (less than 5&amp;nbsp;V) the rotor plate can be drawn to successive stators hence making the plate complete rotations. The high proximity between the stators and the rotor plate is one reason why a large force is not required for electrostatic actuation. Reversing the bias causes the rotor to rotate in the opposite direction as expected.&lt;ref name="main_Zettl" /&gt;

===Applications===
* The rotating metal plate could serve as a mirror for ultra-high-density optical sweeping and switching devices as the plate is at the limit of visible light focusing. An array of such actuators, each serving as a high frequency mechanical filter, could be used for parallel signal processing in telecommunications.
* The plate could serve as a paddle for inducing or detecting fluid motion in microfluidic applications. It could serve as a bio-mechanical element in biological systems, a gated catalyst in wet chemistry reactions or as a general sensor element.
* A charged oscillating metal plate could be used as a transmitter of electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name="main_Zettl" /&gt;

==Thermal gradient driven nanotube actuators==
[[File:Thermal nanomotor1.jpg|thumb|Figure 2.1: Thermal gradient driven nanomotor. (A &amp; B): SEM images of experimental setup. (C) Schematic of the nanomotor also displaying degrees of freedom]]
The nanoactuator, as shown in Figure 2.1 comprises two electrodes connected via a long MWNT. A gold plate acts as the cargo and is attached to a shorter and wider concentric nanotube. The cargo moves towards the cooler electrode (Figure 2.2) due to the thermal gradient in the longer nanotube induced by the high current that is passed through it. The maximum velocity was approximated to 1&amp;nbsp;µm/s which is comparable to the speeds attained by kinesin biomotors.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

===Fabrication===
The MWNT are fabricated using the standard [[#Arc-discharge evaporation technique|arc-discharge evaporation]] process and deposited on an oxidized silicon substrate. The gold plate in the center of the MWNT is patterned using electron-beam lithography and Cr/Au evaporation. During the same process, the electrodes are attached to the nanotube. Finally, [[#Electrical-breakdown technique|electrical-breakdown]] technique is used to selectively remove a few outer walls of the MWNT. Just as the [[#First NEMS nanomotor|nanoactuator from the Zettl group]], this enables low friction rotation and translation of the shorter nanotube along the axis of the longer tube. The application of the electrical-breakdown technique does not result in the removal of the tube(s) below the cargo. This might be because the metal cargo absorbs the heat generated in the portion of the tube in its immediate vicinity hence delaying or possibly even preventing tube oxidation in this part.&lt;ref name="mainthermal"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Principle===
[[File:Thermal nanomotor6.jpg|thumb|Figure 2.2: Motion of shorter nanotubes (red) along the longer tubes (yellow) from the hotter(top) section of the nanotube to the cooler (bottom) section of the nanotube carrying the metal cargo (gray)]]
[[File:Thermal nanometer chirality.png|thumb|Figure 2.3: Degree of translational and rotation are dependent on the chiralities of the two nanotubes]]
The interaction between the longer and shorter tubes generates an energy surface that confines the motion to specific tracks – translation and rotation. The degree of translational and rotational motion of the shorter tube are highly dependent on the chiralities of the two tubes as shown in Figure 2.3. Motion in the nanoactuator displayed a proclivity of the shorter tube to follow a path of minimum energy. This path could either have a roughly constant energy or have a series of barriers. In the former case, friction and vibrational motion of atoms can be neglected whereas a stepwise motion is expected in the latter scenario.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

====Stepwise motion====
The stepwise motion can be explained by the existence of periodic energy barriers for relative motion between the longer and shorter tubes. For a given pair of nanotubes, the ratio of the step in rotation to the step in translation is typically a constant, the value of which depends on the chirality of the nanotubes. The energy of such barriers could be estimated from the temperature in the nanotube, a lower bound for which can be estimated as the melting temperature of gold (1300 K) by noting that the gold plate melts (Figure 2.4) to form a spherical structure as current is passed through the nanomotor. The motion rate γ can be written as a function of the attempt frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;!--the height of the energy barrier &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;,--&gt; the Boltzmann's constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = {\omega \over 2\pi}e^{{-\Delta E}\over kT} &lt;/math&gt;

Taking &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \approx 1 Hz&lt;/math&gt;, using the approximation:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\Delta E\over{m a^2_{0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the cargo and &lt;math&gt;a^2_{0}&lt;/math&gt; represents the contact area, the barrier height is estimated as 17&amp;nbsp;µeV per atom.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;
[[File:Thermal nanomotor melting gold.png|thumb|Figure 2.4: SEM images show the transformation of gold plate (left) into a ball (right) due to very high temperatures]]

====Mechanism for actuation====
Many proposals were made to explain the driving mechanism behind the nanoactuator. The high current (0.1&amp;nbsp;mA) required to drive the actuator is likely to cause sufficient dissipation to clean the surface of contaminants; hence, ruling out the possibility of contaminants playing a major role. The possibility of electromigration, where the electrons move atomic impurities via momentum transfer due to collisions, was also ruled out because the reversal of the current direction did not affect the direction of displacement. Similarly, rotational motion could not have been caused by an induced magnetic field due to the current passing through the nanotube because the rotation could either be left or right-handed depending on the device. Stray electric field effect could not be the driving factor because the metal plate staid immobile for high resistive devices even under a large applied potential. The thermal gradient in the nanotube provides the best explanation for the driving mechanism.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

====Thermal gradient induced motion====
The induced motion of the shorter nanotube is explained as the reverse of the heat dissipation that occurs in friction wherein the sliding of two objects in contact results in the dissipation of some of the kinetic energy as [[phonon]]ic excitations caused by the interface corrugation. The presence of a thermal gradient in a nanotube causes a net current of phononic excitations traveling from the hotter region to the cooler region. The interaction of these phononic excitations with mobile elements (the carbon atoms in the shorter nanotube) causes the motion of the shorter nanotube. This explains why the shorter nanotube moves towards the cooler electrode. Changing the direction of the current has no effect on the shape of thermal gradient in the longer nanotube. Hence, direction of the movement of the cargo is independent of the direction of the bias applied. The direct dependence of the velocity of the cargo to the temperature of the nanotube is inferred from the fact that the velocity of the cargo decreases exponentially as the distance from the midpoint of the long nanotube increases.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

===Shortcomings===
[[File:Thermal nanomotor thermal gradient.png|thumb|Figure 2.5: Graph demonstrating the direct relationship between the thermal gradient and the displacement of the shorter tube / cargo]] The temperatures and the thermal gradient that the MWNT are subjected to are very high. On one hand, the high thermal gradient seems to have a highly detrimental effect on the lifetime of such nanoactuators. On the other hand, experiments show that the displacement of the shorter tube is directly proportional to the thermal gradient (see Figure 2.5). Therefore, a compromise needs to be reached to optimize the thermal gradient. The dimensions of movable nanotube is directly related to the energy barrier height. Although the current model excites multiple phonon modes, selective phonon mode excitation would enable lowering the phonon bath temperature.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

===Applications===
*Pharmaceutical/Nanofluidic – thermal gradient could be used to drive fluids within the nanotubes or in nanofluidic devices as well as for drug delivery by nanosyringes.
* Running bio-engineered nanopores using heat generated from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.&lt;ref name="mainthermal" /&gt;

==Electron windmill==
[[File:CNT windmills.png|thumb|Figure 3.1: MWNT nanomotor (A) and nanodrill (B).]]

===Structure===
As figure 3.1 shows, the nanomotor consists of a double-walled CNT (DWNT) formed from an achiral (18,0) outer tube clamped to external gold electrodes and a narrower chiral (6,4) inner tube. The central portion of the outer tube is removed using the [[#Electrical-breakdown technique|electrical-breakdown]] technique to expose the free-to-rotate, inner tube. The nanodrill also comprises an achiral outer nanotube attached to a gold electrode but the inner tube is connected to a mercury bath.&lt;ref name="windmill"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle===
Conventional nanotube nanomotors make use of static forces that include elastic, electrostatic, friction and van der Waals forces. The electron windmill model makes use of a new "electron-turbine" drive mechanism that obviates that need for metallic plates and gates that the above nanoactuators require. When a DC voltage is applied between the electrodes, a "wind" of electrons is produced from left to right. The incident electron flux in the outer achiral tube initially possesses zero angular momentum, but acquires a finite angular momentum after interacting with the inner chiral tube. By Newton's third law, this flux produces a tangential force (hence a torque) on the inner nanotube causing it to rotate hence giving this model the name – "electron windmill". For moderate voltages, the tangential force produced by the electron wind is much greatly exceed the associated frictional forces.&lt;ref name="windmill" /&gt;

===Applications===
Some of the main applications of the electron windmill include:
* A voltage pulse could cause the inner element to rotate at a calculated angle hence making the device behave as a switch or a nanoscale memory element.
* Modification of the electron windmill to construct a nanofluidic pump by replacing the electrical contacts with reservoirs of atoms or molecules under the influence of an applied pressure difference.&lt;ref name="windmill" /&gt;

'''Carbon tetrachloride''', also known by many other names (the most notable being '''tetrachloromethane''', also [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry|recognized by the IUPAC]], '''carbon tet''' in the [[cleaning industry]], '''Halon-104''' in firefighting, and '''Refrigerant-10''' in [[HVACR]]) is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It was formerly widely used in [[fire extinguisher]]s, as a precursor to [[refrigerant]]s and as a [[cleaning agent]].  It is a colourless liquid with a "sweet" smell that can be detected at low levels.  It has practically no [[flammable|flammability]] at lower temperatures.

==History and synthesis==
Carbon tetrachloride was originally synthesized by the French chemist [[Henri Victor Regnault]] in 1839 by the reaction of [[chloroform]] with chlorine,&lt;ref&gt;V. Regnault (1839) [https://books.google.com/books?id=px0AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sur les chlorures de carbone CCl et CCl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;"] (On the chlorides of carbon CCl and CCl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', vol. 70, pages 104-107.  Reprinted in German as: {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now it is mainly produced from [[methane]]:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]]

The production often utilizes by-products of other [[halogenation|chlorination]] reactions, such as from the syntheses of [[dichloromethane]] and [[chloroform]].  Higher chlorocarbons are also subjected to "chlorinolysis":

:[[Hexachloroethane|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Prior to the 1950s, carbon tetrachloride was manufactured by the chlorination of [[carbon disulfide]] at 105 to 130&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt;

:CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3[[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + [[Disulfur dichloride|S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The production of carbon tetrachloride has steeply declined since the 1980s due to environmental concerns and the decreased demand for [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]], which were derived from carbon tetrachloride.  In 1992, production in the U.S./Europe/Japan was estimated at 720,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;Manfred Rossberg, Wilhelm Lendle, Gerhard Pfleiderer, Adolf Tögel, Eberhard-Ludwig Dreher, Ernst Langer, Heinz Jaerts, Peter Kleinschmidt, Heinz Strack, Richard Cook, Uwe Beck, Karl-August Lipper, Theodore R. Torkelson, Eckhard Löser, Klaus K. Beutel, "Chlorinated Hydrocarbons" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
In the carbon tetrachloride [[molecule]], four [[chlorine]] [[atom]]s are positioned symmetrically as corners in a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] configuration joined to a central [[carbon]] atom by single [[covalent bond]]s. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is non-polar. [[methane|Methane gas]] has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a [[halomethane]]. As a [[solvent]], it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve [[iodine]]. It is somewhat [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], giving off [[vapor]]s with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the [[tetrachloroethylene]] smell reminiscent of [[dry cleaner]]s' shops.

Solid tetrachloromethane has two [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]: crystalline II below &amp;minus;47.5&amp;nbsp;°C (225.6 K) and crystalline I above &amp;minus;47.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C56235&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase |title=Carbon Tetrachloride |author= |date= |website=webbook.nist.gov |accessdate=28 April 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630080210/http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C56235&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase |archivedate=30 June 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At &amp;minus;47.3&amp;nbsp;°C it has [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] crystal structure with space group ''C2/c'' and [[lattice constants]] ''a'' = 20.3, ''b'' = 11.6, ''c'' = 19.9 (.10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nm), β = 111°.&lt;ref name="chtas"&gt;F. Brezina, J. Mollin, R. Pastorek, Z. Sindelar. ''Chemicke tabulky anorganickych sloucenin'' (''Chemical tables of inorganic compounds''). SNTL, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a specific gravity greater than 1, carbon tetrachloride will be present as a [[dense nonaqueous phase liquid]] if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment.

==Uses==
In [[organic chemistry]], carbon tetrachloride serves as a source of chlorine in the [[Appel reaction]].

===Historic uses===
Prior to the [[Montreal Protocol]], large quantities of carbon tetrachloride were used to produce the [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerants R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]) and R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]). However, these refrigerants play a role in [[ozone depletion]] and have been phased out.  Carbon tetrachloride is still used to manufacture less destructive refrigerants. Carbon tetrachloride made from heavy [[chlorine-37]] has been used in the detection of [[neutrino]]s.

====Lava lamps====
Carbon tetrachloride is a key ingredient in lava lamps, as it adds weight to the otherwise buoyant wax.

====Solvent====
It once was a popular [[solvent]] in organic chemistry, but, because of its adverse health effects, it is rarely used today.&lt;ref name=TemaNord/&gt; It is sometimes useful as a solvent for [[infrared spectroscopy]], because there are no significant absorption bands &gt; 1600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Because carbon tetrachloride does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton [[NMR spectroscopy]]. In addition to being toxic, its dissolving power is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/nmr/nmr1.htm |title=Introduction to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] |author=W. Reusch |work=Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831170638/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/nmr/nmr1.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has been largely superseded by [[deuterated solvents]]. Use of carbon tetrachloride in determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as [[tetrachloroethylene]].&lt;ref name=TemaNord&gt;[http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories. TemaNord 516/2003.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227052412/http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it has no C-H bonds, carbon tetrachloride does not easily undergo [[free-radical reaction]]s. It is a useful solvent for [[halogenation]]s either by the elemental [[halogen]] or by a halogenation reagent such as [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]] (these conditions are known as [[Wohl–Ziegler bromination|Wohl-Ziegler Bromination]]).

====Fire suppression====
[[Image:Carbon tetrachloride 1930s fire extinguisher.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A brass Pyrene carbon-tetrachloride fire extinguisher]]
In 1910, the Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Delaware filed a patent to use carbon tetrachloride to extinguish fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1010870}}, filed April 5, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid was vaporized by the heat of combustion and extinguished flames, an early form of [[gaseous fire suppression]]. At the time it was believed the gas simply displaced oxygen in the area near the fire, but later research found that the gas actually inhibits the chemical chain reaction of the combustion process.

In 1911, Pyrene patented a small, portable extinguisher that used the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1105263}}, filed Jan 7, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The extinguisher consisted of a [[brass]] bottle with an integrated handpump that was used to expel a jet of liquid toward the fire. As the container was unpressurized, it could easily be refilled after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were often carried on aircraft or motor vehicles.

In the first half of the 20th century, another common fire extinguisher was a single-use, sealed glass globe known as a "fire grenade," filled with either carbon tetrachloride or salt water. The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire.  The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a [[solder]]-based restraint.  When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the extinguishing agent to be automatically dispersed into the fire.  A well-known brand was the "Red Comet," which was variously manufactured with other fire-fighting equipment in the Denver, Colorado area by the Red Comet Manufacturing Company from its founding in 1919 until manufacturing operations were closed in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Niche====
Carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a [[dry cleaning]] solvent, as a [[refrigerant]], and in [[lava lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A History of the Production and Use of Carbon Tetrachloride, Tetrachloroethylene, Trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in the United States: Part 1—Historical Background; Carbon Tetrachloride and Tetrachloroethylene |author=Doherty R.

One specialty use of carbon tetrachloride is in [[stamp collecting]], to reveal [[watermark]]s on postage stamps without damaging them. A small amount of the liquid was placed on the back of a stamp, sitting in a black glass or obsidian tray. The letters or design of the watermark could then be clearly seen.

The effects of carbon tetrachloride on human health and the environment have been assessed under [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] in 2012 in the context of the substance evaluation by France. Thereafter, further information has been requested from the registrants. Later this decision was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/evaluation/community-rolling-action-plan/corap-table/-/substance-rev/3080/term |title=Substance evaluation - CoRAP - ECHA |author= |date= |website=echa.europa.eu |accessdate=28 April 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820174108/https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/evaluation/community-rolling-action-plan/corap-table/-/substance-rev/3080/term |archivedate=20 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a study of common cleaning products found the presence of carbon tetrachloride in "very high concentrations" (up to 101&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as a result of manufacturers' mixing of surfactants or soap with [[sodium hypochlorite]] (bleach).&lt;ref&gt;

'''Dame Caroline Harriet Haslett''', DBE, JP, born in 1895 in [[Worth village, West Sussex|Worth]], Sussex, was an English electrical engineer, electricity industry administrator and champion of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=33751|title=Haslett, Caroline Harriet|origyear=2004|year=2011|last=Citrine|last2=Symons|first2=Eleanor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haines, Haslett" &gt;{{Cite book|title=International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950|section=Haslett, Caroline|last=Haines|first=Catharine M.C.|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1576070905|pages=127–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HftdjMNDvwIC&amp;pg=PA127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first secretary of the [[Women's Engineering Society]] and the founder and editor of its journal, ''The Woman Engineer''.&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;'Dame Caroline Haslett: Outstanding Woman Engineer', ''[[The Times]]'', 5 January 1957&lt;/ref&gt; She was co-founder, alongside [[Laura Ann Willson|Laura Annie Willson]] and with the support of [[Margaret, Lady Moir]], of the Electrical Association for Women, which pioneered such 'wonders', as they were described in contemporary magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The all-electric house in Bristol|journal=Design for To-Day|date=January 1936|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dame Caroline Haslett|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/caroline_haslett.shtml|publisher=BBC Woman's Hour}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the All-Electric House in Bristol in 1935. She became the first director of the Electrical Association for Women in 1925. Her chief interest was in harnessing the benefits of electrical power to emancipate women from household chores, so that they could pursue their own ambitions outside the home.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Law|first=Cheryl|title=Women, A Modern Political Dictionary|year=2000|place=London, UK|publisher=I. B. Tauris}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, few houses had electric light or heating, let alone electrical appliances; the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] was not yet in existence.

{{quote|source=|'Way is being made by electricity for a higher order of women – women set free from drudgery, who have time for reflection; for self-respect. We are coming to an age when the spiritual and higher state of life will have freer development, and this is only possible when women are liberated from soul-destroying drudgery ...

==Early life==
Born in Worth (now part of [[Crawley]], West Sussex), Caroline Haslett was the eldest daughter of Robert Haslett, a railway signal fitter and activist for the [[co-operative movement]], and his wife, Caroline Sarah, formerly Holmes.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; After attending school in Haywards Heath, she was employed by the [[Cochran boiler]] Company as a clerk and joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU).&lt;ref name="TimesObit"/&gt; Transferring to the Cochran workshops during the First World War, she acquired a basic engineering training in London and in Annan, [[Dumfriesshire]]; from that time she became a pioneer for women in the electrical and professional world.

==Career==
In 1919 Caroline Haslett left Cochran's to become the first secretary of the [[Women's Engineering Society]] (WES) and first editor of ''The Woman Engineer'' magazine, which she continued to edit until 1932.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In June 1920 she helped to found Atalanta, an engineering firm for women. In November 1924 she co-founded and became the first director of the Electrical Association for Women, of which she remained a director until 1956, when she was obliged to retire because of ill health; from 1924 to 1956 she edited ''The Electrical Age''.

In 1925 WES came to national attention when it organised a special conference at Wembley, in association with the First International Conference of Women in Science, Industry and Commerce.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/haslett_c/haslettCaroline3.asp|title=Engineering Timelines – Caroline Haslett – The Women's Engineering Society|website=engineering-timelines.com|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was opened by the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother) and was chaired by [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Nancy, Lady Astor]], the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons. This event also introduced Caroline Haslett to a wider public. She remained secretary of WES until 1929, when she became honorary secretary, and she was the society's president from 1940 to 1941.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Haslett was the sole woman delegate to the [[World Energy Council|World Power Conference]] in Berlin in 1930 and represented Britain at later power conferences. During the next 20 years her public activities were extraordinary, as described by her friend Margaret Partridge, another president of WES: 'She was a member of council of the [[British Institute of Management]] 1946–54, of the [[Industrial Welfare Society]], of the National Industrial Alliance, of the Administrative Staff College, and of King's College of Household and Social Science; a governor of the [[London School of Economics]], of [[Queen Elizabeth College]], and of [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] for Women; a member of the Central Committee on Women's Training and Employment; a member of council and vice-president of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] 1941–55; and president of the British Federation of Business and Professional Women. She was a member of the Women's Consultative Committee and the Advisory Council of the Appointments Department, Ministry of Labour; a member of the Correspondence Committee on Women's Work of the [[International Labour Office]]; and the first woman to be made a Companion of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE).'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Death of Dame Caroline Haslett|journal=The Woman Engineer|volume= VIII| issue =  4 |date=Spring 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dame Caroline Haslett (3752247652).jpg|thumb|380x380px|A blue plaque commemorating the life of Caroline Haslett in Haslett Avenue East, Three Bridges, Crawley, West Sussex]]
In 1932 the National Safety First Association (the forerunner of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]]) extended its activities to home safety, and Caroline Haslett was appointed as chair of the Home Safety Committee, a post she held until 1936. She became the first woman vice-president of the association in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Messenger|first=Rosalind|title=The Doors of Opportunity, A Biography of Dame Caroline Haslett DBE Companion IEE|place=London, UK|publisher=Femina Books|pages=76–77|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War she was the only woman member (and the only safety expert) on the 20-person committee convened by the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] to examine the requirements for electrical installations in post-war Britain, part of a larger scheme of Post-War Building Studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Post-War Building Studies No. 11 Electrical Installations", HMSO, London 1944&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of those recommendations was a new plug and socket standard, the first requirement for which was ''To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket outlet.'' The result was [[BS 1363]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Haslett became vice-president of the [[International Federation of Business and Professional Women]] in 1936 and president of the organisation in 1950; and she was the first woman to chair a government working party – the Board of Trade's Hosiery Industry Working Party 1945–46.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For many years she was a member of the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] and the [[Royal Institution]]. She was appointed to Crawley New Town Development Corporation 1947–56; and served as vice-president (1948) and first female chairman (1953–54) of the British Electricity Development Association. She represented the UK government on business missions in the USA, Canada and Scandinavia, and after the Second World War she took a leading role in conferences organised for women in Germany by the British and American authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Margaret Partridge's view, the crowning achievement of Haslett's multifaceted career occurred in 1947, when she was appointed a member of the [[British Electricity Authority]] (BEA), later the Central Electricity Authority, which was formed to run the industry under national ownership.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The BEA named one of the ships in its collier fleet ''Dame Caroline Haslett'' in honour of its first woman member, and the authority set up the Caroline Haslett Trust to provide scholarships and travelling fellowships for its members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==
Caroline Haslett's publications include ''The Electrical Handbook for Women'' (1934); ''Teach Yourself Household Electricity'' (in collaboration with E. E. Edwards, 1939); ''Munitions Girl, A Handbook for the Women of the Industrial Army'' (1942); and ''Problems Have No Sex'' (1949).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was also the author of numerous journal articles and conference papers.

==Honours==
In recognition of Haslett's services to women she was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1931, and in 1947, in recognition of her work for the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour, she was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was elected a Companion of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) in 1932. From 1950 until her death she was a Justice of the Peace for the County of London. A blue plaque has been erected to honour her memory by Crawley Arts Council and [[EDF Energy]]. It is located in a road named after her: Haslett Avenue East, in Three Bridges, Crawley, West Sussex. Caroline Haslett Primary School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, is also named after her.

==Final years==
She retired to live at the home of her sister (and biographer) Rosalind Messenger at Bungay, in Suffolk, where she died from a coronary thrombosis on 4 January 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Messenger | first = Rosalind | title = The Doors of Opportunity, A Biography of Dame Caroline Haslett DBE Companion IEE  | place = London | publisher = Femina Books | pages = 197–201 | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, her dying wish was that she be cremated by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Dame Caroline Haslett | work= BBC – Radio 4 Woman's Hour | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/caroline_haslett.shtml | accessdate= 24 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dann v. Johnston''''', 425 U.S. 219 (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Dann v. Johnston|425|219|1976}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] on the [[patentability]] of a claim for a [[business method patent]].

==Background==

===The claimed invention===

The business method at issue in ''Johnston'' was claimed as a “machine system for automatic record-keeping of bank checks and deposits." Although the advance was claimed as a system, the invention was a method of creating records of bank checks for expenditures in different categories, such as rent, wages, cost of materials, etc. so that income taxes could more readily be calculated. The system involved such steps as imprinting machine-readable numbers on the individual checks, corresponding to the categories into which the expenditures fell; then the computer would periodically provide a check tabulation, broken down by each category. However, the claims were written in the form of a series of means for performing the steps of the method (in functional language). Accordingly, the claimed subject matter could be argued to be a "machine."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite court |litigants=In re Johnston |vol=502 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=765 |pinpoint= |court=C.C.P.A. |date=1974 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19741267502f2d76511158 |accessdate=2018-06-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patent Office did not accept that argument and rejected the patent application. It said that Johnston wanted the Office to "grant a monopoly ... on a method of conducting the banking business."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Johnston'', 502 F.2d at 769.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston then appealed the rejection to the [[United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals]] (CCPA).

===CCPA decision===

The CCPA reversed the ruling of the Patent Office (3-2). The majority said that Johnston was claiming a machine, not a process, so that there would be no monopoly on the banking business if other banks used a different machine. The majority also held the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Gottschalk v. Benson|409|63|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; inapplicable because that case involved a process patent while this case involved a machine.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Johnston'', 502 F.2d at 771.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Giles Rich]] dissented on the ground that the ''Benson'' case had held a computer program patent ineligible and the machine format was immaterial: "&amp;#8239;'Every competent patent draftsman' can draft claims to computer programs either as a process or a machine system."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Johnston'', 502 F.2d at 773.&lt;/ref&gt; Another dissenting judge found the claimed invention obvious.

The CCPA reversed the Patent Office and the government sought review by the Supreme Court,

==Proceedings in the Supreme Court==

The government sought review on two questions: Whether the claimed business method was ineligible for patent protection, and whether the subject matter was obvious. The Court granted ''certiorari'' on both questions.

The great majority of the government's brief discussed reasons why the claimed invention was not patent eligible. A small portion addressed the obviousness issue.&lt;ref&gt;See Brief for the United States, ''Dann v. Johnston'', 425 U.S. 219 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] delivered the unanimous opinion of the seven-member Court.&lt;ref&gt;Justices Blackman and Stevens took no part in the decision. 425 U.S. at 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court took notice of the prevalence, indeed ubiquity, of computers in the banking industry. That made computerization an obvious approach to the banking activities involved here. More important, the Dirks patent (claiming a computer-operated system for tracking expenses by category within each department of a business
organization) was too close in concept to Johnston's system.&lt;ref&gt;425 U.S. at 228-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he mere existence of differences between the prior art and an invention does not establish the invention's nonobviousness. The gap between the prior art and respondent's system is simply not so great as to render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the art.&lt;ref&gt;425 U.S. at 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

Until ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bilski v. Kappos|561|593|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International|volume=573|year=2014|docket=13-298|slip=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; about four decades later, ''Johnston'' was the only business-method patent case that the Supreme Court had so far decided. But the decision turns on [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obviousness]] rather than [[patent eligibility]]. Despite the fact that most of the pages of the government’s brief on the merits were devoted to a discussion of why advances of the type claimed are not eligible to be considered for patentability, the Court declined to reach that question and instead simply found unanimously that the claimed system was obvious.

The purpose of '''energy-autarkic habitats''' is to be independent of 3rd parties concerning [[energy consumption]] for living. This may be based and [[resource-efficiency]] respective material, living space and energy.

'''[[Autarky]]''' can be defined as the quality of being self-sufficient. As well as '''[[Autonomy]]''' reflects to an autonomous person that acts morally solely for the sake of doing "good", independently of other incentives.

In former times nearly everyone had in some kind a form of autarkic living to a certain point of view, as people had to take care of satisfying' their basic needs (food, living - as it is still done in [[subsistence agriculture]]), until a network of proving these needs was established (craft, trade, profession).

In times of the [[industrialization]] also networks for energy have been set up, which led to a sort of dependency but made live "easier".

Nowadays there can be seen a trend "back to the roots" - being independent of coal, gas and oil using [[renewable energy]] (wind, sun, water, wood).

==Historic examples for autarkic habitats==
There are several historical examples of habitats that could be considered autarkic, including: [[stone age]] [[cave]]s/shelters/huts, [[mountain cabin]]s, [[Bedouin]] tents, and Inuit [[igloo]]s.

==Past and present examples for autarkic habitats==

===Antique houses and urban design===
Even in antic times people thought of energy-efficient living and tried to optimise there conditions.
By orientation to the winter sun to get as much sunrays as possible for heating up the building and less exposure to the winter wind, protection from the summer sun to achieve the different effect and ventilation by the summer wind, compact forms with less surface.&lt;ref&gt;From Low-Energy House to the Passive House, p. 18 http://www.nachhaltigwirtschaften.at/hdz_pdf/0812_ph-summerschool_01_02_from_low_energy_to_passive_houses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igloo===
An [[Igloo]] is a habitat with a compact form that has little surface (compare the low energy form of a drop of water; compare the optimised relation of volume to surface of a ball or globe). This results in less exposure to the wind and reduces hence the cooling of the building. The igloo contains an airtight shell which again assists to keep the temperature inside constant. Concerning heating there is relatively small volume to heat (as mentioned above; volume-surface-ratio).&lt;ref&gt;From Low-Energy House to the Passive House, p. 14 http://www.nachhaltigwirtschaften.at/hdz_pdf/0812_ph-summerschool_01_02_from_low_energy_to_passive_houses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peat house===
A [[peat house]] provides, similar to the igloo, a compact form with less surface and hence less exposure to the wind. It also shows a nearly airtight shell with good heat insulation ([[peat]]). An optimised orientation to the sun adds additional degrees during the day.&lt;ref name="nachhaltigwirtschaften.at"&gt;From Low-Energy House to the Passive House, p. 15 http://www.nachhaltigwirtschaften.at/hdz_pdf/0812_ph-summerschool_01_02_from_low_energy_to_passive_houses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Log house===
[[Log house]]s have the same advantages as mentioned above. The material wood offers also a good heat insulation and a good airtightness can be reached by filling the gaps with moss and clay.&lt;ref name="nachhaltigwirtschaften.at"/&gt;

===Monte Rosa Cabin===
[[File:Neue Monte Rosa Huette2.JPG|thumb|Monte Rosa cabin]]

Monte Rosa Cabins&lt;ref&gt;Energy Autarky of the Monte Rosa Cabin http://www.inive.org/members_area/medias/pdf/Inive%5Cclima2007%5CB03%5CB03F1350.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; mark a milestone in high alpine building presenting a high degree of energy autarky of over 90%, meaning that 90% of needed energy is obtained locally from renewable sources. The technical systems are based on existing technology (combined heat and power unit, photovoltaics, thermal collectors), innovative wastewater treatment (the wastewater is going to be purified on-site to be reused as [[greywater]]) and foremost an ingenious energy management, which takes into account external conditions such as weather forecast and anticipated occupancy schedules to achieve the demanding goal of the high degree of autarky.

===Mikrohaus===

The basis for [[Mikrohaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Mikrohaus: http://www.mikrohaus.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a 8,80 × 3,44 × 3,25 m cube that allows as kind of modular assembly system to combine several of them and hence to generate a flexibility in the size. The cube(s) don’t have any fundament (only screws of 1,40 m length) which allows some kind of mobile living. No cement and therefore time for drying is requisite. Additional floats allow also an installation on water. The building offers a high isolation up to passive house including e.g. photovoltaic (PV) energy supply.
The cubical form allows a good ratio from volume to surface.
The concept includes waste water treatment for greywater via wastewater treatment plant with an ultraviolet light (UV) treatment unit for sanitary water.
Additional planted walls (www.gruenwand.at) are used outside (for cooling/summer, isolation/winter, noise prevention) and inside (for climate and humidity aspects) which also are used as water-filters as kind of biological purification plant.

===Autarc homes===
Autarc homes&lt;ref&gt;Autarc homes: http://www.weissenseer.com/uploads/media/autarchomes_Projektbeschreibung-Presse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; provides the 1st swimming passive-house worldwide and was originated to provide clients autarkic buildings on the basis of a protective handling of our natural resources to present the following generations a working basis of life.
The swimming and rotatable passiv-house has its own on-board energy generation, water supply and disposal.
The idea is to provide a sustainable, energy-efficient, environmentally compatible and affordable living space. The building can be orientated at the sun to get the most possible effect out of it. As this building is located on water the rotation process is done very energy-efficient.
The tasks are decentralized energy supply and storage, decentralized effluent disposal and recycling/ reprocessing and drinking water supply.

===Pithouse===
{{main|Pit-house}}

==Energy production==
Life on our planet is a permanent [[energy transfer|energy flow]] between living things and the environment. Most of the currently used energy resources, such as oil, coal, [[natural gas]] and [[uranium]] are [[non-renewable]]. The supply of them buried in the earth is limited and we are using them up at a rapid pace.
Renewable energy resources such as [[Solar energy]], [[Wind power|wind energy]], small hydroelectricity (e.g. Swimming hydroelectric power plant&lt;ref&gt;The Strom-Boje - a swimming small hydroelectric power plant http://www.aqualibre.at&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Heat pump|geothermal energy]] and biomass fuels are becoming increasingly attractive. Solar, [[Photovoltaics]], water and wind energy do not send pollutants into the air as occurs with coal and petroleum energy.&lt;ref&gt;HEDON Household Energy Network http://www.hedon.info/RenewableEnergy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen storage]] (storage by hydrogen)&lt;ref&gt;Hydrogen Storage in Hydrides for Safe Energy Systems/ http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The objectives are to store H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in solid metal hydrides from which it can be readily recovered by heating which is an alternative and safe, highly volume efficient storage method. The final aim is to provide a storage technology that is attractive both economically and environmentally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9226">The '''externalities of automobiles''', as similarly other economic [[externality|externalities]], are the measurable costs for other parties except the car proprietor, such costs not being taken into account when the proprietor opts to drive their car. According to the [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the main externalities of driving are local and global [[pollution]], [[oil dependence]], [[traffic congestion]]
and [[traffic accidents]]; while according to a meta-study conducted by the [[Delft University]]&lt;ref name="Delft"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; these externalities are [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[scarcity]] costs, [[Traffic collision|accident]] costs, [[air pollution]] costs, [[noise]] costs, [[climate change]] costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for [[water pollution]], costs for [[soil pollution]] and costs of [[energy dependency]].

==Negative externalities==
The [[Externality#Negative|negative externalities]] seem to be the most obvious to confirm, since the driver does not take into account, for example, the negative effects of [[air pollution]] on third parties, when they opt to drive their car. The legislators and the regulators shall, therefore, internalize those external costs, either by taxes on fuels for example, either by any kind of limitation to car usage, such as [[parking meter]]s or [[Congestion pricing|urban tolls]]. Nevertheless, it seems the drivers in some countries, already pay some external costs with taxes. Road taxes in the Netherlands for instance, have a relatively high yearly value, which covers the maintenance of the infrastructures. Nevertheless, in the majority of western nations, the external costs of driving, are not covered totally either by taxes, or by any kind of car usage limitation.&lt;ref name="Delft"/&gt;

===Traffic congestion and scarcity===
Increased reliance on the automobile leads to increased [[road congestion]]. While expansions in road capacity are often touted as relieving congestion, [[induced demand]] often means that any reductions in congestion are temporary.

===Accidents===
Cars are the leading cause of fatal [[traffic accidents]] in many countries, cars are the leading cause of death of youth and children. In addition to that, health care costs are largely borne by society and injuries to healthy productive citizens caused by car accidents have a cost of millions of [[disability adjusted life years]] every year. [[Vision zero]] is one approach to reduce road fatalities.

===Air pollution===
Cars produce numerous harmful air pollutants in their exhaust such as [[Nitrogen oxide]]s, [[particulate matter]], low atmospheric [[ozone]] (indirectly) and in the case of [[leaded fuel]], lead. Those pollutants are known to cause various respiratory and other health issues and cars are among the leading cause of [[smog]] in modern developed world cities.

===Noise===
Cars significantly contribute to [[noise pollution]]. While on common perception the engine is the main cause for noise, at city speeds the noise produced by wheel and asphalt is commonly the dominant factor while at highway speeds air friction noises become a major factor.

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is significantly caused by human activity, particularly the production of [[greenhouse gasses]] and their release into the atmosphere. Cars produce more Carbon dioxide per [[passenger kilometer]] than any other form of land transport. In addition to that [[Nitrogen oxide]]s are also greenhouse gasses.

===Costs for nature and landscape===
Roads, parking spaces but also [[suburban sprawl]] caused by cars need significant amount of space. Typically, once agricultural or uncultivated land is turned over into ever wider motorways and ever larger parking lots to accommodate the automobile but [[induced demand]] means any relief is temporary and more and more surfaces are sealed in the process.

===Costs for water pollution===
Lubricants and fuels used by automobiles are harmful when they leak into the groundwater. Oil refineries and particularly the mining of [[unconventional oil]] like [[oil shales]] and [[oil sands]] can be extremely harmful for the surrounding water resources and bodies of water.

In addition to that runoff of [[impervious surfaces]] like roads or parking lots can be contaminated with all sorts of pollutants.

===Costs for soil pollution===
In addition to the fertile topsoil often "buried" under freeways and parking spaces, cars directly or indirectly release pollutants into the soil. Oil may leak into the groundwater and the common practice to clean cars in the front yard causes [[surfactants]] and other products in the cleaning products to pollute the ground. Similarly, salt is often used to keep roads and highways free of snow and ice and [[chlorides]] cause major damage to vegetation as well as being an aggressive substance linked to rust and corrosion.

===Costs of energy dependency===
While trains and tramway often run on electricity which can be generated through renewable sources or locally available fuel, cars by and large run on petroleum derived fuels. Only a handful of countries are net exporters of petroleum. For developed countries this causes a political dependence on a reliable petroleum supply and has been cited as the reason for foreign policy decisions of the United States among others. For developing countries, petroleum products can be among the chief imports and reliance on automobiles can significantly impact the trade deficit and public debt of such nations.

===Obesity===
Some research indicates a correlation between  [[urban sprawl]] and obesity. Car centric development and lack of [[walkability]] lead to less use of active modes of transportation such as [[utility cycling]] and walking  which is linked to various health issues caused by a lack of exercise.

==Positive externalities==
While the existence of negative externalities seem consensual, the existence of positive externalities of the automobile does not have consensus amongst economists and experts in the transportation sector. The creation of jobs or the fact that the related industries pay taxes, cannot be considered, as such, as positive externalities, because any legal economic activity pays taxes, and the big majority also needs job demand. Time saving to the driver, and therefore eventually more personal production, cannot either be considered a positive externality, because the driver has already taken those factors into account when they opted to use their car, and therefore these factors cannot be considered, by many authors, a pure externality.

===Accessibility and Land Value===
Notwithstanding the above objections, some authors enumerate positive externalities for the automobile like accessibility and land value. Where land is expensive, it is developed more intensively. Where it is more intensively developed, there are more activities and destinations that can be reached in a given time. Where there are more activities, accessibility is higher and where accessibility is higher, [[land price|land is more expensive]].&lt;ref name="wikibook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Transportation_Economics/Positive_externalities#Positive_and_Negative_Feedback:_A_Systems_Approach|title=Transportation Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However observations show that less car dependent forms of development produce denser settlement patterns and higher land values.

===City Growth===
Economists have sought to understand why cities grow and why large cities seem to be at an advantage relative to others. One explanation that has received much attention emphasizes the role of agglomeration economies in facilitating and sustaining [[city growth]]. The clustering of firms and workers in cities generates positive externalities by allowing for labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers.&lt;ref name="wikibook"/&gt;

Nevertheless some other economists mention [[urban decay]] and [[urban sprawl]] as a negative effect or cost of the automobile, when the city grows due to [[automobile dependency]].&lt;ref name=N&amp;K89&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Peter W.G.|last2=Kenworthy|first2=Jeffrey R.|title=Cities and automobile dependence : a sourcebook|date=1989|publisher=Gower Technical|location=Aldershot, Hants., England|isbn=9780566070402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">A '''fish factory''', also called a '''fish plant''', '''fish processing facility''', is a facility where [[fish processing]] is performed. Fish factories range in the size and range of species of fish they process. Some species of fish, such as [[mackerel]] and [[herring]], and can be caught at sea by large pelagic [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and offloaded to the factory within a few days of being caught. Or the fish can be caught by freezer trawlers that freeze the fish before providing it to factories, or by [[factory ship]]s which can do the processing themselves on board. Some fish factories have [[fishing vessel]]s catching fish for them at a given times of the year. This is to do with quotas and seasons conflicting how much and when the fish can be landed.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Ford Model T]]'s engine was capable of running on [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], or a mixture of the first two.]]

A '''flexible-fuel vehicle (FFV)''' or '''dual-fuel vehicle''' ([[colloquial]]ly called a '''flex-fuel vehicle''') is an [[alternative fuel vehicle]] with an [[internal combustion engine]] designed to run on more than one [[fuel]], usually [[gasoline]] blended with either [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] or [[methanol fuel]], and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the [[combustion chamber]] as [[fuel injection]] and [[ignition timing|spark timing]] are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from [[bi-fuel vehicle]]s, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), [[Autogas|liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), or [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]].

The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with about 50 million + [[automobile]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and [[light duty truck]]s manufactured and sold worldwide by mid 2015, and concentrated in four markets,&lt;ref name="SusTransp"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ryan, Lisa |author2=Turton, Hal | year = 2007 | title = Sustainable Automobile Transport| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, England| isbn = 978-1-84720-451-6| pages = 40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil (29.0&amp;nbsp;million by 2017-YTD),&lt;ref name=BR25miFlex/&gt;&lt;ref name=MotoFlex4mi/&gt; the United States (17.4&amp;nbsp;million by the end of 2014),&lt;ref name=US17m&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.schneider-electric.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2014/12/07/chicago-ethanol-stubbornly-holding-premium-gasoline/|title=Chicago Ethanol Stubbornly Holding Premium to Gasoline

In Brazil, the FFVs are popularly known as "total flex" or simply "flex" cars. In Europe, FFVs are also known as "flexifuel" vehicles. Automakers, particularly in Brazil and the European market, use badging in their FFV models with the some variant of the word "flex", such as [[Volvo]] ''Flexifuel'', or [[Volkswagen]] ''Total Flex'', or [[Chevrolet]] ''FlexPower'' or [[Renault]] ''Hi-Flex'', and [[Ford]] sells its [[Ford Focus (international)|Focus]] model in Europe as ''Flexifuel'' and as ''Flex'' in Brazil. In the US, only since 2008 FFV models feature a yellow gas cap with the label "E85/Gasoline" written on the top of the cap to differentiate E85s from gasoline only models.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

Flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) are based on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber at the same time in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenfleet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biofuelmarketplace.com/(S(mfsz0yfocwuc4lbg2lkdidel))/Anonym/Glossary.aspx?Letter=3 |title=Glossary |publisher=Biofuel Marketplace |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211201803/http://www.biofuelmarketplace.com/(S(mfsz0yfocwuc4lbg2lkdidel))/Anonym/Glossary.aspx?Letter=3 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }} See definition of Dual-Fuel Vehicle&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methanol]] has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as [[Methanol fuel#Methanol fuel by country|M85]] FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt;
* [[Bi-fuel vehicle]]s. The term flexible-fuel vehicles is sometimes used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG; also known as [[autogas]]), or [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorpoint.com.au/ffv-alternative.asp|title=Flexible Fuel Vehicles|publisher=Motopoint|first=Diane|last=Nassy|accessdate=2008-08-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723024113/http://motorpoint.com.au/ffv-alternative.asp|archivedate=2008-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenfleet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biofuelmarketplace.com/(S(mfsz0yfocwuc4lbg2lkdidel))/Anonym/Glossary.aspx?Letter=1| archive-url=https://archive.is/20081211201758/http://www.biofuelmarketplace.com/(S(mfsz0yfocwuc4lbg2lkdidel))/Anonym/Glossary.aspx?Letter=1| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2008-12-11| title=Glossary | publisher=Biofuel Marketplace | accessdate=2008-09-01 }}  See definition of Bi-fuel Vehicle &lt;/ref&gt; The most common available fuel in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html | title=Natural Gas Vehicles |author1=Alternative Fuels |author2=Advanced Vehicles Data Center | publisher=US Department of Energy | accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), [[Argentina]] (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million).&lt;ref name="IANGV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |title=Natural Gas Vehicle Statistics |publisher=International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110101111/http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenCar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/forecast-17m-natural-gas-vehicles-worldwide-by-2015.html#more|title=Forecast: 17M Natural Gas Vehicles Worldwide by 2015|author=Pike Research|date=2009-10-19|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as [[taxicab]]s in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.
* [[Multifuel]] vehicles are capable of operating with more than two fuels. In 2004 [[GM do Brasil]] introduced the [[Chevrolet Astra]] 2.0 with a "MultiPower" engine built on flex fuel technology developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] of Brazil, and capable of using CNG, ethanol and gasoline (E20-E25 blend) as fuel.

Since 1975, and as a response to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -[[Proálcool|Pró-Álcool]]- ({{lang-pt|Programa Nacional do Álcool}}), a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from [[fossil fuels]] in favor of ethanol made from [[sugar cane]].&lt;ref name="Veja1979"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/petroleo/130679.html |title=O petróleo da cana |author=[[Revista Veja]] |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |date=1979-06-13 |accessdate=2008-10-18 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006165850/http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/petroleo/130679.html |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bastos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |author=Milton Briquet Bastos |title=Brazil's Ethanol Program – An Insider's View |publisher=Energy Tribune |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193215/http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began with a low blend of anhydrous alcohol with regular gasoline in 1976,&lt;ref name="USP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/86/86131/tde-07052008-115336/|author=Julieta Andrea Puerto Rico|title=Programa de Biocombustíveis no Brasil e na Colômbia: uma análise da implantação, resultados e perspectivas|publisher=[[Universidade de São Paulo]]|date=2008-05-08|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2008-10-05}} Ph.D. Dissertation Thesis, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; and since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of alcohol or [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20, E25|gasohol E25]].&lt;ref name="Portaria2007" /&gt; In 1979, and as a response to the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil crisis]], the first vehicle capable of running with pure [[hydrous]] ethanol (E100) was launched to the market, the [[Fiat 147]],&lt;ref name="Bastos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2007/02/12/4500680/the-brazilian-ethanol-model.html | author=William Lemos |title=The Brazilian ethanol model |publisher=ICIS news | date=2007-02-05 | accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; after testing with several prototypes developed by [[Fiat]], [[Volkswagen do Brasil|Volkswagen]], [[General Motors do Brasil|GM]] and [[Ford do Brasil|Ford]].&lt;ref name="Veja1979" /&gt; The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]], low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices.

In the United States, initial support to develop alternative fuels by the government was also a response to the first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt; California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escorts]] to [[Los Angeles County]], but only four refueling stations were installed.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt; The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with [[neat ethanol vehicle]] production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt;

[[File:Wiki cars1 005.jpg|thumb|The 1996 [[Ford Taurus]] was the first flexible-fuel vehicle produced with versions capable of running with either [[ethanol fuel|ethanol (E85)]] or [[methanol fuel|methanol (M85)]] blended with gasoline.]]
As an answer to the lack of refueling infrastructure, Ford began development of a flexible-fuel vehicle in 1982, and between 1985 and 1992, 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada, including the 1.6L Ford Escort, the 3.0L [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]], and the 5.0L [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]]. These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford.

Flexible-fuel technology started being developed by Brazilian engineers near the end of the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine in cold weather, used in earlier [[neat ethanol vehicle]]s, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below {{Convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Cold101/&gt; An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas reservoir tank.&lt;ref name=BioEnergia&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Here comes the 'Flex' vehicles third generation |journal=Revista Brasileira de BioEnergia |publisher=Centro Nacional de Referência em Biomassa (Cenbio) |date=August 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-23 |language=Portuguese |author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003062358/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }} Ano 2, No. 3 (every article is presented in both English and Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazeta"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=774927&amp;tit= |title=Bosch investe na segunda geração do motor flex |publisher=Gazeta do Povo |author=Agência Estado |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2008-09-23 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110180712/http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=774927&amp;tit= |archivedate=2009-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008.&lt;ref name="Gazeta" /&gt; In March 2009 [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] launched the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo E-Flex]], the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.&lt;ref name="FlexStart1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/lancamentos/volkswagen-polo-e-flex-425390.shtml |author=Quatro Rodas |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |title=Volkswagen Polo E-Flex |date=March 2009 |accessdate=2003-03-12 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307000657/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/lancamentos/volkswagen-polo-e-flex-425390.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlexStart2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode=0548296D-D8CE-4E25-9973-BF18D30BDFFD |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206040122/http://www.unica.com.br/noticias/show.asp?nwsCode=0548296D-D8CE-4E25-9973-BF18D30BDFFD |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-06 |publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil|UNICA]] |title=Volks lança sistema que elimina tanquinho de gasolina para partida a frio |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2003-03-12 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key innovation in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding the need for an additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American [[M85 fuel|M85]] flex fuel vehicles too expensive.&lt;ref name="VejaFlex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/010206/p_096.html |title=A riqueza é o saber|author=João Gabriel de Lima|publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Revista Veja]]|date=2006-02-01|accessdate=2008-08-19|language=Portuguese}} Print edition No. 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexibility of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers to choose the fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/faq.html#12 DOE FAQ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821085349/http://www.eia.doe.gov/ |date=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EEREFAQ"&gt;http://www.eere.energy.gov [http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/progs/ddown.cgi?afdc/FAQ/5/0/0 Energy.gov site]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128202103/http://www.eere.energy.gov/ |date=January 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAATTF"&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf#page=39 Alternative Fuel Efficiencies in Miles per Gallon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821085349/http://www.eia.doe.gov/ |date=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a [[rule of thumb]], Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opiniaoweb.com/portal/alcool-ou-gasolina-saiba-qual-escolher-quando-for-abastecer/ |title=Álcool ou Gasolina?

Flexible-fuel vehicles were introduced in Sweden as a demonstration test in 1994, when three [[Ford Taurus]] were imported to show the technology existed. Because of the existing interest, a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford Taurus E85 flexifuel in different parts of Sweden: [[Umeå]], [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Härnösand]], [[Stockholm]], [[Karlstad]], [[Linköping]], and [[Växjö]]. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baff.info/english/vehicles_FFV_cars.cfm |author=BAFF |publisher=BioAlcohol Fuel Foundation |title=FFV-Vehicles: Environmental class 1 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024185531/http://www.baff.info/english/vehicles_FFV_cars.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1998 the city of [[Stockholm]] placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers [[Volvo|Volvo Group]] and [[Saab AB]] refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, [[Ford Motor Company]] took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its [[Ford Focus (International)|Focus]] model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.&lt;ref name="EthaMag08" /&gt;

In 2005 both Volvo and Saab introduced to the Sweden market their flexifuel models. Saab began selling its [[Saab 9-5|9-5 2.0 Biopower]], joined in 2006 by its 9-5 2.3 Biopower. Volvo introduced its [[Volvo S40|S40]] and [[Volvo V50|V50]] with flexible-fuel engines, joined in late 2006 by the new [[Volvo C30|C30]]. All Volvo models were initially restricted to the Sweden market, until 2007, when these three models were launched in eight new European markets.&lt;ref name="Volvo06"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/2061108.005/volvo-expands-range-of-flexifuel-cars  | title=Volvo Expands Range of FlexiFuel Cars | author=Volvo Cars Press Release| publisher=World Car Fans | date=2006-11-08 | accessdate=2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Saab also started selling a BioPower version of its popular [[Saab 9-3]] line. In 2008 the Saab-derived [[Cadillac BLS]] was introduced with E85 compatible engines, and Volvo launched the [[Volvo V70|V70]] with a 2.5-litre turbocharged Flexifuel engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.volvocars.com/intl/corporation/FactsandFigures/Pages/default.aspx | title=About Volvo Corporation 2007 and 2008 | publisher=Volvo Cars | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629210151/http://www.volvocars.com/intl/corporation/FactsandFigures/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate = June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All flexible-fuel vehicles in Sweden use an E75 winter blend instead of E85 to avoid engine starting problems during cold weather.&lt;ref name="E75" /&gt; This blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and E75 is used from November until March.&lt;ref name="SEKAB" /&gt; For temperature below {{Convert|-15|°C|°F|abbr=on}} E85 flex vehicles require an engine block heater.&lt;ref name="SEKAB" /&gt; The use of this device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below {{Convert|-23|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt; Another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank, thus reducing the ethanol content below the E75 winter blend, or simply not to use E85 during extreme low temperature spells.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEKAB" /&gt;

Sweden has achieved the largest E85 flexible-fuel vehicle fleet in Europe, with a sharp growth from 717 vehicles in 2001 to 243,136 through December 2014.&lt;ref name=BAFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baff.info/english/ |title=Bought ethanol cars |author=BAFF |publisher=BioAlcohol Fuel Foundation |date=January 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190138/http://www.baff.info/english/ |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }} ''Click on the graph "Bought ethanol cars" showing total sales of E85 flexifuels by year since 2001.

[[File:Volvo s40 2nd generations 2.jpg|thumb|The 2005 [[Volvo S40|Volvo FlexiFuel S40]] was one of the first E85 flexible fuel cars available in the country produced by a Swedish automaker. The Volvo FlexiFuel is now offered on the European market.]]

In order to achieve these goals several government incentives were implemented. Ethanol, as the other biofuels, was exempted of both, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and energy taxes until 2009, resulting in a 30% price reduction at the pump of E85 fuel over gasoline. Furthermore, other demand side incentives for flexifuel vehicle owners include a {{USD|1,800}} bonus to buyers of FFVs, exemption from the [[Stockholm congestion tax]], up to 20% discount on auto insurance, free parking spaces in most of the largest cities, owner annual registration taxes, and a 20% tax reduction for flexifuel company cars. Also, a part of the program, the Swedish Government ruled that 25% of their vehicle purchases (excluding police, fire and ambulance vehicles) must be alternative fuel vehicles.&lt;ref name="EthaMag08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IADB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FordSweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.co.uk/ns7/environment/environment/env_euro_projects/-/-/-/- |title=Projects across Europe: The Swedish example |author=Ford U.K. |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024103013/http://www.ford.co.uk/ns7/environment/environment/env_euro_projects/-/-/-/- |archivedate=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first months of 2008, this package of incentives resulted in sales of flexible-fuel cars representing 25% of new car sales.&lt;ref name="EthaMag08" /&gt;

On the supply side, since 2005 the gasoline fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel a year are required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008.&lt;ref name="EthaMag08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IADB" /&gt; Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just two percent of the four million Swedish vehicles.&lt;ref name="EthaMag04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanol-producer.com/article.jsp?article_id=3935 |title=Ethanol use increases in Sweden |author=Brian Warshaw |publisher=Ethanol Producer Magazine |date=April 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027020440/http://www.ethanol-producer.com/article.jsp?article_id=3935 |archivedate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.&lt;ref name="FordSweden" /&gt;

===== France =====
[[Biofuel]] cars in general get strong tax incentives in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction on the tax on new vehicles, and a 40% reduction on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tax for new cars. For company cars there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the [[value added tax]] (VAT) on E85 vehicles.&lt;ref name="BelBioE85" /&gt; Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at [[Euro|€]] 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per [[liter]], as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85,&lt;ref name="FrenchE85"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/05/08/stillborn-french-gas-stations-chain-stops-selling-e85/ |title=Stillborn: French gas stations chain stops selling E85 |first=Les|last=Echos|date=2008-05-08 |publisher=AutoblogGreen|accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007.&lt;ref name="PricesSWE08" /&gt; French automakers [[Renault]] and [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|PSA]] (Citroen &amp; Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.

===== Germany =====
Biofuel emphasis in Germany is on [[biodiesel]],&lt;ref name="IADB" /&gt; and no specific incentives have been granted for E85 flex-fuel cars, however there is complete exemption of taxes on all biofuels while there is a normal tax of €0.65 per liter of petroleum fuels.&lt;ref name="IADB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BelBioE85" /&gt; The distribution of E85 began in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e85.biz/index.php?page=150|title=E85|publisher=e85biz|accessdate=2008-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230211914/http://www.e85.biz/index.php?page=150|archive-date=2008-12-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling stations in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name="e85.biz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e85.biz/media/archive1/ethanol-tankstellen-d.pdf |format=PDF |date=2008-09-16 |title=Bioethanoltankstellen in Deutschland |language=German |publisher=e85.biz |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911063751/http://www.e85.biz/media/archive1/ethanol-tankstellen-d.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}  As of 2008-09-16&lt;/ref&gt;
As of July 2012 retail prices of E85 was €1.09 per liter, and gasoline was priced at €1.60 per liter (for gasoline RON 95), then providing enough margin to compensate for ethanol's lower fuel economy.&lt;ref name="PricesSWE08" /&gt;
Ford has offered the Ford Focus since August 2005 in Germany. Ford is about to offer also the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and other models as FFV versions between 2008 and 2010. The Saab 9-5 and Saab 9-3 Biopower, the [[Peugeot 308]] Bioflex, the [[Citroën C4]] Bioflex, the [[Audi A5]], two models of the [[Cadillac BLS]], and five Volvo models are also available in the German market by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e85.biz/index.php?page=154|title=Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV) in Germany|publisher=e85biz|accessdate=2008-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230211929/http://www.e85.biz/index.php?page=154|archive-date=2008-12-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]] offers the [[Dacia Logan#Logan MCV|Logan MCV]] with a 1.6l 16v flexfuel engine.

===== Ireland =====
Ireland is the third best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France.&lt;ref name="IreE85"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/motoring/ireland-discovers-the-whey-to-go-13491640.html|title= Ireland discovers the whey to go...|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=2007-11-07|accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from [[whey]], a waste product of [[cheese]] manufacturing.&lt;ref name="IreE85" /&gt; The Irish government established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can account for more than one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back.&lt;ref name="BelBioE85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IreE85" /&gt; E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of [[Maxol]] service stations.&lt;ref name="GalwayE85"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/motoring/motoring/ford-expands-the-mondeo-options-with-flexi/ |title=Ford expands the Mondeo options with Flexi |author=Michael Moroney |date=2008-08-20|publisher=Galway Independent|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.ie/ns7/foc_c307/-/-/vhcl_news_item5/-/-/-/# |title=Flexible-fuel: A new innovation from Ford |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630232038/http://www.ford.ie/ns7/foc_c307/-/-/vhcl_news_item5/-/-/-/ |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the [[Ford C-Max|C-max]] and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.&lt;ref name="GalwayE85" /&gt;
[[File:Ford Focus Flexifuel in Madrid with flexifuel badging.jpg|thumb|The Ford Focus flexifuel was the first [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E85|E85]] flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.]]

From 1 January 2011 E85 fuel is no longer excise-free in Ireland. Maxol has announced they will not provide E85 when their current supplies have run out.&lt;ref name="MaxolIreE85"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxol.ie/maxol-bioethanol-e85.html|title=404 Page - The Maxol Group|author=|date=|website=www.maxol.ie|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Spain =====

The first flexifuel vehicles were introduced in Spain by late 2007, with the acquisition of 80 cars for use in the Spaniard official government fleet. At that time the country had only three gas stations selling [[Gasohol#E85|E85]], making necessary to deploy an official E85 fueling station in [[Madrid]] to attend these vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/12/30/spain-adding-flex-fuel-capability-to-official-fleet/|title=Spain adding flex-fuel capability to official fleet|publisher=AutoblogGreen|author=Xavier Navarro|accessdate=2009-05-25|date=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the introduction in the Spaniard market of several flexifuel models, by the end of 2008 still persists the problems of adequate E85 fueling infrastructure, as only 10 gas stations were selling E85 fuel to the public in the entire country.&lt;ref name=Spain1008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotizalia.com/cache/2008/10/28/62_incorporaran_tecnologia_biopower_utiliza_bioetanol.html|title=Los Saab Aero 2009 incorporarán la tecnología BioPower, que utiliza bioetanol|publisher=Cotizalia|author=Europa Press|accessdate=2009-05-25|date=2008-10-28|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== United Kingdom =====
The UK government established several incentives for E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 [[Penny|p]] per liter, until 2010; a [[Pound sterling|£]] 10 to 15 reduction in the [[vehicle excise duty]] (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars.&lt;ref name="BelBioE85"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioethanol.skynetblogs.be/post/4502748/etat-des-choses-dans-differents-pays-avril-20|title=Etat des choses dans différents pays (avril 2007)|publisher=Bio-Ethanol (E85) en Belgique |date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the small number of E85 pump stations available, limited to the [[Morrisons]] supermarket chain stations,&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BelBioE85" /&gt; most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market.

The E85 blend is used in gasoline engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline.&lt;ref name="EEREFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAATTF" /&gt; Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;

The American E85 flex-fuel vehicle was developed to run on any mixture of unleaded gasoline and ethanol, anywhere from 0% to 85% ethanol by volume. Both fuels are mixed in the same tank, and E85 is sold already blended. In order to reduce ethanol evaporative emissions and to avoid problems starting the engine during cold weather, the maximum blend of ethanol was set to 85%.&lt;ref name="ColdE85" /&gt; There is also a seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to E70 (called winter E85 blend) in very cold regions,&lt;ref name="E70green"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/02/27/when-is-e85-not-85-percent-ethanol-when-its-e70-with-an-e85-st/ | title= When is E85 not 85 percent ethanol?

E85 flex-fuel vehicles are becoming increasingly common in the [[Midwest]], where [[maize|corn]] is a major [[agriculture|crop]] and is the primary feedstock for [[ethanol fuel]] production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;

A 2005 survey found that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EERE08" /&gt; This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex vehicles look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollo" /&gt; Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2007-05-05-ethanolvehicles_N.htm| title= 'Flex-fuel' vehicles touted|work=[[USA Today]] | author=Ken Thomas | date=2007-05-07 | accessdate= 2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YellowCap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/vehiclebuyingguide/ig/Alt-fuels---New-York-Auto-Show/Yellow-E85-gas-cap.htm |title=Yellow E85 gas cap |publisher=About.com: Hybrid Cars &amp; Alt Fuels |author1=Christine Gable |author2=Scott Gable |accessdate=2008-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005054544/http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/vehiclebuyingguide/ig/Alt-fuels---New-York-Auto-Show/Yellow-E85-gas-cap.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/08/10/more-gas-cap-news-chrysler-going-yellow-for-e85/ |title=More gas cap news: Chrysler going yellow for E85 |author=John Neff |date=2006-10-06 |publisher=AutoBlog|accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/03/28/afvi-ford-confirms-that-all-2008-police-interceptors-will-be-fl/ |title=AFVI: Ford confirms that all 2008 police interceptors will be flex-fuel |first=Sam |last=Abuelsamid |date=2007-03-28 |publisher=AutobogGreen |accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have argued that American automakers have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85.&lt;ref name="Apollo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT082006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/business/31loophole.html?emc=eta1 |title=Dual-Fuel Vehicles Open Mileage Loophole for Carmakers |author1=Alexei Barrionuevo |author2=Micheline Maynard |work=The New York Times|date=2006-08-31|accessdate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between {{USD|100}} and {{USD|200}} that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year.&lt;ref name="NYT082006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10551762| title=Bumpy Ride for Biofuels | publisher=The Economist | date=2008-01-18 | accessdate=2008-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/information/november_2011-table_of_contents|title=The CAFE Numbers Game: Making Sense of the New Fuel-Economy Regulations|author=Tony Quiroga|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|date=November 2011|accessdate=2011-10-24|page=20}}'' From the print edition of C&amp;D.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 analysis by the [[Renewable Fuels Association]] (RFA) found that oil companies prevent or discourage affiliated retailers from selling E85 through rigid franchise and branding agreements, restrictive supply contracts, and other tactics. The report showed independent retailers are five times more likely to offer E85 than retailers carrying an oil company brand.&lt;ref name=RFAOutlook2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5088b8e8e6b427bb3_cwm626ws2.pdf |title=Going Global - 2015 Ehtanol Industry Outlook |author=[[Renewable Fuels Association]] (RFA) |publisher=RFA |date=2015|accessdate=2015-11-22}} ''See page 22.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 [[General Motors|GM]] brought UK-sourced [[w:Saab 9-5#E85|Saab 9-5 Biopower]] E85 flex-fuel vehicles to Australia as a trial, in order to measure interest in ethanol-powered vehicles in the country. Saab Australia placed the vehicles with the fleets of the [[Queensland]] Government, the media, and some ethanol producers. E85 is not available widely in Australia, but [[the Manildra Group]] provided the E85 blend fuel for this trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/01/gm_begins_saab_.html |title=GM Begins Saab E85 Trial in Australia|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saab Australia became the first car maker to produce an E85 flex-fuel car for the Australian market with the Saab 9-5 BioPower. One month later launched the new [[Saab 9-3|9-3 BioPower]], the first vehicle in Australia to give drivers a choice of three fuels, E85, diesel or gasoline, and both automobiles are sold for a small premium.

In March 2009 the [[Colombia]]n government enacted a mandate to introduce [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E85|E85]] flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013.

The main feedstock used in New Zealand for ethanol production is [[whey]], a by-product of [[milk]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0609/S00245.htm |title=Introducing New Zealand's First Flexi-Fuel Vehicle |publisher=Scoop Business|author=Ford press release|date=2006-09-14|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paraguay ====
Government officials and businessmen from [[Paraguay]] began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers in order to import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/economia/ultnot/2007/05/24/ult35u53557.jhtm |title=Paraguai pode ser o primeiro destino dos carros "flex" do Brasil|publisher=UOL Economia|date=2007-05-24|accessdate=2008-09-17|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.com.py/2008-05-21/articulos/415461/paraguay-dara-el-paso-decisivo-a-la-era-del-alcohol-carburante |title=Paraguay dará el paso decisivo a la era del alcohol carburante |publisher=ABC Digital|date=2008-05-21| accessdate=2008-10-25 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/economia/mat/2008/05/02/paraguai_lanca_programa_de_estimulo_carros_flex_-427180175.asp |title=Paraguai lança programa de estímulo a carros "flex" |author=Paraguai lança programa de estímulo a carros "flex" |publisher=O Globo Online |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517034101/http://oglobo.globo.com/economia/mat/2008/05/02/paraguai_lanca_programa_de_estimulo_carros_flex_-427180175.asp |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thailand ====
In 2006, tax incentives were established in [[Thailand]] for the introduction of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) as an [[alternative fuel]], by eliminating import duties and lowering excise taxes on CNG-compatible cars. Then in 2007, Thai authorities approved incentives for the production of "eco-cars", with the goal of the country to become a regional hub for the production of small, affordable and fuel-efficient cars. Seven automakers joint in the program, [[Toyota]], [[Suzuki]], [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Honda]], [[Tata Motors|Tata]] and [[Volkswagen]].&lt;ref name="EconomistUnit" /&gt; In 2008 the government announced priority for E85, expecting these flex-fuel vehicles to become widely available in Thailand in 2009, three years ahead of schedule. The incentives include cuts in excise tax rates for E85-compatible cars and reduction of corporate taxes for ethanol producers to make sure E85 fuel supply will be met.&lt;ref name="EconomistUnit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Digest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2008/08/29/thailand-e85-tax-incentive-confusion-has-stymied-flex-fuel-car-makers-planning-ethanol-glut-looms-as-e85-takeoff-delayed/ |title=Thailand E85 tax incentive confusion has stymied flex-fuel car makers planning: ethanol glut looms as E85 takeoff delayed |publisher=Biofuel Digest|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2008-09-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919145617/http://biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2008/08/29/thailand-e85-tax-incentive-confusion-has-stymied-flex-fuel-car-makers-planning-ethanol-glut-looms-as-e85-takeoff-delayed/ |archivedate=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new plan however, brought confusion and protests by the automakers which sign-up for the "eco-cars", as competition with the E85 flex-fuel cars will negatively affect their ongoing plans and investments, and their production lines will have to be upgraded at a high cost for them to produce flex-fuel cars.&lt;ref name="EconomistUnit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Digest" /&gt; They also complained that flex-fuel vehicles popular in a few countries around the world, limiting their export potential as compared with other engine technologies.&lt;ref name="EconomistUnit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viewswire.com/index.asp?layout=ib3Article&amp;article_id=543411439&amp;pubtypeid=1112462496&amp;rf=0 |title=Thailand fuels: Thai indecision |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]]|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy, the first E85 flexible fuel vehicles were introduced in November 2008. The first two models available in the Thai market were the [[Volvo S80]] and the [[Volvo C30|C30]]. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By the time of the introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 it was expected that 15 fueling stations in [[Bangkok]] will have E85 fuel available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/12/02/volvo-launches-flex-fuel-s80-and-c30-in-thailand-to-go-with-new/|title=Volvo launches flex fuel S80 and C30 in Thailand to go with new E85 stations|publisher=AutoblogGreen|author= Sam Abuelsamid|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2008/11/27/thailand-introduces-first-e85-vehicle/|title=Thailand Introduces First E85 Vehicle|publisher=Domesticfuel.com|author=  Michelle Kautz |date=2008-11-27|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 the [[Mitsubishi Concept-Sportback|Mitsubishi Lancer Ex]] was launched becoming the first mass-production E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/marketing/23939/mitsubishi-launches-flexible-fuel-lancer|title=Mitsubishi launches flexible-fuel Lancer|date=2009-09-16|accessdate=2010-01-16|publisher=[[Bangkok Post]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flocking''' behavior is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a [[Flock (birds)|flock]], are [[foraging]] or in flight. There are parallels with the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] behavior of fish, the [[swarm]]ing behavior of insects, and [[herd behavior]] of land animals.

Computer simulations and mathematical models which have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviors of birds can generally be applied also to the "flocking" behavior of other species. As a result, the term "flocking" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds.

This article is about the modelling of flocking behavior. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, "flocking" is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities and is a [[collective animal behavior]] exhibited by many living beings such as [[flock (birds)|bird]]s, [[fish]], [[bacteria]], and  [[insect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= O'Loan |first= OJ |last2= Evans |first2= MR |year= 1999|title= Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking |url= https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002/meta |journal= Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General |publisher= IOP Publishing |volume= 32 |issue= 8 |pages= L99 |doi= 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode= 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an [[emergence|emergent]] behavior arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

Flocking behavior was simulated on a computer in 1987 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] with his simulation program, [[Boids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
|author= Reynolds, Craig W.
|title= Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model.
|booktitle= ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics
|volume=21 |issue=4 |pages= 25–34

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The result is akin to a [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of [[bird]]s, a [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] of [[fish]], or a [[swarm]] of [[insects]].

==Flocking rules==

Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules:

#Separation - avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
#Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbours
#Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)

With these three simple rules, the flock moves in an extremely realistic way, creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al.

used attraction, alignment and avoidance and extended this with a number of traits of real starlings: first, birds fly according to fixed wing aerodynamics, while rolling when turning (thus losing lift); second, they coordinate with a limited number of interaction neighbours of 7 (like real starlings); third, they try to stay above a sleeping site (like starlings do at dawn), and when they happen to move outwards from the sleeping site, they return to it by turning; fourth, they move at relative fixed speed. The authors showed that the specifics of flying behaviour as well as large flocksize and low number of interaction partners were essential to the creation of the variable shape of flocks of starlings.

== Measurement ==
Measurements of bird flocking have been made&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last =Feder | first =Toni |date=October 2007 | title =Statistical physics is for the birds | journal = Physics Today| volume =60 | issue =10 | pages =28–30 | id = | url = | accessdate = | doi =10.1063/1.2800090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using high-speed cameras, and a computer analysis has been made to test the simple rules of flocking mentioned above. It is found that they generally hold true in the case of bird flocking, but the long range attraction rule (cohesion) applies to the nearest 5-10 neighbors of the flocking bird and is independent of the distance of these neighbors from the bird. In addition, there is an [[anisotropy]] with regard to this cohesive tendency, with more cohesion being exhibited towards neighbors to the sides of the bird, rather than in front or behind. This is no doubt due to the field of vision of the flying bird being directed to the sides rather than directly forward or backward.

Another recent study is based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome, and uses a computer model assuming minimal behavioural rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hildenbrandt | first1 = H | last2 = Carere | first2 = C | last3 = Hemelrijk | first3 = CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemelrijk | first1 = CK | last2 = Hildenbrandt | first2 = H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index Project Starflag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk Swarm behaviour model by University of Groningen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithmic complexity==
In flocking simulations, there is no central control; each bird behaves autonomously. In other words, each bird has to decide for itself which flocks to consider as its environment. Usually environment is defined as a circle (2D) or sphere (3D) with a certain radius (representing reach).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A basic implementation of a flocking algorithm has complexity &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; - each bird searches through all other birds to find those which fall into its environment.{{synthesis-inline|date=March 2018}}

Possible improvements:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* bin-[[Square lattice|lattice]] spatial subdivision. Entire area the flock can move in is divided into a large number of bins. Each bin stores which birds it contains. Each time a bird moves from one bin to another, lattice has to be updated.
** Example: 2D(3D) grid in a 2D(3D) flocking simulation.
** Complexity: &lt;math&gt;O(n k)&lt;/math&gt;, k is number of surrounding bins to consider; just when bird's bin is found in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Lee Spector, Jon Klein, Chris Perry and [[Mark Feinstein]] studied the emergence of collective behavior in evolutionary computation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hampshire.edu/lspector/gecco2003-collective.html | author=Spector, L. |author2=Klein, J. |author3=Perry, C. |author4= Feinstein, M.  | year=2003 | title=Emergence of Collective Behavior in Evolving Populations of Flying Agents | work=Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2003) | publisher=Springer-Verlag | accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Chazelle]] proved that under the assumption that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius, the time it takes to converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. This means that if the number of birds is large enough, the convergence time will be so great that it might as well be infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Chazelle, ''The Convergence of Bird Flocking'', J. ACM 61 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This result applies only to convergence to a steady state. For example, arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors, which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird's central nervous systems—bird-to-bird-to-bird.

In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated a flock-like behavior in humans. The group of people exhibited a very similar behavioral pattern to that of a flock, where if 5% of the flock would change direction the others would follow suit. When one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish.&lt;ref&gt;"http://psychcentral.com/news/2008/02/15/herd-mentality-explained/1922.html".

Fulvic acid, one of two classes of natural acidic organic polymers that can be extracted from humus found in soil, sediment, or aquatic environments. Its name derives from Latin ''fulvus'', indicating its yellow colour. This organic matter is soluble in strong acid (pH = 1) and has the average chemical formula C&lt;sub&gt;135&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;182&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A hydrogen-to-carbon ratio greater than 1:1 indicates less aromatic character (i.e., fewer benzene rings in the structure), while an oxygen-to-carbon ratio greater than 0.5:1 indicates more acidic character than in other organic fractions of humus (for example, humic acid, the other natural acidic organic polymer that can be extracted from humus). Its structure is best characterized as a loose assembly of aromatic organic polymers with many carboxyl groups (COOH) that release hydrogen ions, resulting in species that have electric charges at various sites on the ion. It is especially reactive with metals, forming strong complexes with Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in particular and leading to their increased solubility in natural waters. Fulvic acid is believed to originate as a product of microbial metabolism, although it is not synthesized as a life-sustaining carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/fulvic-acid&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulvic acid is created in extremely small quantities under the influence of millions of useful microbes, working on the decay of plant matter in a soil environment with sufficient oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Environment with adeequate oxygen — Schnitzer, M. (1977). Recent findings of the characterization of humic substances extracted from soils from widely differing climatic zones.

At the same time, the main problem is not extraction, but subsequent purification, in particular, the breaking of the molecular bond with Cl, Fe, which together with FA form toxic dihaloacetonitriles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22295957| year = 1983| author1 = Oliver| first1 = B.

== Methods of determination in extract ==

Until recently, there has been no standardized analytical method that the scientific community could rely on for consistent accuracy to determine the quantity of fulvic acid in an extract. Without an industry standard, manufacturers and sellers of fulvic products used methods that resulted in various claims being made on labels, marketing literature and websites of commercial fulvic acid products. These claims have caused many scientists and consumers to question the validity and accuracy of these claims about fulvic acid content, which made the evaluation of fulvic products very difficult. 

Analytical quantification methods in the past measured both humic and fulvic acid as one substance.  This created analytical challenges and mass confusion for those products that are fulvic isolates, having no measurable or very low humic acid in them.  It is also the primary reason that fulvic acid content claims were usually inaccurate and much higher than is being brought to light with the new standardized method. 

;Lamar standardized method
The Lamar standardized method&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6831f1_83b86a2e3f8e4fa99e5aabaf82f177e3.pdf THE LAMAR STANDARDIZED METHOD]&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by a team of scientists and individuals from various organizations involved in soil science, the Lamar method was recently accepted as the standardized method for fulvic acid quantification by Association of American Plant Food Control Officials, the Humic Products Trade Association), and the International Humic Substances Society. 

;Butler method
Until the emergence of the standardized Lamar method in 2015, this has been the most accurate of all testing methods for fulvic acid and may still hold promise since the results produced, with regards to fulvic acid content, are somewhat similar to the Lamar method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academictree.org/chemistry/publications.php?pid=67837 LGB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://academictree.org/chemistry/publications.php?pid=67837 Larry G, Butler]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulvic acid is condensed tannin and can be absorbed by a resin whereby it can be quantified much more accurately by reading the vanillin conjugates of the sample.   The one disadvantage to this method, as compared to the Lamar method, is that it does not purify or separate the lignin sulfates from the fulvic acid fraction leading to some inaccuracies in the final FA result.

;Colorimetric
Humic acid is exposed to light; the amount of light absorbed is compared to the quantification value of a [[Sigma-Aldrich]] standardized sample taken from a mine in Germany. Although quick and easy, this method lumps the fulvic acid in with the humic acid producing poor quantification of fulvic isolates.   

;California method (CDFA)
This test was developed by the California State Department of Agriculture. This method does separate the humic and the fulvic but it then discards the fulvic solution and only measures the remaining liquid also including the organic ash content as part of the quantification result with no purification steps performed to remove the ash.  This of course leads to various analytical inaccuracies.  This is the only method that the California departments of agriculture will accept when registering a product.  California does not recognize fulvic acid as separate substance from humic acid and requires that all label registrations list the content as humic acid only.  Until 2017, Oregon also required using this method but has recently switched to the Lamar Method of fulvic acid quantification and now allows the label registration of fulvic acid as a substance apart from humic acid.

;Verploegh and Brandvold method
The Verploegh and Brandvold method (V&amp;B) quantifies both humic and fulvic acid and is a quick, cost effective, and easy test to perform.  It does not go through purification of the chemical reagents used to separate the humic and fulvic acids. This results in various inaccuracies that can produce inflated fulvic acid content readings since amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and lignin sulfates are all lumped in with the quantification.

A '''gas cabinet''' is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.&lt;ref name="Downie1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=N.A. Downie|title=Industrial Gases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EZ7GF3NEr0C&amp;pg=PA219|date=31 December 1996|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7514-0352-7|pages=219–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of gas cabinets is to contain potential leaks in piping and fittings at the cylinder connection. The cabinet must be exhausted by a specifically designed fan and exhaust system. The cabinet exhaust system draws leaking hazardous gasses out of the cabinet.  In the case of a flammable gas the cabinet will contain the flame for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ehs/www99/right/handsMan/compgas/compgas.html |title=Compressed Gas Safety|publisher=North Carolina State University |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can use a newly reconditioned cabinet as well as non-reconditioned used gas cabinets depending on their requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.berkeley.edu/toxic-gas-cabinet-0|title=Toxic Gas Cabinets|publisher=Environment Health and Safety University of California,Berkley|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
There are a variety of gas cabinets available in the market in different gas cylinder configurations, such as 1, 2 and 3 bottle designs.  They can be either new, used, or reconditioned. A gas cylinder cabinet can have many features depending on the specific gas. These features include gas sensor, sprinkler head, excess flow sensor, automatic operation with automatic purging and excess pressure sensor.

They should meet the Uniform Fire Code Specifications and the National Fire Protection Association.  They need to adhere to the Compressed Gas Association and Semiconductor Equipment &amp; Materials Institute codes.  It is also important to know whether the cabinet is OSHA compliant.  OSHA offers additional safety precautions involving the use of gas cabinets. In the absence of finite specifications or unknowns the user or designer should seek the assistance of an impartial consultant.

Reconditioned gas cabinets can be more useful than non-reconditioned used gas cabinets because of the thorough process used in professionally reconditioning and testing to ensure all systems meet manufacturer’s specifications. Different types of gas cabinets can be used, depending on the gas type in the cylinder. Automatic gas cabinets with multiple sensors are useful and fulfill many other requirements.

A gas cabinet can also be manufactured specifically for a company's needs and at lower cost. It is required that a gas cabinet is used for fire safety for gas cylinders.  The requirements vary by state. Many states have no advanced regulations for hazardous industrial gasses since there is little or no use of such gasses in that state.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=5abf32c6e0b24f92b6609a6fc073b431&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|title=Federal Gas Cabinet Opportunities|publisher=Fed Biz Opps|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The gas cabinets are categorized into four popular types based on the type of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/manufacturing_process_equipment/gas_handling_equipment/gas_distribution_systems|title=Gas Distribution Systems|publisher= Global Spec|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The categories are:

===Manual===
These gas cabinets are used for inert, non-reactive and non-toxic gases. There are automatic gas cabinets also available and thus these cabinets are less useful when compared to automatic cabinets.

===Fully automatic ===
These cabinets are available for corrosive, toxic and reactive gases. They provide safe and clean delivery of ultra-high purity gases.  Such systems are designed to monitor a huge number of facility inputs and process sensors as per requirements.

===Auto changeover===
These gas cabinets are useful when uninterrupted gas flow is required. Auto changeover gas cabinets can be defined by mass or pressure inputs. There is software also available for multiple cylinder scales on each joint or bank. Purge down and purge up processes can also be performed without any interruption of connected cylinders.

==Valve Ports==
The port and valve specifications for gas cabinets and distribution systems are an important part of the selection process.

===Valve Types===
Gas cabinets may be distinguished by the types of valves used to control flow.
Manual valves.  Valves are manually adjusted or deployed via a control knob, lever, or other manual device.
Solenoid valves.  Valves are opened and closed via a solenoid magnet deployed by an electrical signal.
Air pilot valves.  Valves are deployed via a pneumatic signal.

===Port Types===
Ports are openings in the manifold or distribution system where the inlet and outlet connections are produced. Each opening is either an inlet (supply) port or an outlet port.  The number of each corresponds to the requirements of the application.
The quantity of supply ports specifies the number of independent fluid supplies that could be interfaced with the manifold or manifold system.

The number of outlet ports establishes the number of outlets in the system. This is frequently specified as number of ports or valves that are or can be attached to the manifold.  For example, an 8-point manifold has 8 ports or valves.
Ports are sized based roughly on tube or pipe size with some important choices.  For industrial gases it is possible to purchase manifolds made of Stainless steel pipe or copper and brass although both these materials are giving way to Stainless steel tubing. (Note differences between Tubing and Pipe). Connection choices might be NPT, VCO, Flare or other
types.

 For gas service that is "Clean For Oxygen Service (CFOS)"  or for Ultra Pure service, manifolds and change over assemblies are typically made from 1/4" OD, 316 L, Electropolished tubing (the ID is Electropolished). The fittings used for ports and other connections are exclusively the "VCR" fitting. Training is needed to properly handle and install VCR connections using a variety of non-resuseable crushable metal gasket materials. Metal gaskets are essential in order to achieve high helium leak ratings.

==Specifications==
The specifications for a gas cabinet detail everything from gas flow rates to the physical size of the system.

===Maximum pressure===
Pressure describes the amount of force exerted on a system by the contained and pressurized gas. Most compressed gases will not exceed 2,000 to 2,640 pounds per square inch gage (psig), but some can reach pressures of 6,000 psig. The system's weakest point determines the pressure limit, so any parts weakened by heat, corrosion, or stress may potentially lower the maximum pressure of the system or cause the vessel to rupture.  Many times this is at the point of welds.

===Maximum flow===
Flow rate details the maximum rate of flow of the gas through the operation, typically measured in standard cubic feet per minute (scfm).

===Temperature range===
Temperature range is the full mandated range of safe ambient or fluid operating temperatures, given in degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius.

===Dimensions===
Size dimensions specify the physical size of the gas cabinet, distribution system, or its components.
Cabinet size - Indicates the physical size of the gas cabinet or the body of the distribution system.
Port/tube size - Indicates the physical size of the tubing or exhaust port connections in the system, typically given in inches based on a sizing standard such as National Pipe Thread (NPT). Sizing is important, as an undersized tube line will result in high pressure drops, while an oversized line will be unnecessarily expensive to install.

==Materials==
The materials used to construct the gas cabinet are an important part of proper system selection. The materials used for the casing and outer parts must have adequate structural strength, while the materials for the gas handling components must be compatible with the media, temperature requirements, and pressure ratings to prevent leakage, rupture, or contamination.

===Aluminum===
A light and fairly corrosion resistant metal which is most often anodized for increased corrosion and wear resistance. Aluminum is never used for tubing or fittings in modern industrial gas control &amp; distribution systems since 316L stainless steel (optimum choice) is so available. Aluminum is not an ideal choice for purity. Aluminum in any form is never used for ultra pure industrial gas systems.

===Copper===
A soft, ductile metal with low hardness and excellent corrosion resistance. Copper is used commonly in tubes and pipes for its inertness and resistance to corrosion. Copper can be used for low air, oxygen and other inert non-critical gases such as medical CFOS systems. For ultra pure gasses 316L Stainless steel remains the optimum choice for many reasons.

===Plastic===
Any of numerous thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers of high molecular weight. Different grades (such as nylon, acetal, and polycarbonate) have varying properties, but most have strong chemical and corrosion resistance.

===Steel===
General purpose industrial metal with high physical strength and hardness. Steel is typically coated or finished to increase its corrosion resistance properties. Steel is used in the petroleum and petro-chemical industries.

===Stainless steel===
316L Stainless steel became industry standard for fittings, piping and controls in gas cabinets and distribution systems in the early 1980s. The material is further improved by electropolishing to render wetted surfaces extremely impervious to the most reactive gasses creating a non-shedding surface. A large industry has grown around supplying these ultra-specialized components and materials.

'''International Business Machines Corporation''' ('''IBM''') is an American multinational [[information technology]] company headquartered in [[Armonk, New York]], United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911 as the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]] (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924.

IBM manufactures and markets computer [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[middleware]] and [[computer software|software]], and provides [[Internet hosting service|hosting]] and [[consultant|consulting services]] in areas ranging from [[mainframe computer]]s to [[nanotechnology]]. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most U.S. [[patents]] generated by a business ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}) for 25 consecutive years.&lt;ref name="patents"&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Breaks Records to Top U.S. Patent List for 25th Consecutive Year|url=https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-news-wire/PRNews_20180109NY83865/ibm-breaks-records-to-top-us-patent-list-for-25th-consecutive-year.html|publisher=Morningstar|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions by IBM include the &lt;!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE--&gt;[[automated teller machine]] (ATM), the [[floppy disk]], the [[hard disk drive]], the [[magnetic stripe card]], the [[relational model|relational database]], the [[SQL|SQL programming language]], the [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcode]], and [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM).&lt;!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE--&gt; The [[IBM mainframe]], exemplified by the [[IBM System/360|System/360]], was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.

IBM has continually shifted its business mix by [[Commoditization|commoditizing]] [[Market (economics)|markets]] focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] printer manufacturer [[Lexmark]] in 1991 and selling off its [[personal computer]] ([[ThinkPad]]/[[ThinkCentre]]) and [[x86]]-based [[IBM System x|server]] businesses to [[Lenovo]] (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC Consulting]] (2002), [[SPSS]] (2009), [[The Weather Company]] (2016), and  [[Red Hat]](2018). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go "[[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]]", continuing to design [[semiconductors]], but offloading manufacturing to [[GlobalFoundries]].

Nicknamed '''Big Blue''', IBM is one of 30 companies included in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and one of the world's largest employers, with ({{as of|2017|lc=y}}) over 380,000 employees. Known as "IBMers", IBM employees have been awarded five [[Nobel Prize]]s, six [[Turing Award]]s, ten [[National Medal of Technology|National Medals of Technology]] and five [[National Medal of Science|National Medals of Science]].

==History==
{{Main|History of IBM}}
In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E.

They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. [[Thomas J. Watson, Sr.]], fired from the [[National Cash Register Company]] by [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Henry Patterson]], called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Belden, Thomas Graham |author2= Belden, Marva Robins |year= 1962 |title= The Lengthening Shadow: The Life of Thomas J.

In 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the [[U.S. Government]], during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the [[Social Security Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ibm.html | title=Early Automation Challenges for SSA | first=Larry | last=DeWitt |date = April 2000| accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tracking of persecuted groups by Hitler's [[Third Reich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1388.wss|date=February 14, 2001|title=IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit|publisher=IBM Press room}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/142991/edwin-black-ibm-nazi-holocaust-history|title=This Is the Hidden Nazi History of IBM — And the Man Who Tried to Expose It|publisher=Tech.Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely through the German subsidiary [[Dehomag]].

In 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.&lt;ref name="WTC1949"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibmworldtrade/ |title=The Creation of the World Trade Corporation |author= |work= |publisher=IBM Corp. |website= ibm.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of [[artificial intelligence]] when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an [[IBM 704]] not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience.  In 1957, the [[FORTRAN]] scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE reservation system]] for [[American Airlines]] and introduced the highly successful [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [[Armonk, New York]]. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.

[[File:IBM360-67AtUmichWithMikeAlexander.jpg|thumb|right|An [[IBM System/360]] in use at the [[University of Michigan]] c. 1969.]]

On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the [[IBM System/360]]. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the [[IBM System/370]] in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the [[IBM mainframe]] the dominant [[mainframe computer]] and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as [[OS/VS1]] and [[MVS]], and the middleware built on top of those such as the [[CICS]] [[transaction processing monitor]], had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry | first=Martin | last=Campbell-Kelly | authorlink=Martin Campbell-Kelly | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | pages=140–143, 175–176, 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, IBM engineer [[George J. Laurer]] developed the [[Universal Product Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cummingsdesign.com/bar_code_history.htm |title=The history of the UPC bar code and how the bar code symbol and system became a world standard. |author= |work= |publisher=Cummingsdesign |accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM and the [[World Bank]] first introduced [[Swap (finance)|financial swaps]] to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th, alternate |last1=Ross |last2 =Westerfield|last3= Jordan|year= 2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IBM PC]], originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard.

[[Research]] has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, [[IBM Research]] constitutes the largest [[R&amp;D|industrial research]] organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/|title=IBM Research: Global labs|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM Research is headquartered at the [[Thomas J.

In terms of investment, IBM's [[R&amp;D]] spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately US$6.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM's expenditure on research and development from 2005 to 2015 (in billion U.S. dollars)|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/274821/ibms-expenditure-on-research-and-development-since-2005/|publisher=Statista|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for [[IBM Watson|Watson]] in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bort|first1=Julie|title=Ginni Rometty just set a big goal for IBM: spending $4 billion to bring in $40 billion|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-ceo-sets-big-40-billion-goal-2015-2|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has been a leading proponent of the [[Open Source Initiative]], and began supporting [[Linux]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |title=IBM launches biggest Linux lineup ever |date=1999-03-02 |publisher=IBM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991110114228/http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |archivedate=1999-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM [[Linux Technology Center]], which includes over 300 [[Linux kernel]] developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM invests in Brazil Linux Tech Center|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/185602/|date=2006-05-24|publisher=[[LWN.net]]|author=Farrah Hamid}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has also released code under different [[open source license]]s, such as the [[Cross-platform|platform-independent]] [[software framework]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-erick.html |title=Interview: The Eclipse code donation |date=2001-11-01 |publisher=IBM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218093727/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-erick.html |archivedate=December 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the three-sentence [https://archive.is/20121220184517/http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/license.html International Components for Unicode] ([[International Components for Unicode|ICU]]) license, and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) [[Apache Derby]].

Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2018, the company holds the record for most [[patents]] generated by a business, marking 25 consecutive years for the achievement.&lt;ref name="patents"/&gt;

Five IBMers have received the [[Nobel Prize]]: [[Leo Esaki]], of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors; [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the [[scanning tunneling microscope]];&lt;ref name="nobelPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1986 - Press Release|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=1986-10-15|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Bednorz]] and [[K.

Aside from the logo, IBM used [[Helvetica]] as a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed [[IBM Plex]].

IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the [[Masters Tournament]], one of the four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in [[Professional golf tours|professional golf]], with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ward|title=IBM and Masters Celebrate 20 Years|url=http://www.masters.com/en_US/news/articles/2016-04-02/ibm_and_masterscom_celebrate_20_years.html|publisher=Masters|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, IBM CEO [[Ginni Rometty]] became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the [[Augusta National Golf Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinman|first1=Sam|title=IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is Augusta National's third female member|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/ibm-ceo-ginni-rometty-is-augus|publisher=Golf Digest|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM is also a major sponsor in professional [[tennis]], with engagements at the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[Australian Open]], and the [[French Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Benjamin|title=Why IBM dominates the U.S. Open|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/01/ibm-us-open-tennis-tech/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also sponsored the [[Olympic Games]] from 1960–2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiCarlo|first1=Lisa|title=IBM, Olympics Part Ways After 40 Years|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/08/23/feat.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Football League]] from 2003–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jinks|first1=Beth|title=IBM Ends Its NFL Sponsorship Over Difference in Views|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-05/ibm-ends-its-nfl-sponsorship-over-difference-in-views|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as "IBMers". The company was among the first corporations to provide [[Life insurance#Group life insurance|group life insurance]] (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]] published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [[Brown vs. Board of Education]] and 11 years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Search_the_Database&amp;Template=/CustomSource/WorkNet/srch_dtl.cfm&amp;srchtype=QS&amp;searchid=34&amp;orgid=1238|title=International Business Machines Corp.

Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use [[genetic testing|genetic information]] in employment decisions; and in 2017, IBM was named to ''[[Working Mother]]''{{'}}s 100 Best Companies List for the 32nd consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Working Mother 100 Best Companies|url=https://www.workingmother.com/best-companies-ibm#page-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., [[management|general management]] (GMLDP), [[human resources management|human resources]] (HRLDP), [[finance]] (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The IBM Corporate Service Corps|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/corporateservicecorps/|publisher=IBM CSC|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the [[Peace Corps]] and gives top employees a month to do [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian work]] abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why IBM Gives Top Employees a Month to Do Service Abroad|url=https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-ibm-gives-top-employees-a-month-to-do-service-abroad|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For certain [[interns]], IBM also has a program called [[Extreme Blue]] that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/ |title=Extreme Blue web page |publisher=01.ibm.com |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taft|first1=Derryl|title=IBM Launches Distinguished Designer Program|url=http://www.eweek.com/developer/ibm-launches-distinguished-designer-program.html|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of [[IBM Master Inventor|Master Inventor]]. The company's most prestigious designation is that of [[IBM Fellow]]. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.

IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.&lt;ref name="Strategic Marketing"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Paul Russell |title=Strategic Marketing Communications: New Ways to Build and Integrate Communications |publisher=Kogan Page |year=1999 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HYvbeQLf_gEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22sincere+tie%22+ibm |isbn=0-7494-2918-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO [[Louis V.

'''IBM Cognos Business Intelligence''' is a web-based integrated  [[business intelligence]] suite by [[IBM]]. It provides a toolset for [[Report#Enterprise/Client reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], [[Balanced scorecard|scorecarding]], and monitoring of events and metrics. The software consists of several components designed to meet the different information requirements in a company. IBM Cognos has components such as IBM Cognos Framework Manager, IBM Cognos Cube Designer, IBM Cognos Transformer.

==Basic components==
The elements described below are web-based components that can be accessed from most popular browsers (IBM Cognos specifically supports Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer).

===Cognos Connection===

Cognos Connection is the Web portal for IBM Cognos BI. It is the starting point for access to all functions provided with the suite. Using this portal, content can be searched in the form of reports, scorecards and agents, it can be managed, structured and displayed. In addition, the portal is used for multiple functions,  for example to schedule and distribute reports, for creating tasks, administering the server and the access permissions to content available to different users. You can also create shortcuts, URLs and pages.

===Query Studio===

Query Studio allows simple [[Information retrieval|queries]] and self-service reports to answer basic business questions. The report layout can be customized and data can be filtered and sorted.  Formatting and creation of diagrams is also supported.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"&gt;IBM Cognos 8 Mainly this document for  Documentation,bm
 p.10 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/wig_cr.pdf], (04.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report Studio===

The Report Studio is used to create management reports. It offers two different modes: The professional authoring mode enables users to access the full range of Report Studio functionality. In this mode, users can create any type of report, including charts, maps, lists, and repeat functions.  In professional authoring mode all types of Data (relational or multidimensional) can be used, but dynamic data can not be displayed.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"/&gt;

The express authoring mode has a more simple user interface, designed for non-technical users. It enables them to create traditional financial or management reports in a more focused user interface. In contrast to the professional authoring mode, the express authoring mode allows the use of dynamic data.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"/&gt;

===Analysis Studio===

[[File:OLAP drill up&amp;down.png|thumb|alt=OLAP-functionalities|Drill-up and drill-down as example OLAP-functionalities]]
Users can create analyses of large data sources and search for background information about an event or action. [[Multidimensional analysis]] allows identifying trends and understanding of anomalies or deviations, which are not obvious in other types of reports. [[Drag-and-drop]] features, elements and [[Performance indicator|key performance indicators]] can be included in the analysis, [[In-place matrix transposition|rows and columns can be switched]],  [[OLAP cube#OLAP operations|OLAP-functionalities]]&lt;ref name="Hannig Uwe (2008)"&gt;Hannig Uwe (2008), Vom Data Warehouse zum Corporate Performance Management, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lusti (2002)"&gt;Lusti (2002), Data Warehouse und Data Mining, pp.157&lt;/ref&gt; like drill-up and drill-down can be used to get a deeper understanding about the sources of the information used in the analysis.

===Event Studio===

The Event Studio is a notification tool that informs about events within the enterprise in real time. Therefore, agents can be created to detect the occurrence of business events or exceptional circumstances,  based on the change of specified event- or data conditions. A notification may be served by sending an e-mail, its publication in the portal, or by triggering reports. This can be used to handle failure with notification.It is very robust in nature.

===Workspace===
IBM Cognos Workspace (formerly introduced in version 10.1 as IBM Cognos Business Insight and renamed in version 10.2.0) is a web-based interface that allows business users to use existing IBM Cognos content (report objects) to build interactive workspaces for insight and collaboration.

===Workspace Advanced===
IBM Cognos Workspace Advanced (formerly introduced in version 10.1 as IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced and renamed in version 10.2.0) is a web-based interface that allows business users to author/create reports and analyze information.

==Windows-based components==
* IBM Cognos Framework Manager
* IBM Cognos Cube Designer
* IBM Cognos Transformer
* IBM Cognos Lifecycle Manager
* IBM Cognos Map Manager

==Additional components==

===Go! Office===

The Go! Office component lets users work with IBM Cognos content in their familiar [[Microsoft Office]] environment. The component provides access to all IBM Cognos Report contents, including data, [[metadata]], headers and footers, and diagrams. Users can use predefined reports or create new content with [[#Query Studio|Query Studio]], [[#Analysis Studio|Analysis Studio]] or [[#Report Studio|Report Studio]]. By importing content into [[Microsoft office#Excel|Microsoft Excel]] users can use the formatting, calculation and presentation features. The created documents can then be imported using Cognos Connection, published and made available for other users.

===Go! Search===

In Cognos Connection, you can do a full-text search for content contained in reports, analyses, dashboards, metric information and events. When searching, an index of the prompts, titles, headings, column names, row names, data elements and other important fields is used as base. The full text search in [[Cognos|IBM Cognos]] Go! Search is related to the search in regular search engines such as [[Google]]. Users can search operators such as +, - or use "" (quotation marks) to change the default behavior of search queries with multiple words. Search terms are not case sensitive, word and spelling variants are included in the results. You can also search for a specific type of entry, such as an agent. The search results are sorted in descending order, the entry with the greatest amount of relevant metadata is displayed at the top of the list. In [[#Analysis Studio|Analysis Studio]], [[#Query Studio|Query Studio]] and IBM Cognos Viewer, you can either perform a full text search, as also search for content related to the data of the current view.&lt;ref name="Go! Search"&gt;IBM Go! Search Documentation, p.59 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/ug_search.pdf],(04.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Go! Dashboards===

With IBM Cognos Go! Dashboard, interactive [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing IBM Cognos content and external data '''sources''' '''can''' be '''created''' to fit the information needs of an individual user.

The following items can be added to a dashboard:&lt;br /&gt;
Report objects, they are displayed in a Cognos Viewer portlet. Report parts such as lists, crosstabs, and charts are displayed in interactive portlets. Lists or crosstabs can be displayed as a chart and vice versa. Content can be shown or hidden dynamically by the use of sliders and checkboxes. The Cognos Search portlet allows searching for published content. In addition, Web links, Web pages, RSS feeds, and images can be displayed on the dashboard.
&lt;ref name="Go! Dashboard"&gt;IBM Go! Dashboard Documentation, p. 7 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/ug_exd.pdf],(25.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The user interface has two modes: In the interactive mode, existing dashboards are viewed and interacted with, creating and editing of dashboards can be done in assembly mode.&lt;ref name="Go! Dashboard" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10567">'''Insecticidal soap''' is based on [[potassium]] [[fatty acid]]s and is used to control many plant pests. Because insecticidal soap works on only direct contact with the pests, it is sprayed on plants in way such that the entire plant is wetted. Soaps have a low [[mammal]]ian toxicity and are therefore considered safe to be used around children and pets and may be used in [[organic farming]].

== Composition ==
Insecticidal soap should be based on long-chain [[fatty acid]]s (10&amp;ndash;18 carbon atoms),&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; because shorter-chain fatty acids tend to be damaging for the plant ([[phytotoxicity]]). Short (8-carbon) fatty-acid chains occur for example in [[coconut oil]] and [[palm oil]] and soaps based on those oils. Recommended concentrations are typically in the range 1&amp;ndash;2 percent.&lt;ref name="CSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clemson"/&gt; One manufacturer recommends a concentration of 0.06% to 0.25% (pure soap equivalent) for most agricultural applications.;&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-super-conc"/&gt; another one&lt;ref name="label-mpede"/&gt; recommends concentrations of 0.5 to 1% pure soap equivalent. In the [[European Union]], fatty acid potassium salts are registered and allowed as insecticide&lt;ref name="eu-db"/&gt; at a 2% concentration.&lt;ref name="eu-rr-2013"/&gt;

Insectidal soap is most effective if it is dissolved in soft water, since the fatty acids in soap tend to precipitate in [[hard water]], thereby reducing the effectivity.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt;

Insecticidal soap is sold commercially for aphid control. Labels on these products may not always use the word soap, but they will list "potassium salts of [[fatty acid]]s" or "potassium [[lauric acid|laurate]]" as the active ingredient. Certain types of household soaps (not synthetic [[detergent]]s) are also suitable,&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; but it may be difficult to tell the composition and water content from the label. [[soap#Effect of the alkali|Potassium-based soaps]] are typically soft or liquid.

== Mechanism of action ==
The mechanism of action is not exactly understood.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; Possible mechanisms are:&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keeley-youtube"/&gt;
* Soap, which enters via the insect's [[trachea]], may disrupt [[cell membrane]]s, resulting in the cell contents leaking from the damaged cells ([[cytolysis]]).
* Soap may dissolve the wax layer on the [[arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] ("skin"), which leads to water loss by evaporation.
* Soap may block [[spiracle|breathing openings]] or trachea, which leads to suffocation.
* Soap may interfere with growth hormones.
* Soap may affect insect [[metabolism]].

== Affected organisms ==
Insecticidal soap works best on soft-bodied insects and [[arthropod]]s such as&lt;ref name="CSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt; [[aphids]], [[Adelgidae|adelgids]],
[[mealybugs]], [[spider mite]]s, [[thrips]], [[Jumping plant louse|jumping plant lice]], [[scale insect]]s, [[whitefly|whiteflies]], and [[sawfly]] larvae. It can also be used for [[caterpillar]]s and [[leafhopper]]s, but these large-bodied insects can be more difficult to control with soaps alone. Many pollinators and predatory insects such as [[coccinellidae|lady beetles]], [[bumblebee]]s, and [[hoverfly|hoverflies]] are relatively unaffected. However, soap will kill predatory mites that may help control spider mites.&lt;ref name="CSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raudonis"/&gt; Also, the soft-bodied aphid-eating larvae of lady beetles, [[Neuroptera|lacewing]], and hoverflies may be affected negatively. According to one study&lt;ref name="raudonis"/&gt; a single soap application killed about 15% of lacewing and lady-beetle larvae, and about 65% of predatory mites (''[[Amblyseius]] andersoni'').

[[myzus persicae|Green peach aphids]] are difficult to control&lt;ref name="tremblay-2009"/&gt; since they reproduce quickly (one adult female can deposit up to four [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] per day) because they tend to reside under the leaves and in [[leaf#Large-scale features (leaf morphology)|leaf axils]] ("leaf armpits"), where they may not be wetted by a soap spray. Manufacturers&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-mpede"/&gt; indeed state that their insecticidal soaps are only suitable for controlling green peach aphids if used in combination with another insecticide, whereas the same soaps can control other aphids on their own. Among green peach aphids that are in contact with a 2% soap solution, around 95% of the adults and 98% of [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] die within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="tremblay-2009"/&gt; At 0.75% concentration, the mortality rates are reduced to 75% and 90%, respectively. 

Since 2011, insecticidal soap has also been approved in the United States for use against [[powdery mildew]].&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-mpede"/&gt; In the European pesticide registration, its use as an insecticide is listed for aphids, white fly, and spider mites.&lt;ref name="eu-rr-2013"/&gt; At different concentrations, it may also be used against [[algae]] and [[moss]].&lt;ref name="eu-rr-2013"/&gt;

== Use ==
Insecticidal soap solution will only kill pests on contact; it has no residual action against aphids that arrive after it has dried. Therefore, the infested plants must be thoroughly wetted. Repeated applications may be necessary to adequately control high populations of pests.

Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32&amp;nbsp;°C (90&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clemson"/&gt; Plant injury may not be apparent until two days after application. Some plant species are particularly sensitive to soap sprays. Highly sensitive plants include:&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt; [[horse chestnut]], [[Acer palmatum|Japanese maple (''Acer'')]], ''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]'' (mountain ash), [[cherimoya|Cherimoya fruit]], ''[[Lamprocapnos]]'' (bleeding heart), and [[sweet pea]]. Other sensitive plants are, for example:&lt;ref name="Clemson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt; ''[[Portulaca]]'', some tomato varieties, ''[[Crataegus]]'' (hawthorn), [[cherry|cherries]], [[plum]], ''[[Adiantum]]'' (maidenhair fern), ''[[Euphorbia milii]]'' (crown of thorns),  ''[[Lantana camara]]'', ''[[Tropaeolum]]'' (nasturtium), ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]'', ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'' (Easter lily). [[Conifer]]s under (drought) stress or with tender new growth are sensitive as well.

Damage may occur as yellow or brown spotting on the leaves, burned tips, or leaf scorch. Plants under [[drought]] stress, young transplants, unrooted [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s and plants with soft young growth tend to be more sensitive. Sensitivity may be tested on a small portion of a plant or plot before a full-scale application.

One manufacturer recommends that applications are done with 7- to 14-day intervals, with a maximum of three applications,&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt; as repeated applications may aggravate phytotoxicity. In addition, water conditioning agents can increase phytotoxicity.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Thanks to its low mammalian toxicity, application of insecticidal soap is typically allowed up to the day of harvest.&lt;ref name="label-super"/&gt;&lt;ref name="label-mpede"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">'''Lagotek''' was a privately held company specializing in [[home automation]]. It was founded in 2005 by four former [[Microsoft]] employees and it is located in [[Bellevue, WA]]. Lagotek developed Home Intelligence Platform (HIP) technology. The 4 founders of  Lagotek are [[Eugene Luskin]], Alex Grach, David Kizhnerman and Lev Tcherkachine,

Lagotek officially ceased operations in 2011.

==HIP==

* HIP is a wireless home automation system that allows homeowners a complete control of lighting, temperature, entertainment, surveillance, security, irrigation and other home appliances in any room from any location of their home
* based on any number of touch-screen controllers, mounted into a standard 2-gang switch boxes of a new or a remodel home; these controllers communicate through [[Wi-Fi]] with [[Z-Wave]] power outlets, dimmers, switches and other devices; each controller acts as a server, enhancing the system's reliability, while devices also act as repeaters, increasing the systems range to infinite
* Software running on top of Microsoft [[Windows CE]] system
'''Systems controlled by Lagotek'''

Current software applications for the HIP platform from Lagotek and its partners include:
*  Climate control with multiple zones of heating and air conditioning 
*  Lighting
*  Intercom
*  Distributed audio
*  Video Surveillance 
*  Irrigation
*  Security
Applications that provide integration and automation are:
*  Modes
*  Rules

;HIP 100 Control Panel: Simplicity Rather Than Complexity

The HIP100 touch screen panels from which the users control the functionality of their homes are elegant, but unobtrusive, easily blending with the walls when not used. Due to the wireless nature of the product there is no need to run new wires since the panels fit into the standard 2-gang box replacing the "so 20th century "dumb" dimmers and switches.

==Form factors and devices==
Lagotek HIP is the distributed system (no single point of failure) that runs on HIP100 touch screen panels, PDAs, PC, UMPC, and Windows Vista MCE. Multiple instances of Lagotek HIP running on various devices throughout the house are fully synchronized and provide unique level of reliability compare to any other Home Automation system where there is only one central controlling device.
Through the support of SideShow technology Lagotek Modes can be controlled from any SideShow device, so no matter where you are and what device you have in your hands you will be able to monitor and control your home.
 
==Remote connection to the Home==
From the cell phone:
Lagotek cell phone application (powered by Crayon Interface’s Moshi server) provides both information about the current state of the home and control of the home through Modes. It is possible to see live real time video from the cameras installed in the house, know how many lights are on and where and what is the temperature in the house. Every system in the house can send Alerts to the cell phone.
From the Web browser:
The same functionality that is accessible on the phone is available through the Web interface due to the integration between Lagotek HIP and Microsoft Windows Home Server.

==The Target Market and Distribution==
The target markets for Lagotek are new home construction and aftermarket remodeling. A network of Certified Installer/Dealers, who install the systems and provide aftermarket service both on an as-needed and post-installation service agreement basis, serves these markets. As a member of CEDIA (Custom Electronic Design &amp; Installation Association), Lagotek is currently adding to its network of Certified Installer/Dealers, and is interviewing and training Certified Installers from the over 6,000 CEDIA installer/dealers

Lagotek touts its technology as an open platform, on top of which other vendors can provide extensions and customizations.

==How it works==
Link Motion is a next generation on-board unit hardware and [[Open-source model|open source]] powered secure software platform that enables integration of features for connected and [[Vehicular automation|smart cars]]. Link Motion uses [[Linux]] and [[Qt (software)| Qt]] to implement several previously discrete [[Electronic control unit|ECU]] with one computer and relies on [[ARM TrustZone]] and [[virtualization]] to protect critical system functions from vulnerabilities. An [[AUTOSAR]] based operating system in the heart of the carputer is responsible for controlling safety-critical functions and vehicle communication on the [[CAN bus|controller-area network (CAN bus)]]. It supports central unit, [[Dashboard|instrument cluster]] and [[Head-up display|head-up displays]], [[Backup camera|rear-view cameras]], [[CANopen]] protocol and it offers connectivity through [[cellular network|cellular]], [[Vehicle-to-everything | vehicle-to-everything (V2X)]], [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] and [[Bluetooth]] connections as well as location services using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]] and [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link-motion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/link_motion_tech_brief_1-14-digital.pdf |title=Motion T Technical Brief |publisher=Link Motion |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is shared and stored in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], uses internal [[blockchain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/17/12/10944563/blockchain-internet-of-vehicles-has-nq-mobile-rallying |title=Blockchain, 'Internet Of Vehicles' Has NQ Mobile Rallying |publisher=Benzinga |date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; technology and a [[platform as a service|platform]] that supports both custom [[connected car]] services and others such as [[Apple Inc. | Apple]] [[CarPlay]], [[Baidu]] Carlife&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlife.baidu.com/ |title=Baidu Carlife |publisher=baidu.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Android Auto]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Vehicle data can be captured with [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD) which is available using standard [[OBD-II PIDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link-motion.com/en/easily-capture-vehicle-data-board-diagnostic-port/ |title=Easily capture your vehicle data through an on-board diagnostic port |publisher=Link Motion |date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Development==
Link Motion will further enhance its carputer into a “CarBrain”, using [[Artificial intelligence| artificial intelligence]] (AI) and blockchain [[Application software| applications]] to make [[Vehicle| vehicles]] a more [[Intelligent transportation system| intelligent]] part of the [[traffic]] [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link-motion.com/papers/link_motion_car_brain_ai_block_chain.pdf |title=LINK MOTION’S “CARBRAIN” INTEGRATING AI &amp; BLOCKCHAIN IN THE CARPUTER |publisher=Link Motion |date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also integrated Keystone into the platform which is Irdeto’s new [[smartphone]]-based [[smart key | vehicle access]] solution that allows vehicle owners to create and control policies around multi-user vehicle access, settings and usage including ECU-side functionality and [[Cloud computing |cloud services]], as well as a complete [[Mobile backend as a service | back-end management system]] with [[analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.keystone-security.com/ |title=Keystone |publisher=Keystone Security |access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==
Founded in 2001 to develop [[Linux on embedded systems|embedded Linux systems]] the company was originally called Nomovok. That led to developing [[mobile operating system|mobile operating systems]] for [[Nokia]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nomovok.com/en/frontpage/about-us |title=About us - Nomovok Ltd |publisher=Nomovok |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 they started working on [[automotive software]] and [[Embedded system|embedded automotive systems]]. Then in 2014 the company was re-branded to Link Motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link-motion.com/en/big-ideas/ |title=Big Ideas - Link Motion |publisher=Link Motion |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, [[Tieto]], Link Motion and Nomovok announced their collaboration on Link Motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tieto.com/news/tieto-link-motion-and-nomovok-announce-partnership-on-automotive-platforms |title=Tieto, Link Motion and Nomovok announce partnership on automotive platforms |publisher=Tieto Corporation |date=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Link Motion and MTA SpA announced their collaboration on Link Motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/EN/IDPagina/379 |title=Link Motion and MTA SpA partnering on automotive platforms |publisher=MTA SpA |date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts are closely held trade secrets, limited as of 2018 to at most 10% of the anode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The first laboratory experiments with lithium-silicon batteries took place in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="bourderau"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00194-9|title=Amorphous silicon as a possible anode material for Li-ion batteries|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=81–82|pages=233–236|year=1999|last1=Bourderau|first1=S|last2=Brousse|first2=T|last3=Schleich|first3=D.M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon-graphite composite electrodes===
Test sample production of batches of batteries using a silicon-graphite composite electrode were started by Amprius in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/amprius-gets-30m-boost-for-silicon-based-li-ion-batteries |title=Amprius Gets $30M Boost for Silicon-Based Lithium-Ion Batteries |last1=St. John |first1=Jeff |date=2014-01-06 |website=Greentechmedia |access-date= 2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same company claims to have sold several hundred thousand of these batteries as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/523296/startup-gets-30-million-to-bring-high-energy-silicon-batteries-to-market/|title=Startup Gets $30 Million to Bring High-Energy Silicon Batteries to Market|publisher=MIT Technology Review|date=10 January 2014|first=Kevin|last=Bullis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Stanford University]] researchers presented a method of encapsulating silicon microparticles in a graphene shell, which confines fractured particles and also acts as a stable solid electrolyte interface layer. These microparticles reached an energy density of 3,300 mAh/g.&lt;ref name="LiYan2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Yuzhang|last2=Yan|first2=Kai|last3=Lee|first3=Hyun-Wook|last4=Lu|first4=Zhenda|last5=Liu|first5=Nian|last6=Cui|first6=Yi|title=Growth of conformal graphene cages on micrometre-sized silicon particles as stable battery anodes|journal=Nature Energy|volume=1|issue=2|year=2016|pages=15029|issn=2058-7546|doi=10.1038/nenergy.2015.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, a company called Enevate presented a battery using an unknown monolithic silicon-composite anode with a low cell resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141209005067/en/Enevate-Announces-HD-Energy%C2%AE-Technology-Li-ion-Batteries|title=Enevate Announces HD-Energy® Technology for Li-ion Batteries|date=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These batteries leave 25% of the capacity unused, most likely to reduce degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semiaccurate.com/2016/01/26/enevate-introduces-a-silicon-lithium-ion-battery/|title=Enevate introduces a Silicon-Lithium-Ion battery|date=26 January 2016|first=Charlie|last=Demerjian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this technology it was named an Innovation Award Honoree in three categories at 2016's [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twice.com/content/enevate-named-ces-2016-innovation-awards-honoree-multiple-categories/59634|date=12 February 2016|title=Enevate Named as CES 2016 Innovation Awards Honoree in Multiple Categories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter CES 2016, Sonim Technologies (a company selling rugged mobile phones) would use Enevate's lithium-silicon batteries in its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/sonim-picks-enevate-batteries-for-ultra-rugged-smartphones--1128518|title=Sonim picks Enevate batteries for ultra-rugged smartphones|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] founder [[Elon Musk]] claimed that silicon in [[Tesla Model S|Model S]] batteries increased the car’s range by 6%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2018, products by startups Sila Nanotechnologies, Angstron Materials, Enovix, Enevate, and others were undergoing tests by the battery manufacturers, car companies, and consumer-electronics companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

China-based Amperex is one of Sila's investors, Sila clients include [[BMW]] and Amperex Technology, battery supplier to companies including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Samsung]]. BMW plans to incorporate Sila technology by 2023 and increase battery-pack capacity by 10-15%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Enevate produces anodes for vehicle manufacturers and claims to increase electric vehicle range by 30% versus conventional batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Enovix, whose investors include Intel and Qualcomm, is working on anodes that are almost pure silicon. The company claims its batteries would provide 30% to 50% more energy than conventional batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A crystalline silicon anode has a theoretical [[Well test|specific capacity]] of 4200 mAh/g, more than ten times that of anodes such as [[graphite#Batteries|graphite]] (372 mAh/g).&lt;ref name="deformation_and_stress" /&gt; Each silicon atom can bind up to 4.4 lithium atoms in its fully lithiated state ({{chem|Li|4.4|Si}}), compared to one lithium atom per 6 carbon atoms for the fully lithiated graphite ({{chem|Li|C|6}}).&lt;ref name="issues_and_challenges"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35104644| pmid = 11713543| title = Issues and challenges facing rechargeable lithium batteries| year = 2001| last1 = Tarascon | first1 = J.M. | journal = Nature| volume = 414| issue = 6861| pages = 359–67| last2 = Armand | first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silicon swelling==
The lattice distance between silicon atoms multiplies as it accommodates lithium ions (lithiation), reaching 320% of the original volume.&lt;ref name="deformation_and_stress" /&gt; The expansion causes large anisotropic stresses to occur within the electrode material, fracturing and crumbling the silicon material and detachment from the current collector.&lt;ref name="berla"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.032|title=Robustness of amorphous silicon during the initial lithiation/delithiation cycle|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=258|pages=253–259|year=2014|last1=Berla|first1=Lucas A.|last2=Lee|first2=Seok Woo|last3=Ryu|first3=Ill|last4=Cui|first4=Yi|last5=Nix|first5=William D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototypical lithium-silicon batteries lose most of their capacity in as little as 10 charge-discharge cycles.&lt;ref name="bourderau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jung"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00707-3|title=Amorphous silicon anode for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=115|issue=2|pages=346–351|year=2003|last1=Jung|first1=H}}&lt;/ref&gt; A solution to the capacity and stability issues posed by the significant volume expansion upon lithiation is critical to the success of silicon anodes.

Silicon [[nanostructure]]s are one potential solution. Researchers created [[Nanowire battery|silicon nanowires]] on a conductive substrate for an anode, and found that  the nanowire morphology creates direct current pathways to help increase [[power density]] and decreases disruption from volume change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Candace K.|last2=Peng|first2=Hailin|last3=Liu|first3=Gao|last4=McIlwrath|first4=Kevin|last5=Zhang|first5=Xiao Feng|last6=Huggins|first6=Robert A.|last7=Cui|first7=Yi|title=High-performance lithium battery anodes using silicon nanowires|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nnano.2007.411|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=31–35|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.411|pmid=18654447|date=Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the large volume change of the nanowires can still pose a fading problem.

Other studies examined the potential of silicon nanoparticles. Anodes that use silicon nanoparticles may overcome the price and scale barriers of nanowire batteries, while offering more mechanical stability over cycling compared to other silicon electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ge|first=Mingyuan|last2=Rong|first2=Jiepeng|last3=Fang|first3=Xin|last4=Zhang|first4=Anyi|last5=Lu|first5=Yunhao|last6=Zhou|first6=Chongwu|date=2013-02-06|title=Scalable preparation of porous silicon nanoparticles and their application for lithium-ion battery anodes|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-013-0293-y|journal=Nano Research|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=174–181|doi=10.1007/s12274-013-0293-y|issn=1998-0124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these anodes add carbon as a conductive additive and a binder for increased mechanical stability. However, this geometry does not fully solve the issue of large volume expansion upon lithiation, exposing the battery to increased risk of capacity loss from inaccessible nanoparticles after cycle-induced cracking and stress.

Another nanoparticle approach is to use [[Conductive polymer|conducting polymers]] as both the binder and the additive for nanoparticle batteries. One study examined a three-dimensional conducting polymer and [[Gel|hydrogel]] network to carry silicon nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Hui|last2=Yu|first2=Guihua|last3=Pan|first3=Lijia|last4=Liu|first4=Nian|last5=McDowell|first5=Matthew T.|last6=Bao|first6=Zhenan|last7=Cui|first7=Yi|date=2013-06-04|title=Stable Li-ion battery anodes by in-situ polymerization of conducting hydrogel to conformally coat silicon nanoparticles|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms2941|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|doi=10.1038/ncomms2941|issn=2041-1723|pmid=23733138|page=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework resulted in a marked improvement in electrode stability, with over 90% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles. However, the potential for inexpensive scale up has not been thoroughly investigated. Other researchers offered another potential solution, utilizing slurry coating techniques – which are currently employed at large scales for electrode production – with a conducting polymer binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Thomas M.|last2=Park|first2=Sang-Hoon|last3=King|first3=Paul J.|last4=Zhang|first4=Chuanfang (John)|last5=McEvoy|first5=Niall|last6=Berner|first6=Nina C.|last7=Daly|first7=Dermot|last8=Shmeliov|first8=Aleksey|last9=Khan|first9=Umar|date=2016-03-22|title=A Commercial Conducting Polymer as Both Binder and Conductive Additive for Silicon Nanoparticle-Based Lithium-Ion Battery Negative Electrodes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b00218|journal=ACS Nano|volume=10|issue=3|pages=3702–3713|doi=10.1021/acsnano.6b00218|issn=1936-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the conducting polymer additive provides both mechanical stabilization and an avenue for conduction, replacing the conventional two-material system of a polymer stabilizer and carbon black particles. The substitution allows both better stabilization and better conduction.

==Solid electrolyte interface layer==
[[File:SEI layer formation on silicon.svg|thumb|SEI layer formation on silicon. In green on the left, the normal battery operation, in blue the SEI layer formation. The electrolyte decomposes by reduction.]]
Another issue is the destabilization of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer consisting of decomposed electrolyte material.&lt;ref name="ChanRuffo2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Candace K.|last2=Ruffo|first2=Riccardo|last3=Hong|first3=Seung Sae|last4=Cui|first4=Yi|title=Surface chemistry and morphology of the solid electrolyte interphase on silicon nanowire lithium-ion battery anodes|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=189|issue=2|year=2009|pages=1132–1140|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEI layer normally forms a layer impenetratable to the [[electrolyte]], which prevents further growth. However, due to the swelling of the silicon,  the SEI layer cracks and become porous.&lt;ref name="Fong1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Rosamaría|title=Studies of Lithium Intercalation into Carbons Using Nonaqueous Electrochemical Cells|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=137|issue=7|year=1990|pages=2009|issn=0013-4651|doi=10.1149/1.2086855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can thicken. A thick SEI layer results in a higher cell resistance, which decreases cell efficiency.&lt;ref name="RuffoHong2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruffo|first1=Riccardo|last2=Hong|first2=Seung Sae|last3=Chan|first3=Candace K.|last4=Huggins|first4=Robert A.|last5=Cui|first5=Yi|title=Impedance Analysis of Silicon Nanowire Lithium Ion Battery Anodes|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=113|issue=26|year=2009|pages=11390–11398|issn=1932-7447|doi=10.1021/jp901594g}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OumellalDelpuech2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oumellal|first1=Y.|last2=Delpuech|first2=N.|last3=Mazouzi|first3=D.|last4=Dupré|first4=N.|last5=Gaubicher|first5=J.|last6=Moreau|first6=P.|last7=Soudan|first7=P.|last8=Lestriez|first8=B.|last9=Guyomard|first9=D.|title=The failure mechanism of nano-sized Si-based negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|volume=21|issue=17|year=2011|pages=6201|issn=0959-9428|doi=10.1039/c1jm10213c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEI layer on silicon is composed of reduced electrolyte and lithium.&lt;ref name="RuffoHong2009"/&gt; At the operating voltage of the battery, the electrolyte is unstable and decomposes.&lt;ref name="ChanRuffo2009"/&gt; The consumption of lithium in the formation of the SEI layer further decreases the battery capacity.&lt;ref name="OumellalDelpuech2011"/&gt; Limiting growth of the SEI layer is therefore critical for commercial lithium-silicon batteries.

The '''March of Intellect''', or the 'March of mind', was the subject of heated debate in early nineteenth-century England, one side welcoming the progress of society towards greater, and more widespread, knowledge and understanding, the other deprecating the modern mania for progress and for new-fangled ideas.

The 'March' debate was seen by [[Mary Dorothy George]]  as a public reflection of the changes in British society associated with industrialisation, democracy and shifting social statuses – changes welcomed by some and not by others.&lt;ref&gt;M. Dorothy George, ''Hogarth to Cruikshank'' (London 1967) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and context==
The roots of the controversy over the March of intellect can be traced back to the spread of education to two new groups in England after 1800 - children and the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. M. Trevelyan]], ''British History in the Nineteenth Century'' (London 1922) p. 163-5&lt;/ref&gt; 1814 saw the first use of the term the 'march of Mind' as a poem written by [[Mary Russell Mitford]] for the [[British and Foreign School Society|Lancastrian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Dorothy George, ''Hogarth to Cruikshank'' (London 1967) p. 181n&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter's work in bringing education to children was soon rivalled by the efforts of the Established Church.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''British History in the Nineteenth Century'' (London 1922) p. 163-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The March of Intellect forms part of nineteenth-century debates over [[science communication]], marking a peak in the development of the idea and possession of knowledge. The concept of knowledge as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] had changed from the end of the eighteenth century. ‘Polite learning’ practiced by the upper and middle classes through the study of ancient cultures was criticised for being ornamental in its uses by commentators such as [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/james-burns/polite-learning-useful-knowledge|title=From 'Polite Learning' to 'Useful Knowledge' {{!}} History Today|last=Burns|first=James|date=|website=www.historytoday.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial revolution created a new focus on applied knowledge, particularly regarding [[natural philosophy]] (later science) and its various fields. ‘Useful knowledge’ was believed to be the way forward by liberal Whigs, but the definition of this term remained fluid. The increase in periodicals, encyclopaedias and printed literature from the late eighteenth century began to raise questions about the newfound availability of knowledge. Advances in the production of books further extended knowledge to the middle classes and owning printed literature became a desirable commodity. Where a volume would cost around 10 shillings at the beginning of the nineteenth century, by the 1820s a reprint of a volume could be half this value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the spread of print culture, artisan coffee houses, and, from 1823 onwards, [[Mechanics' Institutes]],&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''British History in the Nineteenth Century'' (London 1922) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the growth of [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society|Literary and Philosophical Societies]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, &amp; Dangerous People?'' (Oxford 2008) p. 171-2&lt;/ref&gt; meant something of a revolution in adult reading habits.

The working classes had limited access to knowledge owing to poor literacy rates and the expensive cost of printed materials relative to wages. The [[Spa Fields riots|Spa Fields Riots]] and [[Peterloo Massacre]] raised concerns about revolution and the violent unrest created resistance among the elite towards educating the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fe0v-jDb9AIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+march+of+intellect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu8aiAj43QAhXHCMAKHUWqDqAQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Useful Knowledge: The Victorians, Morality, and the March of Intellect|last=Rauch|first=Alan|date=2001-06-26|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822383152|location=|pages=16|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conservative commentators supported educating the working class as a means of control. The ''Edinburgh Review'' commented in 1813 on the hopes of 'a universal system of education' that would 'encourage foresight and self-respect among the lower orders.' Through education, the working class would know their economic position in life and this would prevent further outbreaks of political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/james-burns/polite-learning-useful-knowledge|title=From 'Polite Learning' to 'Useful Knowledge' {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Whig supporters of educating the working classes, such as [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], believed in 'the greatest happiness of the greatest number' outlined by [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/about/who/history|title=History, 1826: Unshackling education- UCL is established|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sciences were seen by these supporters as valuable knowledge for the working classes and debates on the best means of diffusing knowledge was debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peak==
Interest in the so-called March of Intellect came to a peak in the 1820s. On the one hand, the [[Philosophic Whigs]], spearheaded by [[Henry Peter Brougham|Brougham]], offered a new vision of a society progressing into the future: [[Thackeray]] would write of "the three cant terms of the Radical spouters...'the March of Intellect', 'the intelligence of the working classes', and 'the schoolmaster abroad'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. Dorothy George, ''Hogarth to Cruikshank'' (London 1967) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  Brougham's foundation of the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], and of [[University College, London]], seemed to epitomise the new progress of the age.

But the same phenomenon of the March of Intellect was equally hailed by conservatives as epitomising everything they rejected about the new age:&lt;ref&gt;Alice Jenkins, ''Space and the March of Mind'' (2007) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; liberalism, machinery, education, social unrest - all became the focus of a critique under the guise of the 'March'.&lt;ref&gt;M. Dorothy George, ''Hogarth to Cruikshank'' (London 1967) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The March of Intellect was repeatedly [[Satire|satirised]] in written print and visual media, such as [[Editorial cartoon|cartoons]]. Cartoons were frequently used in the nineteenth century to explore current affairs and were becoming increasingly accessible during the peak of the March of Intellect. [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath’s]] collection of prints published between 1825 and 1829 have become central representations of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/march-of-the-intellect|title=March of Intellect|website=The British Library|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath used machines, steam-powered vehicles and other forms of technology in his work to mock liberal Whiggish ambitions that problems in society could be solved through widespread education. The scenes present futuristic visions of society whereby issues such as travel, emigration and postal delivery had been conquered by technological innovation through knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2011/09/flying-postmen-and-magic-glass/|title=Flying postmen and magic glass|last=Schupbach|first=William|date=2011|work=|newspaper=Wellcome Library|language=en-us|access-date=2016-11-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent some of the advances in everyday life such as faster travel due to the extension of the railway and the rise in exchanging letters. These and other satirical works from the period recognised that a transformation within society was already in motion, but were ambiguous as to whether reform would be progressive or damaging. For example, Heath's cartoon entitled 'The March of Intellect' (c.1828) in which a giant automaton sweeps away [[Quackery|quacks]], delayed parliamentary bills and court cases, can be seen as apocalyptic in its attempt to improve society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c24H__xVtm8C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=satire+the+march+of+intellect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo5O_R347QAhXLAMAKHWB2D-MQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mesmerized: Powers of Mind in Victorian Britain|last=Winter|first=Alison|date=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|isbn=9780226902234|location=|pages=17-18|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The March of Intellect remained ambivalent throughout satire, but recurrently criticised the ambition of educating the working class. In [[Thomas Love Peacock|Peacock]]'s 1831 novel [[Crotchet Castle]], one character, Dr. Folliott, satirised the "Steam Intellect Society" and linked the march explicitly to folly, [[Captain Swing|rural protest]] and the rise in crime: "the march of mind...marched in through my back-parlour shutters, and out again with my silver spoons".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Love Peacock, ''Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle'' (London 1947) p. 212-3, and p. 105-6, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Peacock had earlier parodied the Utilitarian take on the role of the modern poet:&lt;ref&gt;M. H Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford 1953) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; "The march of his intellect is like that of a crab, backward"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ben Wilson, ''Decency and Disorder'' (London 2007) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian accommodation==
The March of Mind was used by the Whigs as one argument for the [[Great Reform Act]]; and after a decade of reform and railway, the idea of progress became something of a Victorian truism.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, &amp; Dangerous People?'' (Oxford 2008) p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing concerns related more to ameliorating its effects than turning back the clock - philosophers fearing over-education would reduce moral and physical fibre,&lt;ref&gt;E. Gargano, ''Reading Victorian Schoolrooms'' (2013) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; poets seeking to preserve individuality in the face of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] march.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bristow, ''The Victorian Poet'' (2014) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maritime VSAT''' is the use of satellite communication through a [[Very-Small-Aperture Terminal]] (VSAT) on a moving ship at sea. 
Since a ship at sea moves with the water, the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] needs to be stabilized with reference to the [[horizon]] and [[True north]], so that the antenna is constantly pointing at the [[satellite]] it uses to transmit and receive signals.

The Maritime VSAT (Business) Industry was first created for the US Navy in September 1986, by the joint venture team of Richard A. Hadsall, President and CEO of Crescomm Transmission Services and Robert J. Matthews, President of SeaTel Inc.
The result of this business venture was the creation of the company Maritime Telecommunications Network, Inc. ([[Maritime Telecommunications Network|MTN]]) MTN went on to commercialize the Maritime VSAT business by delivering services to Various Cruise Lines around the world as well as many Commercial Oil and Gas installations and vessels. MTN also pushed for global Maritime VSAT recognition with the petition for rule making from the FCC and the lobbying of the ITU’s World Radio Commission ([[World Radiocommunication Conference|WRC]]) for recognition to use the fixed satellite service ([[Fixed-satellite service|FSS]]) in C and Ku band by creating new rulings to recognize Earth Stations on Vessels [[ESV]]. This was accomplished by revision of the Radio Regulations, complementing the Constitution and the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union [[ITU]], which incorporated the decisions of the World Radio Communication Conferences of 2003 (WRC-03)

There are many different options to build a maritime broadband network onboard of a vessels. 
Each option has its advantage (and disadvantage) in cost, in the coverage, the signal strength and requirements for the antenna size (and thus the requirements of installation).

There are major differences in capabilities, features, cost and performance between VSAT ([[Geostationary orbit]] satellites in Ku-band, C-band and Ka-band) and [[Low Earth orbit or Medium Earth Orbit]] satellites with L-band technologies in use.

Both L-band (LEO &amp; MEO) and VSAT (GEO) systems are marketed with what appear to be a shared set of features and benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">'''Materiomics''' is defined as the holistic study of material systems. Materiomics examines links between physiochemical material properties and material characteristics and function. The focus of materiomics is system functionality and behavior, rather than a piecewise collection of properties, a paradigm similar to [[systems biology]]. While typically applied to complex biological systems and biomaterials, materiomics is equally applicable to non-biological systems. Materiomics investigates the material properties of natural and synthetic materials by examining fundamental links between processes, structures and properties at multiple scales, from nano to macro, by using systematic experimental, theoretical or computational methods. 

The term has been independently proposed with slightly different definitions by T. Akita et al. (AIST/Japan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/bin.asp?CID=2651&amp;DID=60715&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF]: Akita, T., Ueda, A., et al. Analytical TEM Observations of Combinatorial Catalyst Libraries for Hydrogen Production—As a Part of "MATERIOMICS", Materials Research Society Proceedings, Vol. 804, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Markus J. Buehler]] (MIT/USA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/v1182w1516382r0h/]: Buehler, M.J., Keten, S. Elasticity, strength and resilience: A comparative study on mechanical signatures of α-Helix, β-sheet and tropocollagen domains. Nano Research, Vol. 1(1), pp. 63-71, 2008 (May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2008.06.002]: Buehler, M.J., Keten, S., Ackbarow, T. Theoretical and computational hierarchical nanomechanics of protein materials: Deformation and fracture. Progress in Materials Science, Vol. 53(8), pp. 1101-1241, 2008 (November, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Clemens van Blitterswijk]], Jan de Boer and H. Unadkat (University of Twente/The Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science24.com/paper/17265]: [[Clemens van Blitterswijk]] et al. Materiomics: dealing with complexity in Tissue Engineering, press release on science24.com (July 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;) in analogy to [[genomics]], the study of an organism's entire [[genome]]. Similarly, materiomics refers to the study of the processes, structures and properties of materials from a fundamental, systematic perspective by incorporating all relevant scales, from nano to macro, in the synthesis and function of materials and structures. The integrated view of these interactions at all scales is referred to as a material's materiome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/materials/biomaterials/book/978-94-007-1610-0] S. Cranford, M.J. Buehler, Biomateriomics, 2012 (Springer, New York)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dovepress.com/articles.php?article_id=5638] S. Cranford, M. Buehler, Materiomics: biological protein materials, from nano to macro, Nanotechnology, Science and Applications, Vol. 3, pp. 127–148, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/108/40/16565]: Unadkat, H. V., et al. An algorithm-based topographical biomaterials library to instruct cell fate, PNAS, 108(40), 16565-16570, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

New techniques for evaluating materials at the tissue level, such as [[reference point indentation]] (RPI) and [[raman spectroscopy]] are lending insight into the nature of these highly complex, functional relationships.

Materiomics is related to [[proteomics]], where the difference is the focus on material properties, stability, failure and mechanistic insight into multi-scale phenomena.

'''Moody's Analytics''' is a subsidiary of [[Moody's Corporation]] established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities, separate from [[Moody's Investors Service]]. It provides economic research regarding risk, performance and financial modeling, as well as consulting, training and software services.  Moody's Analytics is composed of divisions such as Moody's KMV, Moody's Economy.com, Moody's Wall Street Analytics, the Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications, and [[Canadian Securities Institute|Canadian Securities Institute Global Education Inc.]]

==History==
In 1995, Moody's Corporation started a business unit providing [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] services, including credit risk assessment software and services after acquiring Financial Proformas, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;Personal Experience in both companies&lt;/ref&gt; called Moody's Risk Management Service (MRMS).&lt;ref name="Sinclair 05"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Masters of Capital: American Bond Rating Agencies and the Politics of Creditworthiness |last=Sinclair |first=Timothy J. |authorlink=Timothy J.

In early 2000 Moody's acquired the Software Products Group of [[Crowe Horwath|Crowe, Chizek &amp; Co.]], then the eighth largest accounting and consulting firm in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moody's aims to turn former Crowe, Chizek unit into global business |author=Paul Dodson |newspaper=South Bend Tribune |date=20 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought software used by banks to analyze the risk in taking on commercial loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moody's Acquires Commercial Loan Software Operation  |author=Charles Keenan |newspaper=The American Banker |date=28 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, MRMS partnered with [[RiskMetrics]] to develop software that combined credit risk analysis with portfolio management.&lt;ref name="Airfinance 00"/&gt;

In February 2002, Moody's purchased KMV (Kealhofer, McQuown and [[Oldrich Vasicek|Vasicek]]), a [[San Francisco]]-based quantitative [[Financial risk management|risk management]] firm, and merged it with MRMS to create Moody's KMV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Moody's to Buy Credit Risk Analyzer KMV for $210 Million |author=Aaron T. Smith |newspaper=The Bond Buyer |date=12 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company acquired KMV's clients and its software tool for calculating the probability of credit default, EDF (Expected Default Frequency).

{{other uses}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nesi logo.png|thumb|NESI Logo]] --&gt;
'''Net-centric Enterprised Solutions for Interoperability''' ('''NESI''') is a joint effort between the [[United States Navy]]’s Program Executive Office for [[C4I]] &amp; Space and the [[United States Air Force]]’s Electronic Systems Center. It provides implementation guidance which facilitates the design, development, maintenance, evolution, and use of [[information system]]s for the Net-Centric Operations and Warfare ([[NCOW]]) environment. NESI has also been provided to other [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) services and agencies for potential adoption.&lt;ref name=NESI-P-01/&gt;

NESI comprises six parts, each focusing on a specific area of guidance. NESI provides guidance, best practices, and examples for developing Net-Centric software. The overall goal is to provide common, cross-service guidance in basic terms for the program managers and developers of net-centric solutions. The objective is not to replace or repeat existing direction, but to help translate into concrete actions the plethora of mandated and sometimes contradictory guidance on the topic of net-centric compliance and standards.&lt;ref name=NESI-P-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=NESI-P-03/&gt;

==NESI documentation==

NESI subsumes two now obsolete references; in particular, the Air Force C2 Enterprise Technical Reference Architecture (C2ERA) and the Navy Reusable Applications Integration and Development Standards (RAPIDS). Initial authority for NESI is per the Memorandum of Agreement between Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Navy PEO C4I &amp; Space and the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Center, dated 22 December 2003, Subject: Cooperation Agreement for Net-Centric Solutions for Interoperability (NESI). This guidance will continue to evolve as direction and understanding of the requirements of net-centricity evolve. NESI will be updated to reflect changes to the guiding documents and new regulations.

===Parts===
The NESI documentation, a six-part information set, is available as [[PDF]] files.  These parts consist of:

# Overview: Introduction and vision
# ASD/NII Checklist Guidance: "How to implement" guidance
# Migration Guidance: Guidance for maintenance/upgrade activities leading to net-centric systems
# Node Design Guidance: Guidance for developing nodes and their infrastructure to support net-centric services
# Developer's/Technical Guidance: Detailed development guidance focusing on new starts and major updates
# Acquisition Guidance: Incorporating NESI during the acquisition process

====Technical guidance====
* Complementary to GIG/NCES infrastructure;
* Tied to net-centric objectives such as interoperability and flexibility;
* Vendor, program, platform, and service neutral;
* Focused on decoupling stovepipe systems into services (e.g., [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] and web services).

====*Acquisition guidance*====
* Is intended for [[Program management|program manager]]s and [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] contractors;
* Outlines process and system/product requirements;
* Relates the steps of the System Acquisition Framework.

====Evaluation checklist====
In order to evaluate programs/projects, NESI has developed a technical checklist. The current version of the checklist should be used to analyze the current status of a program/project. The technical checklist is produced from the guidance details and provides public, published, consistent interpretation of NESI guidance. Overall, the checklist will provide a uniform interpretation for all of participating organizations. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nesix.spawar.navy.mil NESI CAC Public Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">A '''Networked Control System''' ('''NCS''') is a [[control system]] wherein the control loops are closed through a communication [[computer network|network]]. The defining feature of an NCS is that control and feedback signals are exchanged among the system's components in the form of information packages through a network.

== Overview ==
The functionality of a typical NCS is established by the use of four basic elements: 
# [[Sensors]], to acquire information,
# [[Controller (control theory)|Controllers]], to provide decision and commands,
# [[Actuators]], to perform the control commands and
# [[Telecommunication network|Communication network]], to enable exchange of information.

The most important feature of a NCS is that it connects cyberspace to physical space enabling the execution of several tasks from long distance. In addition, networked control systems eliminate unnecessary wiring reducing the complexity and the overall cost in designing and implementing the control systems. They can also be easily modified or upgraded by adding sensors, actuators and controllers to them with relatively low cost and no major changes in their structure. Moreover, featuring efficient sharing of data between their controllers, NCS are able to easily fuse global information to make intelligent decisions over large physical spaces. 
                                                                                     
Their potential applications are numerous and cover a wide range of industries such as: space and terrestrial exploration, access in hazardous environments, factory automation, remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, experimental facilities, domestic robots, aircraft, automobiles, manufacturing plant monitoring, nursing homes and tele-operations. While the potential applications of NCS are numerous, the proven applications are few, and the real opportunity in the area of NCS is in developing real-world applications that realize the area's potential.

===Types of communication networks===
* [[Fieldbus]]es, e.g. CAN, LON etc.
* IP/[[Ethernet]]
* Wireless networks, e.g. [[Bluetooth]] or [[ZigBee|ZigBee or Zwave]]. The term [[Wireless Networked Control System]] (WNCS) is often used in this connection.

===Problems and solutions===
[[File:ISpace.jpg|320px|thumb|right|iSpace concept]]
Advent and development of the Internet combined with the advantages provided by NCS attracted the interest of researchers around the globe. Along with the advantages, several challenges also emerged giving rise to many important research topics. New control strategies, kinematics of the actuators in the systems, reliability and security of communications, bandwidth allocation, development of data communication protocols, corresponding [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] and [[fault tolerant]] control strategies, real-time information collection and efficient processing of sensors data are some of the relative topics studied in depth.

The insertion of the communication network in the feedback [[control loop]] makes the analysis and design of an NCS complex, since it imposes additional time delays in control loops or possibility of packages loss. Depending on the application, time-delays could impose severe degradation on the system performance.

To alleviate the time-delay effect, Y. Tipsuwan and M-Y. Chow, in ADAC Lab at North Carolina State University, proposed the [[Gain Scheduler Middleware]] (GSM) methodology and applied it in iSpace. S. Munir and W.J. Book (Georgia Institute of Technology) used a [[Smith predictor]], a [[Kalman filter]] and an energy regulator to perform teleoperation through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/ ADAC Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/iSpace1/home.html iSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C. Lee, S. Lee and H.H. Lee used a genetic algorithm to design a controller used in a NCS. Many other researchers provided solutions using concepts from several control areas such as robust control, optimal [[stochastic control]], model predictive control, fuzzy logic etc.

Moreover, a most critical and important issue surrounding the design of distributed NCSs with the successively increasing complexity is to meet the requirements on system reliability and dependability, while guaranteeing a high system performance over a wide operating range. This makes network based fault detection and diagnosis techniques, which are essential to monitor the system performance,  receive more and more attention.

'''Silicon Taiga''' is a [[nickname]] for [[Akademgorodok]], a [[Russia]]n research and development center that is located near [[Novosibirsk]]. The nickname is a reference to the [[Silicon Valley]], a renowned IT region found in [[Northern California]]. The term was first introduced to the Western press by [[Newsweek|Newsweek magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek magazine, [http://www.newsweek.com/1999/05/02/better-spell-it-cyberia.html First mention of Silicon Taiga in press], May 03, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999.

== Location ==

The town is situated partly on the [[Ob River|River Ob]], and partly on the shore of a [[Novosibirsk reservoir|Novosibirsk artificial reservoir]] that was created by a [[dam]] on the river. Informally, this reservoir is called the [[Ob Sea]]. The dam contains a large [[hydroelectric power plant]] that was constructed in the 1950s.

The town itself has no skyscrapers, and only one remote speedway connecting it to the city of Novosibirsk. Office buildings and residences are connected by many intertwined, footworn paths.

==History==
In the 1950s the former [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] founded its Siberian Division, today known as the [[Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], with a center of [[scientific research]] in Akademgorodok, where they established a dozen research institutes. To keep institutes supplied with fresh minds, [[Novosibirsk State University]] (NSU) was founded by the resolution of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR]] on January 9, 1958.

===Distinctive===
The distinctive feature of NSU is its system of competitive selection and its training of talented youth. NSU is the only university in Siberia to have developed a multilevel model of continuing education. The University was built and developed simultaneously with the Novosibirsk scientific center and is focused on training highly qualified specialists for scientific work and tutoring. Since its foundation in 1958, more than fifty thousand specialists graduated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university NSU on QS World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141934/http://topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Novosibirsk State University; more than six thousand have defended their [[PhD]] dissertations, and over one thousand five hundred have received [[doctor of science|doctoral degrees]]. In 2009, NSU achieved the status of a national research university. This high honor was granted by the [[Russian Government]] on a competitive basis for a period of ten years.

===Information Technology Outsourcing===
The first [[Information Technology Outsourcing|IT]] companies were established in Akademgorodok in the 1990s. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the government's investments into scientific activity were greatly reduced, and many scientists left long established institutions on a quest for better conditions. Some of these scientists decided to leave Russia in search of jobs in foreign scientific organizations all over the world. Others established their own [[private business]]es, which were [[software]]-related [[High tech|high-tech]] IT companies. Many of these companies grew up into large, internationally recommended providers of software products and services. Their strategy was simple: the new IT companies would adopt the tried and true principles of the already established, famous IT corporations.

All IT companies in the Silicon Taiga can be divided into the two categories according to the [[offshore programming]] [[business model]] they employ: The firms that provide [[Offshore Development Center]] (ODC), and mostly develop new custom products ([[New product development|NPD]]), and the firms that are oriented to the [[Software as a service|SAAS]] model. Meantime the global giants in the field of software and high-tech products, such as [[IBM]], [[Intel Corporation]], and [[Schlumberger]], saw this growing trend and established [[branch office]]s in the Silicon Taiga.

===Innovative technology park===
The summer of 2010 saw the launch of an innovative technology park&lt;ref&gt;[http://marchmontnews.com/story.php?story_id=9924&amp;story=Novosibirsk%92s-Akademgorodok-eyes-$5m-nano-center Novosibirsk’s Akademgorodok eyes $5m nano-center]&lt;/ref&gt; in Akademgorodok, which brought together economic and intellectual power in the area, thus expanding innovation in Russia. Today, the Silicon Taiga is not just a collection of IT companies; it is a beneficial environment, in which the Russian national system of innovations can continue to flourish.&lt;ref name="Venture investment"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marya Smorgonskaya|url=http://www.marchmontnews.com/journals/viewJournal.php?articleId=233|title=Novosibirsk Modern Technologies Venture investment|work=MarchmontNews.com|publisher=Marchmont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electrical controls, a '''stepping switch''' or stepping [[relay]], also known as a '''uniselector''', is an [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] device that switches an input signal path to one of several possible output paths, directed by a train of electrical pulses.

The major use of stepping switches was in early automatic [[telephone exchange]]s to route [[telephone call]]s. Later, they were often used in such equipment as industrial control systems. They were used in Japanese cypher machines during [[World War II|World War 2]], known to the Americans as [[CORAL]], [[JADE (cypher machine)|JADE]], and [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]]. Code breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] employed uniselectors driven by a continuously rotating motor rather than a series of pulses in the [[Bombe]] machines to [[cryptanalyse]] the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] ciphers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightstraw.co.uk/bletchley/colossus/equipment1.html|title=Colossus - The Equipment|website=www.lightstraw.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a uniselector, the stepping switch steps only on one axis, although there are often several sets of contacts in parallel. In other types, such as the [[Strowger switch]], mechanical switching occurs on two directions, across a grid of contacts. The Strowger switch was invented by [[Almon Brown Strowger]] in 1888.

==Single-axis stepping switches==
[[File:Uniselector Stepper detail.jpg|thumb|350px|An example of a Western Electric 7A Rotary (Bird-cage) Line Finder assembly. The horizontal shaft is driven by a gear and when the Line Finder's electromagnet is energized, a flexible disc at the base of the Line Finder's brush carriage is engaged through friction to the horizontal shaft's driving disc, causing the brush carriage to rotate.]]
Stepping switches were widely used in telephony and industrial control systems (among related applications) when electromechanical technology was paramount.

A basic stepping switch is an electrically operated rotary switch with a single (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical rotary switches, the single terminal connects to one of the multiple terminals by rotating a contact arm, sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch.

While some stepping switches have only one pole (layer of contacts), a typical switch has more; in the latter case, all wipers are aligned and move together. Hence, one input with multiple wires could be connected to one of multiple outputs, based on the receipt of a single set of pulses. In this configuration, the rotating contacts resembled the head support arms in a modern hard disk drive. Multipole switches were common; some had perhaps as many as a dozen poles, but those were less common.

Most switches have a bank of stationary contacts extending over half a cylinder, while some have only a third of a cylinder. The typical "half-cylinder" switch has two sets of wiper contacts opposite each other, while the "third of a cylinder" type has three sets, equally spaced. For any given level, both or all three wipers are connected, so it makes no difference which of the two (or three) is connecting.  When access to more outlets was required, the rotor had two sets of wipers opposite each other but offset vertically: on the first half rotation one set of outlets was accessed; the second set of outlets was accessed on the second half rotation.

An electromagnet advances (steps) the wipers to the next position when fed with a pulse of DC. The magnet's armature (spring-loaded) operates a pawl that advances a ratchet. When the pawl reaches its full stroke, it blocks the ratchet so it and the wipers will not overshoot. When power to the coil disconnects, the spring retracts the pawl. Another pawl pivoted on the frame ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place.  Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal.

[[File:Panel GCO District Sender Selector Frame.jpg|thumb|alt=An array of stepping switches|An array of uniselector stepping switches as installed in a telephone exchange. The silver dials show the current position of the moving wipers. The fixed feeder brushes are barely visible.]]

In most applications, such as telephony, it is desirable to be able to return the wipers to a "home" position; this is at the beginning of rotation, at one end of the array of fixed contacts. Some switches have a cam attached to the wiper shaft. This cam operates a set of contacts when the wiper is at home position, which is at the beginning of the span of rotation. Other circuit designs used one level (pole) of the contacts to home the wipers, so the separate homing contacts were not needed.

Typical stepping switches have contacts directly operated by the stepping magnet's armature; these contacts can serve to make the magnet cycle ("self-step") and advance the wipers as long as power is applied. The external control circuits remove power when the wipers reach the desired position; that could be the home position.

Most stepping switches rotate the wipers in only one direction, but some are bidirectional; the latter have a second magnet to rotate the wipers the other way. A third variety "winds" a spring as the wiper steps progressively, and a ratchet holds the wipers from returning to home position. When the circuit is no longer needed, another electromagnet releases the holding pawl; the spring then returns the wipers to their home position.

Stepping switches were quite noisy in operation (especially when self-stepping), because their mechanisms accelerated and stopped quickly to minimize operating time. One could compare their sound to that of some snap-action mechanisms. Nevertheless, they were engineered for long life, given periodic maintenance; they were quite reliable.

Single-axis stepping switches are sometimes known as uniselectors.

==Two-axis stepping switch==
Slightly more complicated was the ''two axis stepping switch'', (also called ''Strowger switch'' or ''two motion selector'' in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect to one of 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The wipers moved up and down on a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the wipers to their home position at the bottom.

This type had two stepping coils with pawls and ratchets, one to raise the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary [[telephone dial]]. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an "unused" outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (''final selector'' in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was idle then [[Ringing (telephony)|ringing]] voltage would be applied to the called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line.

Another variant of the two-axis switch was the [[Stromberg-Carlson]] X-Y Switch which was quite common in telephone exchanges in the western USA. It was a flat mechanism, and the moving contacts moved both sidewise, as well as to and fro. It was quite reliable, and could be maintained by people with minimal training.

==Applications==
{{Listen

|title=Stepping switch in telephony
|description=The sound of a step-by-step call reaching a busy circuit.}}

Stepping switches are used in a variety of applications, other than telephone systems. By connecting several in series with the highest output of one going to the stepping contact of the next, a [[Counter (digital)|counter]] could be constructed. Or by feeding the stepping contact with an endless [[pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] train via a [[relay]], and controlling the relay from the switch's own output, it can be made to automatically hunt for the first unpowered line (or powered, depending on whether the relay is [[normally open]] or [[normally closed]]). They could also be used as a [[Multiplexer|demultiplexer]], so that two input lines could control a number of output devices. One input line steps the switch until the correct device is selected, and the other then powers that device. Many other applications are possible.

Such switches were used in a series of Japanese cypher machines during [[World War II|World War 2]]: [[CORAL]], [[JADE (cypher machine)|JADE]], [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]] (the names were American).  Some of the equipment used to break the [[Enigma machine]] code also used many such switches, which some observers called the "Machine Gun" for the loud noise.

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Sjregions.GIF|right|350px]]
The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos&amp;nbsp;— the city itself, (also the seat), [[Eugênio de Melo]] and [[São Francisco Xavier]]. The last one is known for its natural sites and [[ecotourism]].

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
[[Highland (geography)|Highlands]] predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from {{convert|660|to|975|m|abbr=on}}. The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (''Mantiqueira Range''), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500&amp;nbsp;ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the [[urban area]], there are rolling [[plateaus]] and [[hills]].
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the ''Paraíba do Sul'' river, at an elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m.

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the [[Climate of Brazil|country]], the tropical climate of most of the country and the [[subtropical highland]] climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climatic types in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/brag/v66n4/22.pdf |title=Climatic classification in São Paulo State |publisher=Instituto Agronômico de Campinas |accessdate=September 11, 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month of 17&amp;nbsp;°C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hotttest month of 24&amp;nbsp;°C. With [[global warming]] it is very likely that the city's climate will transition to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification) in the near future.

Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. There's no record of snow precipitation in the city.

The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have a colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls (about once per decade).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monteverdemg.com.br/vm-clima.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, ''Aldeia do Rio Comprido''. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the [[Society of Jesus]]. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of [[Jacareí]] today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several [[Jesuit Reductions]] in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the [[Bandeirantes]].

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as [[slaves]]. However, a [[turmeric]] conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest [[Manoel de Leão]], whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as ''Residência do Paraíba do Sul''; in 1696 as ''Residência de São José''.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive [[Suppression of the Jesuits#Portugal|expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire]] in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. [[Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão]], had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the [[Viceroy]] to create [[civil parishes]], known as ''[[freguesias]]'', and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a [[town hall|hall]] and a [[pillory]], passing over the status of civil parish; and the name '''Vila de São José do Paraíba''' was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the ''Estrada Real'' (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of '''São José dos Campos''', followed by the creation of a [[judiciary district]]  in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in [[Vale do Paraiba|Paraíba Valley]], which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil]] railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
[[File:Inauguração_da_Fábrica_da_General_Motors_em_São_José_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inaugura%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_F%C3%A1brica_da_General_Motors_em_S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|thumb|Inauguration of the General Motors Factory in São José dos Campos by President Juscelino Kubitschek, 1959.]]The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by [[sanatorium]]s became noticed at the

beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became to be known as ''the Sanatorium City''. The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of [[antibiotics]] in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the ''[[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Technological Institute of Aeronautics]] '' in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a "strong mayoral" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. The current mayor is [[Felicio Ramuth]], from the political party [[Brazil's Social Democratic Party|PSDB]] and was elected in 2016.

=== The state administrative region of São José dos Campos ===
[[File:sjcvale.gif|right|250px]]
The [[State of São Paulo]] is divided politically and administratively into 15 regions. São José dos Campos is the seat and the name of the 3rd Administrative Region, which includes the North Coast of São Paulo state and the Paraíba Valley.

The region comprises 39 municipalities with sharp contrasts. São José dos Campos is a densely populated city, with approximately 2,100 inhabitants/square kilometers in urban area, whereas the quiet municipality of São José do Barreiro has only seven inhabitants/square kilometer. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} There are both highly industrialized cities and the others in the region are focused on agriculture and tourism. São José dos Campos is well known as the ''Capital do Vale'' which means that São José dos Campos is the most important city of the Paraíba Valley.

It is one of the state's most dynamic areas, the fourth one in terms of population density, and covers 11.3% of the state's territory. The main municipalities are São José dos Campos, [[Taubaté]], [[Jacareí]], [[Guaratingueta]], [[Caraguatatuba]], [[Campos do Jordão]], [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]], [[Lorena, São Paulo|Lorena]], [[Pindamonhangaba]], [[Ubatuba]] and [[Caçapava]].

Although São José is an industrial center, the city still preserves green areas and quiet town districts. Around 62% of the area from the municipality is characterized as an environmental preservation area. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} On the oustskirts of the urban area, [[Augusto Ruschi]] Ecology Reserve has many local plant species. The [[natural reserve]] has {{convert|2,500,000|m2|abbr=on}}, being a government protect area for the local [[flora]]. São Francisco Xavier is a community the offers many of those attributes as well.

Furthermore, there is easy access to the mountain cities (Campos do Jordão, Santo Antônio do Pinhal) and to the beaches of the [[Microregion of Caraguatatuba|Northern Coast of São Paulo]].

The city has three parks and several sports and country clubs. Tenis Clube and Associação Esportiva São José have hosted the 35th [[Banana Bowl]] [[International Tennis Federation]] Juniors Circuit in 2005 and 2006. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A soccer stadium, called [[Estádio Martins Pereira]], is the home ground of [[São José Esporte Clube]], a professional soccer team.

{{wide image|São josé dos campos.jpg|1000px|São José dos Campos.}}

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]].

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a [[ring road]] system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*[[Brazilian Highway System|BR-116]] (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north-south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil's coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*[[Rodovia Carvalho Pinto|SP-070]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects [[São Paulo]] to [[Taubaté]];
*[[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|SP-065]] Connects São Jose dos Campos to [[Campinas]]
*[[Rodovia dos Tamoios|SP-099]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of [[Caraguatatuba]];
[[File:Tamoios.JPG|thumb|right|[[SP-099|Tamoios Highway]]]]
*[[SP-050]] (state highway) - the old road which connects São José dos Campos to [[Campos do Jordão]] and the southern region of [[Minas Gerais]].

The city is also served by a railway (the former [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Central do Brasil]]), administered by [[MRS Logística]], which today only carries freight.

The ports of [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.
[[File:Aeroporto de são josé dos campos.jpg|thumb|right|[[São José dos Campos Airport]]]]
The [[São José dos Campos Airport]] ([[IATA]]: SJK, [[ICAO]]: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]] and [[TRIP Linhas Aéreas]] fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista ("São Paulo's East Cone"). [[Infraero]] and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives [[natural gas]] from two gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

It has also a large network of [[fiber optics]], with [[broadband]] services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Service industry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary]] sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Yet even though most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) [[business incubators]] have been created within universities or industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage [[Oil refinery|Refinery]] of [[Petrobrás]]. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of [[Chemical substance|materials]], [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[information technology]], [[aerospace]], [[energy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] control, [[biotechnology]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[software]] among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new [[think tanks]]: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several [[logistics]] providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the [[Vale do Paraíba]], the northern coast of São Paulo and southern [[Minas Gerais]].

A '''tablecloth''' is a [[textile|cloth]] used to cover a [[table (furniture)|table]]. Some are mainly ornamental coverings, which may also help protect the table from scratches and stains. Other tablecloths are designed to be spread on a dining table before laying out [[tableware]] and food.

Tablecloths can be made of almost any material, including delicate fabrics like [[embroider]]ed [[silk]]. Dining cloths are typically made of [[cotton]], a [[polyester|poly]]-cotton blend, or a [[PVC]]-coated material that can be wiped clean, but they can range from functional coverings to fine textiles, as long as they can be laundered. Some cloths are designed as part of an overall [[table setting]], with coordinating [[napkins]], [[placemat]]s, or other decorative pieces. Special kinds of tablecloth include runners which overhang the table at two ends only and table protectors to provide a padded layer under a normal cloth.

==History==
In many European cultures a white, or mainly white, tablecloth used to be the standard covering for a dinner table. In the later medieval period spreading a high quality white [[linen]] or cotton cloth was an important part of preparing for a feast in a wealthy household. Over time the custom of arranging tableware on a cloth became common for most social classes except the very poorest. As eating habits changed in the 20th century, a much greater range of table-setting styles developed. Some formal dinners still use white tablecloths, often with a [[Damask#Modern_uses|damask weave]], but other colours and patterns are possible. 

==Special cases==
[[Perugia]] tablecloths and napkins have been made since medieval times. White with characteristic woven blue stripes and patterns, the style is also associated with [[Altar cloth|church linen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Karen|title=Perugia Tablecloths|url=http://www.larsdatter.com/perugia-tablecloths.htm|website=www.larsdatter.com|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towel V&amp;A Search the Collections|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O15355/towel/|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] interiors were full of thick, fringed draperies in deep colours, including tablecloths reaching to the floor on any kind of table.&lt;ref&gt;Bott and Clephane, Our Mothers, Gollancz 1932, p60&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular "[[magic trick]]" involved pulling a loaded tablecloth away from a table but leaving the plates behind. This trick relies on [[inertia]].

A '''tolerance interval''' is a [[statistical interval]] within which, with some confidence level, a specified proportion of a sampled population falls. "More specifically, a 100×p%/100×(1−α) tolerance interval provides limits within which at least a certain proportion (p) of the population falls with a given level of confidence (1−α)."&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Young (2010), Book Reviews: "Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation", TECHNOMETRICS, FEBRUARY 2010, VOL. 52, NO. 1, pp.143-144.&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion p of the sampled population with confidence 1−α; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content − (1−α) coverage TI."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011&gt;Krishnamoorthy, K. and Lian, Xiaodong(2011) 'Closed-form approximate tolerance intervals for some general linear models and comparison studies', Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,, First published on: 13 June 2011 {{DOI|10.1080/00949655.2010.545061}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) upper '''tolerance limit''' (TL) is simply an 1−α upper [[confidence limit]] for the 100 p [[percentile]] of the population."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011/&gt;

A tolerance interval can be seen as a statistical version of a [[probability interval]]. "In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% [[prediction interval]] are the same."&lt;ref name="Ryan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas P. Ryan|title=Modern Engineering Statistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=22 June 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-12843-5|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we knew a population's exact parameters, we would be able to compute a range within which a certain proportion of the population falls. For example, if we know a population is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with [[mean]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then the interval &lt;math&gt;\mu \pm 1.96\sigma&lt;/math&gt; includes 95% of the population (1.96 is the [[z-score]] for 95% coverage of a normally distributed population).

However, if we have only a sample from the population, we know only the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and sample standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, which are only estimates of the true parameters. In that case, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu} \pm 1.96\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; will not necessarily include 95% of the population, due to variance in these estimates. A tolerance interval bounds this variance by introducing a confidence level &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, which is the confidence with which this interval actually includes the specified proportion of the population. For a normally distributed population, a z-score can be transformed into a "''k'' factor" or '''tolerance factor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Statistical interpretation of data — Part 6: Determination of statistical tolerance intervals |publisher= ISO 16269-6|year= 2005 |page= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; via lookup tables or several approximation formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Tolerance intervals for a normal distribution | url = http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc263.htm | title = Engineering Statistics Handbook | publisher = NIST/Sematech | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal."&lt;ref name=Example2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = De Gryze | first1 = S. | last2 = Langhans | first2 = I. | last3 = Vandebroek | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.03.002 | title = Using the correct intervals for prediction: A tutorial on tolerance intervals for ordinary least-squares regression | journal = Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 147 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson | title = You might want a tolerance interval | url = http://www.kmjn.org/notes/tolerance_intervals.html | date = 2011-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance interval differs from a [[confidence interval]] in that the confidence interval bounds a single-valued population parameter (the [[mean]] or the [[variance]], for example) with some confidence, while the tolerance interval bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval's size is entirely due to [[sampling error]], and will approach a zero-width interval at the true population parameter as sample size increases, a tolerance interval's size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population's probability interval as sample size increases.&lt;ref name=vardeman /&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;

The tolerance interval is related to a [[prediction interval]] in that both put bounds on variation in future samples. The prediction interval only bounds a single future sample, however, whereas a tolerance interval bounds the entire population (equivalently, an arbitrary sequence of future samples). In other words, a prediction interval covers a specified proportion of a population ''on average'', whereas a tolerance interval covers it ''with a certain confidence level'', making the tolerance interval more appropriate if a single interval is intended to bound multiple future samples.&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy&gt;{{cite book | author = K. Krishnamoorthy| title = Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-470-38026-8 | pages = 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

&lt;ref name=vardeman/&gt; gives the following example: &lt;blockquote&gt;So consider once again a proverbial [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] test scenario, in which several nominally identical autos of a particular model are tested to produce mileage figures &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such data are processed to produce a 95% confidence interval for the mean mileage of the model, it is, for example, possible to use it to project the mean or total gasoline consumption for the manufactured fleet of such autos over their first 5,000 miles of use. Such an interval, would however, not be of much help to a person renting one of these cars and wondering whether the (full) 10-gallon tank of gas will suffice to carry him the 350 miles to his destination. For that job, a prediction interval would be much more useful. (Consider the differing implications of being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge 35&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1} \ge 35&lt;/math&gt;.) But neither a confidence interval for &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; nor a prediction interval for a single additional mileage is exactly what is needed by a design engineer charged with determining how large a gas tank the model really needs to guarantee that 99% of the autos produced will have a 400-mile cruising range. What the engineer really needs is a tolerance interval for a fraction &lt;math&gt;p = .99&lt;/math&gt; of mileages of such autos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is given by:&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The air lead levels were collected from &lt;math&gt;n=15&lt;/math&gt; different areas within the facility. It was noted that the log-transformed lead levels fitted a normal distribution well (that is, the data are from a [[lognormal distribution]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, denote the population mean and variance for the log-transformed data. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes the corresponding random variable, we thus have &lt;math&gt;X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;. We note that exp(mu) is the median air lead level. A confidence interval for mu can be constructed the usual way, based on the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]; this in turn will provide a confidence interval for the median air lead level. If &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; and S denote the sample mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed data for a sample of size n, a 95% confidence interval for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_{m,1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-alpha quantile of a [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with m degrees of freedom. It may also be of interest to derive a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead level. Such a bound for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead is given by &lt;math&gt;\exp{\left( \bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose we want to predict the air lead level at a particular area within the laboratory. A 95% upper prediction limit for the log-transformed lead level is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S \sqrt{\left( 1 + 1/n \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. A two-sided prediction interval can be similarly computed. The meaning and interpretation of these intervals are well known. For example, if the confidence interval &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; is computed repeatedly from independent samples, 95% of the intervals so computed will include the true value of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, in the long run. In other words, the interval is meant to provide information concerning the parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only. A prediction interval has a similar interpretation, and is meant to provide information concerning a single lead level only. Now suppose we want to use the sample to conclude whether or not at least 95% of the population lead levels are below a threshold. The confidence interval and prediction interval cannot answer this question, since the confidence interval is only for the median lead level, and the prediction interval is only for a single lead level. What is required is a tolerance interval; more specifically, an upper tolerance limit. The upper tolerance limit is to be computed subject to the condition that at least 95% of the population lead levels is below the limit, with a certain confidence level, say 99%.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Calculation==
One-sided normal tolerance intervals have an exact solution in terms of the sample mean and sample variance based on the [[Noncentral t-distribution|noncentral ''t''-distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; 
Two-sided normal tolerance intervals can be obtained based on the [[noncentral chi-squared distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal| author=Derek S.

'''Trevor Blackwell''' (born 4 November 1969 in [[Canada]]) is a computer [[programmer]], [[engineer]] and [[entrepreneur]] based in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlb.org/#aboutMe |title=About Me, Professionally |publisher=Tlb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell is a developer of humanoid robots. Dr. Blackwell is the founder and CEO of [[Anybots]] and a partner at [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].

== Life and career ==

Blackwell grew up in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. Blackwell studied [[engineering]] at [[Carleton University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] in 1992, then studied [[Computer Science]] at [[Harvard University]] and received a PhD in 1998. His dissertation applied randomized methods to analyzing the performance of networks and compilers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlb.org/#papers |title=Applications of Randomness in System Performance Measurement |publisher=Tlb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During graduate school Blackwell joined [[Viaweb]] for which he wrote the image rendering, order processing and statistics software. The company was acquired by [[Yahoo]] in 1998, and Blackwell moved to [[Silicon Valley]] to lead the Yahoo Store development group.

He founded [[Anybots]] in 2001 to build teleoperated humanoid robots. In 2006, Anybots announced a humanoid robot that walks and balances like people do, without depending on large feet for stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anybots.com/abouttherobots.html |title=Anybots · About the Robots |publisher=Anybots.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125024202/http://www.anybots.com/abouttherobots.html |archivedate=January 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As side projects, he has built two other balancing vehicles: a two-wheeled balancing scooter similar to the Segway but with different steering, and the self-balancing [[Eunicycle]]. Several hobbyists have built vehicles based on the [[open design]] of the machine.

He was a co-founder of [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] in 2005.

'''UniPro''' (or '''Unified Protocol''') is a high-speed interface technology for interconnecting integrated circuits in mobile and mobile-influenced electronics. The various versions of the UniPro protocol are created within the [[MIPI Alliance]] (Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance), an organization that defines specifications targeting mobile and mobile-influenced applications.

The UniPro technology and associated [[physical layer]]s aim to provide high-speed data communication (gigabits/second), low-power operation (low swing signaling, standby modes), low pin count (serial signaling, multiplexing), small silicon area (small packet sizes), data reliability ([[differential signaling]], error recovery) and robustness (proven networking concepts, including [[Network congestion avoidance|congestion management]]).

UniPro version 1.6 concentrates on enabling high-speed point to point communication between chips in mobile electronics. UniPro has provisions for supporting networks consisting of up to 128 UniPro devices (integrated circuit, modules, etc.). Network features are planned in future UniPro releases. In such a networked environment, pairs of UniPro devices are interconnected via so-called links while data packets are routed toward their destination by UniPro switches. These switches are analogous to the routers used in wired LAN based on gigabit Ethernet. But unlike a LAN, the UniPro technology was designed to connect chips within a mobile terminal, rather than to connect computers within a building.

==History and aims==
The initiative to develop the UniPro protocol came forth out of a pair of research projects at respectively Nokia Research Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.nokia.com/publications/embedded_network_architectures_mobile_devices Nokia's Discobus research project], led by Michel Gillet&lt;/ref&gt; and Philips Research.&lt;ref&gt;The MICA (Mobile Interconnect-Centric Architectures) project, led by Peter van den Hamer, started within Philips but later became, via NXP, part of ST-Ericsson.&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams independently arrived at the conclusion that the complexity of mobile systems could be reduced by splitting the system design into well-defined functional modules interconnected by a network. 
The key assumptions were thus that the networking paradigm gave modules well-structured, layered interfaces and that it was time to improve the system architecture of mobile systems to make their hardware- and software design more modular. In other words, the goals were to counteract the rising development costs, development risks and time-to-market impact of increasingly complex system integration.

In 2004, both companies jointly founded what is now [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI]]'s UniPro Working Group. Such multi-company collaboration was considered essential to achieve interoperability between components from different component vendors and to achieve the necessary scale to drive the new technology.

The name of both the working group and the standard, UniPro, reflects the need to support a wide range of modules and wide range of data traffic using a single protocol stack. Although other connectivity technologies ([[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCIe]], [[USB]]) exist which also support a wide range of applications, it should be noted that the inter-chip interfaces used in mobile electronics are still diverse which differs significantly from the (in this respect more mature) computer industry.

In January 2011, UniPro Version 1.40&lt;ref name="UniPro1.40"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_UniPro_specification_v1-40-00.pdf UniPro 1.40.00 Specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; was completed. Its main purpose is full support for a new Physical Layer: M-PHY® including support for power modes change and peer device configuration. In July 2012 UniPro v1.40 has been upgraded to UniPro v1.41&lt;ref name="UniPro1.41"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_UniPro_specification_v1-41-00.pdf UniPro 1.41.00 Specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; to support the newer higher speed M-PHY v2.0.&lt;ref name="M-PHY v2.0"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v2-0.pdf M-PHY v2.0 Specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; The UniPro v1.4x specifications have been released together with a formal specification model (SDL).

The final draft of Version 1.6&lt;ref name="UniPro1.60"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_UniPro_specification_v1-6.pdf UniPro 1.60.00 Specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; of the UniPro specification was completed in August 2013. Its acknowledgements list 19 engineers from 12 companies and organizations: Agilent, Cadence, IEEE-ISTO,Intel, nVidia, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, STMicroelectronics, Synopsys, Texas Instruments and Toshiba.
The UniPro v1.6 Specification is an update to the UniPro v1.41.00 Specification, and consists solely of the UniPro specification document, SDL is no longer supported.
The UniPro v1.6 Specification references the following documents:
* Specification for M-PHY®, Version 3.0&lt;ref name="M-PHY v3.0"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v3-0.pdf M-PHY v3.0 Specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Specification for Device Descriptor Block (DDB), Version 1.0

To date, several vendors have announced the availability of UniPro IP blocks and various chip suppliers have created implementations that are at various phases of development. In the meantime, the MIPI UniPro Working Group is setting up a conformance test suite&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-unipro/file-fix/Subgroups/Testing/Latest_Documents_Dec2010/mipi_specification_UniPro_v1.4_Testing_v0.08r0.07.pdf, MIPI Alliance Specification for UniPro v1.4 Testing], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; and is preparing future extensions of the technology (see [[UniPro#Versions and roadmap|UniPro Versions and Roadmap]]).

On January 30, 2018, JEDEC published the UFS 3.0 standard which uses MIPI M-PHY v4.1 (with HS-Gear4) and MIPI UniProSM v1.8 for mobile memory with data rates up to 2900 MB/s (11,6 Gbit/s per lane, 2 lanes, 23,2 Gbit/s total).

==Main features==
# ''gigabit/s'' - serial technology with a number of bandwidth scaling options
# ''generic'' - can be used for a wide range of applications and data traffic types
# ''scalable'' - from individual links to a network with up to 128 UniPro devices
# ''low-power'' - optimized for small battery-powered systems
# ''reliability'' - data errors detected and correctable via retransmission
# ''hardware friendly'' - can be implemented entirely in hardware where needed
# ''software friendly'' - similar concepts to familiar network technologies
# ''bandwidth utilization'' - provides features to manage congestion and control arbitration
# ''shareable'' - different traffic types and UniPro devices can share pins and wires
# ''testable'' - since version 1.1, UniPro mandates features to facilitate automated conformance testing

==Layered architecture==

UniPro associated with its underlying PHY layer is a layered protocol stack that covers layers L1 to L4 of the [[OSI model|OSI Reference Model]] for networking. UniPro introduces an extra layer [[UniPro protocol stack#PHY Adapter Layer (L1.5)|L1.5]] between L1 and L2 which can be regarded as a sub-layer of OSI's layer L1.

===Multiple applications===
UniPro's strict layering enables it to be used for a wide range of applications:
* UFS:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/focus/flash/universal-flash-storage-ufs JEDEC UFS] Universal Flash Storage&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Flash Storage]]. Next generation mass storage devices specified by JEDEC with a support for data throughput of up to 300MB/sec, in the first generation, and support command queuing features to raise the random read/write speed.
* CSI-3: 3rd generation MIPI Camera Serial Interface features a scalable high bandwidth interface, a guaranteed data transmission and a command set for basic component initialization and configuration.
* GBT: MIPI Gigabit Trace. A network independent protocol for transporting trace data over high-speed interfaces such as UniPort-M or USB3.0.
* DSI-2: 2nd generation MIPI [[Display Serial Interface]].
* PIE:&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file/Specifications/Board%20Approved/MIPI%20UniPro%20PIE%20Specification_v00-90-00c.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for Processor Interface Emulation (PIE) v0.90.00], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; Processor Emulation Interface. This application protocol conveys traditional memory-based read/write transactions as found on processor busses. Data streaming applications (e.g. multimedia traffic), command/response-type protocols (e.g. for control), and tunneling of popular protocols from other domains (e.g. [[TCP/IP]]) are also supported and specifically encouraged because they tend to increase system-level modularity and interoperability due to their higher abstraction level.
* UniPort-M (UniPro with M-PHY): Enables general purpose extension interface to connect peripheral devices such as graphic accelerators, modules such as Google's [[Project Ara|ARA Project]]
* UniPort-D (UniPro with D-PHY) : Enables general purpose extension with D-PHY, note that D-PHY is not a supported physical layer for UniPro beyond UniPro specification v1.41

===Alternative physical layers===
UniPro's layered architecture also allows it to support multiple '''physical layer''' (L1, PHY) technologies even within a single network. This is analogous to [[TCP/IP]] which can run on a wide range of lower-layer technologies. In the case of UniPro, [[UniPro protocol stack#Physical Layer (L1)|two PHY technologies]] are supported for off-chip use.

===UniPorts===
These PHY technologies are covered in separate MIPI specifications&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_D-PHY_specification_v01-00-00.pdf MIPI D-PHY 1.00 specification], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v1-00-00.pdf MIPI Specification for M-PHY version 1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; (which are referenced by the UniPro specification. Note that the term '''UniPort''' is used to represent the actual port on a chip which conforms to the UniPro specification for its upper layers (L1.5 to 4) and a MIPI PHY specification for L1. As there are two PHY technologies, these are respectively known as UniPort-D (UniPro with D-PHY) and UniPort-M (UniPro with M-PHY).

==Phased roadmap==

The UniPro 1.0 specification&lt;ref name="UniPro1.0"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file/Specifications/Board%20Approved/MIPI%20UniPro%20Specification_v01-00-00.pdf MIPI Alliance Standard for Unified Protocol v1.00.00 (UniPro&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;)], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by the MIPI Board of Directors on January 14, 2008. UniPro 1.1,&lt;ref name="UniPro1.1"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file/Specifications/Board%20Approved/MIPI%20UniPro%20Specification_v01-10-00.pdf UniPro 1.10 spec], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; that was completed in July 2009, aims to improve readability, provides a reference model (in [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]]) for two of the four UniPro protocol layers, and provides features to facilitate automated conformance testing.

The architects designing UniPro intended from the start to release the technology as a step-wise roadmap with backward compatibility. UniPro 1.1 is designed to be fully backwards compatible with UniPro 1.0. The main purpose of UniPro 1.40 and UniPro v1.41 (UniPro v1.4x) is to support an additional physical layer, the M-PHY. Furthermore, UniPort-M features local and remote control of a peer UniPro device that can be used for example to control various supported power modes of the link.
Planned roadmap steps beyond UniPro v1.4x aim to provide specifications for network-capable endpoint and network switch devices.

The UniPro v1.6 Specification was designed to ensure interoperability with UniPro v1.41.00 when using the M-PHY physical layer. As D-PHY is no longer supported on v1.60, backwards compatibility for D-PHY operation cannot be maintained.

==Scope and applicability==
UniPro and its underlying physical layer were designed to support low power operation needed for battery-operated systems. These features range from power-efficient high-speed operation to added low-power modes during idle or low bandwidth periods on the network. Actual power behavior is, however, highly dependent on system design choices and interface implementation.

The UniPro protocol can support a wide range of applications and associated traffic types. Example chip-to-chip interfaces encountered in mobile systems:
* Mass storage file transfer : 6 Gbit/s
* 24M pixel camera @30fps : 9Gbit/s
* Chip-to-chip connectivity: 1Gbit to 24Gbit/s

Note that such applications require an application protocol layer on top of UniPro to define the structure and semantics of the byte streams transported by UniPro. These can be done by simply porting existing data formats (e.g. tracing, pixel streams, IP packets), introducing new proprietary formats (e.g. chip-specific software drivers) or defining new industry standards (e.g. [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] for memory-like transactions).

Applications which are currently believed to be less suitable for UniPro are:
* low-bandwidth control - unless multiplexed with other traffic (concern: UniPro complexity is much higher than e.g. [[I2C]])
* high-quality audio samples (concerns: UniPro does not distribute a shared clock to all devices; UniPro complexity compared to e.g. [[SLIMbus]] or [[I²S|I2S]])
* interfaces to dynamic memory (concern: latency for processor instruction/data fetch)

==Protocol stack architecture==

{{Main|UniPro protocol stack}}
The UniPro protocol stack follows the classical OSI reference architecture (ref). For practical reasons, OSI's Physical Layer is split into two sub-layers: Layer 1 (the actual physical layer) and Layer 1.5 (the PHY Adapter layer) which abstracts from differences between alternative Layer 1 technologies.

The UniPro specification itself covers Layers 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and the DME (Device Management Entity). The Application Layer (LA) is out of scope because different uses of UniPro will require different LA protocols. The Physical Layer (L1) is covered in separate MIPI specifications in order to allow the PHY to be reused by other (less generic) protocols if needed(ref).

[[OSI Layer]]s 5 (Session) and 6 (Presentation) are, where applicable, counted as part of the Application Layer.

==Discussion of value proposition==

===UniPro and system integration===
UniPro is specifically targeted by MIPI to simplify the creation of increasingly complex products. This implies a relatively long-term vision about future handset architectures composed of modular subsystems interconnected via stable, standardized, but flexible network interfaces. It also implies a relatively long-term vision about the expected or desired structure of the mobile handset industry, whereby components can readily interoperate and components from competing suppliers are to some degree [[plug compatible]].

Similar architectures have emerged in other domains (e.g. automotive networks, largely standardized PC architectures, IT industry around the Internet protocols) for similar reasons of interoperability and economy of scale. It is nevertheless too early to predict how rapidly UniPro will be adopted by the mobile phone industry.

===High bandwidth and costs===
High speed interconnects like UniPro, [[USB]] or [[Pci express|PCI Express]] typically cost more than low speed interconnects (e.g. [[I2c|I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] or simple [[CMOS]] interfaces). This is for example because of the silicon area occupied by the required mixed-signal circuitry (Layer 1), as well as due to the complexity and buffer space required to automatically correct bit errors. UniPro's cost and complexity may thus be an issue for certain low bandwidth UniPro devices.

===Adoption rate===
As Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;[[Metcalfe's law]], postulates that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users&lt;/ref&gt; postulated, the value of a network technology scales with the square of the number of devices which use that technology. This makes any new cross-vendor interconnect technology only as valuable as the commitment of its proponents and the resulting likelihood that the technology will become self-sustaining. Although UniPro is backed by a number of major companies and that the UniPro incubation time is more or less in line with comparable technologies ([[USB]], [[Internet Protocol]], [[Bluetooth]], in-vehicle networks), adoption rate is presumed to be main concern about the technology. This is especially true because the mobile industry has virtually no track record on hardware standards which pertain to the internals of the product.

A key driver for UniPro adoption is JEDEC Universal Flash Storage (UFS) v2.0 which uses MIPI UniPro and M-PHY as the basis for the standard. There are several implementation of the standard which are expected to hit the market

===Availability of application protocols===
Interoperability requires more than just alignment between the peer UniPro devices on protocol layer L1-L4: it also means aligning on more application-specific data formats, commands and their meaning, and other protocol elements. This is a known intrinsically unsolvable problem in all design methodologies: you can agree on standard and reusable "plumbing" (lower hardware/software/network layers), but that doesn't automatically get you alignment on the detailed semantics of even a trivial command like ChangeVolume(value) or the format of a media stream.

Practical approaches thus call for a mix of several approaches:
* If the previous generation interconnect worked, there was some kind of solution. Consider reusing/tunneling/porting it with minimal changes.
* There are many reusable application-specific industry standards (like commands to control a radio, audio formats, [[MPEG]]).
* Tunnel major technologies over UniPro. If you interact with the [[Internet protocol suite|IP world]], it is sensible to provide IP-over-UniPro.
* Use application-specific software drivers. This only works for limited data rates and pushes the interoperability problem into an internal software interoperability problem, but is a well understood approach.
* Turn existing software interfaces into protocols. In some cases the transformation can be simple or even automated&lt;ref&gt;[[Network on Terminal Architecture|NoTA]], messaging protocol and library&lt;/ref&gt; if the original [[API]]s have the right architecture.

===Licensing===
The Membership Agreement&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi/file/Governing%20Documents/mipi-ma-2006.pdf MIPI Membership Agreement November 1, 2006], requires an account at the MIPI website 
&lt;/ref&gt; of the MIPI Alliance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipi.org MIPI Alliance web site]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies the licensing conditions for MIPI specifications for member companies. Royalty-free licensing conditions apply within the main target domain of the MIPI Alliance, mobile phones and their peripherals, whereas [[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|RAND licensing conditions]] apply in all other domains.

The '''Universal Powerline Association''' (UPA) was a [[trade association]] that covered [[power line communication]] (PLC) markets and applications. The UPA promoted and certified power line communication technology from 2004 to 2010.

==History==
An interest group for the UPA was established by the founding members in May 2004. A [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed by the founding members in September 2004, and the UPA was officially announced in January 2005. It was a non-profit trade group registered in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Articles of Association |year= 2006 |url= http://upaplc.org/_files/upa_articles_of_association.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060517050546/http://upaplc.org/_files/upa_articles_of_association.PDF |archivedate= 17 May 2006 |accessdate= 28 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Design of Systems on Silicon]] (DS2), a supplier of [[integrated circuits]] and software for PLC, was among the founding members; UPA systems were based on its technology.
Other members included: AcBel, Ambient Corporation, bpl, Corinex Communications, IBEC, [[Netgear]], PCN Technology, [[Toshiba]], Toyo Network Systems, and Junaid.

The Universal Powerline Association released specifications related to three aspects of powerline technology. 
The UPA coexistence specification was published in June 2005.
The UPA Access specification (the European OPERA project endorsed specification for [[Internet access]] over power lines) was published in February 2006.
In-home systems and solutions, called "[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]" scenarios, were published in February 2006 as the UPA Digital Home Specification v1.0.
The UPA worked with international standardisation bodies such as [[IEEE]] and [[ETSI]].
Certification events (known as Plugtests) were held in January 2006 and 2007, with products demonstrated at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Universal Powerline Association awards certification logo to five more 200 Mbps UPA Powerline Products |work= Press release |date= 10 January 2007 |publisher= UPA |url= http://www.upaplc.org/_files/8th_january_2007__upa_awards_certification_logo_to_five_more_200mbps_powerline_products.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070307154435/http://www.upaplc.org/_files/8th_january_2007__upa_awards_certification_logo_to_five_more_200mbps_powerline_products.pdf |archivedate= 7 March 2007 |accessdate= 28 August 2013 }} (date in release is from previous year)&lt;/ref&gt;

DS2 had financial problems in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= DS2 Emerges from Difficult Year: Company Initiates debt restructuring, forecasts growth going forward |work= News release |publisher= DS2 |date=5 March 2010  |url= http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100305005939&amp;newsLang=en |accessdate= 29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Marvell Technology Group]] acquired the [[intellectual property]] of DS2 in August 2011, although it continued to provide UPA specifications compliant  devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Marvell Acquires DS2 Technology |work= News release |publisher= Marvell |date=19 August 2010 |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marvell-acquires-ds2-technology-101063629.html |accessdate= 29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exit of DS2 from the market, the UPA suspended activities in November 2010 and discontinued its website, although the UPA market continued through Marvell and its partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">The '''VAT Information Exchange System''' ('''VIES''') is an electronic means of transmitting information relating to [[VAT]] registration (i.e., validity of VAT numbers) of companies registered in the [[European Union]]. EU law requires that, where goods or services are procured within the EU, VAT must be paid only in the member state where the purchaser resides. For this reason, suppliers need an easy way to validate the VAT numbers presented by purchasers. This validation is performed through VIES.

VIES does not itself maintain a VAT number database. Instead, it forwards the VAT number validation query to the database of the member state concerned and, upon reply, it transmits back to the inquirer the information provided by the member state. This information includes at least a "YES/NO" answer on the existence and validity of the supplied number. It may also include additional information, such as the holder's name and address, if this is provided by the member state.

VIES optionally provides a unique reference number which can be used to prove to a tax authority that a particular VAT number was confirmed at time of purchase.

[[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] provide similar services at national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/traders/vat_number/index_en.htm#this_application|title=VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) enquiries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virus]]es consist of a [[genome]] and a [[capsid]]; and some viruses are enveloped. Most virus capsids measure between 20-500 [[nanometer|nm]] in diameter. Because of their nanometer size dimensions, viruses have been considered as naturally occurring [[nanoparticle]]s. Virus nanoparticles have been subject to the [[nanoscience]] and nanoengineering disciplines. Viruses can be regarded as prefabricated [[nanoparticle]]s. Many different viruses have been studied for various applications in [[nanotechnology]]: for example, mammalian viruses are being developed as vectors for gene delivery, and bacteriophages and plant viruses have been used in [[drug delivery]] and [[Imaging biomarker|imaging]] applications as well as in [[vaccine]]s and [[immunotherapy]] intervention.&lt;ref name="pmid27152673"/&gt;

== An Introduction to Virus Nanotechnology ==
Virus nanotechnology is one of the very promising and emerging disciplines in nanotechnology. A highly interdisciplinary field, viral nanotechnology occupies the interface between virology, biotechnology, chemistry, and materials science. The fields employs viral nanoparticles (VNPs) and its counterparts of virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) for potential applications in the diverse fields of electronics, sensors, and most significantly at clinical field.&lt;ref name=pmid20433947&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nano.2010.04.005 |title=Viral nanoparticles as platforms for next-generation therapeutics and imaging devices |journal=Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=634 |year=2010 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Nicole F |pmc=2948632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; VNPs and VLPs are attractive building blocks for several reasons. Both particles are on the nanometer-size scale; they are monodisperse with a high degree of symmetry and polyvalency; they can be produced with ease on large scale; they are exceptionally stable and robust, and they are biocompatible, and in some cases, orally bioavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmetz |first1=N.F. |last2=Manchester |first2=M. |title=Viral nanoparticles: Tools for materials science and Biomedicine |publisher=Pan Stanford |year=2011 |isbn=978-981-4267-45-8 }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are "programmable" units that can be modified by either genetic modification or chemical bioconjugation methods.&lt;ref name="Krishnan et al 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/338269 |title=Developing a Programmable, Self-Assembling Squash Leaf Curl China Virus (SLCCNV) Capsid Proteins into "Nano-Cargo"-Like Architecture: A Next-Generation "Nanotool" for Biomedical Applications |year=2018 |last1=Krishnan |first1=Kathiravan |last2=Thangavelu |first2=Raja Muthuramalingam |last3=Sundarajan |first3=Deepan |last4=s.u |first4=Mohammed Riyaz |last5=Denison |first5=Michael Immanuel J Esse |last6=Gunasekaran |first6=Dharanivasan |last7=Ganapathi |first7=Rajendran |last8=Duraisamy |first8=Nallusamy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thangavelu|first=Raja Muthuramalingam|last2=Sundarajan|first2=Deepan|last3=Savaas Umar|first3=Mohammed Riyaz|last4=Denison|first4=Michael Immanuel Jesse|last5=Gunasekaran|first5=Dharanivasan|last6=Rajendran|first6=Ganapathy|last7=Duraisamy|first7=Nallusamy|last8=Kathiravan|first8=Krishnan|date=2018-11-02|title=Developing a Programmable, Self-Assembling Squash Leaf Curl China Virus (SLCCNV) Capsid Proteins into “Nanocargo”-like Architecture|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsabm.8b00543|journal=ACS Applied Bio Materials|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsabm.8b00543|issn=2576-6422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viruses ==
A virus is a biological infective agent that infect living hosts and reproduces inside the host cells. Viral infect all forms of life; can cause disease in humans, animals, plants and even insects. The science of studying viruses also called as Virology. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cells. Therefore, viruses are ultimately called as obligatory parasites. Viruses contain genetic materials (either DNA or RNA) which give them the ability to mutate and evolve. It also has a protective coat termed the capsid which is made up of multiple numbers of protein monomers called capsomer. Some viruses have additional structural features such as a lipid envelope over capsid or they may consist of separate head and tail structures. E.g. Bacteriophage. Every year novel viruses emerged with the potential to cause disease and death worldwide. Today, over 5000 species of viruses have been discovered and described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dimmock |first1=N.J |last2=Easton |first2=A.J. |last3=Leppard |first3=K.N. |title=Introduction to Modern Virology |edition=6th |publisher=Blackwell |year=2007 |page=49 |isbn=1-4051-3645-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viruses spread in many ways. Just as many viruses are very specific as to which host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and even plants.

== What is Nanotechnology? ==
Nanotechnology is the manipulation or self-assembly of individual atoms, molecules, or, molecular clusters into structures to create materials and devices with new or vastly different properties. Nanotechnology can work from the top down (which means reducing the size of the smallest structures to the nanoscale) or bottom up (which involves manipulating individual atoms and molecules into nanostructures) .The definition of nanotechnology is based on the prefix "nano" which is from the Greek word meaning "dwarf". In more technical terms, the word "nano" means 10-9, or one billionth of something. For a meaningful comparison, a virus is roughly 100 nanometers (nm) in size. So that a virus can also call as a nanoparticle. The word nanotechnology is generally used when referring to materials with the size of 0.1 to 100 nanometres, however, it is also inherent that these materials should display different properties from bulk (or micrometric and larger) materials as a result of their size.&lt;ref name=pmid20433947/&gt; These differences include physical strength, chemical reactivity, electrical conductance, magnetism and optical effects.

Nanotechnology has an almost limitless string of applications in biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5RA13306H |title=Bioactive bile salt-capped silver nanoparticles activity against destructive plant pathogenic fungi through in vitro system |journal=RSC Advances |volume=5 |issue=87 |pages=71174 |year=2015 |last1=Raja Muthuramalingam |first1=Thangavelu |last2=Shanmugam |first2=Chandirasekar |last3=Gunasekaran |first3=Dharanivasan |last4=Duraisamy |first4=Nallusamy |last5=Nagappan |first5=Rajendran |last6=Krishnan |first6=Kathiravan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology has engendered a growing sense of excitement due to the ability to produce and utilize materials, devices, and systems through the control of matter on the nanometer scale (1 to 50&amp;nbsp;nm). This bottom-up approach requires less material and causes less pollution. Nanotechnology has had several commercial applications in advanced laser technology, hard coatings, photography, pharmaceuticals, printing, chemical-mechanical polishing, and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arabjc.2016.09.022 |title=Nanobiotechnology approach using plant rooting hormone synthesized silver nanoparticle as "nanobullets" for the dynamic applications in horticulture – an  in vitro  and  ex vitro  study |journal=Arabian Journal of Chemistry |volume=11 |pages=48 |year=2018 |last1=Thangavelu |first1=Raja Muthuramalingam |last2=Gunasekaran |first2=Dharanivasan |last3=Jesse |first3=Michael Immanuel |last4=s.u |first4=Mohammed Riyaz |last5=Sundarajan |first5=Deepan |last6=Krishnan |first6=Kathiravan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, there will be lighter cars using nanoparticle reinforced polymers, orally applicable insulin, artificial joints made from nanoparticulate materials, and low-calorie foods with nanoparticulate taste enhancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2001/02/careers-nanobiotechnology-nanoscience-biotechnology |first=John |last=Luong |date=February 2, 2001 |title=Careers in Nanobiotechnology: Nanoscience in Biotechnology |publisher=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viruses as Building Blocks in Nanotechnology ==
Viruses have long been studied as deadly pathogens to cause disease in all living forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3 |pmid=12758285 |title=Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) |journal=Microbes and Infection |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |last1=Bordenave |first1=Guy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, researchers had begun thinking of viruses as tools in addition of pathogens. Bacteriophage genomes and components of the protein expression machinery have been widely utilized as tools for understanding the fundamental cellular process. On the basis of these studies, several viruses have been exploited as expression systems in biotechnology. Later in the 1970s, viruses are used as a vector for the benefit of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(76)90133-1 |title=Construction of hybrid viruses containing SV40 and $lambda; phage DNA segments and their propagation in cultured monkey cells |journal=Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=695 |year=1976 |last1=Goff |first1=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that, often viruses are used as vectors for gene therapy, cancer control and control of harmful or damaging organisms, in both agriculture and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0000344.pub3 |chapter=Biological Control by Microorganisms |title=ELS |year=2013 |last1=Harper |first1=David R |isbn=978-0-470-01590-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0020000.pub2 |chapter=Bacteriophage: Therapeutic Uses |title=ELS |year=2014 |last1=Harper |first1=David R |last2=Burrowes |first2=Benjamin H |last3=Kutter |first3=Elizabeth M |isbn=978-0-470-01590-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas |last1=Häusler |title=Viruses vs. Superbugs: A Solution to the Antibiotics Crisis? |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-230-55228-9 }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, L.A.; Kaya, H.K.

Recently, a new approach to exploiting viruses and their capsids for biotechnology began to change toward using them for nanotechnology application. Researchers Douglas and Young (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA) were the first to consider the utility of a virus capsid as a nanomaterial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/30211 |title=Host–guest encapsulation of materials by assembled virus protein cages |year=1998 |last1=Douglas |first1=Trevor |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6681 |pages=152–5 |last2=Young |first2=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have taken plant virus Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) for their study. CCMV showed a highly dynamic platform with pH and metal ion dependent structural transitions. Douglas and Young made use of these capsid dynamics and exchanged the natural cargo (nucleic acid) with synthetic materials. Since then many materials have been encapsulated into CCMV and other VNPs. At about the same time, the research team led by Mann (University of Bristol, UK) pioneered a new area using the rod-shaped particles of TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus). The particles were used as templates for the fabrication of a range of metallized nanotube structures using mineralization techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(199903)11:3&lt;253::AID-ADMA253&gt;3.0.CO;2-7 |title=Inorganic-Organic Nanotube Composites from Template Mineralization of Tobacco Mosaic Virus |journal=Advanced Materials |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=253 |year=1999 |last1=Shenton |first1=Wayne |last2=Douglas |first2=Trevor |last3=Young |first3=Mark |last4=Stubbs |first4=Gerald |last5=Mann |first5=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that invention, TMV particles have been utilized to generate various structures (nanotubes and nanowires)  for use in batteries and data storage devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1171541 |pmid=19342549 |title=Fabricating Genetically Engineered High-Power Lithium Ion Batteries Using Multiple Virus Genes |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5930 |pages=1051–5 |year=2009 |last1=Lee |first1=Y.

Viral capsids have attracted great interest in the field of nanobiology because of their nanoscale size, symmetrical structural organization, load capacity, controllable self-assembly, and ease of modification. viruses are essentially naturally occurring nanomaterials capable of self-assembly with a high degree of precision.&lt;ref name="Krishnan et al 2018"/&gt; Viral capsid- nanoparticle hybrid structures, which combine the bio-activities of virus capsids with the functions of nanoparticles, are a new class of bionanomaterials that have many potential applications as therapeutic and diagnostic vectors, imaging agents, and advanced nanomaterial synthesis reactors.&lt;ref name="Krishnan et al 2018"/&gt;

== Plant viruses in nanotechnology ==
Plant virus-based systems, in particular, are among the most advanced and exploited for their potential use as bioinspired structured nanomaterials and nano-vectors.Plant virus nanoparticles are non-infectious to mammalian cells also proved by Raja muthuramalingam et al 2018.&lt;ref name="Thangavelu  et al 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arabjc.2018.07.006 |title=Fabrication of virus metal hybrid nanomaterials: An ideal reference for bio semiconductor |journal=Arabian Journal of Chemistry |year=2018 |last1=Thangavelu |first1=Raja Muthuramalingam |last2=Ganapathy |first2=Rajendran |last3=Ramasamy |first3=Pandian |last4=Krishnan |first4=Kathiravan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant viruses have a size particularly suitable for nanoscale applications and can offer several advantages. In fact, they are structurally uniform, robust, biodegradable and easy to produce.&lt;ref name="Krishnan et al 2018"/&gt; Moreover, many are the examples regarding functionalization of plant virus-based nanoparticles by means of modification of their external surface and by loading cargo molecules into their internal cavity. This plasticity in terms of nanoparticles engineering is the ground on which multivalency, payload containment and targeted delivery can be fully exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/09298673113209990035 |pmid=23745557 |title=Nanoparticles in Biomedicine: New Insights from Plant Viruses |journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry |volume=20 |issue=28 |pages=3471–87 |year=2013 |last1=Lico |first1=C |last2=Schoubben |first2=A |last3=Baschieri |first3=S |last4=Blasi |first4=P |last5=Santi |first5=L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

George P. Lomonossoff writing in "Recent Advances in Plant Virology",
The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures consisting of multiple copies of one or a few types of protein subunit arranged with either icosahedral or helical symmetry. The capsids can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by the expression of the subunit(s) in a variety of heterologous systems. In view of their relative simplicity and ease of production, plant virus particles or virus-like particles (VLPs) have attracted much interest over the past 20 years for applications in both bio- and nanotechnology [Lomonossoff, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Lomonossoff G.P. Virus particles and the uses of such particles in bio- and nanotechnology. Carole Caranta, Miguel A. Aranda, Mark Tepfer and Lopez-Moya (Ed). ''Recent advances in plant virology''. '''2011''', 363-379, Caister Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-904455-75-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]. As result, plant virus particles have been subjected to both genetic and chemical modification, have been used to encapsulate foreign material and have themselves, been incorporated into supramolecular structures. Significantly, plant viruses studied are not human pathogens, which have no natural tendency to interact with human cell surface receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/nl0497474 |title=Cowpea Mosaic Virus as a Scaffold for 3-D Patterning of Gold Nanoparticles |journal=Nano Letters |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=867 |year=2004 |last1=Blum |first1=Amy Szuchmacher |last2=Soto |first2=Carissa M |last3=Wilson |first3=Charmaine D |last4=Cole |first4=John D |last5=Kim |first5=Moon |last6=Gnade |first6=Bruce |last7=Chatterji |first7=Anju |last8=Ochoa |first8=Wendy F |last9=Lin |first9=Tianwei |last10=Johnson |first10=John E |last11=Ratna |first11=B.

=== Plant viruses ===
Viruses cause several destructive plant diseases and are accountable for massive losses in crop production and quality in all parts of the world. Infected plants may show a range of symptoms depending on the disease but often there is severe leaf curling, stunting (abnormalities in the whole plant) and leaf yellowing (either of the whole leaf or in a pattern of stripes or blotches).&lt;ref&gt;Hull, R. Comparative plant virology, Second edition, Academic press, '''2001'''. {{ISBN|9780123741547}}.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most plant viruses are therefore transmitted by a vector organism (insects, nematodes, plasmodiophorids and mites) that feeds on the plant or (in some diseases) are introduced through wounds made, for example during agriculture practices (e.g. pruning). Many plant viruses, for example, tobacco mosaic virus, have been used as model systems to provide a basic understanding of how viruses express genes and replicate. Others permitted the elucidation of the processes underlying RNA silencing, now recognised as a core epigenetic mechanism underpinning numerous areas of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1564/16dec08 |title=DPVweb: An Open Access Internet Resource on Plant Viruses and Virus Diseases |journal=Outlooks on Pest Management |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=268 |year=2005 |last1=Adams |first1=Michael J |last2=Antoniw |first2=John F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some properties of viral nanoparticles==
* Plant viruses come in many shapes and sizes: for example, the plant virus [[Tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) measures 300x18 nm in size; it forms a hollow rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1453461 |year=1992 |author1=Pattanayek |first1=R |title=Structure of the U2 strain of tobacco mosaic virus refined at 3.5 a resolution using X-ray fiber diffraction |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=228 |issue=2 |pages=516–28 |last2=Stubbs |first2=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant virus [[Potato virus X]] (PVX) forms flexible filaments of 515x13 nm.&lt;ref name=pmid18667514&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/JVI.00895-08 |pmid=18667514 |pmc=2546986 |title=Structure of Flexible Filamentous Plant Viruses |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=82 |issue=19 |pages=9546–54 |year=2008 |last1=Kendall |first1=A |last2=McDonald |first2=M |last3=Bian |first3=W |last4=Bowles |first4=T |last5=Baumgarten |first5=S.

* These are just some examples, many different viruses are being engineered and studied for their potential applications in medicine, some examples of plant viruses include [[Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus]], Red clover necrotic mottle virus, Physalis mosaic virus, [[Papaya mosaic virus]].
* Plant viruses and bacteriophages are not infectious toward mammals. In contrast to mammalian viruses, there is no risk of a viral infection. 
* [[Virus-like particle]]s (VLPs) can be produced that lack the viral genome; these VLPs are non-infectious also toward plants and thus considered safe also from an agricultural point of view&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; .
* Viruses and their non-infectious counterparts can be produced through molecular farming in plants or fermentation in cell culture. 
* The virus-based nanoparticles can be tailored for specific applications using a number of chemical biology approaches: 
** [[Genetic engineering|Genetic modification]] can be used to modify the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein (also known as coat protein).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12144925 |year=2002 |author1=Wang |first1=Q |title=Natural supramolecular building blocks.

'''Walter Frederick Buckley''' (1922 – January 26, 2006) was an American sociologist, and professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]]. Buckley was among the first to apply concepts from [[general systems theory]] based on the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]] to [[sociology]]&lt;ref name = "GZ 92"&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] and [[Hans van der Zouwen]] (1992), "Sociocybernetics", in: ''Cybernetics and Applied Systems'', C.V. Negoita ed. p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born and raised in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], Buckley studied [[sociology]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. In 1958 he received his Ph.D. with the doctoral dissertation ''Sociological theory and social stratification'', in which he outlined a non-functionalist theory of [[social stratification]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress (1959) ''Catalog of Copyright Entries. Third Series: 1959: January–June''. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckley started his academic career early 1960s as  Assistant Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in the department of sociology, which was chaired by David Gold PhD.&lt;ref&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara (1963) ''General Catalog''. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971 to 1985 he was professor of Sociology at the [[University of New Hampshire]]. In the 1970s he participated in the [[Tom R. Burns#Work|Uppsala Theory Circle]] at the [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden founded by [[Tom R. Burns]]. In 1998 he was awarded the honorary chair of the [[Sociocybernetics|Socio-Cybernetics]] Research Committee of the [[International Sociological Association]].

Buckley has been described as a pioneer in [[social systems]] theory that challenged conventional views.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alumni.unh.edu/obits/fac_staff/buckley.html ''UNH Alumni in Memoriam: Walter F. Buckley''], University of New Hampshire, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In his personal life he appreciated [[jazz]] music and played tenor [[saxophone]]. He died in 2006 in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/buckley.html ''Walter F. Buckley''], Research Committee on Sociocybernetics, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
== Work ==
Buckley was among the first to apply concepts from [[general systems theory]] (GST), based on the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], to sociology although he never specifically aligned to either [[cybernetics]] or the general systems movements.&lt;ref name =" ASC 03"&gt;[[American Society for Cybernetics]], [http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/timeline.htm ''Timeline for the Evolution of Cybernetics''], 2003,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology and Modern Systems Theory ===
* In a series of books and articles, most notable his 1967 publication ''Sociology and Modern Systems Theory'', Buckley argued that the sociological theory of systems needs to be rewritten. The action-based functionalist theories of Parsons, along with the equilibrium and evolutionary models of Durkheim and Spencer, needed to be thrown  out and replaced with the latest advances taking place in second-order cybernetics. Equally important, second-order cybernetics needed to be integrated with the ideas of sociology. 
** Brian Castellani, Frederic William Hafferty (2009) ''Sociology and Complexity Science: A New Field of Inquiry''. p. 183
* Buckley introduced [[cybernetic]] principles to [[sociologists]], emphasizing concepts such as feedback much more than [[:w:Talcott Parsons|Parsons]] had. He presented the standard feedback loops where a positive and negative relationship in concert lead to a steady state... In addition, he drew upon the innovative work of Maruyama (1963) to show that loops could be other than homeostatic or stead state. For example, loops containing only "pluses" (positive relationships) are termed "deviation-amplifying" loops by Maruyama, as they do not lead to a steady state but expand indefinitely. Loops which are "deviation minimizing" in contrast contain all "minuses" (negative relationships) and proceed continuously down in a negative spiral. Both can be seen as examples of what are colloquially termed "circular causation."
** [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]] (1994) ''Sociology and the new systems theory: toward a theoretical synthesis''. p. 154  - Pagina 154 - Social Science

=== Sociocybernetics ===
* The first sociologist to make the argument of sociocybernetics was the American sociologist, Walter F. Buckley, professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire and 1998 honorary chair of the sociocybernetics research committee (RC-51) of the International Sociological Association.
** Brian Castellani, Frederic William. Hafferty (2009, p. 183)

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
* Buckley (1967, 1968) is best known for his outline of the features that characterize complex adaptive systems.  He proposed that a complex adaptive system must manifest some degree of "plasticity" and "irritability" vis-a-vis its environment

'''Young Rewired State''' (often styled as YRS) was an organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]], which ran events and schemes for technically gifted young people aged 18 and under. It brought together young developers, designers, and those with other technical skills to build projects (mainly phone and web applications) to attempt to solve real world problems.&lt;ref name="Kiss"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/aug/04/young-rewired-state|title=Young Rewired State 2011: Fresh blood, fresh data and fresh hacks|first=Jemima|last=Kiss|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the developers participating in Young Rewired State events taught themselves or learned coding skills outside the traditional school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/young-coders-ideas-for-change|title=Young coders: ideas for change|publisher=The Observer|date=31 March 2012|first1=Killian|last1=Fox|first2=Gemma|last2=Kappala-Ramsamy|first3=Kathy|last3=Sweeney|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Young Rewired State was initially run as an annual event by its sister organisation Rewired State, and subsequently became its own separate entity. The former Managing Director of Young Rewired State was Ruth Nicholls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth's bio on the YRS Website|url=http://yrs.io/hello/ruth|deadurl=yes|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20151207082720/http://www.yrs.io:80/hello/ruth|archive-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a law graduate from [[Cambridge University]], specialising in criminal law, penal policy and human rights. The organisation is currently dormant.

Between 2009 and 2015, Young Rewired State held a national [[hackathon]] where attendees across the UK took part in a competition to make an application including at least one piece of open government data. This event was initially called "Young Rewired State", but was renamed in 2012 to the "[[Festival of Code]]". Young Rewired State also ran their "Hyperlocal" scheme from October 2014, which aimed to re-open the local Festival centres to provide support for local young "digital makers" throughout the year.

According to an article by [[Emma Mulqueeny]], one of the founders of Young Rewired State, around 5% of the participants are female as of the 2012 festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/girls-coding-female-peer-pressure|title=Girls and coding: female peer pressure scares them off|first=Emma|last=Mulqueeny|date=31 March 2012|accessdate=15 October 2012|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this rose to over 30% by March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/youngrewired/status/574579091157958656|website=Twitter|title=Young Rewired State Tweet for International Women's Day 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival of Code that would have occurred in 2016 was initially postponed until 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@youngrewired/the-future-of-young-rewired-state-and-the-festival-of-code-d0f1644741f6|title=How do we scale?

== Hyperlocal ==
Throughout the year, Young Rewired State ran various "Hyperlocal" centres across the UK, which provide coding challenges across the year, rather than being focused on one week as the Festival of Code is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hyperlocal - About|url = https://hl.yrs.io/about|website = hl.yrs.io|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20161006143203/http://www.yrs.io/hyperlocal|archive-date=6 October 2016|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperlocal generally had fewer centres operating than the Festival of Code, with 21 operating as of 25 July 2015, although it did have three operating outside of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hyperlocal - Centres |url=https://hl.yrs.io/centres |website=hl.yrs.io |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725120755/https://hl.yrs.io/centres |archivedate=25 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hyperlocal (archived) |url=https://hl.yrs.io/centres |date=2015-07-25 |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725120755/https://hl.yrs.io/centres |archivedate=25 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
