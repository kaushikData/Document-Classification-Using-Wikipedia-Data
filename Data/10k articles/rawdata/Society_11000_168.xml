      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">{{for|other imams of Yemen called Al-Mu'ayyad|Al-Mu'ayyad (disambiguation)}}
'''Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad''' (died February 25, 1503) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled in parts of the Yemeni highland including [[San'a]] in 1462-1503.

==Repulsing the Tahirides==

He was a son of the former imam [[al-Mansur an-Nasir]] who died while imprisoned in [[Kawkaban]] in 1462. At this time the Yemeni highland was contested between several imams, most prominently [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar]] who lost San'a to the [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Tahiride]] Dynasty in July 1462. The Tahirides were a [[Sunni]] dynasty based in [[Zabid]] and [[Ta'izz]] in the lowland. Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad, who had proclaimed his [[imamate]] on the death of his father, moved to bring back the important city within the [[Zaydiyyah]] fold. In 1464, his officer Muhammad bin Isa Sharib tricked his way into San'a by impersonating the Tahiride governor, who bore the same name. In the next year a Tahiride army made an abortive attempt to retake the city. The troops withdrew after al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad promised to pay tribute. War was resumed later in the same year, but this time the Tahiride prince Amir was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lein O. Schuman, ''Political History of the Yemen at the Beginning of the 16th Century''. Groningen 1960, p. 52-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord of San'a==

After 1465 the imam was left in peace as lord of San'a (Sahib San'a) for 36 years. However, he only controlled part of the highland. The sons of the old imam al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar dominated [[Kawkaban]], and the region around the traditional Zaidi centre [[Sa'dah]] was divided between imam [[Al-Mansur Muhammad, Imam of Yemen|al-Mansur Muhammad]] and two other factions. Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad was reportedly a good administrator and a man of learning. For a long time he entertained good relations with the Tahiride Sultan Amir. Finally, however, the sultan attacked [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] and then San'a in 1501. In spite of the use of [[mangonel]]s to break the walls, the city held firm.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; After five months Sultan Amir burnt the equipment that could not be brought along and retreated, defeating a pursuing Zaidi force. Shortly after, in early 1503 ([[Sha'ban]] 908 AH), al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad passed way. His old commander Sharib continued to exercise power in San'a and the latter's brother was declared imam as al-Mustansir Ahmad, though he is not counted in the official list of imams.&lt;ref&gt;Lein O. Schuman, 1960, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1504, however, San'a was conquered by the Tahiride sultan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3268">'''Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim''' (died April 23, 1727) was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1716–1727. He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family, that was descended from [[Muhammad]] and dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] of Yemen in 1597–1962.

==Usurpation of power==

Al-Qasim bin al-Husayn was a grandson of Imam [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]] (d. 1681), and the nephew of Imam [[al-Mahdi Muhammad]] (d. 1718). During the reign of his uncle, he was a military commander of note, and chastised the [[Hashid]] tribes in 1707. For some time he was imprisoned by the ruler. In 1716, however, al-Mahdi Muhammad was badly cornered by the rival imam [[al-Mansur al-Husayn]]. He therefore released al-Qasim and sent him to fight the pretender. At Sudah, al-Qasim was defeated by the latter. He subsequently fell out with al-Mahdi Muhammad and submitted to al-Mansur al-Husayn. He proceeded to besiege his uncle on behalf of the pretender imam, and forced him to plead for a truce. However, al-Qasim had no intention to stick to al-Mansur al-Husayn. In the same year 1716 he rose against the usurper and proclaimed himself imam under the name al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim. Since he controlled [[San'a]] and the seaports, he was able to block the revenues of al-Mansur al-Husayn, who was ensconced in Shaharah and whose powers were rapidly dwindling. When al-Mansur al-Husayn died in 1720, the Zaidi state was firmly in al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim's hands.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''a History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 113; R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==

The reign of al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim was comparatively tranquil. However, in 1723 his cousin [[an-Nasir Muhammad]] laid claim ([[da'wah]]) to the imamate. The well-known literati Muhammad bin Isma'il al-Amir managed to bring about a reconciliation. In 1726 the imam had an encounter with Arhab tribesmen at San'a. The imam's soldiers, led by al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim in person, defeated them with losses. In the following year the Arhab, together with the [[Hashid]] and [[Bakil]] tribes, rose again, and tried to enlist the support of the imam's son al-Husayn. Once again, Muhammad bin Isma'il al-Amir had authority enough to bring about a successful mediation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978, pp. 151-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim is portrayed in positive terms in the chronicles. Apart from his personal bravery, he was considered a generous character who spent much money from the treasury on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1727, a few months after the truce with the tribes, and was succeeded by his son [[al-Mansur al-Husayn II]].

'''''Azmi v Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council''''' [2007] [[IRLR]] 434 ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0009_07_3003.html EAT]) is a [[UK labour law]] case, concerning indirect discrimination on grounds of religion. The United Kingdom Employment Appeals Tribunal in London (EAT) dismissed the appeal in respect of discrimination and/or harassment, but awarded £1,100 to the plaintiff "for injury to her feelings" as a result of the LEA's having failed to follow the statutory grievance protocol.

==Facts==
Aishah Azmi, a graduate (in English and Arabic) from [[Leeds University]], was employed as a bi-lingual support worker at Headfield [[Church of England]] (Controlled) Junior School, Thornhill Lees, [[Dewsbury]], [[West Yorkshire]] (where 92% of the students were [[Muslim]]), claimed constructive unfair dismissal for religious discrimination, because the school refused to allow her to wear a [[niqab]] that covered her entire face except her eyes as she worked with male colleagues and schoolchildren. The [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] stated the following fact summary.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] [[IRLR]] 434 ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0009_07_3003.html EAT]), [8]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|At her interview, the Claimant had worn a black tunic and headscarf; her face was not covered. At no time during the interview did she indicate that her religious beliefs required her to wear a veil or placed any limitation on her working. She attended the training day on 1 September 2005 in advance of term starting. On that occasion she dressed in a similar manner without her face being covered. At the hearing, the Claimant was asked the reason for her apparent change in practice and she explained that her husband had suggested to her that she should go unveiled.}}

After Azmi requested to be able to wear the veil the school and the local authority allowed her to wear the niqab temporarily outdoors in school grounds, but was concerned that many male colleagues were necessarily in the classrooms. They investigated whether wearing the niqab was compatible with doing her job, but ultimately found in a report "Gesture and body language including facial expression reinforce the spoken word" and noted Azmi's "lovely friend smiling manner with the children and how they responded well to this" but that children could not respond to her teaching so well when her face was concealed.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] IRLR 434 ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0009_07_3003.html EAT]), [10] and [17]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they concluded that Azmi could not continue working if she kept the niqab. Between November and February Azmi took time off and it was agreed to resolve the issue in the Tribunal.

The Employment Tribunal dismissed Azmi's claims for direct and indirect religious discrimination and harassment but found that she had been victimised for complaining, and awarded £1000, increased by 10% for the local authority's failure to follow the statutory grievance procedure. Azmi appealed the finding on direct and indirect discrimination and harassment. She was subsequently dismissed by Kirklees Council in February 2006..&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bradford/6179842.stm School sacks woman after veil row] BBC News, 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She lodged papers with the Employment Appeals Tribunal in London, although she was publicly advised by her MP [[Shahid Malik]] to drop the case, since 'there is no real support for it'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6069012.stm "MP tells veil woman 'let it go'"], BBC News, 20 November 2006; accessed 1 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Azmi's legal representative, Nick Whittingham, of Kirklees Law Centre, represented her during her unsuccessful appeal, heard in 2007.

==Judgment==
Wilkie J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that there was no direct or indirect discrimination or harassment. He found the Tribunal's conclusion that another non-Muslim person covering their face for whatever reason would have been dismissed as well would have been treated the same, and so there was no direct discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] IRLR 434 ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0009_07_3003.html EAT]), [55]-[56]&lt;/ref&gt; On the claim for indirect discrimination, he said the following:{{Cquote|73. ...In addition to the paragraph to which we have referred, the ET reminded itself of the consideration which had been given by the Respondent to alternative ways for accommodating the Appellant's wish to wear her veil when in the classroom with a male teacher, including suggestions that she use a screen; or that she remain with her back to the teacher; or that she remove the target group from the classroom; or that she use more hand and body gestures; or that the timetable be changed so that she only taught with female teachers...&lt;br&gt; In respect of each of these possible alternatives, including actions such as raising her voice, the ET in paragraph 25 concluded that it was satisfied that the Respondent had shown that the imposition of the [provision, criterion or practice] was a proportionate means of achieving their legitimate aim. They did so having explicitly reminded themselves of the approach identified most recently in Hardy and Hansons Plc v Lax and having conducted the kind of stringent investigation of the alternative means of achieving the aim by not imposing this requirement upon the Appellant, and having concluded that the Respondent had discharged the statutory burden upon it. In those circumstances, in our judgment, the ET did not err in law in its decision on whether the indirect discrimination that they found was justified within the terms of the statute. Accordingly the appeal on indirect discrimination fails.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Robert Edward Jones''' is a Texas businessman and convicted criminal.  He was formerly [[CEO]] of the National Center for Employment of the Disabled (NCED), which was based in [[El Paso, Texas]]. 

In late 2006, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' newspaper published articles alleging that Jones embezzled millions of dollars from NCED and, by extension, from the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Program, a [[United States]] federal program that helps [[Blindness|blind]] and other severely [[disabled]] people.{{cn|date=May 2017}} Under the management of the Jones Family Trust (JFT), NCED allegedly broke federal rules by claiming employees as disabled whose sole "disability" ("disadvantage") was reportedly being Spanish language speakers who were unable to speak English. NCED, a maker of chemical protective suits for soldiers, has since been reorganized as ReadyOne.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

On October 14, 2008, Bob Jones was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after having been charged under a 37-count indictment in connection with the alleged contract fraud of millions of dollars in government programs. The arrest was part of a federal investigation into alleged public corruption among elected officials and prominent businesspeople in El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 arrested in El Paso charity fraud case |date= October 15, 2008|work=Associated Press|publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/state_news/story/975018.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also arrested were Ernesto Lopez and Patrick James Woods.{{cn|date=May 2017}} 

The office of the United States attorney in San Antonio stated that Robert Jones was accused of lying about the number of disabled employees, and of embezzling or stealing from the company. Prosecutors reportedly demanded that Jones forfeit $58.9 million. Jones originally pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2009, Jones pleaded guilty to various charges in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Docket entry 45, July 2, 2009, ''United States v.

Robert Edward Jones'', case no. 3:08-cr-01698-PRM (U.S. Dist. Court for the Western District of Texas, El Paso Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 17, 2011, a judge sentenced Jones to 10 years in prison and $65 million in restitution for corruption and embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-Leader of Charity for Disabled Gets 10 Years in Prison, Must Pay $65 Million", Feb. 18, 2011, as published by [[ProPublica]], at [https://www.propublica.org/article/ex-leader-of-charity-for-disabled-gets-10-years-in-prison-must-pay-65-milli# 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corrupt El Paso charity boss exposed by The Oregonian gets 10 years in federal prison|date=February 18, 2011|work=Associated Press|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/02/corrupt_el_paso_charity_boss_e.html|publisher=oregonlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COBIT''' ('''Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies''') is a good-practice [[Software framework|framework]] created by international professional association [[ISACA]] for [[Information technology management|information technology (IT) management]] and [[Corporate governance of information technology|IT governance]]. COBIT provides an implementable "set of controls over information technology and organizes them around a logical framework of IT-related processes and enablers."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNgRBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Chapter 5: COBIT as a Framework for Enterprise Governance of IT |title=Enterprise Governance of Information Technology: Achieving Alignment and Value, Featuring COBIT 5 |author1=Haes, S.D. |author2=Grembergen, W.V. |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2015 |pages=103–128 |isbn=9783319145471 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISACA first released COBIT in 1996, originally as a set of control objectives{{clarify|date=June 2018}} to help the financial audit community better maneuver in IT-related environments.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/education/upcoming-events/documents/intro-cobit5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Introduction to COBIT 5 |author=Stroud, R.E. |publisher=ISACA |date=2012 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing value in expanding the framework beyond just the auditing realm, ISACA released a broader version 2 in 1998 and expanded it even further by adding management guidelines in 2000's version 3. The development of both the [[AS 8015]]: ''Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology'' in January 2005&lt;ref name="Cruz10AS8015_06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtREBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |chapter=10: AS 8015-2005 - Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of ICT |title=Frameworks for IT Management |author=da Cruz, M. |editor1=van Bon, J. |editor2=Verheijen, T. |publisher=Van Haren Publishing |year=2006 |pages=95–102 |isbn=9789077212905 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more international draft standard ISO/IEC DIS 29382 (which soon after became [[ISO/IEC 38500]]) in January 2007&lt;ref name="ISODIS29382Arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623191716/https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?&amp;item_s_key=00490704 |title=ISO/IEC DIS 29382: 2007 Edition, February 1, 2007 |work=IHS Standards Store |publisher=IHS, Inc |archivedate=23 June 2016 |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased awareness of the need for more information and communication technology (ICT) governance components. ISACA inevitably added related components/frameworks with versions 4 and 4.1 in 2005 and 2007 respectively, "addressing the IT-related business processes and responsibilities in value creation ([[Val IT]]) and risk management ([[Risk IT]])."&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StroudIntro12" /&gt;

In April 2012, COBIT 5 was released. Several drivers were responsible for the transition from 4.1 to 5:&lt;ref name="ProtivitiISACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protivit.us/en-UK/Documents/Insights/IT-Flash-Report-COBIT5.PDF |format=PDF |title=ISACA Releases COBIT 5: Updated Framework for the Governance and Management of IT |publisher=Provitivi, Inc |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=23 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* need for a more coherent understanding of how existing standards, best practices, and other tools relate and augment each other;
* need for a more end-to-end business/organization scope that covers all business and IT functions;
* need for improved guidance on hot-topic items such as [[enterprise architecture]] and emerging technologies;
* need for tighter integration among COBIT and other ISACA research, recommendations, and frameworks;
* need for tighter integration with external standards, recommendations, and frameworks; and
* need for improved information organization and dissemination concerning the framework.

An add-on for COBIT 5 related to information security was released in December 2012, and one related to assurance was released in June 2013.&lt;ref name="C5InfoSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Information Security |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C5Assur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Assurance-product-page.aspx |title=COBIT 5 for Assurance |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November and December of 2018, the next version of COBIT, COBIT 2019, was released.

==The COBIT framework==
COBIT was initially "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies," though before the release of the framework people talked of "CobiT" as "Control Objectives for IT"&lt;ref name="KatsikasInfo96"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_pLAAAAYAAJ |title=Information Systems Security: Facing the Information Society of the 21st Century |series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology |editor1=Katsikas, S. |editor2=Gritzalis, D. |publisher=Springer |page=358 |year=1996 |isbn=9780412781209 |quote=The [[McCumber cube|McCumber model]] has great similarities with the CobiT - Control Objectives for IT - framework (CobiT 1995).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology."&lt;ref name="ISACAFirstArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaca.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961107101619/http://www.isaca.org/ |title=Welcome to the ISACA/F |publisher=ISACA |date=18 October 1996 |archivedate=7 November 1996 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary [[Capability Maturity Model|maturity model]]. COBIT also provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT with business. COBIT 5 consolidates COBIT 4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with other frameworks and standards.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt;

===Framework and components===
The business orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process owners.

The process focus of COBIT is illustrated by a process model that subdivides IT into four domains (Plan and Organize; Acquire and Implement; Deliver and Support; and Monitor and Evaluate) and 34 processes inline with the responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor. It is positioned at a high level and has been aligned and harmonized with other, more detailed IT standards and good practices such as [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]], [[Business Information Services Library|BiSL]], [[ISO 27000]], [[Capability Maturity Model Integration|CMMI]], [[TOGAF]] and [[PMBOK]]. COBIT acts as an integrator of these different guidance materials, summarizing key objectives under one umbrella framework that link the good practice models with governance and business requirements.&lt;ref name="HaesCOBIT15" /&gt; COBIT 5 further consolidated and integrated the COBIT 4.1, Val IT 2.0 and Risk IT frameworks and drew from ISACA's ''IT Assurance Framework'' (ITAF) and the ''Business Model for Information Security'' (BMIS).

The framework and its components can, when utilized well, also contribute to ensuring regulatory compliance. It can encourage less wasteful information management, improve retention schedules, increase business agility, and lower costs while better complying with data retention and management regulations.&lt;ref name="LuelligACOBIT13"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2013/Volume-5/Pages/A-COBIT-Approach-to-Regulatory-Compliance-and-Defensible-Disposal.aspx |title=A COBIT Approach to Regulatory Compliance and Defensible Disposal |journal=ISACA Journal |author1=Luellig, L. |author2=Frazier, J. |volume=5 |year=2013 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBIT components include:
* Framework: Organizes IT governance objectives and good practices by IT domains and processes and links them to business requirements.
* Process descriptions: A reference process model and common language for everyone in an organization. The processes map to responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor.
* Control objectives: Provides a complete set of high-level requirements to be considered by management for effective control of each IT process.
* Management guidelines: Helps assign responsibility, agree on objectives, measure performance, and illustrate interrelationship with other processes.
* Maturity models: Assesses maturity and capability per process and helps to address gaps.

The '''[[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[diaspora]] in Fiji''' is a small but influential community in the multiracial society that makes up modern-day [[Fiji]].  In the early 2000s their numbers were estimated at around 6,000, or a little over half of one percent of [[Demographics of Fiji|Fiji's population]]. The most recent estimation puts the population at 8,000 making the concentration of Chinese in Fiji at around one percent.&lt;ref name="chineseinfijixinhaunet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-02/03/c_13717791.htm|title=Chinese in Fiji welcome New Year|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=2011-02-23|accessdate=2011-05-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Around 80% of Chinese in Fiji speak [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and around 16% speak [[Shanghainese]] as their native language. Chinese in Fiji also speak the local [[Fijian language]]. Chinese in Fiji have a strong [[Buddhist]] background and some retained [[Confucian]] traditions. There are also a considerable number of Fijians who are of partial Chinese extraction, being descended from marriages between Chinese and [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]].

For [[Politics of Fiji|electoral]] purposes, Chinese people used to be counted as [[General electors|General Electors]], an omnibus category for Fijian citizens not of indigenous, [[Indians in Fiji|Indian]], or [[Rotuma]]n descent, who were allocated three seats in the 71-member [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]]. This classification became redundant with the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]], which abolished ethnic representation in [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]].

== History ==
The history of Chinese people in Fiji dates to the year 1855, when [[Moy Ba Ling]], also known as ''Houng Lee,'' reached Fiji in a sail boat from Australia and settled in [[Levuka]].  He later returned to China, before bringing his relatives and some others to settle in Fiji, in connection with the gold rush.  Later arrivals came looking for [[sandalwood]] and [[beche-de-mer]].  According to [[Dixon Seeto]], President of the [[Chinese Association of Fiji]] in the early 2000s, the first shops in rural areas of Fiji were opened by Chinese merchants.

Chinese people were enfranchised for the first time in 1964.  The former ''European'' roll was redefined to include other minority groups and renamed the ''[[General electors|General Electors]]'' roll.  Despite being only a splinter of the electorate, General Electors were then allocated 10 of the 36 seats in the [[Legislative Council]], as the [[legislature]] was then known, though this figure has gradually been reduced since independence in 1970.

Around a thousand Chinese settled in Fiji in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and in February 1995, the Fijian [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] approved a plan to allow up to 7000 [[Hong Kong]] Chinese to immigrate to Fiji.  Conditions included payment of [[Fijan dollar|F$30,000]] to the government, and investment of [[Fijian dollar|F$100,000]] in government-approved projects.  Many of these invested in restaurants, retailing, and market gardening (mostly in [[Kalabu]], [[Tamavua]], [[Delaivalelevu]], [[Vikoba]], [[Sawani]] and [[Waibau]]), and have intensified [[horticulture]] around [[Suva]].  A further wave of Chinese has arrived since the late 1990s, many of them from the northern part of China.  Many of the more recent immigrants have opened bakeries and other food outlets in Fijian villages, creating employment for local people, says [[Fiji Times]] editor [[Samisoni Kakaivalu]].

The exact date of Moy Ba Ling's arrival is not known, but on 17 September 2005, the Chinese community celebrated the 150th anniversary.

=== Controversies ===
A 357-kilogram [[heroin]] bust in 2000 and a [[Suva]] drug laboratory, with a value estimated at close to [[Fijian dollar|F$1 billion]], in 2004, raised public concerns about the activities of some of the more recent Chinese immigrants.  The activities of a few of them, says [[Fiji Law Society]] President [[Graeme Leung]], have unfairly stigmatized the Chinese community in the eyes of the public.

On 4 October 2005, Military spokesman [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Orisi Rabukawaqa]] said that the Army had uncovered an immigration [[scam]].  Almost seven thousand [[China|Chinese]] nationals, he claimed,  had entered Fiji illegally since 2003.  He alleged that bribery in the office of the [[Registrar General (Fiji)|Registrar General]] had resulted in massive falsification of documents, with Chinese immigrants being falsely identified as [[Fijians|ethnic Fijians]].  Military investigations showed that illegal immigration was related to increasing rates of [[prostitution]], [[gambling]], [[money laundering]], and illegal [[fishing]].

On 6 October, Justice Ministry Chief Executive [[Sakiusa Rabuka]] challenged the Military to substantiate its allegations, telling the [http://www.Fijivillage.com Fiji Village] news service on 9 October that the allegations made by the Military were "baseless."  Only one case had been found, he said, of an Asian national trying to change his birth certificate.

As more evidence came to light, however, the local Chinese community called for a crackdown on corruption in the immigration service.  Government-appointed Senator Kenneth Low, who was also President of the [[Chinese Business Association in Fiji]], alleged on 8 November that corrupt immigration officials were granting Fijian [[citizenship]] to illegal Asian immigrants for money and sex, and called on the government to establish a [[commission of inquiry]] into illegal immigration.

Dixon Seeto spoke out on 15 December against violent attacks made against Chinese market gardeners and farmers.  Both men and women were being assaulted by youths seeking cash, he claimed, when bringing their produce to the market at around 3 or 4 a.m.  He called for more [[police]] patrols to prevent such attacks.

Chinese Fijian have been increasingly linked to illegal human smuggling activities for prostitution since 2006. Several night club owners who are Fijians of Chinese origin such the Wei Zhang and his wife Liu Da Jun (East Court Reastaurant), Billy Chen and Lum Moon Woot (Angel Night Club) and Yan Xiu Hua (Signals Night Club) have been accused of involvement in allowing mainland Chinese prostitutes to solicit for businesses within their premises from mainland Chinese fishing crews.

Well-known persons of whole or partial Chinese descent include former [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet Minister]] [[Pio Wong]], former [[Senate of Fiji|Senators]] [[Kenneth Low]] and [[James Ah Koy]], [[Peter Lee (Fijian businessman)|Peter Lee]] (former long serving General Manager of [[Coca-Cola Fiji]] and currently heading Fiji's largest conglomerate - ''Carpenters'') and prominent lawyer [[Graeme Leung]].  At the 150th anniversary celebrations, Fiji's [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]], [[Joni Madraiwiwi|Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi]], paid tribute to the contribution the Chinese community has made to Fiji.  ''"The Chinese community has never been a large one but their influence has been felt far beyond their numbers,"'' he said.

There were estimated to be roughly five to six thousand '''Chinese people in Botswana''' {{asof|2009|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="France24"/&gt;

==Employment==
{{asof|2009}}, Chinese formed the largest group of self-employment permit holders in [[Botswana]], though [[Zimbabweans in Botswana|Zimbabwean expatriates]] were the largest group of foreign workers overall. Statistics for that year also showed 1,273 Chinese expatriates holding employee permits, 11.3% of the total number.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=8&amp;dir=2009/May/Tuesday5|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Number of foreign workers go up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented 36% growth over the previous year's number of 937.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=27&amp;dir=2008/November/Monday3|date=2008-11-03|accessdate=2009-08-26|last=Benza|first=Brian|title=Zimbos, Chinese Are Majority Work Permit Holders|periodical=Mmegi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the self-employed work as traders in the Oriental Plaza in Gaborone.&lt;ref name="Mmegi20090409"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=6&amp;dir=2009/April/Thursday9|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-04-09|accessdate=2009-08-25|title=Fake Chinese DVDs,CDs off the shelves|last=Gaotlhobogwe|first=Monkagedi}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an increasing number of Chinese traders in Francistown, an influx noted by locals as early as 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Mmegi|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/2005/June/Thursday2/9384339341661.html|date=2005-06-02|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Residents blamed for influx of Chinese businesses|last=Setsiba|first=Tuduetso}}&lt;/ref&gt; In local slang, poor-quality Chinese goods are referred to as "Fong-kongs".&lt;ref name="Mmegi20080725"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Mmegi Businessweek|title=New Licence regime cripples local traders|last=Gabathuse|first=Ryder|date=2008-07-25|accessdate=2009-08-26|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=30&amp;dir=2008/July/Friday25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some locals accuse Chinese businesspeople of violating local labour laws by forcing employees to work long hours, while others praise them for the low prices they offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=6&amp;aid=14&amp;dir=2009/January/Friday30|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2009-08-26|last=Keoreng|first=Ephraim|title=Chinese shops a relief, but they must behave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, new trade laws repealed the earlier Specialised Dealer licence system under which had been primarily used by Chinese and other foreigners. It was speculated that this could lead to self-employed Chinese traders being forced to leave the country; the [[Gaborone City Council]] indicated that it would be willing to license the Chinese under the "Miscellaneous Trade" category for an adjustment period of two years.&lt;ref name="Mmegi20080725"/&gt; The Chinese ambassador also speculated that local traders might eventually be able to out-compete the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=18&amp;dir=2009/February/Friday13|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-02-13|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Chinese envoy tips Batswana entrepreneurs|last=Benza|first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, Chinese were also banned from dealing in clothes; local traders had complained that the Chinese were using the Specialised Dealer system to engage in general retail sales. New trade laws reserved 13 types of retail businesses for locals only: general clothing shops, general dealers, car washes, auctioneers, fresh produce shops, funeral parlours, hairdressers, laundromats, petrol filling station, take-away restaurants, cleaning services, and curio shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=2&amp;dir=2009/January/Tuesday27|periodical=Mmegi|date=2009-01-27|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Government moves to ban Chinese trade in clothes|last=Gaotlhobogwe|first=Monkagedi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers have also expressed concern about the rising number of unskilled Chinese labourers coming to Botswana to work in jobs such as ditch-digging, even in deep rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=52&amp;dir=2008/August/Tuesday12|periodical=Mmegi|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Unskilled Chinese labourers flood the country - MPs|last=Piet|first=Bame}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government records in 2006, there were 1,094 Chinese citizens legally registered to work in the construction industry in Botswana, slightly more than a third of the total number of legal Chinese residents at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20060904&amp;i=Close_to_3_000_Chinese_in_Botswana|date=2006-09-04|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Close to 3,000 Chinese in Botswana|periodical=Botswana Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of construction projects managed by Chinese companies, such as the [[Sir Seretse Khama International Airport]] expansion project, primary schools in [[Serowe]], Oriental Plaza, and Dikgathong Dam, illegally employed Chinese workers whose had no work permits or whose permits had not yet been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=31&amp;sid2=1&amp;aid=1&amp;dir=2009/January/Monday26|date=2009-01-26|accessdate=2009-08-26|periodical=Mmegi|title=Chinese Risk All To Complete Airport On Time|first=Monkagedi|last=Gaotlhobogwe}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to these accusations, the Chinese embassy claimed that the work permit process was already very cumbersome and that it was difficult to find locals willing to work on construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=22&amp;dir=2008/August/Friday15|periodical=Mmegi|date=2008-08-15|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=Work permit process frustrates Chinese envoy|last=Piet|first=Bame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
''The Oriental Post'' (华侨周报), a Chinese-language weekly newspaper, was launched in May 2009.&lt;ref name="France24"/&gt; It is believed to be the first newspaper of Botswana to be printed in an international language other than English. Its president is Miles Nan (南庚戌), who also runs a construction company in Botswana.&lt;ref name="Mmegi"/&gt; Its editor-in-chief is Tian Wentai (田文泰).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=People's Daily|last=Zhao|first=Yanping|url=http://chinese.people.com.cn/GB/9384142.html|title=非洲《华侨周报》首创刊/Africa 'Oriental Post' begins publication|date=2009-05-31|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
The Botswana Chinese General Chamber of Commerce (博茨瓦纳华人华侨总商会) was established in 1998. As late as 2007 it was the only non-profit Chinese organisation in the country. It organises a variety of activities including ping pong tournaments and celebrations of Chinese holidays such as the [[Chinese New Year]] and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://olympic.people.com.cn/BIG5/22192/111850/111852/6604837.html|periodical=People's Daily|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2009-08-26|title="龍行天下耀中華"背景資料：商會簡介}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Xinhua News|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2008-02/05/content_7572384.htm|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2009-08-25|title=中国驻博茨瓦纳使馆举行春节招待会/Chinese Embassy in Botswana holds reception}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.xj.xinhuanet.com/2009-01/21/content_15516420.htm|periodical=Xinhua News|title=新疆艺术团在博茨瓦纳与当地华人华侨共庆新春/Xinjiang art troupe joins local Chinese in Botswana to celebrate the New Year|date=2009-01-21|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also cooperated with the Botswana authorities to translate local laws into Chinese for the benefit of those who do not speak English.&lt;ref name="Mmegi20090409"/&gt;

In 2009, a number of other Chinese organisations were founded.

'''[[Consumer surplus]] for software products''' can be calculated differently from other products. Customers tend to buy products with greater consumer surplus. Software companies should know what measure in their market analysis to determine their consumer surplus so that create products that are better at fulfilling their customers. Messerschmitt and Szyperski have studied what factors affect the perceived consumer surplus in the software product market. The value a customer places on software is affected by things such as compatibility with complementary products, degree of adoption in the market, usability, increases in productivity, differentiation from competitors, and innovativeness. These can be [[customer satisfaction dimensions]]. 

On the other hand, many things affect the total cost of ownership of software products besides price. These include implementation, training, management, and operations costs. Additionally, [[switching barriers|switching costs]] to competitors play a role because customers may fear that the vendor may discontinue the product or go out of business. These authors suggest that the price of software should be based on its consumer surplus. Pricing strategies can be used to gain the most revenue such as [[product bundling]], forming separable modules, and [[price discrimination]] with product variants and target groups. (2004) Calculations of consumer surplus is one way that software firms can keep track of their perception by customers in an integrative way.

==History==
[[File:Malcolm Turnbull announces home affairs portfolio 2017.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Dutton]] (second from right) announcing the creation of the new Home Affairs portfolio in July 2017.]]
One of the seven inaugural [[Australian Public Service]] departments at the [[federation of Australia]] was the [[Department of Home Affairs (1901–16)]] with wide-ranging responsibilities for public works, elections, census, the public service, pensions, and inter-state relations. This followed by the [[Department of Home and Territories|Department of Home and Territories (1916–1928)]], the [[Department of Home Affairs (1928–32)]], the [[Department of the Interior (1932–39)]], the [[Department of the Interior (1939–72)]], the [[Department of Home Affairs (1977–80)]], and the [[Department of Home Affairs and Environment|Department of Home Affairs and Environment (1980–84)]]. Prior to the formation of the current Department of Home Affairs, the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] had responsibility for national security, law enforcement, emergency management as well as border protection alongside the various forms of the [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]].

The proposed establishment of the Department of Home Affairs was announced by Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] on 18 July 2017 to be headed by Immigration Minister [[Peter Dutton]] as the designated Minister for Home Affairs to bring together all national security, border control and law enforcement agencies of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Strong and Secure Australia |date=18 July 2017 |url=https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2017-07-18/strong-and-secure-australia |publisher=[[Prime Minister of Australia]] |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department was officially stood up on the 20 December 2017 through a [[Machinery of government|Administrative Arrangements Order]].

The Department combines the national security, law enforcement and emergency management functions of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]], the transport security functions of the [[Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development]], the counterterrorism and cybersecurity functions of the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], the multicultural affairs functions of the [[Department of Social Services (Australia)|Department of Social Services]], and the entirety of the [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]].

==Ministers==
The ministers of the Home Affairs portfolio were announced on 19 December 2017 by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull including a Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity held by [[Angus Taylor (politician)|Angus Taylor]] and a Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs held by [[Alan Tudge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/19/turnbull-cabinet-reshuffle-conservatives-promoted-and-darren-chester-dumped |title=Turnbull cabinet reshuffle: conservatives promoted and Darren Chester dumped |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=Australia |author=Karp, Paul |date=19 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turnbull2nd-4thAR"&gt;{{cite press release|quote=Peter Dutton will become Minister for Home Affairs, for the first time bringing together the nation’s security, border and intelligence agencies under one department.

He will also continue to have the assistance of Alex Hawke as Assistant Minister for Home Affairs. The Department of Home Affairs will keep Australians safer by ensuring full coordination between ASIO, the AFP, Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and AUSTRAC.

With the [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018]] resulting in the change of Prime Minister, [[Scott Morrison]] separated the concurrently held Minister for Immigration and Border Protection office from Peter Dutton who was also Minister for Home Affairs and renamed the immigration minister to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs as a post in the Outer Ministry.

'''Ecatepec''', (&lt;small&gt;Spanish&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio-IPA|EcatepecPronunciation.ogg|[ekateˈpek]|}} once officially '''Ecatepec de Morelos''', is a city and municipality in the [[State of Mexico]]. Both are usually known simply as "Ecatepec". The city is practically co-extensive with the municipality, with the city's 2005 population of 1,687,549 being 99.9% of the total municipal population of 1,688,258.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/default.asp?s=est&amp;c=10395|title=Principales resultados por localidad 2005 (ITER)|date=13 June 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613185456/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/default.asp?s=est&amp;c=10395|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisional population at the 2010 Census was 1,658,806.

The name "Ecatepec" is derived from [[Nahuatl]], and means "windy hill" or "hill devoted to [[Ehecatl]]." It was also an alternative name or invocation to [[Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref name="CitySite"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecatepec.com/historiaecatepec.htm |title= Historia de Ecatepec|website=Ecatepec.com |accessdate= 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Morelos" is the last name of [[José María Morelos]], a hero of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

Most inhabitants commute to Mexico City for work, and the [[Mexico City metro]] subway system was extended into Ecatepec.

"San Cristóbal" ([[Saint Christopher]]) is the city's patron saint. His feast day is celebrated on July 25 each year.&lt;ref name="CitySite"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ehecatepec.jpg|thumb|left|The [[glyph (archaeology)|glyph]] for Ecatepec. Its name is represented by a hill (''tepetl'') and the face of the wind god (''[[Ehecatl]]'').]]
[[File:Matamoros, Morelos and Galeana.jpg|thumbnail|left|Monument to [[Mariano Matamoros]], [[José María Morelos]] and [[Hermenegildo Galeana]] in the Parque San Cristóbal Ecatepec.]]
Remains of earliest human inhabitation of the area have been found on the nearby ''Cerro'' (Hill) ''de Ecatepec''.  The area was initially settled by successive waves of [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s; however, because of the later arrival of [[Toltec]]-[[Chichimeca]]s that dominated the rest of the [[Valley of Mexico]], this area eventually assimilated to the rest of the Valley, ending with its domination by the [[Aztec empire]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Ecatepec was an [[Aztec]] ''[[altepetl]]'' or [[city-state]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. From 1428 to 1539, Ecatepec was ruled by a ''[[tlatoani]]'' (literally "speaker"). The ''tlatoque'' (plural of ''tlatoani'') of Ecatepec were closely related to the ruling dynasty of [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Explorations in ethnohistory: Indians of central Mexico in the sixteenth century'' by H. R. Harvey, Hanns J. Prem&lt;/ref&gt;
- [[Chimalpilli I]], grandson of [[Moctezuma I]].
- [[Tezozomoc (son of Chimalpopoca)|Tezozomoc]], son of [[Chimalpopoca]].
- [[Matlaccohuatl]], whose daughter [[Teotlalco]] married [[Moctezuma II]].
- [[Chimalpilli II]], son of [[Ahuitzotl]].
- [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin]], grandson of [[Axayacatl]].

Diego Huanitzin was subsequently made tlatoani of Tenochtitlan by [[Antonio de Mendoza]], [[viceroy]] of [[New Spain]].

During the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec empire]], the [[Mexica]]s used the town to control trade routes going north.&lt;ref name="CitySite"/&gt;

Ecatepec was considered an "''República de Indios''" (Indian Republic) 1560, allowing the village to maintain a certain amount of autonomy and keeping the succession of [[tlatoani]]s or chiefs. However, in the first part of the 17th century, this was changed to a mayorship, with the Spanish administrating, along with the communities of [[Zumpango]] and [[Xalostoc]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The municipality was officially created on October 13, 1874.&lt;ref name="CitySite"/&gt; On October 1, 1877, San Cristóbal Ecatepec was declared a village and "de Morelos" was added to its name.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The national hero [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] was executed in Ecatepec in 1815 by the Spanish during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. The house in which he was executed is now the '''Museo Casa de Morelos''' (Museum House of Morelos). Ecatepec was declared a city on December 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="CitySite"/&gt;

In April 1995, the remains of a [[mammoth]] were found in Colonia Ejidos de San Cristóbal, where the ancient lakes of Xaltocan-Ecatepec and [[Lake Texcoco|Texcoco]] came together and where the Aztecs build a dam to keep the fresh and salty waters separate. The bones have been tentatively dated to around 10,500 years B.C.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Ecatepec de Morelos had a 2010 census population of 1,656,107 inhabitants, which makes it the most populous municipality in the nation [http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob93&amp;c=3839&amp;e=15], as well as in the state.

In February 2016, [[Pope Francis]] celebrated  [[Mass (Catholic Church) | Mass]] in the city in front of a crowd of 300,000. The Pope's message was one of encouragement and opposition to the violence and drug trade that permeates the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/14/pope-francis-warns-mexico-city-crowd-against-dialogue-with-the-devil|title=Pope Francis warns Mexico City crowd against 'dialogue with the devil'|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a new transportation system was introduced to Ecatepec's inhabitants: [[Mexicable]]. This project is a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] which main purpose is to help people displace faster (contrary to most cable cars which have tourists as their main users), specially in areas with complicated geography. The idea was originally developed in the South Americas, with Colombia being the first country to add a cable car system, called [[Metrocable (Medellin)|Metrocable]], as part of their metro. The Mexicable, the first cable car constructed in Mexico as a public transport, has a length of almost 5 kilometres (3 miles), 190 cars and it runs the entire line in about 17 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President inaugurates cable car system|url=http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/president-inaugurates-cable-car-system/|newspaper=Mexico News Daily|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Förvaltningsaktiebolaget Stattum''', a Swedish government holding company that can be characterized as a [[National Wealth Fund]]. It was set up in 1991, to manage the listed shareholdings of the Swedish government, following the dismantling of [[Fortia ab|Fortia AB]] and [[Statsföretag]]. Shareholdings included [[Saab Group|Celsius Industrier AB]],  [[:sv:Sveaskog|AssiDomän]], [[SSAB]], and [[Pharmacia|Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/08D0FF12-7902-4165-A054-A8643A4C851B | title=Ekonomisk värde och samhällsnytta – förslag till en ny statlig ägarförvaltning | publisher=[[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2012:14 | year=2012 | location=Stockholm |language=sv | isbn=978-91-38-23700-7| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117063423/https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/08D0FF12-7902-4165-A054-A8643A4C851B | archivedate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''garpon''' is historically a local or [[regional]]  leader in [[Tibet]] and parts of [[Ladakh]] who has command and prominence over a district or area. He is highly regarded by the people and respected as a governor although his power and authority is informal in a given area. Ultimate leadership and spiritual leadership in Tibet was always given centrally to the [[Dalai Lama]] in the capital of [[Lhasa]]. Garpons were usually regarded as localized ministers to maintain district order. However, with the Chinese invasion of 1949, with Tibet now under the control of the [[People's Republic of China]], the rulership of local district garpons has diminished somewhat in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. Sir [[Edward Birkbeck Wakefield]] has cited that in Ladakh there was often a Senior Garpon and a Junior Garpon.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Birkbeck Wakefield, ''Past Imperative'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)]]'', a garpon in western Tibet was played by Samdup Dhargyal and was cited as being the eminent ruler of the province.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13762">One of the chief issues with which the movement for [[gender-neutral language]] has been concerned is that of [[gender]] ([[sex]]) specificity in [[employment|job]] titles.

A '''gender-specific job title''' is a name of a job that also specifies or implies the gender of the person performing that job. For example, in English, the job title ''stewardess'' implies that the person is female; the job title ''policeman'' implies that the person is male. A '''gender-neutral job title''', on the other hand, is one that does not specify or imply gender, such as ''firefighter'' or ''lawyer''. In some cases it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific; for example, ''chairman'' appears to denote a male (because of the ending ''-man''), but the title is also applied sometimes to women.

Proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles, particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified. For example, they prefer ''flight attendant'' to ''stewardess'' or ''steward'', and ''police officer'' to ''policeman'' or ''policewoman''. In some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles (such as ''authoress''), thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form (such as ''author'') as a fully gender-neutral title.

The above applies to [[gender neutrality in English]] and in some other [[gender neutrality in languages without grammatical gender|languages without grammatical gender]] (where [[grammatical gender]] is a feature of a language's grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes, often including feminine and masculine). In [[gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender|languages with grammatical gender]], the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine, and the production of truly gender-neutral titles may not be possible. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job, and that they are treated with equal status.

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sexist-by-occupation billboard, January 1977, California.jpg|thumb|Sexist billboard in California, 1977, in which a woman worker is called a "girl" and a male worker is called a "man."]] --&gt;
The [[suffix]] ''-man'' had the meaning "person" in [[Old English]] (see [[Man (word)|''man'']]), but in present-day English it is predominantly masculine. Thus job titles that include this suffix, such as ''fireman'', ''salesman'' and ''alderman'', generally imply that the holder is male. While some of these job titles have feminine variants (e.g. ''alderwoman''), others do not, because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women.&lt;ref name="handbook linguistics"&gt;Aarts, Bas and April M. S. McMahon. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tzyAyl1retcC&amp;pg=PA737 ''The Handbook of English Linguistics.''] Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell Pub., 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1382-3}}, p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt; For most such titles, gender-neutral equivalents now also exist, such as ''police officer'' (for ''policeman'' or ''policewoman''), ''salesperson'' or ''sales representative'' (for ''salesman'' or ''saleswoman''), etc. However, some proposed gender-neutral terms have not attained such common usage (as with ''fisher'' as an alternative to ''fisherman''). Military ranks with the suffix ''-man'' normally remain unchanged when applied to females: for example, a woman serving in the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] might be known as Craftsman Atkins.

In the case of ''chairman'', gender-neutral alternatives (such as ''chair'' and ''chairperson'') exist, although in some contexts the word ''chairman'' is used even where it denotes (or could denote) a woman. For details, see ''[[Chairman]]''.

Feminine terms such as ''actress'', ''usherette'' and ''comedienne'' are [[markedness|marked]] with respect to the masculine (''actor'', ''usher'', ''comedian'') both formally (i.e. something is added to the masculine form) and in the sense that only the masculine form can be used generically to describe a mixed-gender group of people.&lt;ref name="handbook linguistics" /&gt; This means that the "masculine" form can in fact serve as a gender-neutral term (a solution often favored by proponents of gender-neutral language, who thus tend to deprecate or restrict usage of the specifically feminine forms). Some such feminine forms, such as ''poetess'' and ''authoress'', are now rarely used. Others, such as ''actress'', remain common, although increasing numbers of women are calling themselves ''actors'' rather than ''actresses'', especially in the live theatre.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Screen Actors Guild]] annually gives out awards for "Best Male Actor" and "Best Female Actor".

The term ''[[waiter]]'' appears to retain masculine specificity (with ''waitress'' as the corresponding feminine term). Other gender-neutral terms have therefore been proposed, such as ''server'' (alternatives include ''waitron'', ''waitstaff'' or ''waitperson''), though these are rarely used outside North America.

The term ''[[midwife]]'' looks superficially to be feminine (since it ends with ''-wife''), but it is used for either gender. The term comes from an [[Old English language|Old English]] term meaning "with the woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Midwife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
A change to gender-neutral job titles can be controversial.{{By whom|date=July 2017}} This debate reflects the debate over gender-neutral language in general.

The case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an [[ideology|ideological]] argument, that gender-specific job titles at some level promote [[sexism]] in the workplace. For example, fire chiefs have argued that when the public uses the term "fireman" instead of "[[firefighter]]", it reinforces the popular image that firefighting is only a job for men, and thus makes it difficult for them to recruit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why We Are Campaigning To Shake Off The Outdated Term 'Firemen'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dany-cotton/firefighter-dany-cotton_b_18293684.html|website=HuffPost UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case for the more traditional, gender-specific terms is usually a practical argument, that replacing the historical terms everywhere they appear (in documents, etc.) would be difficult and expensive, or that it is unnecessary. However, there are many (in particular [[feminism|feminists]]) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender-neutral language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is much difficulty in resolving this debate, as in the case of gender-neutral language in general; however there is at least one difference. Whereas in the general case, there is often no appropriate singular gender-neutral replacement (e.g. the third person singular pronoun ''he'', although the use of [[singular they]] is increasingly common), there are gender-neutral versions of nearly all job titles.

During the 19th century, attempts to overlay [[Latin]] [[grammar]] rules onto English required the use of feminine endings in nouns ending with -or.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} This produced words like ''doctress'' and ''professoress'' and even ''lawyeress'',{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} all of which have fallen out of use; though ''waitress'', ''stewardess'', and ''actress'' are in modern use.

Use of the term ''chairman'' remains widespread in predominantly male sectors of society, but ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' is now widespread in society in general, at least in the USA, Canada and increasingly in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/P0208500.html American Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173654/http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/P0208500.html |date=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the boards of most [[Fortune 500]] companies in the [[United States]] are presided over by a "chairman" and also the overwhelming majority of the ([[FTSE 100]]) companies in the [[United Kingdom]] have a "chairman", while committees in the [[United States House of Representatives]] are presided over by a "chair", as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/2009/01/06/house-gender-neutral/ House language becomes gender neutral]&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of these are, however, men, a more correct description of the current language situation needs to consider use in organisations whose chairperson is a woman. Less than half of the members of the American Heritage Dictionary's usage panel accept the use of the word ''chairman'' in describing a woman.&lt;ref&gt;"Only 48 percent (43 percent of the women and 50 percent of the men) accept the use of the word in ''Emily Owen, chairman of the Mayor's Task Force, issued a statement assuring residents that their views would be solicited.''"[http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/M0069600.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some usage guides, such as ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'', advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included.  For instance, a business might advertise that it is looking for a new ''chair'' or ''chairperson'' rather than ''chairman''. Gender-neutral language proscribes ''chairman'', on the grounds that some readers would assume women and those of other genders are implicitly excluded from responding to an advertisement using this word.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'' pp 243,4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generally accepted writing conventions==
Proponents of gender-neutral job titles believe that such titles should be used, especially when referring to hypothetical persons. For example, ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''mail carrier'', ''letter carrier'', or ''post worker'' rather than ''mailman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''. In the rare case where no useful gender-neutral alternative is available, they believe both male and female terms should be used.

Proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of a neuter form when/where appropriate. For example, a company may seek to fill a vacancy and hire a new ''chairperson''. Since a gendered individual doesn't currently hold the position, its title reverts to a neuter form. Once that position is filled, many advocates believe gender can be attached to the title as appropriate (chair''man'' or chair''woman'').

Sometimes this formulation can lead to inconsistent gender-specific usage, in which women become ''chairpersons'' but men remain ''chairmen''. Some women opt to use the word ''chairman'' in preference to ''chairwoman'', subject to the [[Style - Manner of Address|style]] ''Madam'' or ''Mister'' prefixing the title, which they perceive to be gender-neutral by itself.  Particularly in [[academia]], the word [[chairman|Chair]] is often used to designate the person chosen to oversee the [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] at meetings of an [[organized group]].

The principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided. For example, "usher", not "usherette"; "comedian", not "comedienne". Some of these are almost entirely obsolete now, such as sculptress, [[poetess]], and aviatrix. If gender is relevant, the words ''woman'' or ''female'' should be used instead of "lady" ("my grandmother was the first female doctor in the province"), except if the masculine is "lord" (as in "landlady").  In the case of landlord or landlady, it may be preferable to find an equivalent title with the same meaning, such as proprietor or lessor.  However, when a female is in the office of "[[Black Rod|the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]]," it is changed to "the Usher of the Black Rod" in Canada.

Advisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as "male nurse," "male model," or "female judge" because such terms are often used when the gender is irrelevant. These advisors say that the statement of exception indicates that a worker of that gender is somehow an inferior or atypical member of that profession.

==Languages other than English==
When words have a [[grammatical gender]] associated with them, in many languages, they may impose [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] requirements to maintain sentence agreement.  That is, there is a non-political content to the word changes, or [[inflection]].  Nevertheless, gender-identification word endings are sometimes dropped, something that happened often in the former [[East Germany]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=120621159894102 Review of: Mary Fulbrook. The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005. 352 pp.] {{ISBN|978-0-300-10884-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an entirely new or etymologically unrelated word is coined. For example, when men in France wanted to become [[midwife|midwives]], up till then an exclusively female occupation, they chose not to adapt the existing term ''sage-femme'' ("wise woman"), and instead coined ''maïeuticien''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25660">'''Germans from Russia''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Deutsche aus Russland'' or ''Russlanddeutsche''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Российские немцы'', ''rossiyskiye nemtsy'') refers to the large numbers of ethnic [[Germans]] who emigrated from the [[Russian Empire]], peaking in the late 19th century. The upper [[Great Plains]] in the United States and southern [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] have large areas populated primarily by descendants of Germans from Russia.  Argentina, Brazil and other countries have smaller numbers of Germans from Russia.

Their mother tongues were [[High German]] or [[Low German]] dialects, despite their having lived in Russia for multiple generations. The [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans in Russia]] frequently lived in ethnic German communities, where they maintained German-language schools and German churches. They were primarily [[Volga Germans]] from the lower [[Volga River]] valley, [[Black Sea Germans]] from the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]/[[Black Sea]] region, or [[Volhynian Germans]] from the governorate of [[Volhynia]] in contemporary [[Ukraine]]. The smaller villages were often settled by colonists of a common religion, who had come from the same area, so one town might be all Catholic, or all Lutheran, for instance; the people often settled together from the same region of Germany and thus spoke the same German [[dialect]]. Also included were Germans of the [[Mennonite]] faiths (today mostly referred to as [[Russian Mennonite]] despite of their German language culture and ethnicity), and also [[Hutterite]]s seeking religious freedom.

Originally recruited and welcomed into Russia in the 18th century, when they were promised the practice of their own language and religions, and exemption from military service, the German people found increasing hardship. With changes in Russian politics, the government took back some of the privileges granted; economic conditions grew poor, and there were a series of famines. These conditions led to German mass migrations from Russia.

After the 1917 Revolution and the rise of the [[Soviet Union]], and particularly under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]], conditions for the remaining Germans in Russia declined considerably. The rise of [[Nazi Germany]], with its concern about ethnic Germans in other lands and proselytizing the German ''volk'', led to suspicions of any German within Russia. In 1932-33, the Soviet authorities forced starvation among the Volga Germans, seized their food claiming [[famine]] in the rest of the Soviet Union and ordering the breakup of many German villages.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Fred C. (1977). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rzJh_whDGmIC&amp;pg=PA281 ''The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present''], pp. 281-82. The Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin ordered the deportation of Russian Germans to labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia, as he was suspicious of potential collaboration with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Helen (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=lsKClpnX8qwC&amp;pg=PA191 ''Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion''], p. 191. ABC-CLIO, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, his forces attempted to bulldoze the German churches, and reused their tombstones for paving blocks. Many Germans in the Americas sent donations back to their communities, but others permanently lost contact with their relatives during the social disruption of the famine and Stalin's [[Great Purge]], followed by [[World War II]].

==Areas of immigration ==
Unlike many other immigrants to the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germans from Russia wanted to continue farming and settled in agricultural areas rather than industrial cities. Primary areas were the Plains states of Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, North and South Dakota, with some movement to specific areas of Washington and California (Fresno and Lodi for instance) in the United States; Saskatchewan and Manitoba of Canada; and Brazil and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm#5 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806095635/http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm |date=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas tended to resemble the flat plains of the Russian [[steppes]]. In addition, the upper Great Plains still had arable land available for free settlement under the [[Homestead Act]]. In the 2000 Census, North Dakota reported 43.9% of the population identified as having German ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, 5% of the population of North Dakota had been born in Russia; it is likely most were ethnic Germans.

Large-scale immigration to the Americas started in the 1870s and continued until the 1917 Revolution, when travel and emigration were stopped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm#4 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806095635/http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm |date=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.familysearch.org/en/Germans_from_Russia_Emigration_and_Immigration&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[reunification of Germany]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and declining conditions in Russia, many ethnic Germans still living in the lands of the former [[Soviet Union]] sought German [[repatriation]].

==United States: Volga Germans==
[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|280px|left|temporary quarters for Volga Germans in central Kansas, 1875]]
{{main|Volga Germans}}
Germans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals. About 100,000 [[Volga Germans]] immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota was known as "the German-Russian triangle". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.

The largest groups settled mainly in the [[Great Plains]]: [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Kansas]] and nearby areas in the US. Outside that area, they also settled in [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Fresno County]] in [[California's]] [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. They often succeeded in [[dryland farming]], which they had practiced in Russia. Many of the immigrants who arrived between 1870 and 1912 spent a period doing farm labor, especially in northeastern Colorado and in Montana along the lower [[Yellowstone River]] in [[sugar beet]] fields.

===Cities===
Other Volga Germans made new lives in the industrializing American cities, especially [[History of Chicago|Chicago]], which had an immense upsurge in immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] during this time.  Today Chicago has the largest number of ethnic Volga Germans in [[North America]]. The largest area of concentrated settlement was in [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]] on the city's [[Northwest Side, Chicago|Northwest Side]], mostly between the years 1907-1920. By 1930, 450 families of the Evangelical faith were living in this area, most of whom originated from ''Wiesenseite''.&lt;ref&gt;"German Russians in Chicagoland", ''Newsletter'', March 1995, American Historical Society of Germans from Russia&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the period of suburbanization, many of their descendants moved out to outlying areas such as [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]] and [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]].  A number of families living in the Jefferson Park central business district along Lawrence and [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]] have Volga German immigrant ancestors.
[[Image:Gateway Theatre (Chicago).jpg|thumb|right| During the first two decades of the 20th century, the Chicago neighborhood of [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]] was the point of initial settlement for many Volga German immigrants ]]

===Wheat===
[[Warkentin House|Bernhard Warkentin]] was born in a small Russian village in 1847, and travelled to America in his early twenties. Interested in flour mills, he was especially impressed with the wheat-growing possibilities in the United States. After visiting Kansas, Warkentin found the [[Great Plains]] much like those he had left behind. Settling in [[Harvey County]], he built a water mill on the banks of the [[Little Arkansas River]] – the Halstead Milling and Elevator Company. Warkentin's greatest contribution to Kansas was the introduction of hard Turkey Wheat into Kansas, which replaced the soft variety grown exclusively in the state.

===Culture===
Negatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the Tsar, the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had immigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities that retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and created choir groups that sang German church hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets—still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War I their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. 
[[File:0738 Regisseur Ed Ehrenberg beim Dreh zu - Als der Tod ins Leben wuchs - im Volksmuseum von Sanok.jpg|thumb|260px|Actors from Germany in film "Als der Tod ins Leben wuchs" of Sebastian Ed Erhenberg as Volga Germans, [[Sanok]] 2013]]
By the end of the World War II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia sometimes use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake, although the word is primarily used for the sweet bread dessert made in a pie plate with topping like fruits or cottage cheese. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct and has left a lasting impression on the American West.&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn B. Robinson, ''History of North Dakota'' (1966) pp. 285-87, 557; Gordon L. Iseminger, "Are We Germans, or Russians, or Americans? The McIntosh County German-Russians During World War I", ''North Dakota History'' 1992 59(2): 2-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
During the 1970s, Dr. Kenneth Rock, a professor of history at [[Colorado State University]], collected sixty oral histories of German Russian immigrants and their descendants as part of the "Germans from Russia in Colorado" Study Project.  It documented life in the ethnic German communities in Russia, the immigration experience, work and social life in the United States, and interaction between the German-Russian communities and the wider society in both Russia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.colostate.edu/gfr/index.html |title=Germans from Russia: On the Trail to Colorado |accessdate=2007-10-08 |publisher=Colorado State University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one million descendants of Germans from Russia live in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/european/imde/germchro.html Chronology: The Germans in America (European Reading Room, Library of Congress)]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern descendants in Canada and the United States refer to their heritage as ''Germans from Russia'', ''Russian Germans'', ''Volgadeutsch'' or ''Black Sea Germans.'' In many parts of the United States, they tend to have blended to a large degree with the "regular" [[German American]]s who are much more numerous in the northern half of the United States.

==Canada==

===Background===
In addition to the large population of Volga Germans that settled on the American prairie, many also settled in the Canadian West. Beginning in the early 1870s, the Canadian Government had created promotional programs in Europe to entice settlers to the largely unsettled western areas, in what would become Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia.&lt;ref name="HEIER"&gt;HEIER, EDMUND. “The Immigration of the Russo-German Catholics and Lutherans into Canada.” Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue Canadienne Des Slavistes 4 (January 1, 1959): 160–175. doi:10.2307/40866073.
&lt;/ref&gt; Public policy also served to attract immigration following the passage of the [[Dominion Lands Act|Land Act of 1872]], which provided free grants of homesteads to those who settled on the Western Prairie.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt;  In the early twentieth century, many immigrants moved from the United States to Canada in search of inexpensive land, and still greater social autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Victor. “Rußlanddeutsche in Der Kanadischen Präire.” Globus Spezial (n.d.): 191–192.
&lt;/ref&gt;  These German-American immigrants brought not only their experience working on the American plains, but had also accrued wealth, giving a much needed boost to the economy of the Western Provinces.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt;

===1875-1918===
The Volga Germans that flocked to Canada in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from different religious backgrounds including [[Lutheran]], [[Catholic]], and [[Mennonite]]. It was this last group, named after leader Menno Simons, that constituted the largest portion of the immigrant population. In Russia they had proven the best organized, preparing scouting parties to investigate the prospect of immigration to Canada and the United States. These scouts had been reliant on the assistance of established Mennonite groups such as those found in [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], and Ontario.  In the period 1873-1879, Mennonites formed blocked settlements in Manitoba with a total of close to 7000 members. Most settled in Southern Manitoba in the richest part of the [[Red River Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, J. H. “The Canadianization of the Immigrant Settler.” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 107 (May 1, 1923): 45–49. doi:10.2307/1014693.
&lt;/ref&gt; These communities were centered around religious homogeneity, and insistence on the tenets of adult baptism, and the refusal to bear arms or swear an oath.&lt;ref name="Moelleken, Wolfgang W. 1967"&gt;Moelleken, Wolfgang W. “Diaphonic Correspondences in the Low German of Mennonites from the Fraser Valley, British Columbia.” Zeitschrift für Mundartforschung 34, no. 3/4 (December 1, 1967): 240–253. doi:10.2307/40500396.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mennonites had been propelled to leave because of the introduction of extended conscription, put in place in 1874, but set to take effect in Russia in 1881.

Many Volga Germans emigrated from the United States to the Western Provinces in the period 1890-1909. They sought to escape rising land prices, and imposition of laws that began to encroach on their relative autonomy. Canada was seen as a new frontier, a place of vast land, but little settlement.  These immigrants settled mainly in the colonies of St. Peter and St. Joseph, East and West of [[Saskatoon]] in Central Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt; In the 1890s, twelve Catholic families established Rastadt-Dorf, and another twenty-one settled Katherinetal. Additional settlements were begun in Davin, [[Kranau, Saskatchewan|Kronau]], and Speyer as well.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Alan B. “St. Joseph’s Colony, Katherinetal Colony, Kronau-Rastadt, and Odessa (1886-1904).” German Settlements in Saskatchewan: The Origin and Development of German Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, Mennonite, and Huttere Communities (n.d.).
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the World Wars===
In the period between World War I and World War II, conditions in Russia worsened, especially following the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] and the [[Russian famine of 1921|Great Famine of 1921]]. Many Volga Germans sought to leave the USSR, but faced opposition from a government that did not wish to see so large a portion of its population leave. The Russian government imposed a fee for obtaining a passport, which lead to protests as many would-be immigrants flooded the streets of Moscow.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt; Many Mennonites were eventually able to leave, and between the World Wars, over 20,000 left destined for Canada.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt;

Beginning in the second decade of the twentieth century, and continuing until several years after the Second World War, the ethnic background of the Volga Germans made them prey to discrimination. By 1914, Germany had become Canada's enemy, and the Volga Germans were not immune despite many families having not set foot in Germany for hundreds of years. This period saw the suppression of many German cultural customs, including the suppression of their print media, and the closure of German schools. The [[Wartime Elections Act]], passed in September 1917, revoked the citizenship of any German naturalized after March, 1902. Many settlements were renamed to disguise their obvious German origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/germans&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s period also saw the movement of Volga Germans within Western Canada as well. Many pushed further west, settling in [[British Columbia]].  The area had the appeal of a warmer climate, an escape from the frigid prairie. Other Volga Germans were propelled by economic factors such as the [[Great Depression]], which not only impoverished many, but also coincided with a tremendous drought ushering in crop failures. The economy of the Prairie Provinces, and much of Canada, was dependent on the success of wheat farming. Wheat had been a staple crop for the Volga Germans in Russia, and translated well to the climate of the Canadian West. Repeated crop failures meant a large influx of the German-Russian population into larger cities and towns, a fact that would contribute to the gradual decline of their culturally homogeneous communities. The prairie lands abutting the United States border experienced [[Dust Bowl]] conditions, which sent swarms of families to the coastal areas of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, Gerald (1987). The Canadian Prairies: A History (Student ed.). Toronto and London: University of Toronto Press. pp. 383–417.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period following World War II, new immigrants joined their families in British Columbia, congregating in the Fraser Valley, and Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;Goerz, H. “German Russians in British Columbia, Canada,” n.d.
&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-twentieth century brought immigrants from South American regions, namely [[German Argentine|Argentina]] and Brazil, as they fought to maintain their cultural autonomy in increasingly nationalist areas, dominated by nationalist leaders like [[Juan Perón]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Fred C. The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present. Penn State Press, 1978.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lutheran and Catholic Volga Germans were also significant migrants to Canada, but lacked the organization of their Mennonite brethren. Early on, these immigrants were more likely to settle in Saskatchewan, especially around the city of Regina.&lt;ref name="HEIER" /&gt; Despite their location near earlier Mennonite communities, settlements remained religiously homogenous.

===Legacy===
Throughout their history in the Canadian West, the Volga Germans have been able to maintain many of their cultural characteristics, including their dialect, proliferated through Saturday schools and Canadian policies that allowed for cultural freedom. These schools operated on Saturday mornings for around three hours, and became especially vital as the German language was no longer taught in the Canadian public school system after World War I. The Mennonites, unlike most Volga Germans, were able to maintain these schools even after World War II. The dialect of the Volga Germans was also maintained through the Church, especially in the Mennonite community.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi, Paul Robert. Encyclopedia of Canada’s Peoples. University of Toronto Press, 1999.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Volga Germans had left for North America they had been regarded as privileged colonists in Russia. When they arrived in the United States and Canada they found that they were treated the same as any other Eastern European migrant group.&lt;ref&gt;Kloberdanz, Timothy J. “The Volga Germans in Old Russia and in Western North America: Their Changing World View.” Anthropological Quarterly 48, no. 4 (October 1, 1975): 209–222. doi:10.2307/3316632.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Mennonites may be seen as an exception as they successfully used connections with their brethren in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ontario.&lt;ref name="Moelleken, Wolfgang W. 1967"/&gt; Through their hard work on the North American plains, they established themselves as a productive portion of Canadian and American society.

==Language ==
The Germans from Russia originally spoke German dialects such as the [[Palatine German language|Palatine dialect]] or Mennonite Low German (''[[Plautdietsch]]'') at home. Since the villages in Russia often were populated by settlers from a particular region and were isolated from Germany, they maintained their regional dialects. Depending on their specific dialect, Germans from Russia had difficulties understanding [[Standard German]], because German dialects in general differ greatly from the standard language. After emigrating from Russia to the Americas the Germans still spoke with their German dialects. In the 1950s it was still common for the children in the Dakotas to speak in English and the parents and grandparents to use German. Songs in church would be sung in two languages simultaneously.  Probably the person best known for having a "German from Russia accent" in English (a result of having learned English as a second language) was bandleader and television star [[Lawrence Welk]].

The '''''Haymarket Martyrs' Monument''''' is a funeral monument sculpture located at [[German Waldheim Cemetery|Forest Home Cemetery]] in [[Forest Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. Dedicated in 1893, it commemorates the defendants involved in the labor unrest and bombing related to the [[Haymarket Affair]] (1886). On February 18, 1997, it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==History==
Following the Haymarket affair, trial and executions, [[August Spies]], [[Adolph Fischer]], [[George Engel]], [[Louis Lingg]], and [[Albert Parsons]] were buried at the German Waldheim Cemetery (later merged with Forest Home Cemetery).

The Pioneer Aid and Support Association organized a subscription for a funeral monument. In 1893, the ''Haymarket Martyrs' Monument'' by sculptor [[Albert Weinert]] was raised at Waldheim. It consists of a 16-foot-high granite shaft capped by a carved triangular stone.  There is a two step base, which also supports a monumental figure of a woman standing over the body of a fallen worker, both in bronze.  It was dedicated on June 25, 1893, after a march from Chicago. The inscription on the steps read, "1887," the year of the executions. Also, there is a quote attributed to Spies, recorded just before his execution by hanging: "The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you are throttling today."

On the back of the monument are listed the names of the men.  On the top of the monument, a bronze plaque contains text of the pardon later issued by Illinois governor [[John Peter Altgeld]]&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus" /&gt;

The dedication ceremony was attended by 8,000, with union flags and the American flag draped on the monument.  European unions and American organizations sent flowers to be placed.&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus" /&gt;  Many activists and labor leaders were subsequently buried nearby. [[Michael Schwab]] and [[Oscar Neebe]] were also buried at Waldheim when they died. [[Samuel Fielden]] is the only  Haymarket defendant who is not buried at Forest Home. For years, annual commemorations were held.

Since the 1970s, the [[Illinois Labor History Society]] has held the deed to the monument and been responsible for its maintenance and restoration. It conducts monthly guided tours of Forest Home Cemetery from May through October.

==Time capsule==
In October 2016, volunteers and scientists dug near the base of the monument, where they recovered a [[time capsule]] that had been buried under the cornerstone on November 6, 1892, during the monument's construction. The time capsule, which is {{convert|62|cm|in|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|30|cm|in|order=flip}} wide, was made of stone or concrete and capped in marble. According to a list in the records of the Pioneer Aid and Support Association, the time capsule contained newspaper articles, letters to and from the Haymarket defendants, and photographs of the men and their families.

==Early years==
The founding of the '''Council for Mutual Economic Assistance''' (also referred to as Comecon, CMEA, CEMA, or the Council) dates from a January 1949 communiqué agreed upon by the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] in [[Moscow]]. The communiqué announcing the event cited the refusal of these countries to "subordinate themselves to the dictates of the [[Marshall Plan]]" and their intention to resist the trade boycott imposed by "the United States, Britain and certain other countries of Western Europe" as the major factors contributing to the decision "to organize a more broadly based economic cooperation among the countries of the people's democracy and the USSR."

The precise reasons for Comecon's formation in the aftermath of [[World War II]] are quite complex, given the political and economic turmoil of that time. However, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s desire to enforce Soviet domination of the small states of Eastern Europe and to mollify some states that had expressed interest in the Marshall Plan were the primary factors in Comecon's formation. The stated purpose of the organization was to enable member states "to exchange economic experiences, extend technical aid to one another, and to render mutual assistance with respect to raw materials, foodstuffs, machines, equipment, etc."

During Comecon's early years (through 1955), its sessions were convened on an ''ad hoc'' basis. The organization lacked clear structure and operated without a charter until a decade after its founding. These loose arrangements reflected the limited goals of Comecon at the time and the character of the [[Marshall Plan]] (also governed by a loose structure), to which Comecon served as a response.

From 1949 to 1953, Comecon's function consisted primarily of redirecting commerce of member countries toward each other and introducing [[import replacement]] industries, thus making members economically more self-sufficient. Little was done to solve economic problems through a regional policy. This was a period, moreover, when their first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s, formulated along the [[Planned economy|Soviet model]], preoccupied the East European members. In the headlong pursuit of parallel [[industrialization]] strategies, East European governments turned their attention inward. Because of Stalin's distrust of [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] bodies, [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] ties with the Soviet Union quickly came to dominate the East European members' external relations. Each country dealt with the Soviets on a one-to-one basis by means of direct consultations with Moscow through local Soviet missions. Although reparations transfers (extracted by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and former Slovakia, who were [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis' allies]] during [[World War II]]) had been replaced by more normal trade relations, outstanding [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|reparations obligations]] were not halted until 1956. In these circumstances, there was scarcely need or scope for multilateral policies or institutions.

==Rediscovery of Comecon after Stalin's death==
After Stalin's death in 1953, however, new leaders and new approaches emerged in the countries of the region. The more industrialized and the more trade dependent of the East European countries (Czechoslovakia, [[East Germany]], and Poland) had belatedly recognized the need to adapt the Soviet [[Autarky|autarkic]] model to their own requirements. New approaches to foreign trade emerged during discussions of economic reform. Given their isolation from the rest of the world and the dominance of [[intrabloc]] trade in their external relations, interest in these countries inevitably centered on new forms of regional cooperation. For small, [[Planned economy|centrally planned economies]], this meant the need to develop a mechanism through which to coordinate investment and trade policies.

Instability in Eastern Europe and integration in Western Europe increased the desirability of regularizing intrabloc relations in a more elaborate institutional framework. The 1955 [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] and its implementing machinery reinforced political-military links. On the economic front, Comecon was rediscovered. The example of the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], which initiated the processes of West European economic integration, gave impetus and direction to Comecon's revival.

==Rapid growth in Comecon activity==
The years 1956 to 1963 witnessed the rapid growth of Comecon institutions and activities, especially after the 1959 Charter went into effect. Comecon, for example, launched a program to unify the [[electric power|electrical power]] systems of its member-states and in 1962 created the [[Central Dispatching Board]] to manage the unified system. The organization took similar steps to coordinate railroad and river transport. In 1963 a special bank, the [[International Bank for Economic Cooperation]], was created to facilitate financial settlements among members. In this period, Comecon also undertook a number of bilateral and multilateral investment projects. The most notable project led to the coordinated construction of the [[Druzhba pipeline|Druzhba oil pipeline]] for the transport and distribution of crude oil from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe. The joint [[Institute for Nuclear Research]], established in 1956, initiated cooperation in another area of long-term importance.

Parallel to these developments, the Soviet Union led efforts to coordinate the investment strategies of the members in the interest of a more rational pattern of regional specialization, increased productivity, and a more rapid overtaking of the capitalist economies. These efforts culminated in 1962 with the adoption at the 15th Council Session of the [[Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labor]]. Although the principles of specialization were generally favored by the more industrial, northern-tier states, the less developed East European countries were concerned that such specialization would lead to a concentration of industry in the already established centers and would thus thwart their own ambitious industrialization plans. Moreover, the increased economic interdependence that the Basic Principles called for had inevitable political connotations. The latter were reinforced in 1962 by articles and speeches by Soviet party leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] proposing a central Comecon planning organ to implement the Basic Principles and foreseeing the evolution of a "socialist commonwealth" based on a unified regional economy.

These proposals provoked strong and open reaction from Romania on the grounds of "sovereign equality" of members, as articulated most forcefully in the April 1964 Declaration of the Romanian Central Committee. Romania's opposition (combined with the more passive resistance of some other members) succeeded in forestalling supranational planning and reinforcing the interested-party provisions of the Charter. The institutional compromise was the creation of the Bureau for Integrated Planning, which was attached to the Executive Committee and limited to an advisory role on coordination of members' development plans. The Basic Principles, having lost their momentum, were superseded several years later by the Comprehensive Program.

==A lull and subsequent revitalization in the late 1960s==
After the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, the new Soviet leadership was preoccupied with internal matters, and the East European countries were themselves busy with programs of economic reform. A comparative lull in Comecon activities ensued, which lasted until well after the [[Prague Spring|1968 Soviet-led intervention in Czechoslovakia]]. By the end of the 1960s, Eastern Europe had been shaken by the 1968 events, and there was an obvious need to revitalize programs that would strengthen regional cohesion.

In the late 1960s, the question of how to proceed with plans for economic integration received considerable discussion in specialized journals and at international meetings of experts. Disillusioned by traditional instruments and concerned with the need to decentralize planning and management in their domestic economies, the reformers argued for the strengthening of market relations among Comecon states. The conservatives continued to stress the importance of planned approaches. If carried to a logical extreme, the latter would involve supranational planning of major aspects of members' economies and the inevitable loss of national autonomy over domestic investment policy. The old conflict between planned approaches to regional specialization and the principle of sovereign equality could not be avoided in any discussion of the mechanism for future cooperation.

==The Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration, 1971==
{{main|Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration}}
The controversy over supranational planning led to a compromise in the form of the 1971 Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration, which laid the guidelines for Comecon activity through 1990. The Comprehensive Program incorporated elements of both the market and the plan approaches. Following the market approach, the Comprehensive Program sought to strengthen the role of money, prices, and exchange rates in intra-Comecon relations and to encourage direct contacts among lower level economic entities in the member countries. At the same time, the Comprehensive Program called for more joint planning on a sectoral basis through interstate bodies that would coordinate members' activities in a given sector. New organs were also envisaged in the form of international associations that would engage in actual operations in a designated sector on behalf of the participating countries. Finally, the Comprehensive Program emphasized the need for multilateral projects to develop new regional sources of fuels, energy, and raw materials. Such projects were to be jointly planned, financed, and executed.

The Comprehensive Program introduced a new concept in relations among members: "socialist economic integration." Section I, Paragraph 2 of the Comprehensive Program refers to the need "to intensify and improve" cooperation among members and "to develop socialist economic integration." This phrasing, which has since become standard, implies that the latter is a new and higher level of interaction, "a process of the international socialist division of labor, the drawing closer of [member states'] economies and the formation of modern, highly effective national economic structures." The Comprehensive Program avoids, however, the suggestion of ultimate fusion of members' economies that had been contained in the 1962 Basic Principles. It sets limits to the integrative process in the following terms: "Socialist economic integration is completely voluntary and does not involve the creation of supranational bodies."

The term integration had formerly been used to designate the activities of Western regional organizations such as the [[European Economic Community]]. Its new usage in the Comprehensive Program suggested parity of status between Comecon and the EEC. Under subsequent amendments to its Charter, the competence of Comecon to deal with other international organizations and third countries on behalf of its members was made clear. Comecon sought to attract the participation of developing countries in its activities. The language of the Comprehensive Program may thus also be regarded as an attempt to revitalize the image of Comecon in order to make association with it an attractive alternative to associated status with the EEC.

Comecon members adopted the Comprehensive Program at a time when they were actively developing economic relations with the rest of the world, especially with the industrialized Western economies. The Comprehensive Program viewed the two sets of policies as complementary and affirmed that "because the international socialist division of labor is effected with due account taken of the world division of labor, the Comecon member countries shall continue to develop economic, scientific, and technological ties with other countries, irrespective of their social and political system."

In the years following the adoption of the Comprehensive Program, Comecon made some progress toward strengthening market relations among members. The Comprehensive Program's objectives proved somewhat inconsistent with the predominant trends within members' economies in the 1970s, which was a period of recentralization — rather than decentralization — of domestic systems of planning and management. The major exception to this lack of progress lay in the area of intra-Comecon pricing and payment, where the expansion of relations with the West contributed to the adoption of prices and extra-plan settlements closer to international norms. Achievements under the Comprehensive Program have fallen under the heading of planned approaches, especially in the area of joint resource development projects. A second Comecon bank, the [[International Investment Bank]], was established in 1970 to provide a mechanism for the joint financing of such projects. In 1973 Comecon decided to draw up a general plan incorporating these measures. A number of projects formulated in the years immediately following adoption of the Comprehensive Program were then assembled in a document signed at the 29th Council Session in 1975. Entitled the "[[Concerted Plan for Multilateral Integration Measures]]," the document covered the 1976-80 five-year-plan period and was proclaimed as the first general plan for the Comecon economies. The joint projects included in the plan were largely completed in the course of the plan period.

A second major initiative toward implementation of the Comprehensive Program came in 1976 at the 30th Council Session, when a decision was made to draw up Long-Term Target Programs for Cooperation in major economic sectors and subsectors. The session designated a number of objectives to which target programs would be directed: "guarantee of the economically based requirements of Comecon member countries for basic kinds of energy, fuels, and raw materials; the development of the machine-building industries on the basis of intense specialization and cooperation in production; the fulfillment of national demands for basic foodstuffs and industrial consumer goods; and modernization and development of transport links among member countries." The 32d Council Session, held in 1978, approved target programs for cooperation through 1990 in the first two areas, as well as in agriculture and the food industries. These programs established the commitments to multilateral cooperation that member countries were to take into account when drawing up their five-year plans for the 1980s.

By the end of the 1970s, with the exception of Poland's agricultural sector, the economic sectors of all Comecon countries had converted to the socialist system. Member states had restructured their economies to emphasize industry, transportation, communications, and material and technical supply, and they had decreased the share of resources devoted to agricultural development. Within industry, member states devoted additional funds to machine building and production of chemicals. Socialist economic integration resulted in the production of goods capable of competing on the world market.

==The 1980s==
Most Comecon countries ended their 1981-85 five-year plans with decreased extensive economic development, increased expenses for fuel and raw materials, and decreased dependency on [[Western World|the West]] for both credit and hard currency imports. In the early 1980s, external economic relations had greater impact on the Comecon countries than ever before. When extending credit to East European countries, Western creditors did so assuming that the Soviet Union would offer financial assistance in the event that payment difficulties arose. This principle, which has always been rejected in the [[East bloc]], proved inoperable in the aftermath of the [[Polish crisis]] of 1979-82. The sharp rise in interest rates in the West put the Polish debt at an excessively high level, beyond the amount that the Soviet Union could cover. The resulting liquidity shortage that occurred in all Comecon countries in 1981 forced them to reduce hard-currency imports.

In the 1980s, high interest rates and the increased value of the United States dollar on international markets made debt servicing more expensive. Thus, reducing indebtedness to the West also became a top priority within Comecon. From 1981 to 1985, the European countries of Comecon attempted to promote the faster growth of exports over imports and sought to strengthen intraregional trade, build up an increased trade surplus, and decrease indebtedness to Western countries.

In the 1980s, Comecon sessions were held on their regular annual schedule. The two most notable meetings were the special sessions called in June 1984 and December 1985. The first summit-level meeting of Comecon member states in fifteen years was held with much fanfare on June 12–14 June 1984, in Moscow (the 23d "Special" Session of Comecon Member Countries). The meeting was held to discuss coordination of economic strategy and long-term goals in view of the "differing perspectives and contrary interests" that had developed among Comecon members since 1969. More specifically, the two fundamental objectives of the meeting were to strengthen unity among members and establish a closer connection between the production base, scientific and technological progress, and capital construction. However, despite the introduction of proposals for improving efficiency and cooperation in six key areas, Western and some Eastern analysts claimed that the meeting was anticlimactic and even a failure.

The ideas and results of the June 14 session were elaborated at the Extraordinary 41st Council Session, which was held on December 17–18, 1985, in Moscow. The meeting was heralded in the Comecon community as "one of the more memorable events in Comecon history." This special session featured the culmination of several years of work on the new Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress up to the Year 2000. It aimed to create "a firm base for working out an agreed, and in some areas, unified scientific and technical policy and the practical implementation, in the common interest, of higher achievements in science and technology."

The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress up to the Year 2000 was originally to be ratified in 1986, but the Soviets advocated an earlier date of completion to enable the Comecon countries to incorporate their commitments to implement the program in their next five-year plans (which started in January 1986). The program laid out sizable tasks in five key areas: [[electronics]], [[automation systems]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], development of new [[materials science|materials]], and [[biotechnology]]. It sought to restructure and modernize the member states' economies to counteract constraints on labor and material supplies. The need to move to intensive production techniques within Comecon was evident from the fact that from 1961 to 1984 the overall material intensiveness of production did not improve substantially. The 1985 program provided a general framework for Comecon's new direction of development. Details were to be settled in bilateral agreements.

== The fall of Communism and the end of Comecon ==
With the end of Communism in Eastern Europe, Comecon ceased to exist on June 28, 1991.

[[Denmark]] is primarily a transit and destination country for women and children from [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]], [[Eastern Europe|East]] and [[Central Europe]], [[Nigeria]], [[Thailand]], and [[South America]] subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically [[forced prostitution]]. There was one report last year{{clarify|reason="last year" compared to what? Most of this article appear to be based on ref from 2010|date=December 2017}} of a male teenager from Nigeria rescued from the commercial sex trade in Denmark. The government did not report any cases of forced labor during the reporting period, though the Danish Anti-Trafficking Center highlighted that workers in domestic service, restaurants, hotels, factories, and agriculture, may be vulnerable to forced labor in Denmark. There were unconfirmed reports of foreign children being forced to engage in organized [[street crime]]. The government released a report in 2010 about increasing evidence that “[[au pair]]” organizations could be used as front companies for human trafficking. The hundreds of unaccompanied foreign minors who arrive in Denmark every year are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Denmark". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in their 2017 [[Trafficking in Persons Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
Denmark prohibits both sex and labor trafficking through Section 262 of its [[criminal code]]. Punishments prescribed for trafficking under section 262 extend up to eight years’ imprisonment, are sufficiently stringent, and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as [[rape]]. Police reported conducting a total of 44 human trafficking investigations during the reporting period. Using Section 262, the government prosecuted 25 people for sex trafficking and convicted 11 sex trafficking offenders in 2009. The government prosecuted additional alleged sex trafficking offenders under other statutes, such as [[Procuring (prostitution)|prostitution procurement]]. All 11 trafficking offenders convicted in 2009 served some time in prison; none received suspended sentences. Sentences for convicted trafficking offenders ranged from 5 to 42 months’ imprisonment. The [[Police of Denmark|Danish national police]] provided anti-trafficking training to all police precincts and new police recruits during the reporting period, and police leadership has taken a strategic approach to addressing the crime; however, the effectiveness of this training is still undetermined.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
Denmark sustained its victim assistance and protection efforts over the year. In addition to employing formal victim identification procedures, the government conducted a proactive victim identification outreach program, interviewing people in prostitution, as well as in prisons and asylum centers, in an attempt to identify and rescue trafficking victims. The government identified 54 victims during the reporting period, down from 72 identified the previous year.{{clarify|reason=When? Most of this article appears to be based on ref from 2010|date=December 2017}} The government offered medical, dental, psychological, and legal services, and in certain cases a stipend, to victims of trafficking during a 100-day reflection period – a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they considered whether to assist law enforcement. There were two government-funded crisis centers for female victims of violence, which accommodated women trafficking victims. There were no specific shelter facilities for male victims, but at least one government-funded NGO offered assistance to men. The government offered child trafficking victims additional social services and placement in shelters or foster care. No support is provided to adult or child foreign victims of trafficking in Denmark beyond the reflection period if asylum or residency is not granted.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government encouraged victims to assist in investigations of their traffickers, including by offering support of trained counselors during police interviews; however, many victims did not cooperate. It has been Danish NGOs’ experience that 100 days is often not enough time for victims to develop sufficient trust in local authorities to disclose details of their trafficking experience. In addition, after the reflection period and trial process, victims of trafficking are most often deported to their country of origin, where authorities may not be able to provide protection. Trafficking victims were eligible to apply for asylum as an alternative to their removal to countries in which they would face retribution or hardship. This year, six people were determined by the [[Danish Immigration Service]] to be victims of trafficking and had asylum cases pending during the reporting period; one victim from 2008 was granted asylum in 2009. Police acknowledged factors preventing victims’ cooperation with police, including fear of reprisal from traffickers and the knowledge they were going back to their home country. Denmark sustained partnerships with IOM and NGOs in victims’ countries of origin to facilitate safe repatriation. The government provided foreign unaccompanied minors, regardless of whether or not they were suspected victims of trafficking, with a representative to assist with asylum applications or repatriation; however, it was documented that some children were placed in police custody for arriving with forged documents, a crime often occurring as a direct result of being trafficked. Danish victim advocates reported that Danish police generally respected the rights of victims, but claimed victims have been prosecuted for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
While there is currently no nationwide government-sponsored anti-trafficking awareness campaign focused on all forms of trafficking, the government continued a campaign begun in 2008 called “Who Pays the Price?” to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, which may be linked to sex trafficking. The government had an anti-trafficking action plan, and the government produced an annual status report monitoring the previous year’s developments related to the plan. The government forged anti-trafficking partnerships through its funding of anti-trafficking programs in [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Moldova]]. Danish authorities sustained partnerships with [[Scandinavian Airlines]], the Association of Danish Travel Agents, and [[Save the Children]] to disseminate public service announcements against child sex tourism. Denmark established a hotline for trafficking victims and one for information about suspected child sex tourism overseas. The government did not report any prosecutions of its citizens for child sex tourism during the reporting period. The [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]] provided training on human trafficking to all soldiers prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Japhug''' is a [[Rgyalrong languages|Rgyalrong]] language spoken in [[Barkam County]], [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture|Rngaba]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]], in the three [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|townships]] of Gdong-brgyad ({{zh|s=龙尔甲|p=Lóng'rjiǎ}}, Japhug {{IPA-all|ʁdɯrɟɤt}}), Gsar-rdzong ({{zh|s=沙尔宗|p=Shā'rzōng}}, Japhug {{IPA-all|sarndzu}}) and Da-tshang ({{zh|s=大藏|p=Dàzàng}}, Japhug {{IPA-all|tatsʰi}}).

The [[endonym]] of the Japhug language is {{IPA-all|kɯrɯ skɤt}}.  The name Japhug {{IPA-all|tɕɤpʰɯ}} ({{zh|p=Chábǎo|s=茶堡}}) refers in Japhug to the area comprising Gsar-rdzong and Da-tshang, while that of Gdong-brgyad is also known as {{IPA-all|sɤŋu}} (Jacques 2004), but speakers of Situ Rgyalrong use this name to refer to the whole Japhug-speaking area.

== Phonology==

Japhug is the only toneless Rgyalrong language. It has 49 consonants and seven vowels.

The phoneme /w/ has the allophones [β] and [f].

The phoneme {{IPAslink|ʁ}} is realized as an [[Voiced epiglottal fricative|epiglottal fricative]] in the coda or preceding another consonant.

The [[prenasalized consonant]]s are analyzed as units for two reasons. First, there is a phoneme /ɴɢ/, as in /ɴɢoɕna/ "large spider", but neither /ɴ/ nor /ɢ/ exist as independent phonemes. Second, there are clusters of fricatives and prenasalized voiced stops, as in /ʑmbri/ "[[Salix magnifica|willow]]", but never clusters of fricatives and prenasalized voiceless stops.

Japhug distinguishes between palatal plosives and velar plosive + j sequences, as in /co/ "valley" vs. /kjo/ "drag". These both contrast with alveolo-palatal affricates.

There are at least 339 consonant clusters in Japhug (Jacques 2008:29), more than in [[Old Tibetan]] or in most [[Indo-European languages]]. Some of these clusters are typologically unusual: in addition to the previously mentioned clusters of fricatives and prenasalized stops, there are clusters where the first element as a semivowel, as in /jla/ "[[dzo|hybrid of a yak and a cow]]".

=== Vowels ===
Japhug has eight vowel phonemes: {{IPA link|a}}, {{IPA link|o}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|ɤ}}, {{IPA link|ɯ}}, {{IPA link|y}}, {{IPA link|e}} and {{IPA link|i}}. The vowel {{IPA link|y}} is attested in only one native word ({{IPA|/qaɟy/}} "fish") and its derivatives, but appears in Chinese loanwords.

== Grammar ==
Jacques (2008) is a short grammar and Jacques and Chen (2010) a text collection with interlinear glosses. Other studies on morphosyntax include Jacques (2010) on [[Direct–inverse language|Direct–inverse]] marking, Jacques (2012a) on valency ([[passive voice|passive]], [[antipassive voice|antipassive]], [[anticausative verb|anticausative]], [[lability]] etc.), Jacques (2012b) on [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] and Jacques (2013) on [[associated motion]].

'''John S.

==Early life==
John Watts, a.k.a. '''John Boy''' was the eldest of eight children living is [[South Los Angeles|South Central]], [[Los Angeles, California]].  After his father refused to work, the family was forced to look into welfare as a means of support. In 1970, when John Watts was 12 years of age, he found himself hustling on the streets to help provide additional food for his mother and his younger siblings.

In 1978 he formed a dancing group called The Robot Brothers that consisted of his two youngest brothers and himself.  They performed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' hosted by [[Bill Cosby]] and even ''[[The Gong Show]]''.  Their performances generated enough money to help keep a roof over their head and food on the table, but in 1981 his brother Chris decided to leave the group and joined [[Crips]], a notorious street gang in Los Angeles. Chris' departure ended the group.

Soon after, John Watts found himself needing to generate income. The easy way was to make a quick entry and exit into the drug game.  John stole three hundred dollars from his mother's rent money and used it to purchase 3 grams worth cocaine from a local drug dealer.  A few months later John rented a small one-bed apartment in L.A.'s Westside and turned into a Crack House.  Nine months and two million dollars later he stopped and walked away from the drug dealing business.  He moved his mother into a home he purchased in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Hills California.

Watt's desire to leave the drug dealing world was evident.  In 1985 he opened a hair salon in [[Inglewood, California]], his first legitimate business venture.  His business venture came to an end when his salon later caught on fire and burned to the ground closing his business.  Being determined not to give up, John Watts took his $133,000 insurance settlement and used it to open his second business which was a club in [[Marina del Ray, California|Marina Del Ray]] in 1986.  The club business was successful until 1988 when an individual was gunned down inside his establishment.  Customers started to stop coming to his establishment and once again John Watts found him losing money.

In 1988, Watt entered into a drug deal that went bad when he met with so-called drug dealer.  The deal was to purchase 225 kilos for $3.2M.  What he thought was a legitimate deal turned out to be a set up by the Lennox Sheriff's department.  John Watts was arrested and sentenced to six years in state prison.

After serving 33 months, John was released back the streets on March 29, 1991.  John, still determined to help support his family, opened up his own Home Health Care Agency in [[Culver City, California]].  After being in business for 13 months his business was closed after Medicare accused him over billing his them an estimated $5 million. On [[Labor Day]] 1994 the [[FBI]] served him with an indictment for [[Medicare fraud]] charges. On May 2, 2000, John was once again sentenced to 42 months in Federal Prison. He was also sentenced to 78 months for income [[Tax fraud|Tax Fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/tax/usaopress/2001/txdv01038.html |title=USAO/CDCA Press Release |publisher=Justice.gov |date=2001-02-27 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053433/http://www.justice.gov/tax/usaopress/2001/txdv01038.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While in prison John S. Watts Jr. wrote 39 books and once released from prison he wrote one additional book. In 2012 one of his best friends, [[Ice-T]] invested $20,000 into John S. Watts Jr. publishing company. He has also written six movie scripts, 21 business plans and ideas, and four reality shows. Currently, Watts has launched John Boy Entertainment which consists of three upcoming reality shows including 'Your Daddy Knows Best'  and 'Life After Prison'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Courtney |url=http://thegrio.com/2013/09/03/should-ex-convicts-be-the-next-stars-of-reality-tv/#.UiZ2B_p8R5I.email |title=Should ex-convicts be the next stars of reality TV? |publisher=theGrio |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Watts appeared on ''[[Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood]]'' with his daughter, Apple.

==Scope==
The ''Journal of Cosmology'' is an online publication website. The journal publishes original hypotheses and discoveries in [[cosmology]], [[astronomy]], [[astrobiology]], and [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[planetary science]]s. Contributions may cover multiple disciplines and sub-disciplines of [[biology]], [[geology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[extinction]], the [[origin of life|origin]] and [[evolution]] of life, [[panspermia]] and [[colonization of Mars|Martian colonization and exploration]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;

 |accessdate=2011-10-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, published papers present original hypotheses, reviews, commentary, and speculation. Also covered is analysis of similarities and differences between competing hypotheses ([[Big Bang]] vs [[Steady State theory]], [[panspermia]] vs [[abiogenesis]], etc.).&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

In June 2013, the journal launched a public invitation for theologians, theological ethicists and philosophers to contribute articles on "[[astro-theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://journalofcosmology.com/JOC22/theo2.pdf | title = Postmodern Astro-Theology, Cometary Panspermia, and the Polonnaruwa Meteorite : Astro-theology | accessdate = 2013-07-03 | first = Theodore, Jr. | last = Walker | date = 30 June 2013 | format = PDF | work = Journal of Cosmology | quote = The Journal of Cosmology is now inviting theologians, theological ethicists, philosophers, and other scholars to offer commentaries and articles concerning recent factual evidence of extraterrestrial microbial life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schild said he would interpret "any refusal to cooperate, no matter what the excuse" from ''Nature'' or ''Science'' as "vindication for the ''Journal of Cosmology'' and the Hoover paper, and an acknowledgment that the editorial policies of the ''Journal of Cosmology'' are beyond reproach".&lt;ref name="Schild2008" /&gt; They subsequently issued another statement in which they stood by their publication process and suggested that criticisms were "slander and histrionic tirades", and comparing their critics to "lunatics... unleashed to throw filth", suggesting that their own actions were part of a 2000-years struggle of science against religion. Since their critics had "refused to cooperate" in a review, they reaffirmed the study to be "beyond reproach".&lt;ref&gt;

===NASA lawsuit===
{{see also|Opportunity (rover)#2014}}
On January 17, 2014, NASA reported that a [[List of rocks on Mars|martian rock]], named "[[Opportunity (rover)#2014|Pinnacle Island]]", that was not in an [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'' rover]] image taken on Sol 3528, "mysteriously" appeared 13 days later in a similar image taken on Sol 3540. One possible explanation, presented by [[Steven Squyres]], [[principal investigator]] of the [[Mars Exploration Rover Mission]], was that the rover, in one of its turning motions, flicked the rock from a few feet away and into the new location.&lt;ref name="SPACE-20140117"&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Neill |first=Ian |title=Mystery Rock 'Appears' in Front of Mars Rover|url=http://www.space.com/24330-mars-rover-mystery-rock-appears.html |date=January 17, 2014 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=January 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140124"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Mars Rover Marks an Unexpected Anniversary With a Mysterious Discovery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/space/mars-rover-marks-an-unexpected-anniversary-with-a-mysterious-discovery.html |date=January 24, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=January 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the finding, Rhawn Joseph published an article in the ''Journal of Cosmology'' on January 17, 2014, concluding that the object is in fact a living organism resembling [[apothecia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Apothecia on Mars?

'''Kanara Catholic Association''' (KCA),  is one of the reputed cultural organisations of the [[Mangalorean Catholic]] community in India.

KCA's vision is to promote educational, spiritual and cultural activities. A scholarship corpus fund started in the 1960s, has facilitated financial assistance even to this day, to several deserving students of the Mangalorean Catholic Community in Bangalore.

KCA is a major contributor in terms of land and funds to the Konkan Samudai Bhavan (KSB), which is a state of the art building to help members of the Kanara Catholic Community. One of the major aims of the KSB is to provide highly subsidised accommodations for Catholic youth who come from the Konkan area to Bangalore in search of jobs or help in the early part of their careers. The KSB is also there to help the Kanara Catholic Community to host their cultural events and other events to ensure the progress of the community.

In a Landmark event, during the Annual General Body meeting of 2018, the Chief Postmaster General of Karnataka, Government of India, His Excellency, Dr. Charles Lobo, in the presence of members and the newly elected committee, released a stamp commemorating the Monti Fest Festival of the Mangalorean catholics, which is celebrated worldwide by the community on September 8th to honour the Virgin Mary and is connected to the Harvest festival which is also celebrated in India with great gusto.

==Background==
KCA Bangalore was started in 1955 thanks to the initiative of early residents Leo D'Silva, Public Notary and John D'Sa, who was later Chief Engineer of the Karnataka State Government Electricity Board and Capt. Dr. George Mathias - a well-known coffee planter. The early meetings were in the legendary Oorgaum House, the home of Rajpramukh PG D'Souza. Its mission was to promote cohesiveness and camaraderie within the community through social events, picnics and sports.  KCA  became a Registered body in 1988. The membership and Articles of Association were revised in 1994.

The Annual General Body Meeting of KCA has traditionally included a Church Service in Konkani, followed by lunch and entertainment. From 1993, an annual church service  for Departed Members, Thanksgiving Mass in April after Easter, and Montichefest Mass in September with well-organized liturgy and choir is always conducted without fail.  Cultural events have evolved  from modest social gatherings in the 1950s, which introduced a touch of culture with the colourful mando, to 1995, when a cultural troupe from Mangalore led by Bennet Pinto were invited to perform at the 40th Anniversary celebration of KCA at St. Germains School, Bangalore. Cultural programmes have become a rallying force to bring the community together to participate, have fellowship, celebrate and contribute to charity causes. From 2000 onwards, "Mango Showers" and later  [http://www.udayavani.com/english/news/mangaluru/198557/kanara-catholic-association-organises-‘mood-mangalorean’-bengaluru Mood Manglowrean] &lt;ref&gt;"Kanara Catholic Association Organises 'Mood Mangalorean' in Bengaluru", Udayavani Newspaper, English edition, 27 February 2107&lt;/ref&gt; have showcased  Mangalorean cultural heritage through skits, plays, music, dance and songs with large numbers of cultural events to promote the cohesion of the Mangalorean catholic community, which  has been decreasing in numbers  in India.

KCA also publishes a quarterly Newsletter called 'Khobar' from 1994. In 1995, the first Directory of Members was published.  A Land and Building Fund was instituted in 1985 to harness donations from the community for charitable causes, resulting in a plot of land purchased 10 years later. Raising funds for a building turned out to be a major hurdle. In 2016, through the herculean efforts of the Konkan Welfare Trust- a joint collaboration of KCA and KONCAB, and substantial assistance from many individual benefactors both in India and across the World,  a magnificent community building consisting of a hall and hostel called the Konkan Samudai Bhavan was completed.

A tradition is also the annual Thanksgiving Mass,  held every year, after Easter.  Donations and proceeds from this mass are given to other catholic organisations who cater to less privileged members of society.  In the last few years, donations from these masses have been given to  the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Leprosy Home at Sumanahally Bangalore, the home for AIDS patients on Sarjapur Road run by the Camillian Fathers, [http://www.owcbangalore.org/CharityArticles/AshaNiketan_2009-03.pdf Asha Niketan]&lt;ref&gt;"Asha Niketan- A home of Hope", Mona Patel-Sikora, The Rangoli, 3/2009, published in the OWC (Overseas Womens Club) of Bangalore&lt;/ref&gt; Koramangala a home for the intellectually disabled, part of the L'Arch communities started by Jean Vanier in France in 1970 and others

The KCA celebrated its golden jubilee in 2004-2005 under the stewardship of the first Lady President of KCA, Dr. Pat Pinto.

==Committee==

The KCA is run by an Honorary Committee which is elected by the AGM every year. Committee members are responsible for organising all the KCA events, with all the proceeds going to charity.

== History and business activities==
Legatum (meaning "legacy" or "gift"&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonspringer/2014/02/26/mits-legatum-center-unleashes-entrepreneurs-alters-thinking-about-developing-countries/ |title=MIT's Legatum Center Unleashes Entrepreneurs, Alters Thinking About Developing Countries |last1=Springer |first1=Jon |date=26 February 2014 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a private investment firm based in Dubai using only capital provided by members of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-10-09/news/27690734_1_intellecap-christopher-chandler-share-microfin |title=India offers opportunities for long-term investors |last1=Smith Alexander |first1=George |date=9 October 2007 |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legatum was founded in December 2006 in the [[United Arab Emirates]] by [[Christopher Chandler (businessman)|Christopher Chandler]], who made his fortune in markets undergoing political disruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-must-seize-the-opportunities-brexit-offers-or-remain-in-the-eu-ltlzzc923&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Chandler was the president of Sovereign Global, or Sovereign, which he co-founded with his brother [[Richard Chandler (businessman)|Richard Chandler]] in 1986. Sovereign invested capital in companies located in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining. The Chandler brothers embarked on separate ventures following the de-merger of Sovereign in 2006. Christopher Chandler established Legatum the following December.&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.fortune.com/2008/07/25/technology/kirkpatrick_brainstorm.fortune/index.htm |title=From Brainstorm: Our new $1 million prize, and more |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=David |date=25 July 2015 |publisher=Fortune Magazine |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Legatum transitioned to a partnership, consisting of Christopher Chandler, Mark Stoleson, Philip Vassiliou and Alan McCormick, providing a structure for the firm to continue operating beyond its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.difc.ae/public-register/legatum-limited |title=Legatum Limited |publisher=Dubai International Finance Centre |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Legatum purchased a building in the [[Dubai International Financial Centre]] for its global headquarters. The building was renamed Legatum Plaza, and the company moved into the building the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/legatum-buys-difcs-precinct-building-6 |title=Legatum buys DIFC's Precinct Building 6 |last1=Cronin |first1=Sean |date=11 April 2012 |publisher=The National |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Investments==
The firm's investment activities tend to focus on globally listed companies, markets in economic transition (such as [[Japan]] or [[China]]) or distressed situations.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/01/28/principles-before-profit-qa-with-legatum-group-ceo-mark-stoleson/ |title=Principles Before Profit: Q&amp;A With Legatum Group CEO Mark Stoleson |last1=Falconer |first1=Tim |date=28 January 2014 |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/22/globaleconomy.internationalaidanddevelopment |title=School aims to seed the world with business sense |last1=Clark |first1=Andrew |date=21 May 2008 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legatum was one of the first foreign commercial investors to identify the need to provide critical equity capital to for-profit microfinance organizations in India, investing $25 million for a majority stake in SHARE Microfinance, India's leading microfinance institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/O4qYXEPwYZwOEw3xTm611H/Dubais-Legatum-invests-Rs125-cr-in-Share-Microfin-picks-51.html |title=Dubai's Legatum invests Rs125 cr in Share Microfin, picks 51% stake |last1=Banerjee |first1= Gargi |date=16 May 2007 |publisher=[[LiveMint]] |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the company co-founded an early charity crowdfunding platform, Razoo Global Corporation, based in [[Alexandria, VA]]. The platform has raised US$550 million in crowdfunding since its foundation. It announced a management buy-out of Legatum's holding in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/05/100361-razoo-management-charity-crowdfunding-site-buys-founder-legatum/ |title= Razoo Management, a Charity Crowdfunding site, buys out founder Legatum&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Legatum purchased a significant minority stake in Intellecap, which provides business solutions to help support companies that are dedicated to social and environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vccircle.com/exclusive-aavishkaar-buys-back-intellecap-stake-from-legatum-ventures/ |title=Exclusive: Aavishkaar buys back Intellecap stake from Legatum Ventures |last1=Roy |first1= Debjyoti |date=27 July 2017 |publisher=News Corp|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, Legatum and [[Omidyar Network]], a philanthropic investment firm founded by [[Pierre Omidyar]], collaborated to co-invest a total of $40 million into Unitus Equity Fund II (now known as Elevar Equity). The fund is a commercial venture providing capital to businesses in the developing world targeted at serving the poor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.omidyar.com/news/legatum-and-omidyar-network-invest-40-million-anchors-unitus-equity-fund-ii-landmark-private&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Support to other entities and programs==
As of 2014, Legatum had invested around US$80 million in 1,440 projects in 107 countries.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/01/28/principles-before-profit-qa-with-legatum-group-ceo-mark-stoleson/ |title=Principles Before Profit: Q&amp;A With Legatum Group CEO Mark Stoleson |last1=Falconer |first1=Tim |date=28 January 2014 |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legatum focuses on three core areas of philanthropic investment: development, entrepreneurship, and policy innovation.

===Development===
Legatum Foundation is the development arm of Legatum and invests in community-based organizations and projects around the world to help the poorest and most marginalized people in society. In 2015, Legatum established the Luminos Fund, a private donor philanthropic fund designed to develop and scale initiatives which help out-of-school children get back to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genevaglobal.com/blog/programs-stay-same-fail-same |title=Programs That Stay The Same, Fail The Same |last=Jack |first=Andrew |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legatum founded the END Fund in 2012 to co-ordinate and support programmes to treat [[neglected tropical diseases]], which affects over 1.5 billion people globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.devex.com/organizations/the-end-fund-54275 |title=The END Fund |publisher=Devex |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/aac0d518-0266-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12 |title=Philanthropy: the search for the best way to give |last=Barasa |first=Louise Makau |date=19 August 2015 |publisher=Geneva Global |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.devex.com/news/strides-in-progress-on-neglected-tropical-diseases-as-global-partners-meet-89666 |title=Strides in progress on Neglected Tropical Diseases as global partners meet |last=Cheney |first=Catherine |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=Devex |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, in partnership with Humanity United and [[Walk Free Foundation|Walk Free]], Legatum established a $100 million fund called the [[Freedom Fund]]. The aim of the fund is to help eradicate [[Modern slavery|modern day slavery]], an illegal industry that generates over $32 billion in profits every year around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.devex.com/news/strides-in-progress-on-neglected-tropical-diseases-as-global-partners-meet-89666 |title=Strides in progress on Neglected Tropical Diseases as global partners meet |last=Cheney |first=Catherine |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=Devex |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/freedom-fund-galvanizing-resources-end-slavery |title=The Freedom Fund: Galvanizing Resources to End Slavery |publisher=Clinton Foundation |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropys-Bid-to-End/231279 |title=Philanthropy's Bid to End Slavery in the Modern Age |last=Lindsay |first=Drew |date=6 July 2015 |publisher=Philanthropy |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Entrepreneurship===
In 2007, Legatum established '''The Legatum Center for Entrepreneurship''' at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology| MIT]] with the aim to create a generation of business leaders in developing countries by providing them with the skills needed to succeed as entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/world/middleeast/18briefs-CENTER.html?_r=0 |title=Dubai: M.I.T.

Legatum established the annual '''Africa Awards for Entrepreneurship''' program which recognizes and rewards business leaders who serve as role models to Africa's aspiring entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awpnetwork.com/2013/06/18/2013-africa-awards-for-entrepreneurship/ |title=2013 Africa Awards for Entrepreneurship |date=18 June 2013 |publisher=AWP Network |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been in operation since 2007 and is now run by the '''African Leadership Network''', with Legatum still involved as a lead sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/2013-africa-awards-for-entrepreneurship/ |title=2013 Africa Awards for Entrepreneurship |date=7 September 2013 |publisher=OFA |accessdate=11 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423120830/http://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/2013-africa-awards-for-entrepreneurship/ |archivedate=23 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Legatum partnered with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine to announce the Legatum Fortune Technology Prize, a $1 million award intended to reward for-profit businesses who provide products and services to the needy through the use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.fortune.com/2008/07/25/technology/kirkpatrick_brainstorm.fortune/index.htm |title=From Brainstorm: Our new $1 million prize, and more |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=David |date=25 July 2015 |publisher=Fortune Magazine |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, the Center had launched over 20 enterprises across 40 countries. The Legatum fellows have pursued businesses that tackle social issues such as improving sanitation by converting waste products into fertilizer in Kenya, establishing plastic recycling businesses in Nigeria, and improving the apparel industry's conditions in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt;

'''Malays''' ({{lang-ms|Orang Melayu}}, [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: أورڠ ملايو) are an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[ethnic group]] that predominantly inhabit the [[Malay Peninsula]], eastern [[Sumatra]] and coastal [[Borneo]], as well as the smaller islands which lie between these locations — areas that are collectively known as the [[Malay world]]. These locations today are part of the modern nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, and southern Thailand.

There is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking Austronesians and [[Austroasiatic]] tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnard 2004 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&amp;60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a [[Malayness]] – the religion of [[Islam]], the [[Malay language]] and traditions – are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Malay as a major  [[ethnoreligious group]] in the region.{{sfn|Melayu Online|2005}} In literature, architecture, [[Malay cuisine|culinary traditions]], traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the [[Malay sultanate]]s in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the [[Batak]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Orang Asli]] and the [[Orang laut]] become subject to [[Islamisation]] and [[Malayisation]].{{sfn|Milner|2010|pp=200, 232}}  Today, some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as ''anak dagang'' ("traders") and who predominantly consist of [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Bugis]],  [[Minangkabau people]] and [[Acehnese people]]s, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.{{sfn|Milner|2010|p=10 &amp; 185}}

Throughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=7, 32, 33 &amp; 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; They [[Trans-cultural diffusion|absorbed]], [[Intercultural communication principles|shared]] and [[Cultural learning|transmitted]] numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree [[Javanese culture]]; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture. Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related [[Betawi people|Betawi]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Cape Malay]], [[Cocos Malays]] and [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sri Lankan Malay]] cultures, as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like [[Ambonese Malay]], [[Baba Malay]], the [[Betawi language]] and [[Manado Malay]].

==Etymology==
[[File:JogetUNISEL.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Joget]] dance from the [[Malacca Sultanate]]; many aspects of Malay culture are derived from the Malaccan court.]]
The epic literature, the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', associates the etymological origin of "Melayu" to ''Sungai Melayu'' ('Melayu river') in [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. The term is thought to be derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''melaju'', a combination of the verbal [[prefix]] 'me' and the [[root word]] 'laju', meaning "to accelerate", used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid Melebek|Amat Juhari Moain|2006|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Melayu" as an [[ethnonym]], to allude to a clearly different ethnological cluster, is assumed to have been made fashionable throughout the integration of the Malacca Sultanate as a regional power in the 15th century. It was applied to report the social partialities of the Malaccans as opposed to foreigners as of the similar area, especially the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Thai people|Thais]]{{sfn|Barnard|2004|p=4}} This is evidenced from the early 16th century Malay word-list by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] who joined the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan's circumnavigation]], that made a reference to how the phrase ''chiara Malaiu'' ('Malay ways') was used in the [[maritime Southeast Asia]], to refer to the ''al parlare de Malaea'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "to speak of Malacca").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term "Malay" was adopted via the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word Malayo, itself derived from {{lang-pt|Malaio}}, which originates from the original Malay word, Melayu.
[[File:Candi Tinggi.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in [[Jambi]], historically linked to the pre-Islamic [[Melayu Kingdom]].]]
Prior to the 15th century, the term "Melayu" and its similar-sounding variants appear to apply as an old [[toponym]] to the [[Strait of Malacca]] region in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tengku Abd Aziz Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah.jpg|thumb|Tengku Abd Aziz, the Prince of [[Terengganu]] in a classical formal Malay attire. (c. 1920)]]
* '''''Malaya Dwipa''''', "Malaya [[Dvipa]]", is described in chapter 48, [[Vayu Purana]] as one of the provinces in the eastern sea that was full of gold and silver. Some scholars equate the term with [[Sumatra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deka|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several Indian scholars believe the term should refer to the mountainous [[Malay peninsula]], while Sumatra is more correctly associated with [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pande|2005|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gopal|2000|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahir|1995|p=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mukerjee|1984|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarkar|1970|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Maleu-kolon''''' - a location in the [[Golden Chersonese]], from [[Ptolemy]]'s work, [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerini|1974|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Mo-lo-yu''''' - mentioned by [[I Ching (monk)|Yijing]], a [[Tang dynasty]] [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] monk who visited the Southeast Asia in 688–695. According to Yijing, the ''Mo-Lo-Yu'' kingdom was located at a distance of 15 days sailing from Bogha ([[Palembang]]), the capital of Sribhoga ([[Srivijaya]]). It took a 15-day sail as well to reach Ka-Cha ([[Kedah]]) from Mo-lo-yu; therefore, it can be reasoned that Mo-Lo-Yu would lie halfway between the two places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|I Ching|2005|p=xl-xli}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory relates ''Mo-Lo-Yu'' with the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Jambi]] in Sumatra,&lt;ref name="Melayu Online 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Melayu Online|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the geographical location of Jambi contradicts with Yi Jing's description of a "half way sail between ''Ka-Cha'' (Kedah) and ''Bogha'' (Palembang)". In the later [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368) and [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), the word ''Ma-La-Yu'' was mentioned often in Chinese historical texts - with changes in spelling due to the time span between the dynasties - to refer to a nation near the southern sea. Among the terms used was "Bok-la-yu", "Mok-la-yu" (木剌由), Ma-li-yu-er (麻里予兒), Oo-lai-yu (巫来由) - traced from the written source of monk [[Xuanzang]]), and Wu-lai-yu (無来由).
* '''''Malayur''''' - inscribed on the south wall of the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. It was described as a kingdom that had "a strong mountain for its rampart" in Malay peninsula, that fell to the Chola invaders during [[Rajendra Chola I]]'s campaign in the 11th century.
* '''''Bhūmi Mālayu''''' - (literally "Land of Malayu"), a transcription from [[Padang Roco Inscription]] dated 1286&amp;nbsp;CE by Slamet Muljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muljana|1981|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with [[Dharmasraya]] kingdom.
* '''''Ma-li-yu-er''''' - mentioned in the chronicle of [[Yuan Dynasty]], referring to a nation of Malay peninsula that faced the southward expansion of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], during the reign of [[Ram Khamhaeng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guoxue|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle stated: "''..Animosity occurred between [[Thai people|Siam]] and Ma-li-yu-er with both killing each other&amp;nbsp;...''". In response to the Sukhothai's action, a Chinese envoy went to the Ram Khamhaeng's court in 1295 bearing an imperial decree: "Keep your promise and do no evil to Ma-li-yu-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1981|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Malauir''''' - mentioned in [[Marco Polo]]'s [[Travels of Marco Polo|account]] as a kingdom located in the Malay peninsula,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordier|2009|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2004|pp=364–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly similar to the one mentioned in Yuan chronicle.
* '''''Malayapura''''' - (literally "city of Malaya" or "fortress of Malaya"), inscribed on the [[Amoghapasa inscription]] dated 1347&amp;nbsp;CE. The term was used by [[Adityawarman]] to refer to [[Dharmasraya]].The word ''Malay'' refer to Mountain and Pura refer to Country in [[Pali Language]].

Other suggestions include the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word ''mlayu'' (to run) derived from ''mlaku'' (to walk or to travel), or the Malay term ''melaju'' (to steadily accelerate), referring to the high mobility and migratory nature of its people, however these suggestions remain as popular beliefs without corroborating evidence.

===Proto-Malay models===

{{Further2|[[Austronesian peoples#Prehistory and history|History of Austronesian peoples]], [[Austronesian languages#Homeland|Homeland of Austronesian languages]]}}
Also known as ''Melayu asli'' (aboriginal Malays) or ''Melayu purba'' (ancient Malays), the [[Proto-Malay]]s are of [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] origin and thought to have migrated to the [[Malay archipelago]] in a long series of migrations between 2500 and 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryan|1976|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Early History'', has pointed out a total of three theories of the origin of Malays:
* The [[Yunnan]] theory, [[Mekong]] river migration (published in 1889) - The theory of Proto-Malays originating from Yunnan is supported by R.H Geldern, J.H.C Kern, J.R Foster, J.R Logen, Slamet Muljana and Asmah Haji Omar. Other evidence that supports this theory include: stone tools found in the Malay Archipelago are analogous to Central Asian tools, the similarity of Malay customs and [[Assam]] customs.
* The seafarers(Sunda) theory (published in 1965) - The proto-Malays are believed to be seafarers knowledgeable in [[oceanography]] and possessing agricultural skills. They moved  great distances from island to island as far apart as modern day [[New Zealand]] and [[Madagascar]], and they served as navigation guides, crew and labour to Indian, Arab, Persian and Chinese traders for nearly 2000 years. Over the years they settled at various places and adopted various cultures and religions.
* The [[Taiwan]] theory (published in 1997) - The migration of a group of people from [[Southern China]] occurred 6,000 years ago, some moved to Taiwan (today's [[Taiwanese aborigines]] are their descendants), then to the [[Philippines]] and later to [[Borneo]] (roughly 4,500 years ago) (today's [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and other groups). These ancient people also split with some heading to [[Sulawesi]] and others progressing into [[Java]], and [[Sumatra]], all of which now speak languages that belong to the Austronesian Language family. The final migration was to the Malay Peninsula roughly 3,000 years ago. A sub-group from Borneo moved to Champa in modern-day Central and South Vietnam roughly 4,500 years ago. There are also traces of the [[Dong Son culture|Dong Son]] and [[Hoabinhian]] migration from Vietnam and Cambodia. All these groups share DNA and linguistic origins traceable to the island that is today Taiwan, and the ancestors of these ancient people are traceable to southern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deutero-Malays are [[Iron Age]] people descended partly from the subsequent [[Austronesian peoples]] who came equipped with more advanced farming techniques and new knowledge of metals.&lt;ref name="Murdock 1969 278"&gt;{{harvnb|Murdock|1969|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.at"&gt;https://books.google.at/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=mongoloids+in+southeast+asia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3YrTNe9cT_&amp;sig=di2zXCW-rWjgtPtsMGfHh7pAqto&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiO77fspcTcAhUlIMAKHcDACaQQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mongoloids%20in%20southeast%20asia&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.at"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/6/abstracts/anderbeck.html Karl Anderbeck, "Suku Batin - A Proto-Malay People?

====Expansion from Sundaland model====
A more recent theory holds that rather than being populated by expansion from the mainland, the [[Ice Age]] populations of the Malay peninsula, neighbouring Indonesian archipelago, and the then-exposed continental shelf ([[Sundaland]]) instead developed locally from the first human settlers and expanded to the mainland. Proponents of this theory hold that this expansion gives a far more parsimonious explanation of the linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence than earlier models, particularly the Taiwan model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncovering Southeast Asia's Past|last=Oppenheimer|first=Stephen|editor1-last=Bacas|editor1-first=Elizabeth A.|editor2-last=Glover|editor2-first=Ian C.|editor3-last=Pigott|editor3-first=Vincent C.|chapter=The 'Austronesian' Story and Farming-language Dispersals: Caveats on the Timing and Independence in Proxy Lines of Evidence from the Indo-European Model|pages=65–73|year=2006|publisher=NUS Press|location=Singapore|isbn=9971-69-351-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory also draws support from recent genetic evidence by [[Human Genome Organisation]] suggesting that the primary peopling of Asia occurred in a single migration through Southeast Asia; this route is held to be the modern Malay area and that the diversity in the area developed mainly in-place without requiring major migrations from the mainland. The expansion itself may have been driven by rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium |last2=Mahmood |first2=Ameen Abdulla |last3=Ikhlak |first3=Ahmed |title=Mapping Human Genetic Diversity in Asia |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5959 |pp=1541–5 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20007900 |doi=10.1126/science.1177074 |display-authors=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soares |first1=Pedro |last2=Trejaut |first2=Jean Alain |title=Climate Change and Postglacial Human Dispersals in Southeast Asia |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=1209–18 |date=June 2008 |publisher=Oxford Journals |pmid=18359946 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn068 |display-authors=1 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/6/1209.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponent [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] has further theorised that the expansion of peoples occurred in three rapid surges due to rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age, and that this diaspora spread the peoples and their associated cultures, myths, and technologies not just to mainland Southeast Asia, but as far as India, the Near East, and the Mediterranean. Reviewers have found his proposals for the original settlement and dispersal worthy of further study, but have been sceptical of his more [[diffusionist]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.news.yahoo.com/geneticist-clarifies-role-proto-malays-human-origin-041255953.html Geneticist clarifies role of Proto-Malays in human origin], [[Yahoo!

===Genetic analyses===
[[File:Gadispalembang.jpg|thumb|A [[Palembang]]ese Malay girl clad in her ''Gending Srivijaya'' traditional costume from [[South Sumatra]], Indonesia.]]
Studies on the genetics of modern Malays show a complex history of [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] of human populations. The analyses reveal that the Malays are genetically diverse, and that there are substantial variations between different populations of Malays. The differences may have arisen from geographical isolation and independent admixture that occurred over a long period. The studies indicate that there is no single representative genetic component, rather there are four major ancestral components to the Malay people: Austronesian, Proto-Malay, East Asian and South Asian.  The largest components of the genetic makeup of the Malays come from the Austronesian aborigines and Proto-Malays.&lt;ref name="science reports"/&gt; The Austronesian component is related to the Taiwanese [[Amis people|Ami]] and [[Atayal people|Atayal]] people, and genetic analyses of the Austronesian component in Southeast Asians may lend support to the "Out of Taiwan" hypothesis, although some suggest that it is largely indigenous with smaller contribution from Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Early Austronesians: into and out of Taiwan |authors=Albert Min-Shan Ko, Chung-Yu Chen, Qiaomei Fu, Frederick Delfin, Mingkun Li, Hung-Lin Chiu, Mark Stoneking, and Ying-Chin Ko |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=6 March 2014 |volume= 94|issue=3|pages= 426–436 | pmid=24607387 |pmc=3951936 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pedro A.

==History==

===Pre-Indian civilisation===
[[File:Bujang valley.jpg|thumb|The remains of an ancient folk temple in Bujang Valley. It was believed that the area was home to an early civilisation dating from 553 BC.]]
Deep in the pristine estuary of the [[Merbok|Merbok River]], lies an abundance of historical relics of the past. Ancient monumental ruins, buildings, temples, harbour and shipwrecks were all cloistered and entombed in the soil for two millenniums.&lt;ref name="Opalyn Mok 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Opalyn Mok|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its zenith, the massive settlement sprawled across a thousand kilometers wide, dominated in the northern plains of [[Malay Peninsular]].&lt;ref name="Pearson 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On contemporary account, the area is known as the lost city of Sungai Batu. Founded in 535 BC, it is among the oldest testament of [[civilisation]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and a potential progenitor of the [[Kedah Tua]] kingdom.

It was home to a resplendent society, deeply ingrained with culture, philosophy, religion and trade. The historical landscape of the area was binded to a flourishing iron industry, with archaeological findings unearthed various historical mines, warehouses, factories, a harbour; together with a vibrant plethora of superior-quality [[ores]], [[furnace]], [[slag]] and [[ingot]]s. Additionally, the peculiar [[Tuyere]] iron-[[smelting]] technique mobilised in Sungai Batu is hailed as oldest of its kind in the world. The produce was highly sought after and exported to various corners of the [[Old World]], including ancient [[India]], [[China]], [[Middle East]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Based on early [[Sanskrit]] reports, the area was known as "the iron bowl".&lt;ref name="Pearson 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement also narrated a glimpse of the ancient religious undertakings prior to the mass [[Greater India#Indianised kingdoms|Indianisation]] of the region. The early inhabitants of the [[Malay Archipelago]] was chronicled to be the adherence of indigenous [[animism]] and [[shamanism]]. The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as ''semangat''. The ''semangat'' has the governing power to richly blessed or mercilessly cursed the society, hence the spirit should always be pleased and entertained. In Sungai Batu, archaeological evidence unmasked several ceremonial and religious architectures devoted for the sun and mountain worshiping.&lt;ref name="Pearson 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Sungai Batu, the early Malay archipelago also witnessed the monumental development of other subsequent ancient large urban settlements and regional polities, driven by a predominantly cosmopolitan agrarian society, thriving skilled craftsmanship, multinational merchants and foreign expatriates. Chinese records noted the names of Akola, [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|P’an P’an]], Tun-Sun, [[History of Kedah|Chieh-ch'a]], [[Chi Tu|Ch'ih-tu]], among few. Upon the fifth century AD, these settlements had morphed into a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[city-states]], collectively fashioned by an active participation in the international trade network and hosting diplomatic embassies from China and India.&lt;ref name="Pearson 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian influence===
{{Further|Greater India}}
[[File:Malay Kingdoms en.svg|thumb|Early Malayic and pre-Malayic-speaking areas, classical kingdoms and urban settlements preceding the rise of Srivijaya in the 7th century and prior to the eastward [[Malayisation|Malay cultural expansion]] to the shores of Borneo. It also can be witnessed that the historical forebears of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]s, eastern [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] and Southern [[Thai people|Thai]]s were of Malay origin during this era.]]

There is no definite evidence which dates the first [[India]]n voyages across the [[Bay of Bengal]] but conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals on Malay shores at least 2,000 years ago. The discovery of jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to 110&amp;nbsp;CE in the [[Bujang Valley]], shows that a maritime trading route with South Indian [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil kingdoms]] was already established since the second century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devan|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of maritime Southeast Asia into contact with the major religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Throughout this area a most profound in influence has been exerted by India which seems to have introduced into it architecture, sculpture, writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton and a host of elements of higher culture. Indian religions, cultural traditions and [[Sanskrit]] began to spread across the land. [[Hindu temple]]s were built in the Indian style, local kings began referring to themselves as "[[raja]]" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.&lt;ref name="zaki1"&gt;{{harvnb|Zaki Ragman|2003|pp=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nakhon Si Thammarat Chedi Phra Baromathat.jpg|thumb|left|''Chedi Phra Borommathat'', a [[stupa]] located in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Thailand]]. Once a centre of Buddhist teaching and learning, it was built in the early 13th century and witnessed the rise and fall of [[Tambralinga]], a powerful Buddhist-Malay kingdom that managed to conquer [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. Constructed as a religious monument for [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, which was historically followed by a portion of pre-Islamic Malays, this stupa stands today as a major religious site for [[Thai people|Thai]], [[Theravada]] Buddhist pilgrims. The temple complex is believed to hold ancient relics of [[Buddha]] brought from Sri Lanka during the conquest of Jaffna in 1247.]]
The beginning of the Common Era saw the rise of Malay states in the coastal areas of the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]]; [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Bujang Valley|Kedah]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], the [[Melayu Kingdom]] and [[Srivijaya]]. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsula and Sumatran maritime trading states, became part of the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] of Srivijaya,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabrizain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a great confederation of city-states centred in [[Palembang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Munoz|2006|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kedah|Kadaram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muljana|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaiya District|Chaiya]] and [[Tambralinga]].

Srivijaya's influence spread over all the coastal areas of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, western [[Java]] and western [[Borneo]], as well as the rest of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Enjoying both Indian and Chinese patronage, its wealth was gained mostly through trade. At its height, the [[Old Malay language]] was used as its official language and became the [[lingua franca]] of the region, replacing Sanskrit, the language of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="zaki1" /&gt; The Srivijayan era is considered the golden age of Malay culture.

The glory of Srivijaya however began to wane after the series of raids by the Indian [[Chola dynasty]] in the 11th century. By the end of the 13th century, the remnants of the Malay empire in [[Sumatra]] was finally destroyed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese invaders]] during the [[Pamalayu expedition]] (''Pamalayu'' means "war against the Malays").

The complete destruction of Srivijaya caused the diaspora of the Srivijayan princes and nobles. Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation. In 1299, through the support of the loyal servants of the empire, the [[Orang laut]]s, a Malay prince of Srivijaya origin, [[Sang Nila Utama]] established the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] in [[Temasek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ministry of Culture|1973|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dynasty ruled the island kingdom until the end of the 14th century, when the Malay polity once again faced the wrath of Javanese invaders. In 1400, his great great grandson, [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]], headed north and established the [[Malacca Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buyers|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new kingdom succeeded Srivijaya and inherited much of the royal and cultural traditions, including a large part of the territories of its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=8 &amp; 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stearns|2001|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolters|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Srivijaya Empire.svg|thumb|The Buddhist maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]], the first vast Malay polity in the region]]
The power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the kingdom of [[Tambralinga]] in the 12th century. Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by [[Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja]] (1230–1263) managed to capture [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1247 and 1258. He was eventually defeated by the forces of the [[Pandyan dynasty]] from Tamil Nadu in 1263 and was killed by the brother of Emperor [[Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I]].&lt;ref&gt;India's interaction with Southeast Asia, by Govind Chandra Pande p.286&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion marked an unrivaled feature in the [[history of Southeast Asia]], it was the only time there was an armed maritime expedition beyond the borders of the region.

The cultivation of Malay polity system also diffused beyond the proper Sumatran-Peninsular border during this era. The age avowed by exploration and migration of the Malays to establish kingdoms beyond the traditional Srivijayan realm. Several exemplification are the enthronement of a Tambralingan prince to reign the [[Lavo Kingdom]] in present-day [[Central Thailand]], the foundation of [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] in the [[Visayas]] and the establishment of the [[Tanjungpura Kingdom]] in what is now [[West Kalimantan]], [[Borneo]]. The expansion is also eminent as it shaped the [[ethnogenesis]] development of the related [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] and [[Banjar people]] and further spreading the Indian-influenced Malay ethos within the regional sphere.

===Islamisation===
{{Further|Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia|Malayisation}}
[[File:Malacca Sultanate en.svg|thumb|The extent of the powerful Malaccan Sultanate in the 15th century. The emergence of Malacca as a cosmopolitan regional metropolis has monumentally redefined the characteristic of the Malay interpretation of culture, language, religion, philosophy and identity. With [[Malayness]] and [[Islam]] as the core pillars and strengths, the legacy of the Malaccan court can be strongly witnessed in the construction of the Malay [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] framework until today.]]
[[File:Malays from the Malacca Sultanate Codice Casanatense.jpg|thumb|Portuguese illustration of Malays of Malacca, 1540.]]

&lt;!--[[File:Masjid Kampung Laut, Nilampuri, Kelantan, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|[[Kampung Laut Mosque]] in [[Tumpat]], Kelantan. Built in the 1730s, it is the oldest surviving mosque in Malaysia.]]--&gt;
The period of the 12th and 15th centuries saw the arrival of [[Islam]] and the rise of the great port-city of Malacca on the southwestern coast of the Malay Peninsula&lt;ref name="W&amp;IP1"&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1174}}&lt;/ref&gt; – two major developments that altered the course of Malay history.

The Islamic faith arrived on the shores of what are now the states of [[Kedah]], [[Perak]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]], from around the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hussin Mutalib|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest archaeological evidence of Islam from the Malay peninsula is the [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]] dating from the 14th century found in [[Terengganu]] state, [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="W&amp;IP1" /&gt;

By the 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony reached over much of the western [[Malay Archipelago]], had become the centre of [[Islamisation]] in the east. As a Malaccan state religion, Islam brought many great transformation into the Malaccan society and culture, and It became the primary instrument in the evolution of a common Malay identity.The Malaccan era witnessed the close association of Islam with Malay society and how it developed into a definitive marker of Malay identity.&lt;ref name="Barnard 2004 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andaya 1984 55"&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Fauzi Yaacob|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu Talib Ahmad|Tan|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this common Malay cultural idiom came to characterise much of the Malay Archipelago through the [[Malayisation]] process. The expansion of Malaccan influence through trade and [[Dawah]] brought with it together the [[Classical Malay]] language,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Islamic faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Malay Muslim culture;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esposito|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three core values of ''Kemelayuan'' ("Malayness").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1511, the Malaccan capital fell into the hands of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[conquistadors]]. However, Malacca remained an institutional prototype: a paradigm of statecraft and a point of cultural reference for successor states such as [[Johor Sultanate]] (1528–present), [[Perak|Perak Sultanate]] (1528–present), [[Pahang Sultanate]] (1470–present), [[Siak Sri Indrapura Sultanate]] (1725–1946), Pelalawan Sultanate (1725–1946) and [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]] (1824–1911).&lt;ref name="Harper1"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the [[South China Sea]] in the 14th century, another Malay realm, the [[Bruneian Empire]] was on the rise to become the most powerful polity in [[Borneo]]. By the middle of the 15th century, Brunei entered into a close relationship with the Malacca Sultanate. The sultan married a Malaccan princess, adopted Islam as the court religion, and introduced an efficient administration modelled on Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Europa Publications Staff|2002|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei profited from trade with Malacca but gained even greater prosperity after the great Malay port was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511. It reached its golden age in the mid-16th century when it controlled land as far south as present day [[Kuching]] in [[Sarawak]], north towards the [[Philippine Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richmond|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire broadened its influence in [[Luzon]] by defeating Datu Gambang of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and by founding a [[Satellite state|satellite]] state, [[Kota Seludong]] in present-day [[Manila]], setting up the Muslim Rajah, [[Rajah Sulaiman I]] as a vassal to the Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, [[Philippines]] when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]]. However, states like the [[Huangdom of Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of [[Malayisation]]. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''. In [[West Kalimantan|West Borneo]], the development of such sultanates of [[Sarawak Sultanate|Sarawak]], [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], [[Sukadana]] and [[Landak Regency|Landak]] tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant Malay sultanates were the [[Kedah Sultanate]] (1136–present), [[Kelantan|Kelantan Sultanate]] (1411–present), [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani Sultanate]] (1516–1771), [[Reman Sultanate]] (1785–1909) and [[Legeh Sultanate]] (1755-1902) that dominated the northern part of the Malay peninsula. [[Jambi Sultanate]] (1460–1907), [[Palembang Sultanate]] (1550–1823) and [[Indragiri Sultanate]] (1298–1945) controlled much of the southeastern shores of Sumatra. While [[Deli Sultanate]] (1632–1946), [[Serdang Sultanate]] (1728–1948), [[Langkat Sultanate]] (1568–1948) and [[Asahan Sultanate]] (1630–1948) governed eastern Sumatra.

===Colonisation by foreign powers===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van de Sultan van Lingga Riouw met zijn gevolg Batavia TMnr 60003185.jpg|thumb|The reigning elite of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]], together with the Sultan (being seated, in the middle) as depicted in this photograph taken in 1867. The administrative class of Riau-Lingga are known to be strict adherents of [[Sufi]] [[Tariqa]], this resulted various laws and legal enactments based on [[Islamic law|Islamic principles]] to be strictly observed throughout the archipelago kingdom. The sultanate would be abolished almost half a century later in 1911 by the Dutch powers, following a strong independence movement manifested in the nation against the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]].]]

Between 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct [[colonisation]] or became the [[protectorate]]s of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], to regional powers like [[Siam]] and [[Japan]].
In 1511, the [[Portuguese Empire]] [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|captured]] the capital city of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the [[A Famosa|fort of Malacca]]. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528 to succeed Malacca. [[Portuguese Malacca]] faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the [[Dutch Empire]], [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|ousted]] the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunter|Roberts|2010|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Malay states]] of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the [[Thai people|Siamese]]. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the [[Thonburi Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] under the new [[Chakri Dynasty]] abolished the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] and later annexed a large part of [[Kedah Sultanate]]. Earlier, the Siamese under [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] have had already absorbed [[Tambralinga]] and overrun the [[Singgora Sultanate]] in the 17th century. Between 1808-1813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the [[Satellite state|semi-independent]] Malay kingdoms of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]], [[Sai Buri District|Saiburi]], [[Nong Chik District|Nongchik]], [[Yaring District|Yaring]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Reman]] and [[Rangae]] from [[Patani (region)|Greater Pattani]] and similarly obtained [[Ranong province|Rundung]], [[Takua Pa District|Kupa]], [[Phuket province|Tongkah]], [[Trang Province|Terang]] while carving [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]], Langu, [[Perlis]], [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|Kubang Pasu]] from the [[Kedah Kingdom]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|pp=62–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ganguly|1997|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government. The [[coup de grâce]] was cultivated by 1906, when the Siamese [[delimitation|redraw]] the border of the Pattani territories and installed a new governance and administrative system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd. Zamberi A. Malek.|1994|pp=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashahar Ramli|1999|pp=35–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tongkat Ali|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reman.jpg|thumb|left|Tuan Lebeh (seated, in the middle), the ''Long Raya'' or ''Raja Muda'' ([[crown prince]]) of the [[Kingdom of Reman]] in 1899. A state in the northern Malay Peninsula made wealthy by [[tin mining]], the State of [[Reman]] was abolished by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] alongside various other Malay kingdoms that revolted for independence in the early 1902 including [[Pattani Sultanate|Pattani]], Saiburi, Nongchik, Yaring, Yala, Legeh and Teluban.]]

In 1786, the island of [[Penang]] was leased to [[East India Company]] by [[Kedah Sultanate]] in exchange of military assistance against the Siamese. In 1819, the company also acquired [[Singapore]] from [[Johor Empire]], later in 1824, [[Dutch Malacca]] from the Dutch, and followed by [[Straits Settlements#Dindings and Province Wellesley|Dindings]] from [[Perak]] by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 and became the crown colony of [[British Empire]] in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when [[Malay rulers]] accepted [[British Resident]]s in administration, and the [[Federated Malay States]] was formed. In 1909, [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] were [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|handed over]] by Siam to the British. These states along with [[Johor]], later became known as [[Unfederated Malay States]]. During the [[World War II]], all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as [[British Malaya]] were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].

The twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the [[Castille War]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day [[Philippine archipelago]]. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in [[Borneo]] to the [[White Rajah]]s of [[Sarawak]], [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] and its [[Kalimantan|lower Borneo]] vassals to [[Dutch East India Company]]. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.&lt;ref name="CIA (B)"&gt;{{harvnb|CIA World Factbook|t=Brunei|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] which divided the [[Malay Archipelago]] into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan|Southern Borneo]] became part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lumholtz|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and [[Riau Sultanate]] in 1911.

[[File:Sultans at the first Malayan Durbar.jpg|thumb|The [[Malay Rulers]] and nobilities of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor with [[British Malaya|British colonial officers]] during the first [[Conference of Rulers|Durbar]] in Istana Negara, [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], [[Federated Malay States]], 1897.]]
A similar partition of the [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]] was also replicated by the British and the Siamese in wake of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]]. This was done after the British alarmed by the growing influence between Siamese government and rivaling [[German colonial empire]], especially in the northern Peninsular. The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the [[Southern Thailand|upper portion]] of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the [[British Empire|British dominance]]. The British originally planned for the inclusion of [[Kingdom of Reman|Reman]], Legeh and [[Kingdom of Setul|Setul]] under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with [[Tarutao National Park|Terutao]], [[Tarutao National Park|Butang islands]] groups, [[Sadao District|Sendawa]], [[La-ngu District|Langgu]] and the principality of [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the [[Tak Bai District|Tabal district]], including [[Su-ngai Kolok District|Sungai Golok]] and [[Su-ngai Padi District|Sungai Padi]]; while [[Perlis]] lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled [[Federated Malay States|Federated Malay State]] of [[Perak]] however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with [[Hulu Perak|southern territories]] of [[Reman]] being transferred into the state. The Siamese then [[abdicated]] Tunku Baharuddin, the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|King of Setul]], the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the [[British Malaya|British colonial government]], a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.

Later during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|British Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as [[Pontianak incidents]], the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the [[West Kalimantan]] Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and [[coup d'etat]] against the Japanese. It was believed that West Kalimantan took two generations to recover from the near-total collapse of the Malay ruling class in the territory.

===Malay nationalism===

{{main|Malay nationalism|Malay supremacy}}
{{see also|South Thailand insurgency|Early Malay nationalism in Riau}}
Despite the widespread distribution of the Malay population throughout the Malay archipelago, modern Malay nationalism was only significantly mobilised in the early twentieth century [[British Malaya]] i. e. the [[Malay Peninsula]]. In the [[Netherlands Indies]], the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called "[[Indonesian National Awakening]]" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as "Indonesians".&lt;ref name="Ricklefs, pp. 163-164"&gt;Ricklefs, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, [[South Thailand insurgency|Pattani separatism]] against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar [[secession movement]] can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]] sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]], later reconstituted as Malaysia.

The earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the [[periodical]]s which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Pengasuh'' (1920), ''Majlis'' (1935) and ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939). The rise of [[Malay nationalism]] was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions – the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.&lt;ref name="Leo Suryadinata"&gt;{{harvnb|Suryadinata|2000|pp=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malaya stamp.png|thumb|left|Federation of Malaya's commemorative stamp issued in 1957. The semi-independent federation was formed in 1948 from nine [[Malay states]] and two British [[Straits Settlements]]. It [[Hari Merdeka|achieved independence]] in 1957.]]
The Malay [[leftist]]s were represented by [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]], formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in [[Sultan Idris Training College]], with an ideal of ''[[Greater Indonesia]]''. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The [[Islamist]]s were originally represented by ''Kaum Muda'' consisted of Middle east –educated scholars with [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] sentiment. The first Islamic political party was ''Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya'' (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] in 1951. The third group was [[Conservatism|the conservatives]] consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. They formed voluntary organisations known as ''Persatuan Melayu'' ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), to assert [[Malay dominance]] over Malaya.&lt;ref name="Leo Suryadinata"/&gt;

The Malay and [[Malayness]] has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a ''Bangsa Melayu'' ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported [[Malay language]], [[Malay Islamic identity|Islam]] and [[Malay rulers|Malay monarchy]] as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the [[secular state]] but wanted to end [[feudalism]], whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Spandoeken tijdens het bezoek van de Wali Negara Sumatera Timur aan Pematangsiantar TMnr 60024766.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Supporters of ''Negara Soematra Timoer'' ([[State of East Sumatra]]) that sought to maintain the monarchy system in [[Aftermath of World War II#Dutch East Indies|post-World War II]] Dutch-established territory of East Sumatra. The state was headed by a president, Dr. Tengku Mansur, a member of [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan royal family]]. Both the state and the traditional Malay monarchy institution in East Sumatra dissolved following her merger into the newly formed [[Unitary state|unitarian]] Republic of Indonesia in 1950. (image taken c. 1947–1950)]]
Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Indonesia]] as a [[unitary state]] in 1950, all traditional Malay monarchies in Indonesia were abolished,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|He|Galligan|Inoguchi|2007|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sultans positions reduced to [[titular head]]s or [[pretender]]s. The violent demise of the sultanates of [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Sultanate of Serdang|Serdang]], [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] and other Malay principalities in [[East Sumatra]] during the "[[East Sumatra revolution|Social revolution]]" of 1946, drastically influenced their Malayan counterparts and politically motivating them against the PKMM's ideal of [[Greater Indonesia]] and the Islamists' vision of [[Islamic Republic]].

In March 1946, UMNO emerged with the full support of the Malay sultans from the [[Conference of Rulers]]. The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain's abandonment of the radical [[Malayan Union]] plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans' representatives and UMNO and the other.&lt;ref name="Riwanto Tirtosudarmo"&gt;{{harvnb|Tirtosudarmo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later the semi independent [[Federation of Malaya]] was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional [[Malay rulers]] thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the [[Federation of Malaya]], the West's last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power.&lt;ref name="Riwanto Tirtosudarmo"/&gt; The federation was reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] with the addition in 1963 of [[Singapore]] (separated in 1965), [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].

===Language===
[[File:Prasasti Kedukan Bukit 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] written in [[Vatteluttu|Pallava script]]. Dating back from 683, it is one of the oldest surviving Malay written artefact.]]
{{Main|Malay language|Malay dialects}}{{See also|Jawi alphabet}}
The Malay language is one of the major languages of the world and of the [[Austronesian]] family. Variants and dialects of Malay are used as an official language in [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Singapore]]. The language is also spoken in [[Thailand]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Islands]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Sri Lanka]]. It is spoken natively by approximately 33 million people throughout the [[Malay Archipelago]] and is used as a second language by an estimated 220 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2007|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest form of Malay is descended from the [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] spoken by the earliest [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] settlers in Southeast Asia. This form would later evolved into [[Old Malay]] when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region. Old Malay contained some terms last until today, but remained unintelligible to modern speakers, while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written [[Classical Malay]], which the oldest form dating back to 1303 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeuw|1959|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary, when Islam made its way to the region. Initially, Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia. One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, eventually became predominant.

The Malaccan era marked with the transformation of the Malay language into an Islamic language, in similar fashion as the Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Swahili languages. An adapted Arabic script called [[Jawi script|Jawi]] was used replacing the Indian script, Islamic religious and cultural terminologies were abundantly assimilated, discarding many Hindu-Buddhist words, and Malay became the language of Islamic medium of instruction and dissemination throughout Southeast Asian region. At the height of Malacca's power in the 15th century, the Classical Malay spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world&lt;ref name="Sneddon 2003 59"&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a ''[[lingua franca]]'' that was called ''Bahasa Melayu pasar'' ("Bazaar Malay") or ''Bahasa Melayu rendah'' ("Low Malay") as opposed to the ''Bahasa Melayu tinggi'' ("High Malay") of Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]] was a pidgin and the most important development, however, has been that pidgin creolised, creating several new languages such as the [[Ambonese Malay#Ambonese Malay|Ambonese Malay]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Betawi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier|Tavernier]], [[Louis Thomassin|Thomassin]] and [[Anthony Abraham Werndly|Werndly]] describe Malay as "''language of the learned in all the Indies, like [[Latin language|Latin]] in Europe''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most widely used during British and Dutch colonial era in the Malay Archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Putten|Cody|2009|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversed was seen in the [[Spanish East Indies]], where mass [[Romanization (cultural)|latinisation]] of the archipelago during the colonial years resulted the historical [[coup de grâce]] of the Malay language in the Philippines.

The dialect of [[Johor Sultanate]], the direct successor of Malacca, became the standard speech among Malays in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], and it formed the original basis for the standardised [[Indonesian language]].&lt;ref name="Sneddon 2003 59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wong|1973|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clyne|1992|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Ogilvie|2009|p=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the standard Malay, developed within the Malacca-Johor sphere, various local [[Malayan languages|Malay dialects]] exist. For example, the [[Bangka language|Bangkanese]], the [[Brunei Malay|Bruneian]], the [[Jambi Malay|Jambian]], the [[Kelantanese]], the [[Kedah Malay|Kedahan]], the [[Negeri Sembilan Malay language|Negeri Sembilanese]], the [[Musi language|Palembangnese]], the [[Pattani Malay|Pattanese]], the [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian]], the [[Terengganu Malay|Terengganuan]], and many others.

The Malay language was historically written in [[Pallava script|Pallawa]], [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Rencong script|Rencong]]. After the arrival of Islam, [[Arabic script|Arabic]]-based [[Jawi script]] was adopted and is still in use today as one of the two official scripts in Brunei and as an alternative script in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Star|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning from the 17th century, as a result of British and Dutch colonisation, Jawi was gradually replaced by the Latin-based [[Rumi script]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Omniglot|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became the official modern script for Malay language in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, and co-official script in Brunei.

===Literature===
[[File:Hkyt merong mahawgsa.jpg|thumb|[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]] in [[Jawi script|Jawi]] text. Also known as the Kedah Annals, it is an ancient Malay literature that chronicles the bloodline of [[Merong Mahawangsa]] and the foundation of [[Early history of Kedah|Kedah]].]]
{{Main|Malay literature|Malay folklore}}
The rich oral literature and classical literature of the Malays contain a great number of portraits of the people, from the [[servant]] to the minister, from the judge to the [[Raja]]s, from the ancient to the very contemporary periods, which together form the amorphous identity of the Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littrup|1996|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the softness and mellifluence of the Malay language, which lends itself easily to the requirements of rhyme and rhythm, the originality and beauty in Malay literature can be assessed in its poetical elements. Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are – the [[Pantun]], [[Syair]] and [[Gurindam]].
The earliest form of Malay literature was the [[oral literature]] and its central subjects are traditional [[folklore]] relating to [[nature]], animals and people. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by ''penglipur lara'' (storytellers) for example: ''[[Hikayat Malim Dewa]]'', ''Hikayat Malim Deman'', ''Hikayat Raja Donan'', ''Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal'', and ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]''.

When Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of [[Sanskrit literature]] and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to [[Hindu mythology]]. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' (a free translation of the ''[[Ramayana]]''), ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]'' (an adaptation of [[Śukasaptati]]) and ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]'' (an adaptation of ''[[Hitopadesha]]'').&lt;ref name="popular science 1899"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1899|pp=379–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of [[Jawi script]] (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and [[romance (love)|romance]] in Jawi script.&lt;ref name="Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218"&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature. During this era, notable [[Islamic literature|Middle Eastern literary works]] were translated and religious books were written in Malay language. Among famous translated works are ''[[Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah]]'' and ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]''.

The rise of Malay literature during the period was also penned by other homegrown literary composition coloured by mystical [[Sufi]]sm of the middle-east, the notable works of  [[Hamzah Fansuri]] such as ''Asrar al-Arifin'' (''Rahsia Orang yang Bijaksana;'' The Secret of the Wise), ''Sharab al-Asyikin'' (''Minuman Segala Orang yang Berahi;'' The Drink of All the Passionate) and ''Zinat al-Muwahidin'' (''Perhiasan Sekalian Orang yang Mengesakan;'' The Ornament of All the Devoted) can be seen as the [[Masterpiece|magna opera]] of the era.

The most important piece of Malay literary works is perhaps the famed [[Malay Annals]] or Sulalatus Salatin. It was called "the most famous, distinctive and best of all Malay literary works" by one of the most prominent scholars in Malay studies, [[Richard Olaf Winstedt|Sir Richard O. Winstedt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|1999|p=756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of its composition and the identity of its original author are uncertain, but under the order of [[Alauddin Riayat Shah III|Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah III]] of Johor in 1612, [[Tun Sri Lanang]] oversaw the editorial and compilation process of the Malay Annals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johan Jaaffar|Safian Hussain|Mohd Thani Ahmad|1992|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the Malay literature received some notable additions, including ''Kitab Ilmu Bedil'' (Book of Traditional Weaponry) that provides valuable details of traditional Malay ammunition and weaponry. The era also witnessed the wider usage of Malay [[General medical journal|medical journals]], known as ''Kitab Tib''. These works are indeed important as it serve as references to the Malay knowledge and technology during the classical era.&lt;ref name="MOWCAP, The Memory of the World Committee for Asia/Pacific 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|MOWCAP, The Memory of the World Committee for Asia/Pacific|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same century also witnessed a monumental shift in the Malay literature through writings of [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], a famous [[Malacca]]-born [[munshi]] of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name="popular science 1899" /&gt; Abdullah is regarded as the most cultured Malay who ever wrote,&lt;ref name="popular science 1899" /&gt; one of the greatest innovators in Malay letters&lt;ref name="Sneddon 2003 59"/&gt; and the father of modern Malay literature.&lt;ref name="Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218"/&gt; His most important works are the ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]'' (an autobiography), ''[[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan]]'' (an account of his trip for the government to [[Kelantan]]), and ''[[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah]]'' (a narrative of his [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] 1854). His work was an inspiration to future generations of writers and marks an early stage in the transition from classical Malay literature to modern Malay literature.&lt;ref name="Sneddon 2003 59"/&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque 02.jpg|thumb|[[Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque]] in [[Brunei]] on the eve of [[Ramadhan]]. The wealthy kingdom adopted [[Melayu Islam Beraja]] (''Malay Islamic Monarchy'') as the national philosophy since its independence in 1984.]]
{{see also|Malay Islamic identity}}
The early Malay communities were largely [[animist]]s, believing in the existence of ''semangat'' ([[spirit]]s) in everything.&lt;ref name="zaki1" /&gt; Around the opening of the [[common era]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were introduced by South Asian traders to the Malay Archipelago, where they flourished until the 13th century, just before the arrival of Islam brought by Arab, South Asian and Chinese Muslim traders.

In the 15th century, Islam of the orthodox [[Sunni]] sect flourished in the Malay world under the Malacca Sultanate. In contrast with Hinduism, which transformed early Malay society only superficially, Islam can be said to have really taken root in the hearts and minds of the Malays.&lt;ref name="Syed"&gt;{{harvnb|Syed Husin Ali|2008|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this era, the Malays have traditionally had a close identification with Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Lahoud|2005|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and they have not changed their religion since.&lt;ref name="Syed" /&gt; This identity is so strong that it is said to become Muslim was to ''[[Malayisation|masuk Melayu]]'' (to enter Malayness).&lt;ref name="Andaya 1984 55"/&gt;

Nevertheless, the earlier beliefs having deeper roots, they have maintained themselves against the anathemas of Islam – and indeed [[Sufism]] or the [[mysticism]] of [[Shia Islam]] have become intertwined among the Malays, with the spirits of the earlier animistic world and some elements of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winstedt|1925|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1970s, [[Islamic revival]] (also referred as re-[[Islamisation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burgat|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;) throughout the [[Muslim world]], many traditions that contravene the teaching of Islam and contain elements of [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] were abandoned by the Malays. Among these traditions was the ''[[Mandi (bath)|mandi]] safar'' festival ([[Safar]] bath), a bathing festival to achieve spiritual purity, in which can be discerned features similar to some of those of the [[Durga Puja]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolton|Hutton|2000|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vast majority of modern ethnic Malays are the adherents of [[Sunni]] Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bethany World Prayer Center|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important Malay festivals are those of [[Muslim holidays|Islamic origin]] - ''[[Eid ul-Fitr|Hari Raya Aidilfitri]]'', ''[[Eid al-Adha|Hari Raya Aidiladha]]'', ''[[Islamic New Year|Awal Muharram]]'', and ''[[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]]''. It is considered "apostasy" for Malays to convert out of Islam in Malaysia and Brunei. However, a few ethnic Malays living outside of these countries have also embraced other religions.

===Architecture===

[[File:Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum 1.jpg|thumb|Replica of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]'s Imperial Palace, which was built from information and data obtained from the [[Malay Annals]]. This historical document had references to the construction and the architecture of palaces during the era of [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mansur Shah]], who ruled from 1458 to 1477.]]
Various cultural influences, notably [[Culture of China|Chinese]], Indian and Europeans, played a major role in forming Malay architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jan Henket|Heynen|2002|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent time, wood was the principal material used for all Malay traditional buildings.&lt;ref name="MC1219"&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1219}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, numerous stone structures were also discovered particularly the religious complexes from the time of [[Srivijaya]] and ancient [[Kra Isthmus|isthmian]] Malay kingdoms.

[[Candi Muara Takus]] and [[Candi Muaro Jambi]] in [[Sumatra]] are among the examples that associated with the architectural elements of Srivijaya Empire. However, the most of Srivijayan architecture was represented at [[Chaiya]] (now a province in [[Thailand]]) in Malay peninsular, which was without doubt a very important centre during the Srivijaya period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chihara|1996|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Beek|Invernizzi|1999|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of structure consists of a cell-chamber to house the [[Buddha image]] and the summit of structure was erected in the form of ''[[stupa]]'' with successive, superimposed terraces which is the best example at ''Wat Pra Borom That'' of Chaiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jermsawatdi|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of Hindu shrines or ''[[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]]'' around south [[Kedah]] between the [[mount Jerai]] and the [[Muda River]] valley, an area known as [[Bujang Valley]]. Within an area of about 350 square kilometres, 87 early historic religious sites have been reported and there are 12 ''candis'' located on mountain tops, a feature which suggests may derive from pre-historic Malay beliefs regarding sanctity of high places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Reilly|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintu Setul Mambang Segara.jpg|thumb|A wall panel adorned with various floral motives from the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul Mambang Segara]] palatial residence as seen in the [[National Museum (Malaysia)|Muzium Negara]]. Setul was a historical Malay kingdom that existed between 1808-1915 in the northern Malay Peninsula.]]
Early reference on Malay architecture in Malay peninsula can be found in several Chinese records. A 7th-century Chinese account tells of Buddhist pilgrims calling at [[Langkasuka]] and mentioned the city as being surrounded by a wall on which towers had been built and was approached through double gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jamil Abu Bakar|2002|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 7th-century account of a special Chinese envoy to [[Red Earth Kingdom]] in Malay peninsular, recorded that the capital city had three gates more than hundred paces apart, which were decorated with paintings of Buddhist themes and female spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamad Tajuddin Haji Mohamad Rasdi|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detailed description of Malay architecture was on the great wooden ''[[Istana]]'' of [[Mansur Shah of Malacca]] (reigned 1458–1477).&lt;ref name="MC1219" /&gt; According to [[Sejarah Melayu]], the building had a raised seven bay structures on wooden pillars with a seven tiered roof in cooper shingles and decorated with gilded spires and Chinese glass mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamad Tajuddin Haji Mohamad Rasdi|2005|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Malay houses]] are built using simple [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] structure. They have pitched roofs, [[porch]]es in the front, high ceilings, many openings on the walls for [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|A. Ghafar Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often embellished with elaborate [[wood carvings]]. The beauty and quality of Malay wood carvings were meant to serve as visual indicators of the social rank and status of the owners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farish Ahmad Noor|Khoo|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout many decades, the traditional Malay architecture has been influenced by [[Bugis]] and [[Joglo|Java]] from the south, [[Architecture of Thailand|Siamese]], [[Architecture of the United Kingdom|British]], [[Islamic architecture|Arab]] and [[Architecture of India|Indian]] from the north, [[Architecture of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Rumah Aceh|Aceh]] and [[Rumah Gadang|Minangkabau]] from the west and [[Chinese architecture|Southern Chinese]] from the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Art of Living Show|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Several design elements of traditional Malay architecture are adapted to modern structures to reflect the Malaysian identity. The stilt elevated undulating roof structure of the [[KLIA]] is supposed to imitate the traditional Malay-styled raised [[kampung]] houses. Wood, an important element in traditional Malay buildings, is also reinterpreted and readapted in modern landscape in the KLIA and [[Putrajaya]]. In Putrajaya, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]'s office is lined with wood panels to achieve the design goal. The underside of the KLIA's domed roof structure is similarly "clad in narrow strips of wood" which the architect suggests, "alludes to vernacular Malaysian timber structures, reinterpreting traditional building methods and strengthening sense of local identity". Non-architectural elements of the Malay heritage are also employed. The entrance to the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] is adorned with contemporary Malay motifs adapted from traditional [[handicrafts]], including ''[[Songket]]'' and [[wood carvings|timber carvings]] inspired by images of the [[tropical rainforests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical reflections on cities in Southeast Asia|page=201|author=Tim Bunnell, Lisa Barbara Welch Drummond &amp; Kong-Chong Ho|isbn=981-210-192-6|year=2002|publisher=Time Media Private Limited|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Visual art===

Wood carving is a part of classical Malay [[visual arts]]. The Malays had traditionally adorned their monuments, boats, weapons, tombs, musical instrument, and utensils by motives of flora, calligraphy, geometry and cosmic feature. The art is done by partially removing the wood using sharp tools and following specific patterns, composition and orders. The art form, known as ''ukir'', is hailed as an act of devotion of the craftsmen to the creator and a gift to his fellowmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art form is mainly attributed to the abundance of timber on the [[Malay Archipelago]] and also by the skillfulness of the woodcarvers that have allowed the Malays to practice woodcarving as a craft. The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna and cosmic forces is abundant has inspired the motives to be depict in abstract or styled form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and [[Islamic calligraphy]] form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of the fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight to light the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor. Thus, the carved components performed in both functional and aesthetic purposes.

===Pottery===
[[File:Sayong.jpg|thumb|An ebony-coloured ''Labu Sayong'', a classic Malay [[jar]] from [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], Malaysia.]]
Under the Malay culture, [[pottery]] is not solely witnessed as a mere household [[List of eating utensils|utensil]]. It is perceived as a work of [[art]], a paradigm of talent, embroidered with aesthetic, legacy, perseverance and religious devotion. The Malay earthen is usually unglazed, with the ornamental designs were carved when the pottery is semi-dried during its construction process.&lt;ref name="Travel Malaysia 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Travel Malaysia|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several studies,&lt;ref name="Azmi Arifin 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Azmi Arifin|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the native Malay pottery industry has developed indigenously from the period of great antiquity and has since encapsulates a high-level of culture sophistication. It also has been noted that the design features of the Malay pottery suggested the absence of the [[globalisation|foreign influence]] prior to the 19th century, a paradox considering the vast cultural contact between the Malays and the outside world.&lt;ref name="Azmi Arifin 2015"/&gt;

Among the renowned traditional Malay pottery includes ''Mambong'' of [[Kelantan]], molded from clay and identified with the colour of [[terracotta]]. It is usually assumed the form as cooking utensils. In the west coast, the raven-coloured ''Labu Sayung'' of [[Kuala Kangsar]] is honourned for gourd-formed jars. There are also several variants of ''Labu'', including ''Labu Tela, Labu Kepala, Labu Gelugor Tela'' and ''Labu Gelugor Kepala''.&lt;ref name="Travel Malaysia 2012"/&gt;

Other forms of Malay traditional pottery are: The ''Belanga'', commonly in a wide rim and a round base, the pot usually mobilised to cook [[curries]]. It is held that the structure of the earthen would aid the heat to be evenly distributed, correlating to its round base. A smaller version of the ''Belanga'' is called ''periok'', used for [[rice]]-preparation; The ''Buyong'', commonly defined by a straight collar and a spherical body, oftentime used as a water jar; The ''Terenang'', the angular ''Terenang'' is used as a canister, especially in the coastal Malay regions of [[Kelantan]], [[Pattani]] and [[Terengganu]]; The ''Bekas Bara'', a small container, usually crafted for the use of [[incense]]; The ''Jambangan'', a traditional Malay [[vase]], usually for aesthetic purposes and ''Geluk'', a small water storage.&lt;ref name="Cikgu Paklong 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Cikgu Paklong|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bubur 100618-4100 sbs.jpg|thumb|[[Bubur pedas]], a variant of richly spiced [[congee]] that can be found among the [[Borneo|Bornean]] Malay communities in [[Sarawak]] and [[West Kalimantan]], served together with [[Pisang goreng]] and a cup of coffee.]]
{{Main|Malay cuisine}}
Different Malay regions are all known for their unique or signature dishes – [[Pattani]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]] for their ''[[Nasi dagang]]'', ''[[Nasi kerabu]]'' and ''[[Lekor|Keropok lekor]]'';  [[Jambi]], [[Pahang]], and [[Perak]] for their Durian-based cuisine especially ''[[tempoyak|gulai tempoyak]]''; [[South Sumatra]], [[Kedah]], and [[Penang]] for their northern-style ''[[Asam laksa]]'' and ''[[rojak]]''; [[Perlis]] and [[Satun Province|Satun]] for their ''Bunga kuda'' desserts; [[Negeri Sembilan]] for its lemak-based dishes, [[West Sumatra]], [[Riau]], [[Melaka]], and [[Johor]] for their spicy ''[[Asam Pedas]]''; [[Riau]] and [[Pahang]] for their ''ikan patin'' ([[Pangasius]] fish) dishes; Melayu Deli of [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]] for their ''[[Nasi goreng]] teri Medan'' (Medan anchovy fried rice) and ''[[Gulai]] Ketam'' (crab gulai);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winarno|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jambi]] for its ''Panggang Ikan Mas''; [[Palembang]] for its ''[[Mie celor]]'' and ''[[Pempek]]''; [[Sarawak]] and [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]] for their ''[[Bubur pedas]]'' and ''[[laksa]]''; [[Brunei]] for its unique ''[[Ambuyat]]'' and ''Nasi Katok'' dish.

The main characteristic in traditional Malay cuisine is undoubtedly the generous use of spices. The [[coconut milk]] is also important in giving the Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is ''[[belacan]]'' (shrimp paste), which is used as a base for ''sambal'', a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, [[Chili pepper|chillies]], onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of [[lemongrass]] and [[galangal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly every Malay meal is served with rice, the [[staple food]] in many other East Asian cultures. Although there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most of Malay people are Muslims, Malay cuisine follows Islamic [[halal]] dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb meat, and also includes poultry and fishes. Pork and any non-halal meats, also alcohol is prohibited and absent from Malay daily diet.

[[Nasi lemak]], rice cooked in rich [[coconut milk]] probably is the most popular dish ubiquitous in Malay town and villages. Nasi lemak is considered as [[Malaysia]]'s [[national dish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malaysia.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[Ketupat]] or ''nasi himpit'', glutinous compressed rice cooked in palm leafes, is popular especially during ''Idul Fitri'' or ''Hari Raya'' or [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. Various meats and vegetables could be made into [[Gulai]] or [[Curry|Kari]], a type of curry dish with variations of spices mixtures that clearly display Indian influence already adopted by Malay people since ancient times. [[Laksa]], a hybrid of Malay and Peranakan Chinese cuisine is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine also adopted some their neighbours' cuisine traditions, such as [[rendang]] adopted from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]s in [[West Sumatra|Pagaruyung Highlands]], and [[satay]] from Java, however Malay people has developed their own distinctive taste and recipes.

===Performing arts===
[[File:ShowMakyonginRama5.jpg|thumb|A troupe of [[Thai Malays|Siamese Malay]] dancers performing the [[Mak Yong]] during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Rama V of Siam]] (c. 19th century), a dance theatre that owes its origin from the [[Pattani]] and [[Kelantanese]] palace courts. In 2005, it received recognition as being among the [[Intangible cultural heritage|masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].]]
The Malays have diverse kinds of music and dance which are fusions of different cultural influences. Typical genres range from traditional Malay folk dances dramas like [[Mak Yong]] to the Arab-influenced [[Zapin]] dances. Choreographed movements also vary from simple steps and tunes in [[Dikir barat]] to the complicated moves in [[Joget]] [[Gamelan]].

Traditional Malay music is basically percussive. Various kinds of [[gongs]] provide the beat for many dances. There are also drums of various sizes, ranging from the large ''rebana ubi'' used to punctuate important events to the small ''jingled-rebana'' ([[frame drum]]) used as an accompaniment to vocal recitations in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Regalia of Malaysia#Nobat|Nobat]] music became part of the [[Royal Regalia]] of Malay courts since the arrival of Islam in the 12th century and only performed in important court ceremonies. Its orchestra includes the sacred and highly revered instruments of ''nehara'' ([[kettledrums]]), ''gendang'' (double-headed drums), ''nafiri'' (trumpet), ''serunai'' ([[oboe]]), and sometimes a knobbed [[gong]] and a pair of [[cymbals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian influences are strong in a traditional [[shadow play]] known as [[Wayang Kulit]] where stories from Hindu epics; [[Ramayana]] &amp; [[Mahabharata]] form the main repertoire. There are four distinctive types of shadow puppet theatre that can be found in Malay peninsula; ''Wayang Gedek'', ''Wayang Purwa'', ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Siam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Srinivasa|2003|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ghulam Sarwar Yousof|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matusky|1993|pp=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the art and the storytelling of ''Wayang Purwa'' and ''Wayang Siam'' denote a regional influence in fused with the Javanese and Siamese respectively, while ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Gedek'' narrated a more autochthonously Malay form and fashion.

Other well-known Malay performing arts are; ''[[Bangsawan]]'' theatre, ''[[Dondang Sayang]]'' love ballad and ''[[Mak Inang]]'' dance from Malacca Sultanate, ''[[Jikey]]'' and ''[[Mek Mulung]]'' theatre from [[Kedah]], ''[[Asyik]]'' dance and ''[[Menora (dance)|Menora]]'' dance drama from [[Pattani (region)|Patani]] and [[Kelantan]], ''[[Ulek mayang]]'' and ''[[Rodat (dance)|Rodat]]'' dance from Terengganu, ''[[Boria (theatre)|Boria]]'' theatre from [[Penang]], ''Canggung'' dance from [[Perlis]], ''Mukun'' warble from [[Brunei]] and [[Sarawak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marzuki bin Haji Mohd Seruddin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mysarawak.org|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmad Salehuddin 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad Salehuddin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gending Sriwijaya]] from [[Palembang]],''Serampang Dua Belas'' dance from [[Sultanate of Serdang|Serdang]].&lt;ref name="Ahmad Salehuddin 2009"/&gt; and [[Zapin Api|Zapin Api firedance]] from [[Riau]].

===Traditional dress===
[[File:HariRayaMalaykids.jpg|thumb|right|Malay children wearing traditional dress during [[Eid al-Fitr]].]]
{{Main|Baju Melayu|Baju Kurung}}
The traditional Malay apparel and textile has been continuously morphed since the time of antiquity. Historically, the ancient Malays were chronicled to incorporate various natural materials as a vital source for fabrics, clothing and attire. The common era however, witnessing the early arrivals the merchants from east and west to the harbours of Malay archipelago, together they bought new luxurious items, including fine cotton and silks. The garments subsequently become a source of high Malay fashion and acquired a cultural role as the binding identity in the archipelago, especially in the Peninsula, Sumatra and the coastal areas of Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanisa Hassan|2016|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wacanaseni.usm.my/WACANA%20SENI%20JOURNAL%20OF%20ARTS%20DISCOURSE/wacanaseni_v15/WS_15_3.pdf |title=A Study on the Development of Baju Kurung Design in the Context of Cultural Changes in Modern Malaysia|last=Hanisa Hassan|publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malay culture, clothes and textiles are revered as symbols of beauty, power and status. Numerous accounts in [[List of Hikayat|Malay hikayats]] stressed the special place occupied by textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malay handloom industry can be traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under [[Song dynasty]]. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in [[Malay peninsular]] was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among well-known Malay textiles are [[Songket]], [[Malaysian batik|Batik]], ''Telepok'', ''Limar'', ''Tenun'', ''Kelingkam'', ''Cindai'' and ''Tekad''.

Classical Malay dress varies between different regions, but the most profound traditional dress in modern-day are Baju Kurung (for women) and Baju Melayu (for men), which both recognised as the national dress for Malaysia and Brunei, and also worn by Malay communities in Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand.
[[File:Wanita Kedah.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[Kedahan Malay]] lady wearing a traditional Baju Kurung. (1930s)]]

The word ''Baju Kurung'', literary defined as "encase the body" of the wearer is tailored based on the Islamic principles of modesty, decency and humility. The practice is parallel to the [[Judaeo-Christian]] religious doctrine, as flaunting the [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate body parts]] is considered as forbidden in Islam. The interpretation was then absorbed to the Malay way of dressing and cultural perspective, this can be strongly witnessed upon the rule of [[Mansur Shah of Malacca]] in the 15th century, the sultan prohibited his female muslim subjects in the public from wearing only a sarong from the bust downwards. Throughout the ages, The Malay Baju Kurung went into several reincarnation before assuming its current form. Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanisa Hassan|2016|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as "Baju Melayu". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanisa Hassan|2016|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common classical Malay attire for men consists of a ''baju'' (shirt) or ''tekua'' (a type of a long sleeve shirt), ''baju rompi'' (vest), ''kancing'' (button), a small leg ''celana'' (trousers), a [[sarong]] worn around the waist, ''capal'' (sandal), and a ''tanjak'' or ''tengkolok'' ([[headgear]]); for the aristocrats, the ''baju sikap'' or ''baju layang'' (a type of coat) and ''pending'' (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a ''pendekar'' (Malay warrior) to have a [[Kris]] tucked into the front fold of sarong.

In contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.

===Festivals and celebrations===
[[File:Majlis Tujuh Likor Pasang Pelita.jpg|thumb|Rows of Pelita ([[oil lamps]]) lighted during ''Malam Tujuh Likur'' (the 27th night of [[Ramadhan]]), the oil lamps are traditionally used to illuminate homes and the streets during the Ramadhan. Seen here in [[Muar town|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia]]
The rise of [[Islam]] managed to [[ethnogenesis|redefine]] the [[Malayness|Malay identity]] by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the [[Islamic calendar]], albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of [[Malayisation|Malay character]]. The biannual [[Hari Raya]] (lit "the Great Day") observance of [[Aildifitri]] and [[Aidiladha]] are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of [[fasting]] and patience in [[Ramadan]], while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by [[Ibrahim]] (Abraham) under the name of [[Allah]].

The Raya holidays usually commenced during the [[homecoming]] event known as [[Balik Kampung]] which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.

Other major religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include [[Ramadhan]], a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; [[Maulidur Rasul]], a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; [[Ashura]], remembrance of Muharram where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as ''Bubur Ashura''; [[Nisfu Syaaban]], the Mid-[[Sha'ban]] observance, a special day of [[fasting]] for forgiveness; [[Nuzul Quran]], the first the revelation of the [[Quran]]; [[Israk dan Mikraj]], the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and [[Awal Muharram]], the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special ''sunat'' prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the [[mosque]].

There are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the ''Mandi Safar'' or ''Puja Pantai'' ceremony, a purifying bath during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Safar]], originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and ''Pesta Menuai'', a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, [[Joget]] and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.

The Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual [[rite of passage]] as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised ''kenduri'', a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from ''Doa Selamat'' (asking for divine favour and protection), ''Kesyukuran'' (for thanksgiving and gratitude), ''Aqiqah'' and ''Cukur Jambul'' (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), ''Khatam'' (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the [[Quran]]), ''Khatan'' ([[circumcision]]),  ''Kahwin'' ([[wedding]]), ''Arwah'' or ''Tahlil'' (prayers for a deceased person),  among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as ''Rewang''. In ''Rewang'', the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of [[urbanism]] in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of ''Rewang'' is gradually superseded by hired-[[catering|caterer]] services by the family.

===Martial arts===
[[File:Silat Melayu Keris Lok 9.jpg|thumb|A [[Silat Melayu]] performance on a stage.]]
{{Main|Silat|Silat Melayu}}
Silat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the [[Malay peninsula]] (including [[Singapore]]), the [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]] and coastal areas of [[Borneo]]. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1994|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abd. Rahman Ismail|2008|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Srivijaya (7th century).

The influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Brunei Sultanate|Brunei]] has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary [[Laksamana]] [[Hang Tuah]] of Malacca is one of the most renowned ''pesilat'' (Silat practitioners) in history&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2001|p=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheikh Shamsuddin|2005|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the classical era, [[Silat Melayu]] underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian [[Pencak Silat]] and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Draeger|1992|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Silat, [[Tomoi]] is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of [[Indo-Chinese]] forms of [[kickboxing]] which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan Empire]] (68&amp;nbsp;AD).

===Metal Casting===
[[File:Bunga Mas.jpg|thumb|The [[Bunga Mas]], [[National Museum of Malaysia]]. Literary translated as the "Golden Flowers", the Bunga Mas was offered by the northern Malay states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Patani Kingdom|Pattani]], [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Ra-ngae District|Rangae]], [[Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kubang Pasu]] and [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul]] to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ([[Siam]]) as a symbol of allegiance.]]
In the Malay society, classical [[metalworks]] assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of [[culture]], cultivated by [[art]]istic appreciation and [[religious]] symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the [[Malay World]], observations made by the [[Arab people|Arabs]] on the courts of [[Srivijaya]] narrated that about the abundance of golds in the [[Palembang|capital]], till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the [[estuary]] in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as ''Jinzou'', the [[gold]] coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of [[silver]] bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Shaffer 1955"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaffer|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the turn of 17th century, gold, silver, [[iron]] and [[brass]] have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A plethora of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as [[Keris]] made of iron, down to the elaborate fine [[jewellery]] made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental [[Belt buckle]] embellished with [[precious stones]]), ''keronsang'' (brooch) and ''cucuk sanggul'' (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, ''Tepak sirih'' (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by [[repoussé]] and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.&lt;ref name="Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver &amp; Brass 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver &amp; Brass|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karyaneka 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Karyaneka|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, [[filigree]] and [[Niello|neillowork]]. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The ''Awan Larat'' (cloud patterns) and ''Kerawang'' (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.&lt;ref name="Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver &amp; Brass 2011"/&gt;

The usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for [[Ornamental brassware|decorative purposes]]. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in [[Islamic arts|religious]] and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for [[Tepak Sireh]], a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as [[Gong]]s for the classical Malay [[Gamelan]] orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.&lt;ref name="Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver &amp; Brass 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karyaneka 2013"/&gt;

===Weaponry===
[[File:Malay Keris.jpg|thumb|A Malay Keris, with its sheath on the left. This dagger  historically belonged to a Malay aristocrat from [[Sumatra]].]]
{{See also|Taming Sari}}
The [[Keris]] is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] down south, the armament gradually assumed a Malay identity after entering the [[Srivijaya]]n court, giving rise to characteristics distinct from its Javanese Keris forebears.&lt;ref name=" William Wira Kusuma 2011"&gt;{{harvnb| William Wira Kusuma|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] in 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as part-and-parcel of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.&lt;ref name="Syefiri Moniz Mohd. Niza 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Syefiri Moniz Mohd. Niza|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Faizal Izzani Zakaria|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angahsunan 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Angahsunan|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the classical era, a Malay man was not be seen without a Keris outside of his house. The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: ''Keris Pusaka'' (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), ''Keris Pangkat'' (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and ''Keris Perjuangan Dirinya'' (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris.&lt;ref name="Angahsunan 2017"/&gt; The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey.&lt;ref name="Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016"/&gt; Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a [[spirit]], known as ''semangat'', Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guardthe "soul" of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual approach is usually held every ''Malam Jumaat'' (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and smoked with [[incense]], dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to compliment the mystic ritual.&lt;ref name="Irma Musliana 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Irma Musliana|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rentaka Melayu.jpg|thumb|The [[Lantaka|Rentaka]], a type of indigenous Malay [[artillery]], smaller than a ''Lela'' and ''Meriam'' (medium and large [[cannon]] respectively). Upon the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Fall of Malacca]] in 1511, it was recorded by [[Tomé Pires]] that the [[Conquistador|Portuguese conquistadors]] managed to seized 3000 bronze and iron cannons and thousands of ''Istinggar'' Malay guns from the capital.]]
The Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical [[values]] pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.&lt;ref name="Angahsunan 2017"/&gt;

Paradoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the [[Kris#Hilt|hilt]] of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]].&lt;ref name="Angahsunan 2017"/&gt;

There are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: ''Tuju'' ("Direct", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay [[cannons]] of ''Meriam'', ''Ekor Lontong'', ''Lela'' and ''Rentaka''), ''Bidik'' ("[[Gun]]", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an [[ammunition]], with the Malay forms of ''Terakor'' and ''Istingar''), ''Setubuh'' ("A body", weapon in the similar dimension of a [[human body]], referred to the Malay [[spears]] of ''Tongkat Panjang'' and ''Lembing''), ''Selengan'' ("An arm", a large [[saber]] from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of ''Pedang'' and ''Sundang''), ''Setangan'' ("A hand", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including ''Badik Panjang'' and ''Tekpi''), ''Sepegang'' ("A hold", smaller than the ''Setangan'', a [[dagger]] with ''Keris'' and ''Badik'' in the category) and ''Segenggam'' ("A grab", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized [[blade]], including ''Lawi Ayam'', ''Kerambit'', ''Kuku Macan'' and ''Kapak Binjai'').&lt;ref name="Kerawang Merah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Kerawang Merah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes ''sumpit'' ([[Blowgun|Blowpipe]]) and ''Busur dan Panah'' ([[Bow and Arrow]]), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy ''Zirah'', a type of ''Baju Besi'' ([[armour]]) and ''Perisai'' ([[shield]]) as defense mechanisms during the [[armed conflict]].

===Traditional games===
[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Wau bulan|Wau]]-maker's workshop in [[Kelantan]], Malaysia. This peculiar type of kite can be found in the northeast coast of Malay Peninsular.]]
Traditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. ''[[Sepak Raga]]'' and [[kite flying]] are among traditional games that were mentioned in the [[Malay Annals]] being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockard|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=1357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sepak Raga]]'' is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as [[Malaysia]]'s national sport&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|1972|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played in the international sporting events such as [[Asian Games]] and [[Southeast Asian Games]].

[[File:Gasing.jpg|thumb|A close-up to two Malay style ''[[Top|Gasings]]''.]]
Other popular game is [[top|''Gasing'' spinning]] which usually played after the [[harvest]] season. A great skill of [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] is required to produce the most competitive ''Gasing'' (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2006 51"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most popular Malay games is the ''[[Wau bulan|Wau]]'' (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (''Wau'' are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all [[Malay kite]]s are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2006 51"/&gt;

The Malays also have a variant of [[Mancala]] board game known as [[Congkak]]. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since [[Ancient Egypt]].
As the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names and titles===
{{Main|Malay names|Malay styles and titles}}
Malay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured [[Arabic names]] as marks of their religion.

Malay names are [[patronymic]] and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name [[Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak]], where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.

In addition to naming system, the [[Malay language]] also has a complex system of [[titles]] and [[honorifics]], which are still extensively used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. By applying these [[Malay titles]] to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] has the full name [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak]], where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning "son of" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word "bintun" meaning "daughter of", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.
The more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] has the full [[regnal name]] [[Muhammad V of Kelantan|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Muhammad V lbni Sultan lsmail Petra]], while the reigning [[Sultan of Brunei]] officially known as [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien]].

==Sub-ethnic groups==
[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Ethnic Malays among other ethnic groups in Indonesia. Although only constituting 3.4% of the total population, ethnic Malays are one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. The realm of Malays is described in green and other related sub-ethnic groups are rendered in darker or lighter green. Malay ethnic groups are shown as inhabiting the eastern coast of Sumatra and coastal Kalimantan. Outside the Indonesian archipelago in white, the Malay people inhabit the Malay peninsula, forming the dominant ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia and a significant minority in Singapore, Thailand and southern Myanmar. The corridor of Bornean Malay territories begins north from southwestern Sabah, continues with the country of Brunei Darussalam, coastal Sarawak and continues down to the green shaded shores of Kalimantan.{{lower|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.com.bn/golden-legacy/2011/10/24/search-brunei-malays-outside-brunei In search of Brunei Malays outside Brunei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514083428/http://www.bt.com.bn/golden-legacy/2011/10/24/search-brunei-malays-outside-brunei |date=14 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

==Alleged last appearance==
In March 2017, there were video recordings by a group of bikers in [[Aceh]] who accidentally saw and recorded a man that was thought to be a Mante tribe. The alleged Mante man at the site was caught by surprise and ran away immediately; and the scene was recorded by one of the bikers in the group. The video recording was uploaded on YouTube and quickly became a viral topic of discussion on social medias and in the news in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/784837/pygmy-tribe-mante |title=WATCH: Mysterious figure thought to be a member of Indonesia’s LOST pygmy tribe spotted |author=Lauren O'Callaghan |publisher=Express UK |date=2017-03-28 |accessdate=2018-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the news gained the attention of the Aceh government to dispatch a search team to find the Mante people and examine their real existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2017/03/28/pemerintah-aceh-telusuri-keberadaan-suku-mante |title=Pemerintah Aceh Telusuri Keberadaan Suku Mante |author=Daspriani Y Zamzami |publisher=Media Indonesia |date=2017-03-28 |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Social Affairs department also participated in the search in order to provide social security to the Mante people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/2913719/untuk-apa-kementerian-sosial-mencari-suku-mante |title=Untuk Apa Kementerian Sosial Mencari Suku Mante? |author=Nila Chrisna Yulika |publisher=Liputan6 |year=2017-04-08 |accessdate=2018-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase '''Marriage mill''' refers to the [[western states]] of the [[United States]] which allowed for fairly straightforward [[divorce]] proceedings at the turn of the twentieth century. The most often cited example seems to be [[Dakota Territory]]. As it was, those states needed higher [[population]] quotas to gain legitimacy, and this was a way of getting around their problem.

'''The multi-dimensional model of Māori identity and cultural engagement (MMM-ICE)'''  is a [[self-report]] ([[Likert scale|Likert]]-type) questionnaire designed to assess seven distinct dimensions of [[identity (social science)|identity]] and cultural engagement in [[Māori people|Māori]] populations: group-membership evaluation, socio-political consciousness, cultural efficacy and active identity engagement, spirituality, interdependent self-concept, authenticity of beliefs, and perceived appearance.

The MMM-ICE is a quantitative index of [[identity (social science)|identity]] that can be readily compared across independent studies of the [[Māori people]]. The index was developed by Drs Carla Houkamau and [[Chris Sibley]] in 2010; both of whom are senior lecturers at [[The University of Auckland]]. The scale was updated in 2014 as the MMM-ICE2 to incorporate the seventh measure of perceived appearance.&lt;ref name="MMM-ICE2"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11205-014-0686-7 | issn = 0303-8300 | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 279–296| last1 = Houkamau| first1 = Carla A.| last2 = Sibley| first2 = Chris G. | title = The Revised Multidimensional Model of Māori Identity and Cultural Engagement (MMM-ICE2) | journal = Social Indicators Research| date = 5 June 2014 }} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMM-ICE2 aims to provide a culturally sensitive, valid, and reliable measure of Māori identity:  "who" a person is as Māori, how they "fit in" with others socially, and what that means in terms of [[behaviour]]. The MMM-ICE is associated with the [[New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study]].

==Dimensions==

===Group membership evaluation===
''Group membership evaluation'' reflects the basic premise of [[social identity]] theory that individuals strive for favourable evaluations of their group.&lt;ref name=tajfel86&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Tajfel| first1 = H.| last2 = Turner| first2 = J. C. | chapter = The social identity theory of intergroup behavior | editor-last=Worshel | editor-first=S. | editor2-last=Austin | editor2-first=W. | title= The Psychology of Intergroup Relations | location = Chicago | publisher=Nelson-Hall | year=1986 | isbn=9780830410750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more positively one's group is perceived, the greater the positive evaluations individuals can draw from when interpreting themselves. Having a negative sense of [[self]] as Māori has group members [[internalise]] the negative evaluations into their own [[self-concept]]. Since social identities are not only descriptive but also [[evaluative]], the position of one's group within [[social hierarchy]] is viewed as central to the self-experience of individual members.&lt;ref name=tajfel86 /&gt;

Sample items in this dimension include:
*I reckon being Māori is awesome.
*I love the fact that I am Māori.
*My Māori ancestry is important to me.
*I don't really care about following Māori culture. (reverse coded)
*I wish I could hide the fact that I am Māori from other people. (reverse coded)
*Being Māori is ''not'' important to who I am as a person. (reverse coded)

===Socio-political consciousness===
''[[Socio-political]] consciousness'' reflects how active an individual is in promoting and defending [[Māori rights]] given the context of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

Issues include support for (or lack thereof) a [[Māori politics|Māori]] political party, [[resource allocation]] and [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] for the Māori based on historical injustice, and issues relating to the symbolic representation of [[Māori culture]]. A high score on this scale reflects the belief that Māori individuals need to remain loyal to the group and stay politically unified. For example, individuals who score high on this scale are more supportive of the [[Māori Party]] (a political party in New Zealand that represents the Māori), and least supportive of the [[New Zealand National Party]] (the mainstream centre-right political party currently in power). A low score on this scale reflects the belief that Māori people should operate independently and that Māori–[[Pākehā]] (non-Māori New Zealanders) historical relations are irrelevant for understanding contemporary ways of "being" Māori. Those who score low on this scale will generally endorse the dominant ideological positions, political attitudes, and intergroup attitudes of white New Zealanders.

Sample items include:
*I stand up for Māori rights.
*It's important for Māori to stand together and be strong if we want to claim back the lands that were taken from us.
*All of us, both Māori and Pākehā, did bad things in the past – we should all just forget about it. (reverse coded)
*I'm sick of hearing about the Treaty of Waitangi and how Māori had their land stolen. (reverse coded)
*I think we should all just be New Zealanders and forget about differences between Māori and Pākehā. (reverse coded)
*What the European settlers did to Māori in the past has nothing to do with me personally.  I wasn't there and I don't think it affects me at all. (reverse coded)

===Cultural efficacy and active identity engagement===
''Cultural efficacy and active identity engagement'' measures the extent to which the individual perceives they have the personal resources required to engage appropriately with other Māori in Māori social and cultural contexts. These personal resources include the ability to speak and understand [[Te Reo Māori]], knowledge of [[Tikanga Māori]] and [[Marae]] etiquette, and the ability to articulate heritage confidently (e.g., recite [[whakapapa]]).
 
A high score on this scale would reflect that an individual is comfortable and feels accepted when among other Māori or in situations which require the active expression of Māori [[traditional knowledge]] (such as participating in [[powhiri]] and [[tangihanga]]).

Sample items include:
*I know how to act the right way when I am on a [[Marae#In New Zealand|marae]].
*I'm comfortable doing Māori cultural stuff when I need to.
*I try to korero (speak) Māori whenever I can.
*I don't know how to act like a real Māori on a marae. (reverse coded)
*I can't do Māori culture or speak Māori. (reverse coded)
*I sometimes feel that I don't fit in with other Māori. (reverse coded)

===Spirituality===
''Spirituality'' measures engagement with, and [[belief]] in, certain [[Māori mythology|Māori]] spiritual concepts. This relates primarily to feeling a strong connection with ancestors, Māori traditions, the sensation and experience of waahi tapu ([[sacred places]]), and a strong spiritual attachment and feeling of connectedness with the land.

Sample items include:
*I believe that Tupuna (ancient ancestors) can communicate with you if they want to.
*I believe that my Taha Wairua (my spiritual side) is an important part of my Māori identity.
*I can sense it when I am in a Tapu place.
*I can sometimes feel my Māori ancestors watching over me.
*I don't believe that Māori spiritual stuff. (reverse coded)
*I have never felt a spiritual connection with my ancestors. (reverse coded)
*I think Tapu is just a made-up thing. It can't really affect you. (reverse coded)

===Interdependent self-concept===
''Interdependent self-concept'' measures the extent to which the concept of the self-as-Māori is defined by virtue of [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with other Māori people, rather than being defined solely as a unique and independent individual. Māori are more likely to experience [[self-conceptualization]] in terms of important relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | author=Love, C. |title= Understanding social wellbeing: Māori contributions | work=Social Policy Research and Evaluation conference |location= Wellington | date=November 2004 | url=http://www.ibrarian.net/navon/paper/Paper_Title__Understanding_social_wellbeing__Maor.pdf?paperid=3573346}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is manifested by a tendency for individuals to see their [[identity (social science)|identity]] as inherently linked to relationships with others. The MMM-ICE [[interdependent]] [[self-concept]] scale also relates to the concept of the independent versus interdependent self that has emerged in [[cross-cultural psychology]].&lt;ref name=kashima00&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-839X.00053 | issn = 1467-839X | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–48| last1 = Kashima| first1 = Emiko S.| last2 = Hardie| first2 = Elizabeth A. | title = The development and validation of the Relational, Individual, and Collective self-aspects (RIC) Scale | journal = Asian Journal of Social Psychology | date = 1 March 2000 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emiko_Kashima/publication/228588275_The_development_and_validation_of_the_Relational_Individual_and_Collective_Self-Aspects_RIC_Scale/links/0046352cbd72d85fca000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This link suggests that the concept of [[self]] for many Māori people may be inherently linked or embedded in a [[collective identity]].&lt;ref name=harrington02&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022022102033001003 | issn = 0022-0221 | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–55| last1 = Harrington| first1 = Leigh| last2 = Liu| first2 = James H. | title = Self-Enhancement and Attitudes Toward High Achievers A Bicultural View of the Independent and Interdependent Self | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | year = 2002 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Liu16/publication/247723955_Self-Enhancement_and_Attitudes_Toward_High_AchieversA_Bicultural_View_of_the_Independent_and_Interdependent_Self/links/5596e82d08ae21086d220979.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample items include:
*My relationships with other Māori people (friends and family) are what make me Māori.
*I consider myself Māori because I am interconnected with other Māori people, including friends and family.
*My Māori identity is fundamentally about my relationships with other Māori.
*My Māori identity belongs to me personally.  It has nothing to do with my relationships with other Māori. (reverse coded)

===Authenticity beliefs===
''Authenticity beliefs'' measures the extent to which the individual believes that to be a "real" Māori, one must display specific ([[stereotypical]]) features, [[knowledge]], and behaviour, as opposed to the [[belief]] that Māori identity is fluid rather than fixed and is produced through experience.

A high score on this scale therefore represents a rigid and inflexible construction of the characteristics that determine an "authentic" Māori identity. This relates to various (often Pākehā-constructed) definitions of Māori "race", such as [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]] or appearance.&lt;ref name=webster98&gt;{{cite book | publisher = University of Otago Press | isbn = 978-1-877133-48-0| last = Webster| first = Steven | title = Patrons of Maori Culture: Power, Theory, and Ideology in the Maori Renaissance | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name=wall97&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-7939.1997.tb00498.x | issn = 1745-7939 | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 40–45| last = Wall| first = Melanie | title = Stereotypical Constructions of the Maori 'Race' in the Media1 | journal = New Zealand Geographer | date = 1 September 1997}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample items include:
*You can always tell true Māori from other Māori. They're real different.
*I reckon that true Māori hang out at their marae all the time.
*True Māori always do a [[karakia]] (prayer) before important events.
*Real Māori put their [[Whānau|whanau]] first.
*To be truly Māori you need to understand your [[whakapapa]] and the history of your people.
*You can be a real Māori even if you don't know your [[Iwi]]. (reverse coded)
*You can be a true Māori without ever speaking Māori. (reverse coded)

===Perceived appearance===

''Perceived appearance'' measures the extent to which people subjectively evaluate their physical appearance as exhibiting features that signals their ethnicity as Māori.&lt;ref name=wilkins10&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.017 | issn = 0022-1031 | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 1029–1034| last1 = Wilkins| first1 = Clara L.| last2 = Kaiser| first2 = Cheryl R.| last3 = Rieck| first3 = Heather | title = Detecting racial identification: The role of phenotypic prototypicality | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | date =  October 2010 | url = https://depts.washington.edu/silab/Documents/Documents/Wilkins%20Kaiser%20Rieck%20(2010).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample items include:
*I think it is clear to other people when they look at me that I am of Māori descent.
*When people meet me, they often do not realise that I am Māori. (reverse coded)
*People who don't know me often assume that I am from another (non-Māori) ethnic group. (reverse coded)

==Research using the MMM-ICE==

Houkamau and Sibley proposed the MMM-ICE be used as an instrument for answering the question, "What does 'being Māori' mean?"&lt;ref name=houkamau10&gt;{{cite journal | last=Houkamau | first=CA | last2=Sibley | first2=CG | year=2010 | title=The Multi-Dimensional Model of Māori Identity and Cultural Engagement | journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=8–28 | url=http://www.psychology.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/Houkamau.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, they examined how those who identified solely as Māori versus those who identified partially differed in terms of a range of psychological and economic outcomes.&lt;ref name=houkamau14&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2014.03.001 | issn = 0147-1767 | volume = 40 | pages = 113–125| last1 = Houkamau| first1 = Carla A.| last2 = Sibley| first2 = Chris G. | title = Social identity and differences in psychological and economic outcomes for mixed and sole-identified Māori | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | date =  April 2014 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris_Sibley/publication/262020175_Social_identity_and_differences_in_psychological_and_economic_outcomes_for_mixed_and_sole-identified_Maori/links/5554ff5c08ae980ca60ad62f.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that those who identified as having mixed Māori and European ancestry reported significantly higher satisfaction with their standard of living, personal health, future security, and the economic situation in New Zealand. Identifying with a mixed ancestry was also associated with having political views closer to those of white New Zealanders, such as supporting the [[New Zealand National Party]]. Those who identified solely as Māori showed increased support for the [[Māori Party]], and were more supportive of bicultural policies.{{clarify|reason=Examples?|date=September 2016}}

In 2015, Houkamau and Sibley found that self-reported measures of one's appearance as Māori significantly predicted decreased rates of [[Owner-occupancy|home ownership]]. This effect held even when adjusting for numerous demographic covariates.&lt;ref name=houkamau15&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0118540 | issn = 1932-6203 | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = –0118540| last1 = Houkamau| first1 = Carla A.| last2 = Sibley| first2 = Chris G. | others = Kimmo Eriksson | title = Looking Māori Predicts Decreased Rates of Home Ownership: Institutional Racism in Housing Based on Perceived Appearance | journal = PLoS ONE  | date = 4 February 2015 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118540| bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1018540H | pmid=25738961 | pmc=4349451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Muslim Teli''' are an ethnic group found in Pakistan and India. The word ''Tel'' means ''oil'' ([[cooking oil]]) and ''Teli'' means ''person dealing with manufacture and sale of cooking oil'' in [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Related to the Muslim Teli are the [[Ghanchi (Muslim)|Ghanchi]], a community found in [[Gujarat]], who are also involved in the manufacture of cooking oil.

The members of this community converted from the Hindu [[Teli]] to Islam. They are found in [[North India]] and Pakistan.  In North India, the community is also known by the name [[Shaikh Mansuri]], while in Pakistan, they are known as [[Teli Malik]]. Actaually they have hide their cast because of English Empire. They were Rajpoots but due unfavourable conditions they have hide their cast. &lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 1061 to 1065&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
The word Teli is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word tailika or tails, which means oil pressed from mustard or sesame. The community are thus manufacturers of mustard or sesame oil. In North India, the community speaks [[Urdu]], and its dialects, [[Awadhi]] and [[Khari Boli]]. In Pakistan, the community speak [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].  They were among a number of artisan communities, that were converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 1062&lt;/ref&gt;
The Muslim Teli of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] claim descent from a Baba Hasu, who is said to have invented the kolhu or oil press. According to their traditions, their ancestor Luqman was apprenticed to the King [[David]]. Luqman attempted extract oil, but failed until taught by an old woman who suggested mixing water with the oil press.  After Luqman came Baba Budhu, and after him Mina and Baba Jasu or Baba Hasu, who was ancestor of the Punjab Telis.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of the Tribes &amp; Castes of Punjab by H. A Rose pages  462 to 464&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

=== In India ===

In India, they are found throughout North India, with concentrations in the states of [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]. The community depend on land. Their traditional occupation of oil pressing has now been replaced with the growing of cash crops and business. Many are now successful businessmen. The commuynity perceives itself to be of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] status, as they are converts from [[Vaish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1063&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uttar Pradesh, a majority of Teli are small and medium-sized farmers. Many have benefited from land reforms carried out at [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], when they were granted ownership of the land they cultivated. The Uttar Pradesh Teli are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], and are further divided into four endogamous groups, the Turkiya, Ikasna, Doasna and Dese. In terms of distribution, the Turkiya are found mainly in [[Awadh]] and [[Varanasi]], while the Ikasna and Doasna are found in western [[Uttar Pradesh]]. They speak Urdu, as well as dialects of [[Hindi language|Hindi]], and follow the [[Sunni]] sect. The Teli live in multi-caste villages, and but occupy their own distinct quarters. .&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1063&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Delhi]], the Teli are sub-divided into two communities, the Teli proper and the Teli Dhuniya. They live in the neighbourhoods of Phatak Teliya, Phatak Habash Khan, Khirwala Phatak and Borhaiya in [[Old Delhi]]. The Delhi Teli are also known as Shaikh Mansuri, and this name has replaced Teli as a self-description. They are now a community of small businessman and traders, although many are still engaged in oil pressing. A good many of the Delhi Teli emigrated to Pakistan, at [[partition of india|partition]], and now found concentrated in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Delhi Volume XX editors T K Ghosh and S Nath pages 683 to 684 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bihar, the Muslim Teli (malik) call themselves Turk Teli or Turkia. According to their traditions, the community is descended of Turk soldiers in the armies of [[Bakhtiyar Khilji]], the Muslim conqueror of Bihar. They are found throughout Bihar, and speak [[Bhojpuri]]. Like Teli elsewhere, many are now small and medium-sized businessmen, and have been more successful than other Muslim artisans castes in their adoption of the modern market economy.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 918 to 923 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

In Haryana, the Muslim Teli, who are also known as Malik, are found throughout the state, and speak [[Haryanvi]]. They are divided along sectarian divisions, with the majority being [[Sunni]] and a minority [[Shia]]. The community is further divided into three endogamous groups, the Ikasna, Doasna and Asne. These three sub-divisions are further divided into clans or [[gotra]]s, such as the Olyan, Diyya and Panwar. But the Muslim Teli practice clan exogamy, and there is a further restriction on not marrying within the village. Although Muslim, the Teli do practice a number of Hindu customs, but these are in decline. The community has abandoned its traditional occupation of oil pressing, with a small number now being cultivators. A majority however are agricultural labourers, with other others employed in the construction industry in Delhi. Like other Haryana Muslims, they were affected by the [[partition of India]], which the departure almost half the community to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Haryana Volume XXIII edited by M.L Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 485 to 489 Manohar Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teli have traditional communities councils, but they also have a formal communities association, the Mansuri Anjuman. Their traditional communities councils or panchayats are sub-divided into circles, made up of 10 to 20 villages.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1065&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Indonesians''', also '''Pribumi''' (literally "first on the soil"), is a term used to distinguish [[Indonesian people|Indonesians]] whose ancestral roots lie mainly in the archipelago from Indonesians of known (partial) foreign descent, like [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Arab Indonesians]], [[Indian Indonesians]] and [[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]] (Eurasians). 

== Etymology and historical context ==
The term "pribumi" was coined after Indonesian independence as a respectful replacement for the Dutch colonial term "inlander" (normally translated as "native" and seen as derogatory).&lt;ref&gt; William H. Frederick and Robert L. Worden, ''Indonesia: A Country Study'' (Washington: Library of Congress, 6th ed., 2011), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from Sanskrit terms ''pri'' (before) and ''bhumi'' (earth).

Following independence, the term was normally used to distinguish indigenous Indonesians from citizens of foreign descent (especially [[Chinese Indonesians]]). Common usage distinguished between "pri" and "non-pri".&lt;ref&gt;Kwik Kian Gie, in Leo Suryadinata, ''Political Thinking of the Indonesian Chinese, 1900-1995: A Sourcebook'' (Singapore University Press, 2nd ed., 1977), p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the term is sometimes translated as "indigenous", it has a broader meaning than that associated with [[Indigenous peoples]].

The term '''WNI keturunan asing''' (WNI = "Indonesian citizen", "keturunan asing" = foreign descent), sometimes just "WNI keturunan" or even "WNI", has also been used to designate "non-pri" Indonesians.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Siegel, "Early Thoughts on the Violence of May 13 and 14, 1998 in Jakarta", '''Indonesia''' 66 (Oct., 1998), p. 90 (pp. 74-108).&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, usage of the term is fluid. "Pri" is seldom used to refer to Indonesians of [[Melanesian]] descent, although it does not exclude them. Indonesians of [[Arab Indonesians|Arab]] descent sometimes refer to themselves as "pri". Indonesians with some exogenous ancestry who show no obvious signs of identification with that ancestry (such as former President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] who is said to have had Chinese ancestry) are seldom called "non-pri". The term [[bumiputra]] is sometimes used in Indonesia with the same meaning as ''pribumi'', but is more commonly used in [[Malaysia]], where it has a slightly different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Siddique and Leo Suryadinata, "Bumiputra and Pribumi: Economic Nationalism (Indiginism) in Malaysia and Indonesia", ''Pacific Affairs'', Vol. 54, No. 4 (Winter, 1981-1982), pp. 662-687.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''putra daerah'' ("son of the region") refers to a person who is indigenous to a specific locality or region. 

In 1998, the Indonesian government of President [[B.J. Habibie]] instructed that neither ''pri'' nor ''non-pri'' should be used, on the grounds that they promoted ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Purdey |first= Jemma |title= Anti-Chinese Violence in Indonesia, 1996–1999 |year= 2006 |publisher=Singapore University Press |location= Singapore |isbn=9971-69-332-1 |page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.hukumonline.com/klinik/detail/lt59e581d832a82/dasar-hukum-yang-melarang-penggunaan-istilah-%E2%80%9Cpribumi%E2%80%9D |title= Dasar Hukum yang Melarang Penggunaan Istilah "Pribumi"|trans-title= Law that based ban of "Pribumi" term|last= Hasanah|first= Sovia|date= 2017-10-17|website= hukumonline.com|publisher= hukumonline.com|access-date= 2018-06-11|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch East India Company]], which dominated parts of the archipelago from the 17th century, classified its subjects mainly by religion, rather than ethnicity. The colonial administration which took power in 1815 at shifted to a system of ethnic classification. Initially they distinguished between Europeans (''Europeanen'') and those equated with them (including native Christians) and ''Inlanders'' and those equated with them (including non-Christian Asians).

Over time, native Christians were gradually shifted de facto into the ''Inlander'' category, while [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Arab Indonesians]] and others of non-Indonesian descent were gradually given separate status as ''Vreemde Oosterlingen'' ("Foreign Orientals"). The system was patriarchal, rather than formally racial. A child inherited his/her father's ethnicity if the parents were married; the mother's ethnicity if they were unmarried. The off-spring of a marriage between a European man and an Indonesian women were legally European.

The colonial system was similar to the [[casta]] system in [[Hispanic America]], or the South African [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid system]], which [[racial segregation|prohibited inter-racial neighborhoods]] (''wet van wijkenstelsel'') and inter-racial interactions were limited by ''passenstelsel'' laws.&lt;ref name="Pribumi"/&gt;

The outbreak of the [[World War II]] saw the fall of colonial state of Dutch East Indies. During Japanese occupation, the Dutch colonials were put into the lowest class of social strata. Native blood was the only thing that could free Indos (mixed Eurasian ancenstry) from being put into concentration camps.&lt;ref name="bersiap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is responsible for ‘Bersiap’?|first=Calvin Michel|last=Sidjaja|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/22/who-responsible-bersiap.html|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following [[Indonesian Revolution]] (1945-1949) saw the rise of Indonesian Republic, subsequently the revolution has brought a drastic social changes. The Dutch colonials and the Indos are suspiciously considered by republicans as Dutch loyalist, thus they are not a desired element in the newly established republic. By 1950s, large numbers of Dutch colonials and Indos were being repatriated to the Netherlands.

After the revolution, the natives majority has gained the political, social and economic power previously reserved only for Dutch colonials. In post colonial Indonesia, the [[Chinese Indonesians]] are the most significant minority group that being categorized as ''non-pribumi'' (non native).

Today, [[Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language of the Language Center|Indonesian dictionary]] describes ''pribumi'' as ''penghuni asli'' which translated into "original, native or indigenous inhabitant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pribumi | work=KBBI | language=Indonesian | url=http://kbbi.web.id/pribumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pribumi make up about 95% of the Indonesian population.&lt;ref name="Pribumi"/&gt; Using Indonesia’s population estimate in 2006, this translates to about 230 million people. As an umbrella of similar cultural heritage among various ethnic groups in Indonesia, Pribumi culture plays a significant role in shaping the country’s socioeconomic circumstance.

The United States [[Library of Congress]] Country Study of Indonesia defines ''Pribumi'' as:
{{Quote|Literally, an indigene, or native. In the colonial era, the great majority of the population of the archipelago came to regard themselves as indigenous, in contrast to the non-indigenous Dutch and Chinese (and, to a degree, Arab) communities. After independence the distinction persisted, expressed as a dichotomy between elements that were ''pribumi'' and those that were not. The distinction has had significant implications for economic development policy|''Indonesia: A Country Study''|Glossary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are over 300 ethnic groups in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference. Page 88. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel &amp; JPM Publications&lt;/ref&gt; 200 of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.

The largest ethnic group in Indonesia are the [[Javanese people]] who make up 41% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of [[Java]] but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies| title =Indonesia's Population: Ethnicity and Religion in a Changing Political Landscape| date = | year =2003 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] are the next largest groups in the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many ethnic groups, particularly in [[Kalimantan]] and the province of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family, although a significant number, particularly in [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], speak [[Papuan languages]].

The division and classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases are unclear as the result of migrations, along with cultural and linguistic influences; for example some{{who|date=June 2012}} may agree that the Bantenese and [[Cirebonese]] belong to different ethnic groups with their own distinct dialect, however others{{who|date=June 2012}} might consider them to be Javanese sub-ethnicities, as members of the larger [[Javanese people]]. The same considerations may apply to the [[Baduy people]] who share so many similarities with the [[Sundanese people]] that they can be considered as belonging to the same ethnic group. The clearest example of hybrid ethnicity are the [[Betawi people]], the result of a mixture of different native ethnicities that have merged with people of Arab, Chinese and Indian origins since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).

== Physical characteristics ==
The skin color of native Indonesians ranges from fair skin with yellowish undertone to light brown to very dark brown or black skin color. Archaeologist [[Peter Bellwood]] claims that the "vast majority" of people in Indonesia and Malaysia, the region he calls the "clinal [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]-[[Australoid race|Australoid]] zone", are "Southern Mongoloids" but have a "high degree" of Australoid admixture.&lt;!--p.89,92--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood, Peter. ''Pre-History of the Indo-malaysian Archipelago.'' Australian National University:1985. {{ISBN|978-1-921313-11-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sawo matang'' (lit. "ripe [[sapodilla]]") usually refers to the skin colour of the Pribumis in Indonesia which connotes "mid light to dark tone brown" especially for those who live in Java, Bali, Sumatra, etc. For other places like in Borneo, Sulawesi, and eastern parts of Indonesia, native people tend to have darker skin colour who actually come from the east of Indonesia{{clarify|date=August 2016}} and for those who live in high altitude areas and highlands tend to have lighter skin colour like people from [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Manado]], [[Tomohon]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], etc. For islandic people,{{clarify|date=August 2016}} they tend to have dark skin colour which all of the physical characteristics depend on the geographical areas they inhabit.

== Genetic research ==
Most Native Indonesians are genetically close to [[Asians]] while the more eastern one goes the more people show [[Melanesian]] affinity. Geneticist [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] claims that there is a genetic division between [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cavalli-Sforza |first1=L. Luca |title=The Chinese human genome diversity project |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=29 September 1998 |volume=95 |issue=20 |pages=11501-3 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.20.11501 |pmid=9751692 |pmc=33897}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, Zhou Jixu agrees that there is a physical difference between these two populations.&lt;ref&gt;http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp175_chinese_civilization_agriculture.pdf
The Rise of Agricultural Civilization in China, Sino-Platonic Papers 175, Zhou Jixu, citing Ho Ping-ti, {{ISBN|0-226-34524-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other geneticists have found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non-recombining [[Y chromosome]] lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: [[North Asians]], [[Han Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Southeast Asians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tajima |first1=Atsushi |last2=Pan |first2=I-Hung |last3=Fucharoen |first3=Goonnapa |last4=Fucharoen |first4=Supan |last5=Matsuo |first5=Masafumi |last6=Tokunaga |first6=Katsushi |last7=Juji |first7=Takeo |last8=Hayami |first8=Masanori |last9=Omoto |first9=Keiichi |last10=Horai |first10=Satoshi |title=Three major lineages of Asian Y chromosomes: implications for the peopling of east and southeast Asia |journal=Human Genetics |date=28 November 2001 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=80–88 |doi=10.1007/s00439-001-0651-9 |pmid=11810301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of genetic data has led to doubt about the usefulness of the concept of a Mongoloid race itself, since distinctive East Asian features may represent separate lineages and arise from environmental adaptations or retention of common proto-Eurasian ancestral characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Mongoloid&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions of Indonesia have some of their ''indigenous'' ethnic groups. Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions.

The '''New Haven Lawn Club''' is a private club located on [[Whitney Avenue]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] close to [[Yale University]].  It is a social and athletic facility.  

The club is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=03000309}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: New Haven Lawn Club |date=March 7, 2003 |author=Christopher Wigren |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=03000309|title=''Accompanying 20 photos, exterior and interior, from 2002 (see captions page 26 of text document)''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One building and one structure of the club are deemed [[contributing property|contributing to the historic character]] while another building and three structures are non-contributing.  The architecture of the clubhouse is primarily [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] with [[Art Moderne]] decorative elements.  The clubhouse, built in 1931 to replace the former clubhouse that had burned in 1929, is credited to architect Douglas W. Orr, but much of the detail design is by William Douglas.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;

The club offers [[tennis]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and outdoor [[human swimming|swimming]],&lt;ref name="lawn club activities"&gt;[http://www.nhlawnclub.com/?page_id=96 Lawn Club Activities Page]&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the most prestigious clubs in the area.&lt;ref name="Who Rules"&gt;[http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/local/new_haven.html  Who Really Ruled in Dahl's New Haven?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:NH Lawn Club in 2007.JPG|thumb|Sign of the New Haven Lawn Club]]
The Club was founded in 1891 by a group of New Haven residents. The original clubhouse was destroyed by fire in 1929. Renowned [[architect]] [[Douglas Orr]] designed the current facility. As of 2005, over 520 families were counted among its membership.

It originally hosted [[lawn tennis]], now more commonly known as [[court tennis]], reflecting a fad brought from England.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;

==Activities==
The New Haven Lawn Club offers a wide range of activities and events including tennis, swimming, food, art exhibits, concerts, book clubs, yoga and pilates. The Club is also a venue for many of New Haven's prestigious dances.

==Facilities==
The Lawn Club mansion is rich with architectural details. Visitors enter the foyer through a vaulted portico, archways, and columns made of the local red brick. Octagonal windows look out over the manicured Lawn Club grounds. A Lalique crystal chandelier graces the foyer and working fireplaces are found throughout the building. The New Haven Lawn Club is home to several event rooms.

The Grand Ballroom, is the club's largest event space and with a 225-person occupancy. The Ballroom has a [[barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] ceiling, a performance stage, and hardwood floors. The event space includes a [[terrazzo]] entryway and fireplace.

The club's Main Dining Room seats 120 people. Two wood burning fireplaces mirror each other at opposite ends of the hall, with terrazzo flooring between them. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of the Lawn Club grounds and the attached terrace overlooks the tennis courts.

[[File:Wizjalokalna.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Polish book cover]]

'''''Observation on the Spot''''' (Polish ''Wizja lokalna'', with the common meaning of the expression being "crime scene investigation") is a [[social science fiction]] novel by [[Stanisław Lem]]. The novel is a report of [[Ijon Tichy]]'s travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from [[The Star Diaries|Tichy's Fourteenth Voyage]] to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia,  masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the "Institute of Historiographical Computers" (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use [[predictive modeling]] to overcome the [[speed of light]] limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions.

Major themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the "ethicsphere" which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of [[Western World]]-[[Soviet Union]] split taken to the absurd.

The original novel was first printed by [[Wydawnictwo Literackie]] in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title ''Lokaltermin'' in 1987 ({{ISBN|3-518-37955-0}}).

Lacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as ''"Eyewitness Account"'' and ''"The Scene of the Crime"''.&lt;ref name=sfs/&gt;

''[[Science Fiction Studies]]'' published a collection of excerpts from Lem's letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981.&lt;ref name=sfs&gt; "On the Genesis of ''Wizja Lokalna''" in: [https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/abstracts/a40.htm Science Fiction Studies #40 = Volume 13, Part 3 = November 1986, Article Abstracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from "kurdl") and Luzania. These names require some explanations.

''Kurdl'' is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem's invention, used in earlier tales about Tichy. (In Polish it is ''kurdel'', however in [[declension]]s of the word the [[root (linguistics)|root]] converts into "kurdl-", hence there are no associations with the English word "curdle"). The name "Luzania" derives from the Polish root "luz-" with the meaning of "loose", "not restrained"; the choice will become clear below.

Kurdlandia's guiding ideology is "national mobilism", that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are "able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl", in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it.

The other state, Luzania, constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an "ideal state" in Lem (and many would argue, in all science fiction). Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of "ethicsphere" (compare "atmosphere"). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized [[nanobots]] called "bystry" ("quickies" in English) that serve to control matter in the 'quickated' areas. The primary function of the 'quickies' is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the 'quickies' would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet.

The 'quickies' also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the 'quickies' are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that 'quickies' can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement.

There exists ideological opposition between the collectivist Kurdlandia and the generally libertarian Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the 'quickies' and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the 'quickies', depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the 'quickies' areas.

The main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="684">The '''Otomi''' or '''Otontin''' were an elite [[Aztec]] military order, named after the [[Otomi people]].

The Otomies (Otontin [21]) were another warrior society who took their name after the Otomi people who were renowned for their fierce fighting. In the historical sources it is often difficult to discern whether the word otomitl "Otomi" refers to members of the Aztec warrior society, or members of the Otomí ethnic group who also often joined the Aztec armies as mercenaries or allies.

[[File:USRadiumGirls-Argonne1,ca1922-23-150dpi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Radium dial painters working in a factory]]
The '''Radium Girls''' were female factory workers who contracted [[radiation poisoning]] from painting watch dials with [[radioluminescence|self-luminous]] paint. Painting was done by women at three different sites in the United States, and the term now applies to the women working at the facilities: the first, a [[United States Radium Corporation|United States Radium]] factory in [[Orange, New Jersey]], beginning around 1917; the facility at [[Ottawa, Illinois]], beginning in the early 1920s; and a third facility in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]].

The women in each facility had been told the paint was harmless, and subsequently ingested deadly amounts of [[radium]] after being instructed to "point" their brushes on their lips in order to give them a fine point; some also painted their fingernails, face and teeth with the glowing substance. The women were instructed to point their brushes because using rags, or a water rinse, caused them to waste too much time and waste too much of the material made from powdered radium, [[Gum Arabic|gum arabic]] and water.

Five of the women in New Jersey challenged their employer in a case over the right of individual workers who contract [[occupational disease]]s to sue their employers under New Jersey's occupational injuries law, which at the time had a two-year statute of limitations, but settled out of court in 1928. Five women in Illinois who were employees of the Radium Dial Company (which was unaffiliated with the United States Radium Corporation) sued their employer under Illinois law, winning damages in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==United States Radium Corporation==
{{Main article|United States Radium Corporation}}
[[File:Undark (Radium Girls) advertisement, 1921, retouched.png|right|thumb|250px|1921 advertisement for Undark]]
From 1917 to 1926, U.S. Radium Corporation, originally called the [[Radium Luminous Material Corporation]], was engaged in the extraction and purification of [[radium]] from [[carnotite]] ore to produce [[luminous paint]]s, which were marketed under the brand name "[[Undark]]". The ore was mined from the [[Paradox Valley]] in [[Colorado]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5559255/smithsonian_displays_ore_containing/|title=Smithsonian displays ore containing radium, United States Radium Corporation (1921) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other "Undark mines" in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5559270/museums_holding_exhibits_to_explain/|title=Museums holding exhibits to explain uses of radium, United States Radium Corporation (1922) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[defense contractor]], U.S. Radium was a major supplier of [[Radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] watches to the military. Their plant in Orange, New Jersey, employed over one hundred workers, mainly women, to paint radium-lit watch faces and instruments, misleading them that it was safe.

===Radiation exposure===
The U.S. Radium Corporation hired approximately 70 women to perform various tasks including handling radium, while the owners and the scientists familiar with the effects of radium carefully avoided any exposure to it themselves; chemists at the plant used lead screens, masks and tongs.&lt;ref name=interesting&gt;http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=660&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Radium had distributed literature to the medical community describing the "injurious effects" of radium. In spite of this knowledge, a number of similar deaths had occurred by 1925, including the company's chief chemist, Dr. Edwin E. Leman, and several female workers. The similar circumstances of their deaths prompted investigations to be undertaken by Dr. Harrison Martland, County Physician of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5559220/us_starts_probe_of_radium_poison_deaths/|title=US Starts Probe of Radium Poison Deaths in Jersey, United States Radium Corporation (1925) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 4,000 workers were hired by corporations in the U.S. and Canada to paint watch faces with radium.
At USRC, each of the painters mixed her own paint in small [[crucible]]s, and then used [[camel hair brush]]es to apply the glowing paint onto dials.  The then-current rate of pay, for painting 250 dials a day, was about a penny and a half per dial ({{inflation|US|0.015|1917|fmt=eq|r=3}}).  The brushes would lose shape after a few strokes, so the U.S. Radium supervisors encouraged their workers to point the brushes with their lips ("lip, dip, paint"), or use their tongues to keep them sharp. Because the true nature of the radium had been kept from them, the Radium Girls painted their nails, teeth, and faces for fun with the deadly paint produced at the factory.&lt;ref name="NYT_1998-10-06"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=November 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the workers became sick; it is unknown how many died from exposure to radiation.

===Radiation sickness===

Many of the women later began to suffer from [[anemia]], bone fractures and [[necrosis]] of the jaw, a condition now known as [[radium jaw]]. It is thought that the [[X-ray]] machines used by the medical investigators may have contributed to some of the sickened workers' ill-health by subjecting them to additional radiation. It turned out at least one of the examinations was a ruse, part of a campaign of [[disinformation]] started by the defense contractor.&lt;ref name=interesting/&gt; U.S. Radium and other watch-dial companies rejected claims that the afflicted workers were suffering from exposure to radium.  For some time, doctors, dentists, and researchers complied with requests from the companies not to release their data.  At the urging of the companies, worker deaths were attributed by medical professionals to other causes; [[syphilis]], a notorious [[sexually transmitted infection]] at the time, was often cited in attempts to smear the reputations of the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mullner |first=R. |title=Deadly Glow: The Radium Dial Worker Tragedy |publisher=[[American Public Health Association]] |year=1999 |isbn=9780875532455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventor of radium dial paint, Dr Sabin A. Von Sochocky, died in November 1928, becoming the 16th known victim of poisoning by radium dial paint. He had gotten sick from radium in his hands, not the jaw, however the circumstances of his death helped the Radium Girls in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3474048/dr_s_von_sochocky_death_notice/|title=Dr S. von Sochocky death notice - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radium Dial Company==

The [[Radium Dial Company]] was established in Ottawa, Illinois, in 1922, in the town's former high school.  Like the United States Radium Corporation, the purpose of the studio in Ottawa was to paint dials for clocks, their largest client being [[Westclox|Westclox Corporation]] in [[Peru, Illinois]]. Dials painted in Ottawa appeared on Westclox's popular Big Ben, Little Ben and travel clocks; and like United States Radium Corporation, Radium Dial hired young women to paint the dials, using the same "lip, dip, paint" approach as the women in New Jersey and by another unaffiliated plant in Waterbury, Connecticut, that supplied the [[Timex_Group_USA|Waterbury Clock Company]].

Following the termination of President Joseph Kelly from the concern, Kelly established a competing firm in the town named Luminous Process Company, which also employed women in the same fashion, and in the conditions as the other firms.  Employees at Radium Dial began showing signs of radium poisoning in 1926-1927, and were unaware of the hearings and trials in New Jersey.  Furthermore, Radium Dial leadership authorized physicals and other tests designed to determine the toxicity of its employees, but the company never turned those records to the employees or told them of the results.  In a half-hearted attempt to end the use of the camel hair brushes, management introduced glass pens with a fine point; however, the workers found that the pens slowed down their productivity (they were paid by the piece), and they reverted to using brushes.  When word of the New Jersey women and their suits appeared in local newspapers, the women were told that the radium was safe, and that employees in New Jersey were showing signs of viral infections.  Assured by their employers that the radium was safe, they returned to work as usual.

==Significance==

===Litigation===

In New Jersey, the story of the abuse perpetrated against the workers is distinguished from most such cases by the fact that the ensuing litigation was covered widely by the media.  Plant worker [[Grace Fryer]] decided to sue, but it took two years for her to find a lawyer willing to take on U.S. Radium.  Even after the women found a lawyer, the slow-moving courts held out for months.  At their first appearance in court on January 1928, two women were bedridden and none of them could raise their arms to take an oath.  A total of five factory workers – Grace Fryer, Edna Hussman, Katherine Schaub, and sisters Quinta McDonald and Albina Larice – dubbed the Radium Girls, joined the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5559067/women_radium_victims_offer_selves_for/|title=Women radium victims offer selves for test while alive, United States Radium Corporation (1928) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The litigation and media sensation surrounding the case established [[Precedent|legal precedents]] and triggered the enactment of regulations governing [[Occupational safety and health|labor safety]] standards, including a baseline of "[[provable suffering]]".

In Illinois, employees began asking for compensation for their medical and dental bills as early as 1927, but were refused by management. The demand for money by sick and dying former employees continued into the mid 1930s before a suit before the Illinois Industrial Commission (IIC) was brought.  In 1937 five women found an attorney by the name of Leonard Grossman, that would represent them in front of the commission, but by this time, Radium Dial had closed, moving to New York.  The IIC did retain a $10,000 deposit left by Radium Dial when it disclosed to the IIC that they could not find any insurance to cover the cost of indemnifying the company against employee suits. In the spring of 1938, the IIC ruled in favor of the women.  The attorney representing the interests of Radium Dial appealed hoping to get the verdict overturned, and again the commission judge found for the women. Radium Dial appealed over and over, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court and on October 23, 1939, the court decided not to hear the appeal and the lower ruling was upheld. In the end, this case had been won eight times before Radium Dial was finally forced to pay.

===Historical impact===

The Radium Girls' saga holds an important place in the history of both the field of [[health physics]] and the [[labor rights]] movement. The right of individual workers to sue for damages from corporations due to labor abuse was established as a result of the Radium Girls case.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the wake of the case, industrial safety standards were demonstrably enhanced for many decades.

The case was settled in the autumn of 1928, before the trial was deliberated by the jury, and the settlement for each of the Radium Girls was $10,000 ({{inflation|US|10000|1928|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) and a $600 per year annuity plus $12 a week for all of their lives ({{inflation|US|600|1928|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) while they lived, and all medical and legal expenses incurred would also be paid by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kovarik | first = Bill | title = The Radium Girls | work = (originally published as chapter eight of ''Mass Media and Environmental Conflict'') | publisher = RUNet.edu | year = 2002 | url = http://www.rst2.edu/ties/radon/ramfordu/pdffiles/The%20Radium%20Girls.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050105021031/http://www.rst2.edu/ties/radon/ramfordu/pdffiles/The%20Radium%20Girls.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2005-01-05 | accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit and resulting publicity was a factor in the establishment of [[occupational disease]] [[labor law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/radium.html|title=Mass Media &amp; Environmental Conflict - Radium Girls|accessdate=2009-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721113733/http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/radium.html|archivedate=2009-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Radium dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear; in particular, they no longer shaped paint brushes by lip and avoided ingesting or breathing the paint. Radium paint was still used in dials as late as the 1960s.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Second River radium site WOrange jeh.jpg|thumb|Former factory site]]

===Scientific impact===

[[Robley D. Evans (physicist)|Robley D. Evans]] made the first measurements of exhaled [[radon]] and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At [[MIT]] he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to establish the [[tolerance level]] for radium of 0.1 [[micro-|μ]][[curie|Ci]] (3.7 [[kilo-|k]][[becquerel|Bq]]).

The Center for Human Radiobiology was established at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in 1968. The primary purpose of the Center was providing medical examinations for living dial painters. The project also focused on collection of information and, in some cases, [[Sampling (medicine)|tissue samples]] from the radium dial painters. When the project ended in 1993, detailed information of 2,403 cases had been collected. This led to a book on the effects of radium on humans. The book suggests that radium-228 exposure is more harmful to health than exposure to radium-226. Radium-228 is more able to cause cancer of the bone as the shorter half life of the radon-220 product compared to radon-222 causes the daughter nuclides of radium-228 to deliver a greater dose of alpha radiation to the bones. It also considers the induction of a range of different forms of cancer as a result of internal exposure to radium and its daughter nuclides. The book used data from radium dial painters, people who were exposed as a result of the use of radium-containing medical products, and other groups of people who have been exposed to radium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Roxalana "Roxana" Druse''' (née Teftt; born ca. 1847 &amp;ndash; hanged February 28, 1887), was the last woman [[hanged]] in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The first woman to be hanged in four decades in Central New York, her botched execution resulted in the decision to replace the [[gallows]] with the [[electric chair]] in 1890.

Mrs. Druse murdered her husband, William Druse, in their home in [[Warren, New York]]. The murder unfolded with the help of her son and daughter, George and Mary Druse, and nephew Frank Gates. The family members were threatened with death if they refused and therefore, they all had an involvement with the murder case as a whole. Druse claimed that her motive was that her husband was abusive to her and was not supporting the family because he had left  for a number of days after an argument. Frank Gates and George Druse were later released due to lack of involvement of the murder. During the trial, Mary Druse admitted to assisting in the murder, and was sentenced to life at the Onondaga Country penitentiary. On October 6, 1885 Roxalana was sentenced to be hanged  on November 25, 1885 but, due to multiple changes, this was changed to a final, official date of February 28, 1887.

==Events of the murder==
On December 18th, 1884, in the morning before the murder, the Druse couple had a fight. Fights were common between the Druses, and many residents reported signs of foul play. The couple were known in the community for their arguments and disagreements (which the Defense later presented to the jury to convince them that Mr. Druse was in fact abusive to his wife). During this dispute, Roxalana concealed a revolver under her apron which was placed by her in another room. Upon instruction from his mother, George Druse, aged ten, left the house while sister and daughter of the couple Mary Druse, aged nineteen, remained in the house.

Mary then tied a rope around her father's neck while Mrs. Druse fired the revolver wounding Mr. Druse. Due to misuse of the weapon, Roxalana forced fourteen-year-old nephew Frank Gates to further fire at her husband. After pleading for help and unable to move, Mr. Druse was decapitated by his wife wielding an axe. The body, along with the head, were then taken into the parlor, where they remained for the day. There, Mrs. Druse cut up her husband’s body and burnt it to ash on a stove. She also burned William’s clothes to further destroy evidence and erase his traces from the house. False documents were produced which read that Mr. Druse had left the house after an argument and his whereabouts were unknown. In order to further the idea that William disappeared, Roxalana threatened that she would kill her daughter and the boys, (who were playing checkers), if they admitted to the crime. The ashes were dumped in a nearby swamp, while the murder weapon and revolver were wrapped up and dumped in a pond.

On December 18, 1884, William Druse was reported missing by the police due to his sudden disappearance. Investigation lead to finding the murder weapon, an axe sold previously to William Druse, wrapped in paper in a pond along with the revolver. Multiple allegations were reported against wife Roxalana, yet due to lack of evidence, nothing was officially reported.  On January 16, 1885, Frank Gates admitted to the crime after consistent harassment from neighbors. Gates and Mrs. Druse were then arrested and brought to trial on September 21, 1885, which lasted nearly two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkimer.nygenweb.net/warren/druseroxalana.html ''The Notorious Roxana Druse Murder Case, Part 2]''. Accessed 2014-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
When Druse was sentenced to death in [[Herkimer County, New York]], suspension hanging was the method of execution. The process jerked the prisoner upwards by a weighted rope instead of the body dropping downwards through a trap door. But as Druse was a small woman, the force failed to break her neck leaving her to die agonizingly by [[strangulation]]. The scene was so upsetting, officials decided to switch the primary method of execution in the state to the electric chair. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==History==
The first mass-immigration of  Russians into Armenia occurred in the late 18th century when [[Molokan]]s, a break-off sect of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], were deported to [[Amasya]] and [[Sevan, Armenia|Sevan]], with some 5000 of their descendants still living in the nation.&lt;ref name="TAC"/&gt;

After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish war]] of 1828-1829 many Russians immigrated to [[Russian Armenia]], establishing businesses and churches, and settling throughout [[Geography of Armenia|mountainous northwest]] of the country. The largest number, however, came from post-[[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] immigration, where Orthodox Russians fleeing persecution under the new Soviet regime came to Armenia. Outward migration of Russians increased after 1990, during the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], when [[Armenian language|Armenian]] became the official language of the nation.&lt;ref name="TAC"/&gt;

Traditional Russian villages can still be found in Amassia, Ashotsk (Shirak), [[Sevan (city)|Sevan]] and Semyonvka ([[Gegharkunik Province]]), Filoetovo, [[Lermontov, Armenia|Lermontov]], [[Pushkino, Armenia|Pushkino]], [[Sverdlov, Armenia|Sverdlov]], Lernantsk, Medovka, Lerhovit, Petrovka, [[Tashir]] and Mikaielovska ([[Lori Province]]).

'''Sambyal''' are [[Dogra Rajput]], who migrated to the [[Shivalik Hills]] of the [[Jammu Division]], from the [[Rajputana]] (Present Day [[Rajasthan]]) many centuries ago.Majority of the Sambyal Rajputs are settled in the [[Samba District]] of [[Jammu Division]] in the State of [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]].Sambyal Rajputs are also settled in the [[Kangra District]] and [[Chamba District]] in the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Apart from [[Hindi]], [[Dogri]] is the most spoken language among Sambyal Rajputs. Dogri sounds somewhat similar to [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] but it has been recognized as an official language and has been included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Serving in defence forces has been a long time tradition among Sambyal Dogra Rajputs. The area around Samba City is a conglomerate of 22 villages commonly called 'Mandis' in local parlance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9513">{{About|the initiatory Order|the Jesuit school|Stella Matutina (Jesuit School)}}
The '''Stella Matutina''' (Morning Star) was an initiatory [[magical order]] dedicated to the dissemination of the traditional teachings of the earlier [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Originally, the outer order of the Stella Matutina was known as ''Mystic Rose'' or ''Order of the M.R. in the Outer''.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, 1989, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, when [[occult]] [[author]] [[Israel Regardie]] released the documents of the Golden Dawn to the general public for the first time, it was not the teachings of the original order, but those of the Stella Matutina that he revealed. The Stella Matutina was one of several daughter organisations into which the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] fragmented, including the [[Alpha et Omega]] led by [[John William Brodie-Innes]] and [[Macgregor Mathers]], the [[Isis-Urania Temple]] led by [[A.E. Waite]], and others.

==Origins==
After a revolt of London Adepts against the then-head of the Order ([[Samuel MacGregor Mathers]]) in early 1900, the Order segmented into two new groups.  Those who remained loyal to Mathers took on the name [[Alpha et Omega]], while the London group took on the name Hermetic Society of the Morgenrothe.  The latter group retained such members as [[Robert Felkin]] (a British doctor), [[John William Brodie-Innes]], [[A.E. Waite]], [[William Alexander Ayton|Rev. Ayton]], [[W.B. Yeats]] and others.&lt;ref name="llewellyn"&gt;{{cite web |website=Llewellyn Encyclopedia |url=http://www.llewellynencyclopedia.com/article/35 |title=Golden Dawn Time Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgenrothe had a very short existence before it, too, schismed into two groups.  Those who were most interested in Christian Mysticism (led by A.E. Waite) took over the remnants of [[Isis-Urania Temple|Isis-Urania]], and formed the Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn, and later the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].  Those from the Morgerothe who were more interested in occultism (led by Dr. Felkin) formed the group "Stella Matutina"- naming their Mother Temple "Amoun."&lt;ref name="llewellyn"/&gt;

The outer order was changed by Dr. Felkin and other members of the Golden Dawn based in [[London]].&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; Among others who helped form Stella Matutina was J.W. Brodie-Innes, though he soon made peace with Mathers and left for the [[Alpha et Omega]].&lt;ref name="llewellyn" /&gt;[

The first gesture of independence brought a committee of twelve to govern for a year. Further developments forced them to realise that this was far from satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, 1989, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; With pettiness and further dispute, they abandoned every reform and went back to the original scheme of appointing three chiefs to lead and govern them.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, 1989, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

While visiting [[New Zealand]] in 1912, Dr. Felkin issued a Warrant for the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 (commonly referred to as [[Whare Ra]] ([[Maori language|Maori]] for "House of the Sun")), which operated in the basement of his purpose built home at [[Havelock North]], in the [[Hawke's Bay]] Region. Felkin's visit  was closely associated with the ''New Zealand Province of the Societas Rosicruciana''.&lt;ref name="francis"&gt;King, 1989, page 106&lt;/ref&gt; The stay was supposed to be permanent, but Mr. Meakin, who was to take over as chief of the Amoun Temple, died in the autumn of 1912.&lt;ref name="francis"/&gt; Felkin returned to England, but moved to New Zealand permanently in 1916.

During the next few years, Felkin established Hermes Lodge in [[Bristol]], the Secret College in [[London]], and Merlin Lodge, also in London.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Amoun Temple of the Stella Matutina in London closed its doors in 1919.&lt;ref name="frking"&gt;King, 1989, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; due to two members becoming [[schizophrenic]], one of whom, a [[clergyman]], was later to die in a [[mental institution]].&lt;ref name="frking"/&gt;

In 1933, [[Israel Regardie]] joined the Hermes Temple in Bristol,&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, 1989, page 208&lt;/ref&gt; and resigned from Amoun Temple in 1934, finding it, according to him, in a state of low morale and decay. Many of the original Golden Dawn's Knowledge Lectures had been "removed or heavily amended, largely because they were beyond the capacity of the chiefs."&lt;ref name="regardie"&gt;King, 1989, page 154&lt;/ref&gt; These same chiefs claimed "extraordinarily exalted" grades, but Regardie found them lacking. As an example, he recounted that no one in the temple knew how to play [[Enochian chess]], in fact the Order's chess set had never been used.&lt;ref name="regardie"/&gt; He constructed his own boards and he challenged his superiors in the Order to play: all refused with excuses.&lt;ref name="regardie"/&gt;

By 1939, Stella Matutina became largely dormant, although the Hermes Temple continued until 1970. Whare Ra in New Zealand continued until 1978.&lt;ref name="llewellyn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, 1986, {{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asserting independence==
From the very beginning, Felkin believed that the Order must in fact gain contact with the [[Secret Chiefs]] by the use of [[Astral plane|astral]] work and communications which were received through either trance or automatic writing,&lt;ref name="fking"&gt;King, 1989, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his wish that there should be unity among the [[Rosicrucian]]s. Great importance was given to these messages, which were coming in considerable numbers, some of which gave approval to make changes to the rituals.&lt;ref name="fking"/&gt; Felkin constructed new rituals for the Stella Matutina, which included ''Adeptus Major'', ''Adeptus Exemptus'', and ''Magister Templi'', all of which bear resemblance to the original Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Degree rituals of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] before they were rewritten by [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name="francis"/&gt;

At this point, according to Francis King, the chiefs of the Amoun Temple were addicted to mediumship and [[astral travel]]. Their interpretation of the Golden Dawn techniques of astral projection and travel appears to have been derived from [[Florence Farr]]'s ''Sphere'' group.&lt;ref name="frking"/&gt;

There were two main astral entities contacted. The first group were Rosicrucian, in which at times the medium believed to be controlled by [[Christian Rosenkreuz]] himself. The second were called Arabs, said to be the teachers of the Rosicrucians.&lt;ref name="frking"/&gt; The orders given by these "Arabs" had a substantial effect on the policies. For example, instructions received on January 9, 1915 was put into effect by the foundation of the [[Anglican]] spiritual healers organisation called the ''Guild of St. Raphael'', as Francis King notes, "were almost without exception, members of the Stella Matutina".&lt;ref&gt;King, 1989, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; Recent documentary evidence, however, suggests King may have been mistaken and the Guild was not linked to Felkin (Chrism, 2006, p2)

Felkin was not satisfied with astral meetings as he wished for physical contact with the Secret Chiefs. From 1901 onwards, he traveled extensively in hoping to meet authentic Rosicrucians.&lt;ref&gt;King, 1989, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, he believed he had found what he was looking for: a professor, his adopted daughter, and another gentleman, all who he believed were in fact Rosicrucians. The professors' adopted daughter had claimed to be the niece of [[Anna Sprengel]] (the Secret Chief who authorised the founding of the original Golden Dawn), and also claimed that her aunt was a member of the same organization as herself.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;King, 1989, page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported Rosicrucian group which Felkin had made contact with was led by [[Rudolf Steiner]], founder of the [[Anthroposophical]] Society, and at that time, still head of the [[Germany|German]] section of the [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical]] Society. King explains that it didn't appear as though this group was Theosophical, nor did it appear to be any later form of Anthroposophy. He speculates that, since Steiner was at that time also the [[Austria]]n Chief of Ordo Templi Orientis, his first Rosicrucian grade bore resemblance to the original first Degree of O.T.O.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">'''BaTalaote'''{{Pronunciation needed}} are an ethnic group found in the central district of [[Botswana]] and south-western parts of [[Zimbabwe]]. They are part of a large group of ethnic groups called [[Bakalanga]]. Over the years Batalaote lost their language and adopted Kalanga for those in Zimbabwe and [[Sengwato]], which is spoken by the [[Bangwato]],  for those in Botswana. The Talaunda and the [[Wadoma]] could share a common ancestor. Both tribes have significantly high cases of [[ectrodactyly]].{{cn| date= October 2017}}

Batalaote (sometimes spelt "Talaunda") meaning glance back while trudging on, are a very large tribe even though they are divided and live in various parts of Botswana and Western Zimbabwe. They are Rozvi people and their totem is a heart/pelo/moyo and they do not pierce their ears. They are a very peaceful tribe which migrated from [[Zimbabwe]]; they came from the same region in East Africa as the Shona. They fled Zimbabwe to Senyawe in Botswana because of the intertribal wars. They lived with the Bangwato when they settled in Botswana. Some of them accompanied Ratiltadi and Mpoengs who fled from Kgama into [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe]]. The Rozvi are the people from where the Mambo dynasty emerged. It is now thought that these Kalanga/Rozvi people built the Mapungubwe and [[Great Zimbabwe]] ruins.{{cn| date= October 2017}}
 
The Gululu are a smaller family within the Talaunda; their origin dates back to the aftermath of a genocide attempt by King Mzilikazi after Kedikilwe, brother of Musemwe, misled the King on the whereabouts of herds of cattle that belonged to the Talaunda and the Bangwato in Botswana. The survivors of that attack adopted the name [[Gululu]] or [[Gwababa]] in Si[[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]], as the king's warriors had unwittingly mistaken rustling noises in the bushes made by these Talaunda for creeping Monitor lizards (called [[Gululu]] in Kalanga).{{cn| date= October 2017}}

Their first settlement in Botswana was in a small village north-east of Botswana called Senyawe, where they lived on a hill. {{As of|2010}} Batalaote are still in Senyawe village. They were divided due to the search for greener pastures, intertribal marriage and intertribal wars. That is why there are some Batalaote in Plumtree, Matopos, [[Serowe]], [[Mmadinare]], [[Makaleng]], [[Bobirwa]].

Several of the Talaote/Talunada people seek government-assisted repatriation from their current locations to locations that are governed by Talaote chiefs and tribal princes.

Bakalanga-Banyai, just like any other African tribe has dialects; their dialects are
*Badhalaunda/batalaote (they lived in Madzilogwe, Mazhoubgwe, up to Zhozhobgwe.)
*BaNambya can be found in Hwange up to Gweta.
*BaLilima ( BaWombe; Bayela. Are in the central district with Baperi
*Baperi (live together with BaLilima as mentioned above){{cn| date= October 2017}}

Dhalaunda was the leader of one of these Kalanga sub-tribes, and the clan was named after him, originally Badhalaunda, but then Bangwato changed it to Batalaote, as they changed Bakalanga to Bakalaka, maybe because of difficulty pronouncing the Kalanga words. They are found in the central district of Botswana and south-western parts of Zimbabwe. Over the years the Talaunda dialect was levelled to other Ikalanga dialects, just as the north-eastern Tjikalanga dialect is shifting to Tjililma. Some of them live in Serowe; former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, is a member. These have completely lost their Ikalanga identity, and now just identify themselves as Talaote or Ngwato, with little knowledge of what Talaote really means. Most Talaote tribe who witnessed the conflicts between their rulers fled Botswana for South Africa. Most Batalaota are currently found in the Malebogo District in the Blouberg Municipality.{{cn| date= October 2017}}

The '''Tlapanec''' {{IPAc-en|'|t|l|ae|p|@|n|E|k}}, or '''Me'phaa''', are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]] native to the state of [[Guerrero]]. The [[Tlapanec language]] is a part of the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language family]]. The now extinct [[Subtiaba]] language of [[Nicaragua]] was a closely related language. Today Tlapanecs live primarily in the state of [[Guerrero]] a number more than 98,000.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times they lived in the isolated mountain area along the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region of Guerrero, just southeast of present-day [[Acapulco]]. Their territory was called ''[[Yopitzinco]]'' by the [[Aztec]]s who also referred to the Tlapanecs as '''''Yopi'''''{{Pronunciation-needed}}. Yopitzinco was never conquered by the Aztecs and remained an independent enclave within the Aztec empire. The main Tlapanec city was Tlapan and the name ''Tlapanec'' is the [[Nahuatl]] for "Inhabitant of Tlapan".

==Religion==
The Tlapanecs explain natural phenomena through [[mythology|myth]], like the myth of the creation of the sun (''Akha'''), the moon (''Gon&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'') and the fire god (''Akuun mbatsuun&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), who all were born on the bank of the river and who were raised by ''Akuun ñee'', goddess of the [[temazcal]] sweatbath and patron of the hot/cold duality.

Another important element in their culture is [[nagualism]]. When a baby is born it is said that at the same time an animal is born and that that animal is the [[nahual]] of the child. No one except the child knows which animal is its nahual because the nahual will only show itself to the child in its dreams.

The '''Tumbwe people''' are an ethnic group living mostly in [[Tanganyika District]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Tumbwe are a small group of about 100,000 people whose homeland is on the west shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]].&lt;ref name=AfDirect/&gt;
They take their name from a hereditary chief of the [[Sanga people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other people in the region include the related [[Luba people|Luba]], [[Tabwa people|Tabwa]] and [[Hemba people|Hemba]].&lt;ref name=AfDirect/&gt;

The [[Tumbwe Chiefdom]] is an administrative area around the port of [[Kalemie]], on Lake Tanganyika, where the [[Lukuga River]] leaves the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.rgc.cd/doctech/UNDP-GIS-25_RDC_administratif.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401040116/http://rgc.cd/doctech/UNDP-GIS-25_RDC_administratif.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-04-01 |title=Découpage administratif de la République Démocratique du Congo

Traditionally the Tumbwe made their living by small-scale farming and by fishing on the lake.
Today, growing numbers of Tumbwes work for wages in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A Tumbwe chief will own a ceremonial staff, kept hidden when not in use, which indicates his rank and status.
The staff is decorated with abstract design that tell of the chief's ancestry and is a residence for their spirits.&lt;ref name=AfDirect/&gt;

'''[[United Nations]] [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 188''', adopted on April 9, 1964, after a complaint by the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] about a British air attack on their territory on March 28, the Council deplored the action at [[Harib]] as well as at least 40 other attacks that had occurred in that area. The [[British Empire]] (U.K.) had also complained that Yemen had violated airspace of the [[Federation of South Arabia]].&lt;ref name="well"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellens|first=Karen|author2=T.M.C.

The Council asked the Yemen Arab Republic and the [[United Kingdom]] to exercise the maximum restrain in order to avoid future conflict and requested the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] use his good offices to try to settle the issue with the parties.  

The resolution was adopted by nine votes to none, with the United Kingdom and the [[United States]] [[Abstention|abstaining]].

'''Urban art''' is a style of art that relates to cities and city life often done by artists who live in or have a passion for city life. In that way urban art combines [[street art]] and [[graffiti]] and is often used to summarize all [[visual art]] forms arising in [[urban area]]s, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as [[vandalism]] and destruction of private property.

Although urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with [[graffiti]] culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, [[Le Mur (urban art)|Le Mur]] is a [[Public art|public]] museum of urban art.

== In the mainstream ==
Though starting as an underground movement, urban artists like [[Banksy]] and [[Adam Neate]] have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the [[Tate]] calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/apr/08/streetartattate|title=Street Art is Officially Mainstream|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Gorillaz]] uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a [[graffiti]] style.
