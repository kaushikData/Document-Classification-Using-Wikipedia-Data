'''Alice Domurat Dreger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɛ|ɡ|ər}}) is a historian, bioethicist, author, and former professor of clinical medical humanities and bioethics at the [[Feinberg School of Medicine]], [[Northwestern University]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073|title=Alice Dreger Bio |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=Apr 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201840/http://www.bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger engages in academic work and activism in support of individuals born with atypical sex characteristics ([[intersex]] or [[disorders of sex development]]) and individuals born as [[conjoined twins]].&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; She challenges the perception that those with physical differences are somehow "broken" and need to be "fixed".&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt; She has opposed the use of "corrective" surgery on babies whose genitalia are considered "ambiguous".  She has criticized the failure to follow such patients in later life, and reported longer-term medical and psychological difficulties experienced by some of the people whose sex is arbitrarily assigned.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Michal|title=Identity Politics|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=40–43|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/identity-politics|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpurol.2016.05.017| issn = 1477-5131| last1 = Feder| first1 = Ellen K.| last2 = Dreger| first2 = Alice| title = Still ignoring human rights in intersex care| journal = Journal of Pediatric Urology|  date = May 2016| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477513116300997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She supported [[J.

==Education==
Dreger received her Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science from [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

Dreger has taught at both [[Michigan State University]], where she received a Teacher-Scholar Award in 2000,&lt;ref name="MSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher-Scholar Award|url=https://natsci.msu.edu/faculty-staff/awards/teacher-scholar/|website=Michigan State University|publisher=College of Natural Science|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Northwestern University]] (2005-2015).&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

During her doctoral work, Dreger became interested in "how and why it is that scientists and medical doctors work to mediate the relationships between our bodies and our selves" and "why it is we often look to scientists and medical doctors to read or even alter our bodies."&lt;ref name="bartlett"/&gt; In 1995 she published a paper in ''Victorian Studies'' examining 19th-century British medical attitudes towards intersex people.  In 1998 she published ''Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex''&lt;ref name="bartlett"/&gt; and in 1999, ''Intersex in the age of ethics''. Increasingly, she became engaged in intersex activism as well as scholarship, advocating that doctors accept a wide variety of genital structure rather than "correcting" babies' genitalia to conform to artificially gendered standards.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;  More recently, she has criticized the prenatal use of [[dexamethasone]] to normalize female genitalia in cases of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], and tried to charge that its safety has not been sufficiently tested by pediatrician [[Maria New]].&lt;ref name="Dobbs"/&gt; However, the FDA found nothing worth pursuing on this topic.

In 2004, Dreger published ''One of us: conjoined twins and the future of normal'', an examination of [[conjoined twins|Conjoined twinning]] and of surgical practice.  Described as "a book filled with warmth, humour and unexpected insights", it raises similar issues to her earlier work on intersex people: questioning the ways in which the surgical profession defines "acceptable limits of the normal" and enforces conformity to such norms. She criticizes the lack of long-range follow-up studies of separated children. Dreger also introduces more than twenty sets of conjoined twins, most of whom have adapted happily to the challenges of their situations. One reviewer states that Dreyer's intent is to show us the humanity of people whose anatomies differ from ours.&lt;ref name="Kessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kessel|first1=Ross|title=One of Us|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=2004|volume=97|issue=12|pages=603–604|doi=10.1258/jrsm.97.12.603|pmc=1079680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharp|first1=Helen M.|title=One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|date=March 2005|volume=42|issue=2|pages=220–220|doi=10.1597/04-116.1|url=http://www.cpcjournal.org/doi/pdf/10.1597/04-116.1?code=acpa-premdev|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' (2003) J. Michael Bailey promoted a hotly disputed theory of transsexualism by [[Ray Blanchard]] that characterized male-to-female transsexuals into two groups in a way that was seen by many as deeply offensive.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=J. Michael|title=Book Controversy Question &amp; Answer|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/controversy.htm|website=Northwestern University|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dreger published an article in ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', describing in detail the opposition to Bailey and his work. A major concern for her was the ways in which attacks targeted him as a person and a scholar, rather than addressing his ideas.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; Dreger asserted that a theory, even if found threatening or offensive, should be judged by its supporting evidence.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt; She also argued against reduction of the controversy to a simple dualism,&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; seeing the ideas and actions of all those involved as "significantly more complicated".&lt;ref name="Dreger"/&gt; As result of the paper, Dreger herself was perceived as attacking trans people, and drawn into an ongoing controversy.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

In 2009, Dreger received a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] to study conflicts between activists and scientists.  She has examined a number of conflicts including the controversial career of [[Napoleon Chagnon]]. Dreger accepts that scientists, being human, have biases and ideologies. But, she argues, they must "put the truth first and the quest for social justice second" and try to "adhere to an intellectual agenda that [isn't] first and only political".&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

{{quote|Forms of scholarship that deny evidence, that deny truth, that deny the importance of facts, even when performed in the name of good, are dangerous, not only to science and to ethics but to democracy.|Alice Dreger, 2008, quoted in 2015&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Tom|title=Reluctant Crusader  Why Alice Dreger’s writing on sex and science makes liberals so angry|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Reluctant-Crusader/228377/?cid=gn|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2015, Dreger published ''[[Galileo's Middle Finger]]'', which covered her observations and experiences with controversies in academic medicine, especially those surrounding human sexuality.  They include her work with intersex people, the career of [[Napoleon Chagnon]], Dreger's criticisms of [[Maria New]], and her defense of  J. Michael Bailey and its consequences.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galileo"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's middle finger: heretics, activists, and the search for justice in science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[The New York Times]]'' described Dreger's "smart, delightful book" as "many things: a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms (sissyphobia, autogynephilia, phall-o-meter) and an account of the author's transformation" from activist to anti-activist and back again.&lt;ref name="Dobbs"/&gt; The book also received positive reviews from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-galileos-middle-finger-alice-dreger-20150326-story.html#page=1|title=Review: 'Galileo's Middle Finger' by Alice Dreger|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',&lt;ref name="bartlett" /&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]],''&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite news | last= Miller|first= Laura | title = "Galileo’s Middle Finger": When scholars and activists clash over controversial research, we all lose.

However, ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' also reignited controversy over her defense of Bailey and her discussion of transgender issues. Her book was removed from consideration for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] after complaints.  One critic accused Dreger of promoting the idea that trans women are "just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)".&lt;ref name="Tannehill"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=March 25, 2016 |title=Lambda Literary Foundation Snuffs Out Anti-Trans Scandal |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/25/lambda-literary-foundation-snuffs-out-anti-trans-scandal |newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreger protested the removal in an open letter to [[Lambda Literary Foundation]].&lt;ref name="LFF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alicedreger.com/LLF|title=An Open Letter to the Lambda Literary Foundation -  Alice Domurat Dreger|website=alicedreger.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreger herself has since reiterated her articulation of  ideas in ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' that relate to trans women, stating that she considers both gender and sexuality to be relevant and valid concerns for people, and therefore finds value in Blanchard's dual categorization if not his terminology.&lt;ref name="Answers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alicedreger.com/autogyn|title=Answers to Some Questions about Autogynephilia - Alice Domurat Dreger (June 2015)|website=alicedreger.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I want to emphasize that I think both of these developmental paths are perfectly legitimate ways to become women, and regardless of how someone becomes a woman, if she identifies as such, we owe her the respect of recognizing her identity and addressing her appropriately.&lt;ref name="Answers"/&gt;}}

Dreger resigned from Northwestern University in August, 2015, citing censorship issues.&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alicedreger.com/resignation_NU|title=FAQ on my resignation from Northwestern University -  Alice Domurat Dreger|website=alicedreger.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school had ordered her and other editors of ''Atrium'', a bioethics journal, to take down an article about consensual oral sex between a nurse and patient.&lt;ref name="Peace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peace|first1=William|title=Head Nurses|url=http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/atrium/articles/issue12/peace.html|website=Atrium|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the article was eventually reposted, the university established its own editorial committee to approve future issues of the journal.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite news | last= Grant |first= Bob | title = Censored Professor Quits | work = The Scientist | date = August 27, 2015 | url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43848/title/Censored-Professor-Quits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingkade"&gt;{{cite news | last= Kingkade |first= Tyler | date = September 25, 2015 | title = Noted Author Resigns From Northwestern In Censorship Protest | work = Huffington Post | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alice-dreger-resigns-northwestern_55dc84c5e4b08cd3359d4f95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arbeiter Ring Publishing''' is a worker-owned and operated independent book publisher and distributor that specializes in progressive, radical and [[anarchist]] literature (both fiction and non-fiction). Founded by Todd Scarth and [[John K. Samson]] in [[Winnipeg]] in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-comprehensive-look-at-winnipegs-rock-history-part-2 "A Comprehensive Look At Winnipeg’s PC Punk Scene"]. ''Noisey'', Sheldon Birnie Sep 22 2014,&lt;/ref&gt; the publishing company was originally based in [[The Old Market Autonomous Zone]] (or A-Zone), which also houses [[Mondragon Bookstore]] and Coffee House, and other radical and worker-run organizations.  Named after [[Arbeiter Ring]] (meaning "Workers' Circle"), a radical Jewish workers' organization (which had a strong presence in Winnipeg at the outset of the 20th century and helped promote [[Emma Goldman]]'s early visits to the city), Arbeiter Ring also shares a commitment to workers' self-management.  One aspect of this is the organization's promotion of [[participatory economics]] (or parecon), an alternative economic model first articulated by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The '''Association for Women in Psychology''' ('''AWP''') is a not-for-profit scientific and educational organization committed to encouraging [[feminism|feminist]] psychological research, theory, and activism.

==History==
AWP was founded in 1969 at the annual convention of the [[American Psychological Association]]. One of its co-founders was [[Phyllis Chesler]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology, and Mental Health'', Phyllis Chesler, Esther D. Rothblum, Ellen Cole, Haworth Press, 1995, p. 1. {{ISBN|1-56023-078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there was no national organization nor division thereof addressing issues related to the [[psychology]] of women. Also in 1969, after an Association for Women in Psychology group had worked on a series of demands, [[Phyllis Chesler]] and Dr. [[Dorothy Riddle]] presented the demands at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]]. Chesler prepared a statement on the APA's obligations to women and demanded one million dollars in reparation for the damage psychology had perpetrated against allegedly mentally ill and traumatized women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/presence-timeline/|title=Timeline|publisher=|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Reinhold, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/06/archives/women-criticize-psychology-unit-1million-in-reparations-is-demanded.html?sq=phyllis+chesler+AND+reinhold&amp;scp=2&amp;st=p Women Criticize Psychology Unit; $1-Million in Reparations Is Demanded at Convention]", ''The New York Times'', September 6, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Association for Women in Psychology also picketed the APA's Board of Directors meeting, to raise awareness of the [[sexism]] within the organization and the field of psychology in general.&lt;ref name="A brief history of the Association for Women in Psychology"&gt;Tiefer, L. (1991). [http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/15/4/635.full.pdf "A brief history of the Association for Women in Psychology"]. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly'', 15, pp. 635-649.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, APA eventually established a division on the Psychology of Women (Division 35) in 1973. Together, AWP and Division 35 successfully advocated for a Women's Program Office at APA's national headquarters.

==Status==
AWP remains an independent organization, operating separately from Division 35, outside of APA's organizational structure. AWP has held [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) status within the [[United Nations]] since 1976. AWP maintains a broad membership inclusive of all people interested in the psychology of women. AWP sponsors regional and national conferences on feminist psychology and offers several awards to recognize significant contributions to the psychology of women. AWP also collaborates with other organizations in support of feminist approaches to psychological theory, research, pedagogy, teaching, and mental health issues. AWP is concerned about such things as [[reproductive rights]] and bias in psychiatric diagnosis in [[DSM-5]].

AWP co-sponsors a listserv, POWR-L, the Psychology of Women Resource List, and a suite at the APA convention with Division 35, both of which support collaboration and collegiality among feminists.

The Attorney General of Indonesia ('''''Jaksa Agung Republik Indonesia''''') is the competent authority to advise the [[Government of Indonesia]] on matters of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=297&amp;Itemid=1767 |title=indonesia.go.id |access-date=2016-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924061928/http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=297&amp;Itemid=1767 |archive-date=2012-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General represents the government at the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] and is a [[Cabinet of Indonesia|Cabinet-level]] official. The office is not part of the Justice Department, however, as the cabinet has its own [[Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Indonesia)|Law and Human Rights department]] (''Kementerian Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia'') with a separate [[List of Ministers of Law and Human Rights (Indonesia)|Minister of Law and Human Rights]] (''Menteri Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia'') that focuses on more technical matters and regulation making rather than executing the Supreme Court's order. 

The Attorney General is also a Solicitor General. Thus, the Attorney General can represent the Government in the Supreme Court. The Attorney General has the power to indict and prosecute outlaws and law breakers. The term of office of the Attorney General was determined by the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia]] in 2010 to be concurrent with the term of office of the [[President of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/indonesia-attorney-general-told-to-step-down-following-ruling-of-constitutional-court/ Global Legal Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt; The current Attorney General of Indonesia of Indonesia is [[Muhammad Prasetyo|HM Prasetyo]], who assumed office in 2014.

The '''capacity''' of [[natural person|natural]]  and [[juridical person|juridical]] persons ([[legal person]]s) in general, determines whether they may make binding amendments to their [[rights]], [[duty|duties]] and [[obligation]]s, such as getting [[marriage|married]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions|merging]], entering into [[contract]]s, making [[gift (law)|gifts]], or writing a valid [[will (law)|will]]. Capacity is an aspect of [[status (law)|status]] and both are defined by a person's ''personal law'':
*for natural persons, the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or ''[[lex domicilii]]'' in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, and either the law of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'', or of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states;
*for juridical persons, the law of the place of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'' for [[company (law)|companies]] while other forms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place in which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a presence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the transactions entered into.
When the [[law]] limits or bars a person from engaging in specified activities, any [[Contract|agreements]] or [[contract]]s to do so are either [[Voidable contract|voidable]] or [[Void contract|void]] for '''incapacity'''.  Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as ''incompetence''.  For comparison, see [[Competence (law)]].

==Discussion==
As an aspect of the [[social contract]] between a state and its [[citizen]]s, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In [[public policy (law)|public policy]] terms, this is the policy of ''[[parens patriae]]''. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of [[consanguinity]]), she cannot [[evasion (law)|evade]] that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Natural persons===
{{see also|Testamentary capacity}}
Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of [[freedom of contract]] and the detailed [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. Hence, for example, freedom of movement may be modified, the [[right to vote]] may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, [[English law]] used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minor (law)====
{{main article|Minor (law)}}

The definition of an ''infant'' or ''minor'' varies, each state reflecting local [[culture]] and [[prejudice]]s in defining the [[age of majority]], [[marriageable age]], [[voting age]], etc. In many [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, legal [[contract]]s, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor.  For a minor to undergo [[medical procedure]], [[consent]] is determined by the minor's parent(s) or [[legal guardian]](s).  The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often set at 21 years by U.S. [[state law]].  Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry younger. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the [[age of criminal responsibility]] to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see ''[[doli incapax]]''). For sexual crimes, the [[age of consent]] determines the potential liability of [[adult]] accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the [[British Columbia]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040617060433/http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm Infants Act]'' (RSBC 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

====Minors and Contractual Capacity====
A [[Minor (law)|minor]] (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, [[barter]] transactions such as purchasing a [[retail]] item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a [[legal fiction]] not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action.  A minor may not disavow such a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. &lt;u&gt;[http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm A Consent Theory of Contracts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033415/http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/u&gt; Columbia Law Review (March, 1986) pp. 299, fn 123&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Disaffirmance''' - it  must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states don't allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*'''Obligations''' - most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor’s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*'''Liability''' - for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor’s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*'''Ratification''' - accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Gaylord A. and Roger LeRoy Miller &lt;u&gt;Business Law Today: The Essentials&lt;/u&gt; South-Western College/West, Ohio, 2003 pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;
As one court put it, "the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect 'minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Hauer v. Union State Bank of Wautoma'', 192 Wis. 2d 576, 593 (1995), quoting ''Halbman v. Lemke'', 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====
{{See also|Insanity|mental disorder}}
Individuals may have an inherent physical condition which prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant [[power of attorney]] to an appointed [[legal guardian]].

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the [[Court of protection|Court of Protection]], and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This makes provision for [[Lasting power of attorney|lasting powers of attorney]] under which decisions about the health, welfare and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person's interests.

In Ireland the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act addresses the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia.  Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment and otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters.  If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs.  If the afflicted person owns his/her property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs.  Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs.  Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian.  The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M'Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or, if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Drunkenness or drug abuse====
Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

====Bankruptcy====
{{See also|Bankruptcy}}
If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some [[U.S. state|states]] have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the "enemy", including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Business entities===
*[[Corporations]]
The extent of an artificial person's capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation's capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is ''[[ultra vires]]'', i.e. "beyond the power" of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.
*General and limited partnerships
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the "firm" and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
*Unions
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
*[[Insolvency]]
When a business entity becomes insolvent, an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

'''The Caretaker Government of Bangladesh''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশের তত্ত্বাবধায়ক সরকার}}) was a form of government in which [[Bangladesh]] used to be ruled by a selected government for an interim period during the transition from one elected government to another, after the completion of tenure of the former, during the period between 1996 to 2008. The outgoing elected government used to hand over its power to the nonelected nonpartisan [[caretaker government]] (CTG).

Top members of the caretaker government did not represent any political party; nor were they allowed to contest the elections. The main objective of the Caretaker Government (CTG) was to create a level playing field environment in which an election could be held in a free and fair manner without any political influence by the outgoing government.

It was not empowered to take any policy decisions unless it was necessary. The head of the Caretaker Government (CTG) was called the [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh|Chief Adviser]] (in place of [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]]) and was selected by the [[President of Bangladesh]]. The Chief Adviser selected the other advisers. The top positions of the administration were generally distributed among the advisers. The [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh|Chief Adviser]] and the other advisers were committed for their activities to the [[President of Bangladesh]].

==History==
In 1990 three party alliances discussed creating a better environment for elections. They jointly made a demand for it. After the forced resignation of General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], the three alliances nominated Chief Justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] as the Chief Adviser. The caretaker government was headed by a [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh|Chief Adviser]], who enjoyed the same power as the regular prime minister of the country except in defence matters. The advisers functioned as ministers.

Since 1996, a Caretaker government has managed the elections and transitions of 1996, 2001 and 2008. Although the first caretaker government (CTG) was intended to help the transition from authoritarianism to democracy, this system was adopted as part of the Constitution in 1996 by the Sixth Parliament. It was dominated by [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], which yielded to opposition pressure.

In Bangladesh, a [[Caretaker Government]] (CTG) ruled for the period of 1990 to 1991 with the understanding of the major political party alliances. Later, CTGs were formed within the constitutional framework in 1996, 2001 and 2006. The 13th amendment to the constitution was passed in the parliament formalising this arrangement.

In addition, an extra-constitutional military-backed CTG was installed in 2007; it governed the country without legitimacy, but ultimately handed over power to the elected political party following 29 December 2008 parliamentary election. They were under pressure internationally to yield to a democratically elected government.

According to the provision (before abolishment) of CTG in the Bangladesh Constitution, there were six options to appoint a [[Chief Advisor of Bangladesh|Chief Advisor]] (CA). The last option of CA is the President. The CTG had to hold an election within 90 days and in 120 days could hand over power to the duly elected political party. The daily operations of government, routine duties, and holding parliamentary election are the mandated responsibilities of the CTG.

Caretaker Government was very popular in Bangladesh although it was a contradiction with constitution. Recently Pakistan and Greece have also adopted this model to hold elections and overcome political stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title='টাইমস অব ইন্ডিয়া'কে এরশাদ, পাঁচ বছর অন্তর জনগণ সরকারের পরিবর্তন চায় |trans-title='Times of India' Who says, wants to change the government's five-year intervals |url=http://www.mzamin.com/details.php?nid=MTg4NzI=&amp;ty=MA==&amp;s=MTg=&amp;c=MQ== |newspaper=Daily Manab Zamin |language=bn |date=23 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102033503/http://www.mzamin.com/details.php?nid=MTg4NzI%3D&amp;ty=MA%3D%3D&amp;s=MTg%3D&amp;c=MQ%3D%3D |archive-date=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military backed Caretaker Government and its role==

The military-backed [[Caretaker Government]] (CTG) was formed outside the constitutional provisions. It performed all responsibilities of the regular elected government and continued for 2 years. Ruling autocratically, the Army chief used to attend the advisory council meetings and pressured the cabinet to make decisions he wanted. [[:wikt:advisor|Adviser]] to President, [[Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury|M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury]], was ousted as he was against the Army's actions.&lt;ref name="07DHAKA66_a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butenis |first=Patricia A. |authorlink=Patricia A.

Later, President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] had to run the presidency at gun point.&lt;ref name="07DHAKA66_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pbc24.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Faruque |first=Omar |title=Bangladesh is heading towards uncertainty involving the upcoming general elections |url=http://www.pbc24.com/index.php/article/print/1073 |newspaper=PBC24.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313165943/http://www.pbc24.com/index.php/article/print/1073 |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Gen. [[Moeen U Ahmed|Moeen]] upgraded the Army Chief of Staff's rank to General; to maintain balance the other two military service chiefs were also promoted. Moeen extended the rule of the CTG for two years while his tenure for one year as army chief without lawful authority, in the absence of regular elected government.&lt;ref name="pbc24.com"/&gt; The senior adviser and [[minister of state]] Mukhles Chowdhury tried to solve the political problems. He brought the rival political parties to the planned parliamentary elections of 22 January 2007. But, by cancelling H M Ershad's nomination, Moeen staged a military coup on 11 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=H7IhU6mTEsjjywOZ0oKABg#q=in+bangladesh%2C+by+cancelling+H+M+Ershad's+nomination%2C+Moeen+staged+a+military+%5B%5Bcoup%5D%5D+on+11+January+2007|title=Google|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhles Chowdhury was the de facto President and Prime Minister from 2006 to January 2007. Although strongly criticised by civil, military, political, media and the inner circle of President's office and President's family, a later investigation demonstrated that he had run the government honestly.&lt;ref name="07DHAKA66_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=১/১১ নিয়ে মুখ খুললেন মোখলেস চৌধুরী |trans-title= |url=http://www.bd-pratidin.com/2013/08/01/8709 |newspaper=Bangladesh Pratidin |language=bn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709085522/http://www.bd-pratidin.com/2013/08/01/8709 |archive-date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then PM's political secretary was dead against his induction in the government publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonarbangladesh.com/articles/MokhlesurChow/ |script-title=বঙ্গভবনের দিনগুলি – ৫ |trans-title=President days – 5 |language=bn |website=sonarbangladesh.com |type=Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2007 when Mukhles Chowdhury became powerless, Brigadier [[Chowdhury Fazlul Bari|Fazlul Bari]] decided to impose a [[curfew]] and [[press censorship]] with the consent of Major General [[Masud Uddin Chowdhury|Masududdin Chowdhury]] at Advisor's Office.

==2008 Election==
The [[Bangladeshi general election, 2008|national election of Bangladesh]] was held on 29 December 2008 under the Caretaker government formed with Dr. [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] as the [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh|Chief Adviser]] on 13 January 2007. This was the third Caretaker government formed after the tenure of the government of prime minister [[Khaleda Zia]] ended in October 2006. The Caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed functioned without legislative authority as it continued to function after its scheduled tenure of 120 days ended on 12 May 2007. All decisions taken after this date must be ratified by the parliament for the sake of legitimacy.

The Caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed was a military controlled and has made extensive use of the military to stymie the chaos that preceded 11 January 2007 (popularly known as ''1/11'', like [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]). From the very outset however, the government made it clear that they were there not only to arrange a free and fair election, but also to make sure that all aspects that are connected to it are reviewed properly. This meant major reforms in the election system, but also making sure that corrupt candidates could not take part in the election.

The task was however an enormous one, since Bangladesh is regarded as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. Therefore, the government had exceeded its mandated term, which according to the constitution allows it to stay only for 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=সংসদ বহাল রেখে নির্বাচন হবে না: প্রধানমন্ত্রী |trans-title=Parliamentary elections will be maintained: PM |url=http://banglanews24.com/detailsnews.php?nssl=22a24cfb7c20852b7c8ecfb48968d62e&amp;nttl=19092012139862 |newspaper=BanglaNews24.com |language=bn |date=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006145800/http://www.banglanews24.com/detailsnews.php?nssl=22a24cfb7c20852b7c8ecfb48968d62e&amp;nttl=19092012139862 |archive-date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
The caretaker government introduced Voter ID cards (with photograph) for the first time just before [[Bangladeshi general election, 2008]]. The [[Bangladesh Army]], including members of other military forces, were deployed throughout the nation prior to the elections, including the remotest areas, to assist with voter registration and issuance of the new IDs. They were equipped with laptops and small [[digital camera]]s in an effort that would result in the most orderly voters' registration list in Bangladesh's history.

==Reactions==
Initial reactions of the public were welcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sleeplessinironcity.blogspot.co.uk/ |title=Curfew causes people immense sufferings, journalists assaulted |author=Shamim Ashraf |date=23 August 2007 |work=Spectator |type=Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrests of corrupt prominent politicians in 2007 led many to believe that a new political age was imminent. No new major parties came into the scene. In some cases, former political leaders had been released from prison in 2008 and appeared to be returning to former positions and displacing reformers.

Opponents of the CTG's long tenure had chiefly been of the two major political parties. Members of the public in general understood the reasons and necessity for the government' actions.

The televisions and print media had reported events throughout the term (2007 to 2008). There had been little questioning of the leaders who had been charged with an array of corruption charges, and who were now on the verge of returning to power. Almost all of the television channels are now owned by members from one of the two major parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh emergency declared, president quits as interim leader |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-11-bangladesh_x.htm |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chief Advisers since 1991==
* [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] – Election of 1991
* [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]] – Election of 1996
* [[Latifur Rahman]] – Election of 2001
* [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] – Had to resign by a military coup on 11 January 2007
* [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] – Appointed on 12 January 2007 by an army group followed by a coup – Election of 2008

==Abolishment of CTG==
In 2011 the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] led government abolished Caretaker Government through passage of the 15th amendment of the constitution with its majority in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liton |first1=Shakhawat |last2=Hasan |first2=Rashidul |date=1 July 2011 |title=Caretaker system abolished |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192303 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition parties, including the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]], have protested passage of the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/08/running-elections-bangladesh "Running Elections in Bangladesh"], ''The Economist'', August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; People are worried about next elections since the CTG was abolished.

{{Party politics}}
In [[politics]], '''centrism'''—the '''centre''' ([[British English|British]]/[[Canadian English|Canadian]]/[[Australian English]]) or the '''center''' ([[American English|American]]/[[Philippine English]])—is a political outlook or specific position that involves acceptance or support of a balance of a degree of [[Egalitarianism|social equality]] and a degree of [[social hierarchy]], while opposing political changes which would result in a significant shift of society either strongly to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] or the [[Right-wing politics|right]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver H. Woshinsky. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. Oxon, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2008. Pp. 141, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centre-left politics|Centre-left]] and [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] politics both involve a general association with centrism combined with leaning somewhat to their respective sides of the [[Left-right political spectrum|spectrum]].

Various political ideologies, such as [[Christian democracy]], can be classified as centrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=Jonathan|title=Community and the Economy: The Theory of Public Co-operation|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136159015|page=160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage by political parties by country ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

=== Australia ===
There have been centrists in both sides of politics, who serve alongside the various factions within the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] parties.

In addition, there are a number of smaller groups that have formed in response to the bipartisan system who uphold centrist ideals. South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] had launched his own centrist political party called the [[Nick Xenophon Team]] (NXT) in 2014, renamed [[Centre Alliance]] in 2018. The [[Palmer United Party]] has been suggested as being a centrist party as well, but the party itself does not make such formal claims of being politically centrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/populist-palmer-drops-his-jester-act-to-appeal-to-middle-australia-26919|title=Populist Palmer drops his jester act to appeal to middle Australia|first=Paul|last=Williams|date=|work=TheConversation.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
The traditional centrist party of [[Flanders]] was the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] which embraced [[social liberalism]] and aimed to represent Dutch-speaking Belgians who felt culturally suppressed by Francophones. The [[New Flemish Alliance]] is the largest and since 2009 the only extant successor of that party. It is, however, primarily composed of the right wing of the former People's Union, and has adopted a more [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] ideology in recent years.

Among French speaking Belgians the [[Centre démocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] is a centre-right or centre party as it is considerably less [[conservatism|conservative]] than its Flemish counterpart, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic &amp; Flemish]].

Another party in the centre of the political spectrum is the liberal [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]].

=== Brazil ===
Brazilian politics have lots of centrist political parties and one of the greatest examples is the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB), which is the largest political party in Brazil.

The [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] is also another example of centrist party in Brazilian politics, though it was supported by right-wing political parties from [[Brazilian general election, 2002|2002]], [[Brazilian general election, 2006|2006]], [[Brazilian general election, 2010|2010]] and [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014]] elections.

===Canada ===

Throughout modern history [[Canadian government]]s at the federal level have governed from a [[moderate]], centrist political position.&lt;ref name="Johnson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Johnson|title=Thinking Government: Public Administration and Politics in Canada, Fourth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_HzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|year=2016|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-3521-0|pages=13–23|quote=...most Canadian governments, especially at the federal level, have taken a moderate, centrist approach to decision making, seeking to balance growth, stability, and governmental efficiency and economy...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plurality-Majority Electoral Systems: A Review |url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/fra/sys/courtney&amp;document=courtney&amp;lang=e |website=Elections Canada|quote= First Past the Post in Canada has favoured broadly-based, accommodative, centrist parties... }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has been dominated by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] who have traditionally positioned themselves as being more moderate and centrist than the center-right [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and the more left-wing [[New Democratic Party]], putting them somewhere between the center and center-left.&lt;ref name="BittnerKoop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amanda Bittner|author2=Royce Koop|title=Parties, Elections, and the Future of Canadian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdFTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA300|date=1 March 2013|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2411-8|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaumerGold2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald C.

=== Croatia ===
[[Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats]] and [[People's Party - Reformists]] may be considered as centrist parties. Agrarian [[Croatian Peasant Party]] during last years became moderate and centrist, having been centre-right in the past.

=== Czech Republic ===
[[Czech Republic]] has two main centrist political parties: liberal [[ANO 2011|ANO]] (Yes) and Christian democratic [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party]].

=== Estonia ===
{{Main|Centrism in Estonia}}

=== France ===
France has a tradition of parties that call themselves "''centriste''" and the most notable centrist party is [[La République En Marche!|La République en marche !]], founded by [[Emmanuel Macron]]; who was elected as [[President of France]] in May 2017.

Another party is the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] of [[François Bayrou]], founded in 2007. However, the centrist parties often oppose the left-wing parties such as [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] and [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]]. It often support the centre-right [[Gaullist]] parties and have joined several coalitions governed by Presidents [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

=== Germany ===
[[File:2010-11-29 JoachimGauck 211.JPG|thumb|In 1990, [[Joachim Gauck]] (who is a former German President, centrist politician and activist without party affiliation) took part in the [[Alliance 90]], having become an independent after [[Alliance 90/The Greens|its merger with The Greens]]]]
''Zentrismus'' is a term only known to experts, as it is easily confused with ''Zentralismus'' ("centralism", the opposite to decentralisation/federalism), so the usual term in German for the political centre/centrism is ''politische Mitte'' (literally "political middle", or "political centre"). Historically, the German party with the most purely centrist nature among German parties to have had current or historical parliamentary representations was most likely the [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918–1933).

There existed during the Weimar Republic (and again after the Nazi period) a ''[[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]'', a party of German [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] founded in 1870. It was called Centre Party not for being a proper centrist party, but because it united left-wing and right-wing Catholics, because it was the first German party to be a ''Volkspartei'' ([[big tent|catch-all party]]) and because his elected representatives sat between the liberals (the left of the time) and the conservatives (the right of the time). However, it was distinctly right-wing conservative in that it was not neutral on religious issues (such as on secular education), being markedly against more liberal and modernist positions.

The main successor of ''Zentrum'' after the return of democracy to West Germany in 1945, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], has throughout its history alternated between describing itself as right-wing or centrist and sitting on the right-wing (with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in its social liberal moments sitting at its left, in the centre and themselves sitting at the centre, with the FDP in its [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] moments sitting at its right, in the right-wing). The representatives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], although they have since the 1990s many times referred to themselves as "the new middle" (under influence of the [[Third way (centrism)|Third way]] of the time), feel less at ease in describing their party as centrist due to their history and socialist identity.

[[Alliance '90/The Greens]] was founded in 1993 as a merger from the East German [[Alliance 90]] (a group of centrist/[[transpartisan|transversalist]] civil rights activists) and the (West) German Greens. The latter was a coalition of various unorthodox-left politicians and more liberal "realists". This [[Bundestag]] party also hesitates in using the term centre, although it does distance itself as well from the tag of left, which identifies it for the moment as a transversalist party. The transversalist moderation of the party and its position in the Bundestag between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (while the FDP has its seats at the right of the Christian Democrats) also points somewhat to The Greens being a more or less centrist party.

In the state parliaments of specific German states there are other specifically regional parties which could be identified as centrist. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], of the Danish and Frisian minorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] has currently a centrist political position, although in the past the party usually leaned to the left. In the German presidential elections of [[German presidential election, 2009|2009]], [[German presidential election, 2010|2010]] and [[German presidential election, 2012|2012]], it supported the candidates of the Social Democrats and the Greens. In Bavaria, the [[Free Voters]] party present at the state parliament may also be seen as a centrist party.

=== Greece ===
In Greece centrism has its roots to centrist politician and founder of [[Agricultural Party of Greece|Agricultural]] and [[Labor Party of Greece|Labour]] Party, [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]. In 1961, [[Georgios Papandreou]] created along with other political leaders the coalition party of [[Centre Union]]. Five parties were merged: Liberal Party, Progressive Agricultural Democratic Union, National Progressive Center Union, Popular Social Party into one, with strong centrist agenda opposed equally to right wing party of National Radical Union and left wing party of United Democratic Left. The Centre Union Party was the last Venizelist party to hold power in Greece. The party nominally continued to exist until 1977 (after the Junta it was known as the [[Centre Union – New Forces|Center Union – New Forces]]), when its successor Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) party was created.

[[Union of Centrists]] was created by [[Vassilis Leventis]] in 1992 under the title "Union of Centrists and Ecologists", though the name was changed shortly after. The Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Center Union. The party strives to become "the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece". Leventis aimed to become part of the Venizelist legacy of some great politicians of the past, such as Eleftherios Venizelos and George Papandreou Sr. However, the party's total influence had been marginal until 2015, with 1.79% of the total votes (in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015]]) being its highest achievement before finally making its way to the [[Greek Parliament]] in September 2015 with 3.43% of the total votes and 9 members elected.

=== India ===
In India, actor turned politician [[Kamal Haasan]] has launched a party named Makkal Needhi Maiam meaning People's Centre for Justice.  He claims that the party's ideology is Centrism as the name suggests and looks to focus on the politics of the state Tamil Nadu. As a self-proclaimed rationalist he claims to usher in a scientific rational centrist outlook to seek, analyse and solve various issues instead of falling for the binary polarizing political trap which the right wing and left wing tend to.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], both two main political parties ([[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]]) claim the political centre ground, but seem to lean to the centre-right and be mostly made up of centre-right members.&lt;ref name="iran-daily.com"&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 Iran Daily – Dot Coms – 05-31-07, Bertie's Challenge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018012627/http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 |date=18 October 2007 }}, 5th paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iran-daily.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658,s01=1.htmlThe Irish Poll Hits Fianna Fáil], 2nd paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; The two parties have shared broadly similar policies in the past, with their primary division being perceived as being steeped in [[Irish Civil War]] politics. Fine Gael is aligned to [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties in Europe via its membership of the [[European People's Party]] and is described internationally as [[centre-right]] by the likes of Reuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6BB0WA20101212|title=Irish opposition party says IMF/EU deal too costly |work=Reuters|date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus in analysis seems to be that Fianna Fáil is mostly centrist, expanding to the centre-right space and that Fine Gael is mostly centre-rightist, expanding also to the centre space.

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], four moderate centrist to centre-right parties have sent members into the [[Third Rutte cabinet]] since 2017. From them, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) tend to be [[centre-right]] whilst the social liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) are more centrist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf Politieke Barometer: ''D66 middenpartij bij uitstek''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719123931/http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf |date=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant]] [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] is a small [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] party that has transversalist positions less typical in European centrist parties. Whilst it is left-leaning on issues such as immigration, welfare and the environment, it is more conservative on social issues, such as [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[euthanasia]]. They have participated in several coalitions due to their moderate centrist politics.

[[Livable Netherlands]] was originally a centrist political movement of local grass-root parties with an anti-establishment touch similar to early D66. However, the party entered in 2002 national parliament with a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] programme based [[Law and order (politics)|on security]] and immigration as the major issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the 1980s and 90s there were two self-described "centre" parties, the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] and the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] who at some point were represented in [[Tweede Kamer|Dutch parliament]]. However these parties were considered as [[far right]] (in the case of the Centre Democrats) or even [[extreme right]] (in the case of the Centre Party) in their opinion about foreign immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/nl/Educatie/monitor/Kronieken/Kroniek-extreemrechts/De-Centrumstroming/De-Centrumpartij/|title=Kroniek extreemrechts: De Centrumpartij|first=Anne Frank|last=Stichting|date=20 January 2011|website=annefrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties denied being racist or extremist in character. The party slogan of the Center Party was ''"niet rechts, niet links"'' ("Neither rightist nor leftist"), and in some respect could be seen as a centrist (or more correctly [[Third Position]]) party since it borrowed ideas from the political (far) right (a tough stand on immigration combined with typical racial prejudice) and the political left ([[mixed economy]], green politics). However both of these two parties didn't really have a coherent ideology; they were basically one-issue parties focussed on what the perceived as mass immigration from non-European countries.

=== Nordic countries ===
[[File:Senterpartiet campaining Norwegian Storting elections 2005 Picture from Nærbø at Jæren.JPG|thumb|Campaign for the Norwegian [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] at [[Nærbø]]: like its [[Centre Party (Finland)|Finnish]] and [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Swedish]] counterparts, the party has a strong focus on decentralisation, rural and agrarian issues]]
{{Main|Nordic Agrarian parties}} {{See also|Centrism in Sweden|Centrism in Iceland|Centrism in Finland}}
In most of the [[Nordic countries]], there are [[Nordic agrarian parties]]. These share in addition to the centrist position on the socio-economic left-right scale a clear, separate ideology.

This position is centred on [[decentralisation]], a commitment to [[small business]] and [[environmentalism|environmental protection]]. Centrists have aligned themselves with the [[Liberal International]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]. Historically, all of these parties were farmers' parties committed to maintaining rural life. In the 1960s, these parties broadened their scope to include non-farmer-related issues and renamed themselves [[Centre Party (disambiguation)|Centre Party]].

Neither the [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] (a now defunct centrist political party) nor the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] (a political party founded as a centrist social liberal party, but that now is a classical liberal party), both of Denmark, are rooted in centrist agrarianism.

=== Pakistan ===
[[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI), founded by [[Imran Khan]], claims to be a centrist political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/28/survey-imran-khan-most-popular-leader-of-pakistan/|title=Survey: Imran Khan most popular leader of Pakistan|first=Mirza|last=Hassan|date=28 June 2012|work=TheNewsTribe.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Pakistan general election 2013|general election of 2013]], PTI emerged as the second-largest political party in Pakistan by number of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.com.pk/|title=elections.com.pk|author=|date=|work=Elections.com.pk|access-date=4 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064535/http://elections.com.pk/|archivedate=5 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2018 it won the general elections of Pakistan and [[Imran Khan]], its chairman, became Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="PTI_2018Election"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saifi |first1=Sophia |last2=Raja |first2=Adeel |last3=Dewan |first3=Angela |title=Imran Khan's party wins Pakistan election but falls short of majority |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/28/asia/pakistan-election-results-imran-khan-intl/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestinian Authority ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}The [[Third Way (Palestinian authority)|Third Way]] is a small centrist Palestinian political party active in Palestinian politics. Founded on 16 December 2005, the party is led by [[Salam Fayyad]] and [[Hanan Ashrawi]].

In the January 2006 PLC elections, it received 2.41% of the popular vote and won two of the Council's 132 seats. The party presents itself as an alternative to the two-party system of [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]].

=== Poland ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}[[Civic Platform]] (PO), ruling in 2007–2015, began in 2001 as a liberal conservative party, but later under the leadership of [[Donald Tusk]] turned into typical centrist in order to attract left-leading liberal voters. Depending on the context, it is described as either Christian Democratic (it is a member of [[European People's Party]]), conservative, liberal, or social. Its pragmatism, technocracy and lack of ideology have been nevertheless criticized and currently, under the new leader [[Grzegorz Schetyna]], it is returning to the right. Other political groups like [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL) may be described as centrist too (in Poland, national-moral right-wing [[Law and Justice]] is [[social conservative]], usually at the same time economical left and favor [[protectionism]] policies).

=== South Korea ===
There are [[Bareunmirae Party]], [[Democratic Peace Party (South Korea)|Democratic Peace Party]] and [[Evergreen Korea Party]]&lt;ref&gt;Local party&lt;/ref&gt; in the centrist political parties, advocating centrism in South Korea, though these parties are dissidents from the two mainstream parties, the liberal [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]] and conservative [[Liberty Korea Party]].

The [[Bareun Party]] insists on "Centrist conservatism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.kr/articles/?2877474|title=개혁보수신당 창당발기인1185명 참여…오후2시 발기인 대회|author=|date=5 January 2017|website=news1.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is close to [[liberal conservatism]].

[[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]] does not have the insist centrism ideology. It implies an ideology similar to the [[social liberalism]] that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|U.S. Democratic Party]] is proposing. However, compare to the U.S. Democrats, the Democratic Party is progressive on [[economic justice]] but conservative on social issues.

=== Spain ===
The only national party that defends itself as a centrist party is [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], whose platform is been increasingly perceived as right-wing by the Spanish citizens as the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]] surveys show. In April 2018 Ciudadanos obtained a 6,77, when ranging political parties from 1 to 10, where 1 was farthest left and 10 its equivalent in the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3200_3219/3210/es3210mar.pdf] Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas. 27 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It first entered the [[Cortes Generales]] in 2015.

In Catalonia, where the party was born, many people even consider it as an extreme right-wing party, considering its fierce "opposition to nationalism". Not even the media agree on its place and several newspapers from different ideologies manifest that Citizens is either left or right, depending on their political line. Regardless of subjective opinions, the truth is that Ciudadanos has always tried to reach agreements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2015-06-24/irene-lozano-aboga-por-el-pacto-con-ciudadanos-como-pide-el-tiempo-nuevo-en-su-candidatura-de-upyd_901183/], El Confidencial&lt;/ref&gt; with the national party, which according to several opinion polls Spanish voters most traditionally considered to be the closest to the centre: [[Union, Progress and Democracy]] (UPyD). This popular perception was pointed out by UPyD, which positions itself simultaneously on the political centre and cross-sectionalism, thus embracing ideas across the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.reuters.com/article/idESKCN0PL0M120150711|title=Andrés Herzog sucederá a Rosa Díez al frente de UPyD|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=Reuters|language=es|date=11 July 2015|quote=En su último discurso como portavoz de UPyD, Díez reivindicó a su formación -que se define como un partido progresista situado en el centro político-, como el artífice del cambio político en España}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upyd.es/contenidos/noticias/105/105880-UPyD_La_evolucion_de_la_politica_en_Espana|title=UPyD: La evolución de la política en España|last=González Almeida|first=José María|accessdate=22 May 2016|website=upyd.es|language=Spanish|date=12 November 2013|quote=UPyD ofrece entendimiento a través del ''transversalismo'', que bien pueden servir sin necesidad de inclinarse a un lado o a otro, ya que todos tienen algo positivo que aportar y la formación magenta sabe bien sintetizar lo mejor de cada idea, ofreciendo un dulce cóctel al ciudadano|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428024340/http://www.upyd.es/contenidos/noticias/105/105880-UPyD_La_evolucion_de_la_politica_en_Espana|archivedate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPyD has lost a great deal of its voters to Ciudadanos,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-mitad-votantes-iu-upyd-pasa-podemos-ciudadanos-20150806134053.html] Europa Press&lt;/ref&gt; the latter counting with 32 representatives in the Spanish Congress in the last election. Electors also consider as centrists the [[Convergence and Union]] coalition from [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Spanish Basque Country]], although these two usually consider themselves as right-centrist parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/-Archivos/Marginales/2900_2919/2909/e290900.html DISTRIBUCIONES DE FRECUENCIA MARGINALES DEL ESTUDIO 2909 CUESTIONARIO 0 MUESTRA 0], CIS-Centro de Estudios Sociológicos (see Question number 27) (''Spanish'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]] the political centre (in [[German language|German]]: ''die Mitte''; in [[French language|French]]: ''le Centre''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''il Centro'') is traditionally occupied by the so-called "bourgeois" parties: [[FDP.The Liberals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdp.ch/aktuell/medienmitteilungen/medienmitteilung-detail/news/es-braucht-eine-starke-liberale-kraft-im-parlament-mehr-denn-je/|title=Es braucht eine starke liberale Kraft im Parlament – mehr denn je|first=WNG agence|last=digitale|date=|website=fdp.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (centre-right&lt;ref&gt;The party itself rejects the lefy-right notion, stating on its FAQ-page that it's a centre party&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvp.ch/index.php/de/news/2015-10-18/die-cvp-ist-die-partei-der-mitte|title=Die CVP ist die Partei der Mitte!|author=|date=|website=cvp.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvp.ch/de/die-cvp/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=|date=|website=CVP Schweiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (centre&lt;ref&gt;In urban (and Protestant) areas the party tends to be more centrist than in rural, predominantly Catholic areas&lt;/ref&gt; to centre-right) and the much smaller [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland|Evangelical People's Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evppev.ch/partei/|title=Partei - EVP Schweiz|author=|date=|website=www.evppev.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evppev.ch/fr/news/action/News/detail/artikel/im-parlamentarier-rating-steht-die-evp-mit-der-sozialen-mitte-alleine-da-ist-niemand/|title=«Im Parlamentarier-Rating steht die EVP mit der sozialen Mitte alleine, da ist niemand!»|author=|date=|website=evppev.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (centre to centre-left&lt;ref&gt;The party rejects the left-right classification, and indeed it appears difficult to classify the party: it tends to be on the centre or even centre-left on social and environmental issues, centrist on economic issues and centre-right on ethical issues.&lt;/ref&gt;). Recently some new parties were founded who claimed to be part of the political centre: the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland|Conservative Democratic Party]] (centre to centre-right), a split from the right-wing populist [[Swiss People's Party]] is a self-styled centre party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdp.info/schweiz/de/koepfe/einsatzfuereinestarkemitte/|title=BDP Schweiz › Köpfe|author=|date=|website=www.bdp.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely conceived to be a party of the political centre as is shown in a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smartvote.ch/downloads/edu/sv_edu_parteienportraet_bdp_de_CH.pdf|title=Smartvote Parteienporträt: Bürgerlich-Demokratische Partei (BDP), page 3|author=|date=|website=smartvote.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Green Liberal Party of Switzerland|Green Liberal Party]] (centre)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grunliberale.ch/partei/geschichte.html|title=Parteigeschichte|first=Magnolia International|last=Ltd.|date=|website=grunliberale.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a split from the leftist [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party]].

The [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] is considered to be more to the left than to the centre&lt;ref&gt;http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=721636456&amp;Country=Switzerland&amp;topic=Summary&amp;subtopic=Political+structure The Economist Intelligence Unit (2015). Switzerland--Country Overview. The Economist. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland the centrist parties tend to co-operate closely in Canton parliaments and municipal councils.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 1970s, the traditionally socialist [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] moved further to the left, causing discomfort to MPs who saw themselves as belonging to the party's social democratic tendency. On 25 January 1981, leading figures from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] ([[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], known collectively as the "Gang of Four") launched the Council for Social Democracy, which later became the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in March, after outlining their policies in what became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]]. The "Gang of Four" were centrists, who had defected from the Labour Party due to what they perceived to be the influence of the [[Militant tendency]] and the "[[hard left]]" within the party.&lt;ref name="ChildsStorry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&amp;pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-75555-4|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sassoon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Sassoon|title=One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUkBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA698|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-530-2|page=698}}&lt;/ref&gt; After waning electoral success, the SDP merged with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1988 to create the centrist [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the late 1990s, Labour under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] began to move towards a centrist [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] policy platform, creating the [[New Labour]] movement. The new New Labour era is seen as ending when Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] lost the 2010 election to the Conservatives. Brown's successor as leader, [[Ed Miliband]], moved the party (slightly) to the left of New Labour era position. Miliband set out his stall to "redefine the political centre", with pundits declaring New Labour "dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e9c342ac-c954-11df-b3d6-00144feab49a|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Miliband declares New Labour dead|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=8 August 2018|last=Barker|first=Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Labour]] movement, launched in 2009, attempted to cultivate a new path for Labour centrism that would appeal to socially conservative working class periods, and was a mild influence on Labour during Miliband's tenure. The party later moved decisively to the left when the socialist [[Jeremy Corbyn]] became leader in 2015, as a result of the introduction of a [[one member one vote]] system under Miliband.

In March 2011, [[Nick Clegg]], the-then leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], stated that he believed that his party belonged to the radical centre, mentioning [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[William Beveridge]], [[Jo Grimond]], [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] as examples of the radical centre that preceded the Liberal Democrats' establishment in 1988. He pointed to liberalism as an ideology of people and described the political spectrum and his party's position as follows: "For the left, an obsession with the state. For the right, a worship of the market. But as liberals, we place our faith in people. People with power and opportunity in their hands. Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre".

In the 2000s, [[David Cameron]] also moved the Conservative Party towards the centre, allowing his party to be [[UK general election 2010|elected in 2010]] in a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition with the Liberal Democrats]]. In the [[UK general election 2015|2015 election]], the Conservatives gained a majority and the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats. They regained a small number of seats in the [[UK general election 2017|2017 election]]. Cameron's successor [[Theresa May]] used left-wing rhetoric on her appointment as Prime Minister, stating her wish to tackle social inequality, and adopted some of Ed Miliband's policies; for example, on regulating energy companies. However, the party's 2017 manifesto was seen as sharp break from the centre ground, appealing to traditionally Tory heartland issues in the aftermath of the UK's [[Brexit referendum]], including a promise to restore [[fox hunting]].

Following the [[Brexit referendum]], politics in the UK was seen as having reverted to traditionally polarised "left and right" politics. For the 2017 election, the group [[More United]] was set up in the vein of the US [[Super PAC]] model to support candidates from multiple parties who meet its values; it gave support primarily to Labour and Lib Dem MPs, as well as one Conservative. In April 2018, amid ''The Observer'' newspaper reported that a group setup by Simon Franks had amassed £50 million to start a new centrist political party in the UK to field candidates at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit|title=New centrist party gets £50m backing to ‘break mould’ of UK politics|first=Michael|last=Savage|date=8 April 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has reportedly been named [[United for Change]].

Independent candidate [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]] garnered nearly 19% of the popular vote in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]]. His "get under the hood" campaign focusing on [[United States federal budget|balancing the budget]] has been one of the most successful centrist efforts in U.S. history,&lt;ref name=elect /&gt; but he did not carry a single state in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

[[Americans Elect]], a coalition of American centrists funded by wealthy donors such as business magnate [[Michael Bloomberg]], former [[High-yield debt|junk-bond]] trader [[Peter Ackerman]] and [[hedge fund]] manager John H. Burbank III, launched an effort in mid-2011 to create a national "virtual primary" that would challenge the current two-party system. The group aims to nominate a presidential ticket of centrists with names that would be on ballots in all 50 states. The group banks on broad cultural dissatisfaction with the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' has stated that "the political climate couldn't be riper for a serious third-party alternative" such as their effort, but the "hurdles Americans Elect faces are daunting" to get on ballots.&lt;ref name=elect&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0729/Americans-Elect-launches-centrist-third-party-bid-amid-Washington-dysfunction|title=Americans Elect launches centrist third-party bid amid Washington dysfunction|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=1 January 2012|first=Patrik|last=Jonsson|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist and political commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] wrote in his book ''Why Americans Hate Politics'', published on the eve of the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], that he believes American voters are looking for a "New Political Center" that intermixes "liberal instincts" and "conservative values". He labelled people in this centre position as "tolerant traditionalists". He described them as believers in conventional social morals that ensure family stability, as tolerant within reason to those who challenge those morals and as pragmatically supportive of government intervention in spheres such as education, child care and health care, as long as budgets are balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dionne, Jr.|first=E.J.|title=Why Americans Hate Politics: A Reprise|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2000/12/winter-politics-dionne|work=Brookings Research|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=16 April 2014|location=Washington, D.C.|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Davis|title=Social Democracy in the South Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=1983|publisher=Peter Davis|isbn=978-0-908636-35-8|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was '''Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Calgary Herald, August 1, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The CCF aimed to alleviate the suffering that workers and farmers, the ill and the old endure under capitalism, seen most starkly during the [[Great Depression]], through the creation of a Co-operative Commonwealth, which would entail economic co-operation, public ownership of the economy, and political reform.
 
The object of the political party as reported at its founding meeting in Calgary in 1932 was  "the federation [joining together] of organizations whose purpose is the establishment in Canada of a co-operative commonwealth, in which the basic principle of regulating production, distribution and exchange will be the supplying of human needs instead of the making of profit."&lt;ref&gt;Calgary Herald, Augusut 1, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

The Co-operative Commonwealth, the goal of the CCF, was defined as a "community freed from the domination of irresponsible financial and economic power in which all social means of production and distribution, including land, are socially owned and controlled either by voluntarily organized groups of producers and consumers or – in the case of major public services and utilities and such productive and distributive enterprises as can be conducted most efficiently when owned in common – by public corporations responsible to the people's elected representatives".&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Gronlund, ''Co-operative Commonwealth, An Exposition of Socialism'' (1884), p. 36 as quoted in Monto, Tom, ''Protest and Progress, Three Labour Radicals in Early Edmonton'', Crang Publishing/Alhambra Books, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the party's first [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) were members of the [[Ginger Group (Canada)|Ginger Group]], composed of United Farmers of Alberta, left-wing [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]], and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Labour]] MPs. These MPs included [[United Farmers of Alberta]] MPs [[William Irvine (Canadian politician)|William Irvine]] and [[Edward Joseph Garland|Ted Garland]], [[Agnes Macphail]] (UFO), [[Humphrey Mitchell]], [[Abraham Albert Heaps]], [[Angus MacInnis]], and Labour Party MP [[J. S. Woodsworth]]. Also involved in founding the new party were members of the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] (LSR), such as [[F. R. Scott]] and [[Frank Underhill]].{{sfnp|Young|1969|p=31}} It can be said that the CCF was founded on May 26, 1932, when the Ginger Group MPs and LSR members met in William Irvine's office, the unofficial caucus meeting room for the Ginger Group, and went about forming the basis of the new party.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=259–260}} J. S. Woodsworth was unanimously appointed the temporary leader until they could hold a founding convention.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=259-260}} The temporary name for the new party was the Commonwealth Party.{{sfnp|Young|1969|p=30}}

[[File:CooperativeCommonwealthFederationFoundingMeeting.jpg|left|upright=1.5|thumb|CCF founding meeting, Calgary, 1932]]
At its founding convention in 1932 in Calgary, the party settled on the name "Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist)" and selected J. S. Woodsworth as party leader.{{sfnp|Morton|1986|p=12}} Woodsworth had been an [[Labour candidates and parties (Canada)|Independent Labour Party]] MP since 1921 and a member of the Ginger Group of MPs. The party's 1933 convention, held in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], adopted the [[Regina Manifesto]] as the party's program. The manifesto outlined a number of goals, including [[nationalization|public ownership]] of key industries, universal public [[pension]]s, [[universal health care]], children's allowances, [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]], and [[workers' compensation]].{{sfnp|Young|1969|pp=304-313}}

Its conclusion read, "No CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated [[capitalism]] and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth."{{sfnp|Morton|1986|p=12}} The party affiliated to the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name="Knuttila2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Murray Knuttila|title=The Prairie Agrarian Movement Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K03wdWJ3uLQC&amp;pg=PA173|year=2007|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=978-0-88977-183-3|pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Regina—Lewvan]] MP [[Erin Weir]] designated himself as a CCF MP following his expulsion from the New Democratic Party caucus.&lt;ref name="CCF join"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marotta|first1=Stefanie|title=Erin Weir declares himself a member of the CCF - a party that no longer exists|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/weir-new-party-ccf-1.4659853|accessdate=May 18, 2018|work=CBC News|date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral performance==

In line with Alberta's important role in founding the CCF, it is said that the first CCF candidate elected was [[Chester Ronning]] in the Alberta provincial constituency of Camrose, in October 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mardiros |first=Anthony |title=William Irvine, The Life of a Prairie Radical |date=1979 |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co |location=Toronto |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMLs5Gbq5wC&amp;pg=PA208 |p=208 |isbn=978-0-8886-2237-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFA, under whose banner he contested the election, formalized its already-strong connection to the CCF in its next provincial convention, in January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Champion Chronicle, January 26, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In its first federal election, seven CCF MPs were elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935]]. Eight were elected in the following election in [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940]], including their first member east of Manitoba, [[Clarence Gillis]], in Nova Scotia's [[Cape Breton South (federal electoral district)|Cape Breton South]] district. The party was divided with the outbreak of [[World War II]]: Woodsworth was a passionate [[pacifism|pacifist]], and this upset many supporters of the Canadian war effort. Woodsworth had a physically dehabilitating stroke in May 1940 and could no longer perform his duties as leader.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=313-315}} In October, Woodsworth wrote a letter to the 1940 CCF convention, in essence asking to retire from the leadership.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=313-315}} Instead, the delegates created the new position of Honorary President, abolished the President's position and re-elected [[Major James Coldwell|M. J. Coldwell]] as the National Chairman.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=313-315}} Coldwell was then appointed acting House Leader on 6 November.{{sfnp|Stewart|2000|pp=244–245}} Woodsworth died on 21 March 1942, and Coldwell officially became the new leader at the July convention in Toronto and threw the party's support behind the war effort.{{sfnp|Stewart|2000|pp=244–245}} As a memorial to Woodsworth, Coldwell suggested that the CCF create a research foundation, and Woodsworth House was established in Toronto for that purpose.{{sfnp|McNaught|2001|pp=313-315}} The party won a critical [[York South]] [[by-election]] on 8 February 1942, and in the process prevented the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] leader, former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Arthur Meighen]], from entering the House of Commons. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 election]], 28 CCF MPs were elected, and the party won 15.6% of the vote.

However, the party was to have its greatest success in provincial politics in the 1940s. In 1943, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section)|Ontario CCF]] became the official opposition in that province, and in 1944 the [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party|Saskatchewan CCF]] formed the first socialist government in [[North America]], with [[Tommy Douglas]] as [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]. Douglas introduced universal [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] to [[Saskatchewan]], a policy that was soon adopted by other provinces and implemented nationally by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] during the administration of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]].

Federally, during the [[Cold War]], the CCF was accused of having [[Communism|Communist]] leanings. The party moved to address these accusations in 1956 by replacing the Regina Manifesto with a more moderate document, the [[Winnipeg Declaration]]. Nevertheless, the party did poorly in the [[Canadian federal election, 1958|1958 election]], winning only eight seats.

After much discussion, the CCF and the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] decided to join forces to create a new political party that could make [[social democracy]] more popular with Canadian voters. This party, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), was founded in 1961.

==Organization==
The CCF estimated its membership as being slightly more than 20,000 in 1938, less than 30,000 in 1942, and over 90,000 in 1944.{{sfnp|Young|1969|loc=Appendix B, Table III, p. 320}} Membership figures declined following [[World War II]] to only 20,238 in 1950 and would never again reach 30,000{{sfnp|Young|1969|loc=Appendix B, Table III, p. 320}}

By the late 1940s the CCF had official or unofficial weekly newspapers in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan; twice-monthly papers in Ontario and Manitoba; and a bimonthly in the Maritimes. A French-language paper in Quebec was also attempted at various times. The party also produced many educational books, pamphlets, and magazines, though these efforts declined in the 1950s.

===National chairmen===

[[File:Claire Gillis, David Lewis, M.J.Coldwell c007253.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Four past and future National Chairmen in September 1944: National CCF delegation attending the '''Conference of Commonwealth Labour Parties''' in [[London]], England. ''Pictured from left to right'': [[Clarence Gillis|Clarie Gillis]], MP for [[Cape Breton South (federal electoral district)|Cape Breton South]]; [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], National Secretary; [[Major James Coldwell|M. J. Coldwell]], National Leader, MP for [[Rosetown—Biggar]]; [[Percy Wright|Percy E. Wright]], MP for [[Melfort (electoral district)|Melfort]]; and [[F. R. Scott|Frank Scott]], national chairman.]]
The national chairman was the equivalent of party president in most Canadian political parties and was sometimes referred to as such, in that it was largely an organizational role. In the case of the CCF, the national chairman oversaw the party's national council and chaired its meetings. Following an initial period in which Woodsworth held both roles, it was usually distinct from and secondary to the position of party leader. National president originally was also a title the leader held, as both Woodsworth and Coldwell held the title when they held seats in the House of Commons. In 1958, after Coldwell lost his seat, the position of national chairman was merged formally into the president's title and was held by David Lewis.{{sfnp|Young|1969|p=235}}

==CCF song==
[[File:Towards the Dawn.jpg|thumb|"Towards the Dawn!" – a 1930s promotional image from Saskatchewan]]
The CCF had a song, which would be later popularized by the movie ''[[Prairie Giant|Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story]]''.

First verse:

:''A call goes out to Canada''
:''It comes from out the soil—''
:''Come and join the ranks through all the land''
:''To fight for those who toil''
:''Come on farmer, soldier, labourer,''

A '''commercial policy''' (also referred to as a '''trade policy''' or '''international trade policy''') is a government's policy governing [[international trade]]. Commercial policy is an all encompassing term that is used to cover topics which involve international trade.  Trade policy is often described in terms of a scale between the extremes of [[free trade]] (no restrictions on trade) on one side and [[protectionism]] (high restrictions to protect domestic producers) on the other.

A [[common commercial policy]] can sometimes agreed by treaty within a [[customs union]], as with the [[Common commercial policy (EU)|European Union's common commercial policy]] and in [[Common Commercial Policy (MERCOSUR)|Mercosur]].

A nation's commercial policy will include and take into account the policies adopted by that nation's government while negotiating international trade. There are several factors that can have an impact on a nation's commercial policy, all of which can have an impact on international trade policies.

== Types and aspects of Commercial policy ==

=== Regionalism ===
[[Regionalism (international relations)|Regionalism]], or Regional Trade Agreements (RTA), are [[Trade agreement|trade policies and agreements]] that are crafted by the nations in a region for the purposes of increasing international trade in the area. RTAs have been described by supporters as a means of increasing free trade with the goal of eventually merging into larger, either bilateral or multilateral, trade deals. The more relatively local area of RTAs are useful in resolving trade issues as well without causing gridlock in other trade agreements. Critics of RTAs say that they are a hindrance to the negotiation of trade because they can be lopsided or unfairly beneficial to one side over the other sides, particularly if some of the participants are nations that are still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/cid/cidtrade/issues/regionalism.html|title=Regionalism|last=|first=|date=|website=sites.hks.harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As China was rising in economic power and prominence, they turned to regionalism as a strategic method of leveling the playing field with Europe and the United States. In 2000, China signed the [[Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement|Bangkok agreement]] with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) to reduce tariffs in the region. The signing of the agreement also began the push for a formal Free Trade Agreement between China and ASEAN. However, strained relations between China and other Asian nations such as Japan have prevented the same level of regional FTAs to be put in place with Northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wan|first=Ming|date=2010-05-01|title=The Great Recession and China's Policy Toward Asian Regionalism|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/50/3/520|journal=Asian Survey|language=en|volume=50|issue=3|pages=520–538|doi=10.1525/as.2010.50.3.520|issn=0004-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilateral Free Trade Agreements ===
When two countries enter into a bilateral trade agreement, they are essentially giving one another special deals and favorable treatment in the arrangements. These privileges can include lowering tariffs on each others goods and services. The United States has signed such treaties as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1994 as well as with Israel in the 1980s. Experts who support such free trade agreements argue that these deals help to increase competition and offers larger markets that businesses can reach out to. Critics of bilateral agreements claim that a larger nation, such as the [[United States]], can use these agreements to unfairly push smaller states into much harsher work loads than the World Trade Organization already requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/rise-bilateral-free-trade-agreements|title=The Rise in Bilateral Free Trade Agreements|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the European Union and South Korea have led to both parties signing several bilateral agreements regarding trade policy. In 2009, South Korea and the EU signed the [[European Union–South Korea Free Trade Agreement|EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement]]. The signing of the agreement created an FTA that is second only to NAFTA in size. The agreement held the benefits of increased free trade between the participants in the FTA as well as increased challenge to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-eu-korea-fta-a-boost-to-economic-recovery-and-a-challenge-to-the-u-s/|title=The EU-Korea FTA: A Boost to Economic Recovery and a Challenge to the U.S.|last=Lee|first=Ho-Jin|date=-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preferential Trade Agreements ===
[[Preferential trading area|Preferential agreements]] are trade deals that involve nations making deals with specific countries that can aid the interests of one another as opposed to the nondiscriminatory deals that are pushed by the WTO. Nations have been increasingly preferring such deals since the 1950s as they are quicker to show gains for the parties involved in the agreements. A common argument that has been made is that it allows businesses to open up markets that would otherwise be considered closed and therefore falls into the free trade idea that most countries will push for. Countries that have similar levels of GDP and a higher scope in their economies as well as their relative position to one another and the rest of the world are more likely to have preferential trade agreements. PTAs can also be applied to regional areas with unions such as NAFTA, the European Union, and ASEAN being examples of regional PTAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Neil|last2=Stehrer|first2=Robert|date=2011|title=Preferential trade agreements and the structure of international trade|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41485873|journal=Review of World Economics / Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv|volume=147|issue=3|pages=385–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Those who opposer PTAs argue that these deals have increased the importance of where a product is made so that tariffs can be applied accordingly. The certification of a product's origin also unfairly holds back smaller countries that have less resources to spend. Others argue that PTAs can hinder negotiations of trade disputes and places an emphasis of which country has more power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dieter|first=Heribert|date=2009|title=The Multilateral Trading System and Preferential Trade Agreements: Can the Negative Effects Be Minimized?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27800766|journal=Global Governance|volume=15|issue=3|pages=393–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ways in which commercial policy is affected. ==

=== Tariffs ===
[[Tariff|Trade tariffs]] are a tax that are placed on the import of foreign goods. Tariffs increase the price of imports and are usually levied onto the country the goods are being imported from. Governments will use tariffs as a way to promote competition within their own country with businesses of the foreign country that wishes to sell their goods or services. In some instances, a country's government will use them as a means of protectionism for their own interests. In modern history, generally starting at the mid-20th century, the use of tariffs has been largely diminished in favor of the rise of international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/tariff|title=Tariff {{!}} international trade|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2017, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] began to impose tariffs on several of nations that were involved in trade deals with the United States. The countries targeted by the Trump Tariffs then retaliated with their own tariffs on American goods.

=== Import Quotas ===
[[Import quota|Import quotas]] are the limitations of the amount of goods that can be imported into the country from foreign businesses. Generally, an import quota is set for a specific period of time with one year being the most common metric. Some versions of the quotas limits the quantity of specific goods being imported into a country while other versions place the limit on the value of said goods. The objectives of quotas can include: the protections of a nations interests, ensuring a balance of trade so as not to create deficits, retaliation to restrictive trade policies of other countries that do business on the international playing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/import-quotas/import-quotas-meaning-objectives-and-types-international-economics/30454|title=Import Quotas: Meaning, Objectives and Types {{!}} International Economics|date=2018-03-15|work=Economics Discussion|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee for Nonviolent Revolution''' ('''CNVR''') was a [[pacifist]] organization founded in [[Chicago]] at a conference held on February 6 to 9, 1946. Many of the founding members were [[conscientious objectors]] who had served time in prison or in [[Civilian Public Service]] camps for their refusal to fight in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=lost /&gt; They included [[Dave Dellinger]], [[George Houser]],&lt;ref name=dellinger&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Andrew E.|authorlink=Andrew E.

Muste]].

The activists, having been radicalized by their experiences during the war, were dissatisfied with the [[War Resisters League]] and other, more traditional pacifist organizations, such as the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]. They announced that "the time has come for radical elements from the groups devoted to war resistance, socialism, militant labor unionism, consumer cooperation, and racial equality to attempt to come together in a common program of revolutionary action."&lt;ref name=radical /&gt;

The CNVR promoted civil disobedience,&lt;ref name=unger /&gt; and it opposed the formation of the [[United Nations]], picketing outside the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in 1946. The group also published a number of bulletins and managed to sponsor another conference, whose theme was ''Radicalism in the Next Five Years'', from August 8 to 10, 1947.&lt;ref name=dellinger /&gt;  However, the wide variety of views held by the members, ranging from pacifism to [[anarcho-syndicalism]], made effective organization difficult.

{{About|the international law describing a territory in which two sovereign powers have equal rights|other uses|Condominium (disambiguation)}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}

In [[international law]], a '''condominium''' (plural either ''condominia'', as in Latin, or condominiums) is a political territory (state or border area) in or over which multiple sovereign powers formally agree to share equal ''dominium'' (in the sense of sovereignty) and exercise their rights jointly, without dividing it into "national" zones.

Although a condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility, condominia have been rare in practice. A major problem, and the reason so few have existed, is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation between the sovereign powers; once the understanding fails, the status is likely to become untenable.

The word is recorded in English since c.&amp;nbsp;1714, from Modern Latin, apparently coined in Germany c.&amp;nbsp;1700 from Latin ''com-'' "together" + ''dominium'' "right of ownership" (compare [[demesne|domain]]). A condominium of three sovereign powers is sometimes called a '''tripartite condominium''' or '''tridominium'''.

* The [[International Space Station]] is a ''de facto'' space condominium, via a [[International Space Station program|program]] of complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between all parties. 
* [[Antarctica]] is a ''de facto'' continental  condominium, governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] that have consulting status.
* The [[Moselle]] and its tributaries, the Sauer and the Our, constitute a condominium between [[Luxembourg]] and Germany, which also includes bridges, about 15 river islands of varying size,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/the-worlds-most-exclusive-condominium/?_r=0 |title=The World’s Most Exclusive Condominium|first=Frank |last= Jacobs |date= 12 January 2012|accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tip of one island, ''Staustufe Apach'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/BoundaryPoint/files/delu | title = ''Select'' DEFRLUBEDELU.PDF (Map of condominium boundaries)| accessdate= 2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Schengen, Luxembourg|Schengen]] (the rest of the island is in France). The condominium was established by treaty in 1816.
* [[Pheasant Island]] (also known as Conference Island, ''Konpantzia'' in Basque, ''Île de la Conférence'' in French or ''Isla de los Faisanes'' in Spanish) in the [[Bidassoa]] is a condominium between France and Spain. It was established by the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659. It is formally controlled by Spain between 1 February and 31 July each year and by France for the following six months. The island has no permanent population and has been eroded significantly by the river.&lt;ref name=bbc28jan18&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-42817859 The island that switches countries every six months], [[BBC News]], 28 January 2018.

*  Austria and Germany consider themselves, together with Switzerland, to hold a tripartite condominium (albeit on different grounds) over the main part of [[Lake Constance]] (without its islands).  On the other hand, Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V01T5VI4nZ4C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=kahn+deutsche+staatsgrenzen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdxTeHxs0c&amp;sig=ose9KRF2RrQlBB2ave0RTFp6lok&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=3XJGSty4JtKPsAb37Zwm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1| title = Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen: rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen ("The German national borders: legal-historical foundations and open legal questions") | author = Daniel-Erasmus Kahn | publisher= Oxford University Press | date= 2004 | isbn=9783161484032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "fiat"&gt;{{cite paper| url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/fiatobjects.pdf|title= Fiat Objects| first = Barry| last= Smith | publisher = Department of Philosophy, Center for Cognitive Science and NCGIA, SUNY at Buffalo (NY)|accessdate= 2013-06-02|p=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence no international treaty establishes where the borders of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria in or around Lake Constance lie.&lt;ref name = "fiat"/&gt;
* The part of the [[Paraná River]] between the [[Guaíra Falls|Salto Grande de Sete Quedas]] and the mouth of the [[Iguassu River]] is shared in condominium by Brazil and Paraguay.
* Jamaica and Colombia share a maritime condominium (called a "Joint Regime Area") by mutual agreement as an alternative to delimiting their sea boundary.  The outer portion of the [[EEZ]] of each country otherwise would overlap in this area.  Unlike other "joint development zones", this condominium appears not to have been purposed simply as a way to divide oil, fisheries or other resources.
* In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Brčko District]] forms a condominium between the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/Amendment_I_to_the_Constitution_of_BiH_(OHR_and_CC).pdf AMENDMENT I TO THE CONSTITUTION OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-principality ==
Under French law, [[Andorra]] was once considered to be a French–Spanish condominium, although it is more commonly classed as a [[co-principality]], since it is itself a sovereign state, not a possession of one or more foreign powers. However, the position of Head of State is shared ''ex officio'' by two foreigners, one of whom is the [[President of France]], currently [[Emmanuel Macron]], and the other the [[Bishop of Urgell]] in Spain, [[Joan Enric Vives Sicília]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/coprince-d-andorre-hollande-rend-visite-a-la-principaute-12-06-2014-3917601.php Coprince d'Andorre, Hollande rend visite à la principauté], ''[[Le Parisien]]'', 12 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former condominia ==
* In 688 the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian II]] and the Arab [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reached an unprecedented agreement to establish a condominium (the concept did not yet exist) over [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Arab conquest and Arab-Byzantine condominium|Cyprus]], with the collected taxes from the island being equally divided between the two parties. The arrangement lasted for some 300 years, even though in the same time there was nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. {{Citation needed|reason=Please cite this|date=May 2018}}
* [[Fellesdistrikt|Fellesdistrikt (Common District)]] ({{lang-no|Fellesdistrikt}}, {{lang-ru|Общий район}}) was an Russo-Norvegian condominium from 1684 until 1826.
[[File:Flag of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] (1899–1956)]] 
* [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] was legally an Egyptian-British condominium from 1899 until 1956, although in reality Egypt played no role in its government other than providing some administrators in the country: all political decisions were made by the UK and all Governors-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were British. Though the system was resented by Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, and would later be disavowed by the Egyptian Government, it persisted due to the United Kingdom's effective control over Egypt itself, which began from 1882 and continued until at least 1936.
* The [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was jointly ruled by [[Cisleithania|Cisleithanian Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] between 1908 and 1918, while both [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878-1918)|countries]] were parts of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].
* An islet in the border river [[Brömsebäck]] was considered to belong to neither (or both) Denmark and Sweden.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* The [[Independent State of Croatia]] during World War II from 1941 to 1943 was a condominium of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] until the collapse of the Italian Fascist regime in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Jozo Tomasevich.

* [[Couto Misto]] was shared until 1864 between Spain and Portugal, even though in its final decades of existence it was ''de facto'' independent.
* Countship of [[Friesland]] ([[West Frisia (historical)|West Frisia]]), since 1165 under Imperial administration, was from 1165 to 1493 a joint condominium of the [[Count of Holland]] and the [[Prince-bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Utrecht]], then again until 25 October 1555 under Imperial administration.

* The city of [[Erfurt]] from 12th century until the [[Thirty Years' War]] was shared between the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]] and the Counts of [[Gleichen]], the latter replaced by the city council in 1289 (Concordata Gebhardi), the Landgrave of [[Thuringia]] in 1327 and the [[House of Wettin]] in 1483 (Treaty of Weimar).
* A small area ([[Hadf]] and surroundings) on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], a part of Oman, at one time was jointly ruled with the Emirati member state of [[Ajman]].  The agreement defining the Hadf zone was signed in Salalah on 26 April 1960 by Sultan Said bin Taimur and in Ajman on 30 April 1960 by Shaikh [[Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi]], ruler of Ajman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The UAE: Internal Boundaries and the Boundary with Oman| isbn=1-85207-575-9|volume=6| pages=477–478}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided for some joint supervision in the zone by the ruler of Ajman and the shaikhs under the rule of Muscat. It allowed the Ajman ruler to continue collecting [[zakat]] (Islamic tax). The ruler of Ajman was, however, not to interfere in the affairs of the local people, the ''Bani Ka'ab'' (a branch of the [[Banu Kaab]]), which were the sole responsibility of shaikhs who were under Muscat rule.  The agreement was later terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/borderpoint/message/3566 |title =Ajman/Muscat condominium |quote=I don't know when the Hadf zone agreement was terminated, but it certainly was.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* The [[Free City of Kraków]] was a protectorate of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] from 1815 until 1846, when it was annexed by Austria
* [[Maastricht]] was a condominium for five centuries until 1794. It was shared between the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the latter replaced by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1632
* [[Nauru]] was a tripartite condominium [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] territory administered by Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom from 1923 to 1942 and again in 1947 as a [[trust territory]] until independence in 1968
* The village of [[Nennig]] was a condominium of the [[Electorate of Trier|Trier bishopric]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] (the [[Early Modern France|Kingdom of France]] from 1766) and [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] until its annexation by [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]] in 1794

* The [[Oregon Country]] was an Anglo-American condominium from 1818 until 1846
* [[Samoan Islands]] from 1889 to 1899 were a rare tripartite condominium under joint [[protectorate]] of Germany, Britain and the United States.
* Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg were an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] condominium. The two German powers acceded it following the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]]. According to the [[Gastein Convention]] in the next year, Lauenburg left the condominium (to Prussia), Austria governed Holstein and Prussia Schleswig. In 1866, after the Austro-Prussian War, Austria passed over its remaining rights to Prussia. Prussia later created the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]].
* The [[County of Sponheim]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was ruled since the 15th century by the [[Margraviate of Baden|Margraves of Baden]], the [[Palatinate of the Rhine|Counts Palatine of the Rhine]] and the [[County of Veldenz|Counts of Veldenz]], later [[Palatinate-Simmern]], [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]] and [[Palatinate-Birkenfeld]] as heirs of Veldenz.
* The [[Spanish Netherlands]] became an Anglo-Dutch condominium in 1706 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], until the peace treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] in 1713/14 ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, J S (editor) 1970, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22condominium%22+William+III&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CYFEBG4g93&amp;sig=U5ebcD06VPjx4AvKOXln-bzTROM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c2_GVICwKquR7AbwwIHAAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22condominium%22%20William%20III&amp;f=false ''The New Cambridge Modern History Volume 6: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25''], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521075244}} (p. 428)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Togoland]], formerly a German protectorate, was an Anglo-French condominium, from when the United Kingdom and France occupied it on 26 August 1914 until its partition on 27 December 1916 into French and British zones. The divided Togoland became two separate [[League of Nations mandate]]s on 20 July 1922: [[British Togoland]], which joined Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) in 1956, and [[French Togoland]], which is now the nation of Togo.
* [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a brief Russo-Polish condominium, was established in 1667 by the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]].
* [[Tangier International Zone]], an [[international zone]] nominally under Moroccan sovereignty but jointly administered by several European powers.
* The term is sometimes even applied to a similar arrangement between members of a Monarch's countries in (personal or formal) union, as was the case for the district of [[Fiume]] (Rijeka), shared between Hungary and Croatia within the Habsburg Empire since 1868.
* Between 1913 and 1920 [[Spitsbergen]] was a neutral condominium. The [[Svalbard Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty]] of 9 February 1920 recognises the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over all the arctic archipelago of [[Svalbard]]. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. Originally limited to nine signatory nations, over 40 are now signatories of the treaty. Citizens of any of the signatory countries may settle in the archipelago. Currently, only Norway and Russia make use of this right.
* In 1992, South Africa and Namibia established a Joint Administrative Authority in the enclave of [[Walvis Bay]], prior to its cession to Namibia in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qrkvAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=walvis+bay+enclave+%22Joint+Administrative+Authority%22+%28JAA%29+in+November+1992&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Joint+Administrative+Authority%22+ Namibia Yearbook], Issue 3, pages 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed condominia==
* In 2001, the British government held discussions with Spain with a view to putting a proposal for joint sovereignty to the people of [[Gibraltar]]. This initiative was pre-emptively rejected by Gibraltarians in the [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|2002 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gi.html CIA – The World Factbook – Gibraltar] US Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3851047.stm#overview BBC News | Europe | Country profiles | Regions and territories: Gibraltar] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, the Canadian and Danish governments were close to an agreement to declare [[Hans Island]] a condominium, after decades in dispute. Another considered alternative was to divide the island in half. Negotiations continued.
* Hypothetical condominia have been proposed for [[Jerusalem]] (Israel-Palestine) within the framework of [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] independence.
* In the talks between the UK and the People's Republic of China in 1983–84 over the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]], one of the British proposals was to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] and its dependencies to the People's Republic of China while the UK would retain the rights of administration of the territory.&lt;ref name="Cottrell"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090809225312/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-mrs-thatcher-lost-hong-kong-ten-years-ago-fired-up-by-her-triumph-in-the-falklands-war-margaret-thatcher-flew-to-peking-for-a-lastditch-attempt-to-keep-hong-kong-under-british-rule--only-to-meet-her-match-in-deng-xiaoping-two-years-later-she-signed-the-agreement-handing-the-territory-to-china-1543375.html How Mrs Thatcher lost Hong Kong], ''[[The Independent]]'', Robert Cottrell, 30 August 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rejected and negotiations ended with the UK agreeing to relinquish all rights over Hong Kong to China in 1997.

* In 1984, the [[New Ireland Forum]] suggested a proposal for joint UK/Irish authority in [[Northern Ireland]] to try to bring an end to the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] conflict. This idea was dismissed by the British government. The [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998 lead to the establishment of a devolved power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland lead jointly by the First and Deputy First Minister; positions nominated separately by the largest parties in each of the two largest community designations in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly|assembly]]. The proposal of joint-authority by the UK and Irish governments over Northern Ireland was raised again in 2017 after the collapse of the power-sharing executive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/northern-ireland-british-irish-rule-sdlp-dup-sinn-fein SDLP backs British-Irish rule if Northern Ireland devolution fails], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Countering Violent Extremism Task Force''', or '''CVE''', is a US government program established under the [[Obama administration]] to counter all violent ideologies, held by groups or individuals in the US, by engaging communities in the [[counterterrorism]] effort and by education programs or counter-messaging. The program works with community groups such as local governments, police departments, universities, and non-profits.

In December 2016, the incoming [[Trump presidency|Trump]] presidential transition team planned to stop the program from targeting [[white supremacy|white supremacists]], which have committed bombings and shootings such as at a [[Charleston church shooting|black church in Charleston]].

'''The Central Intelligence Service''' (CIS, KYP) is the intelligence-gathering body of Cyprus. It was reorganised and given official status by a 14 April 2016 Parliamentary bill. The CIS was initially founded in 1970 by President [[Archbishop Makarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anastasiou|first1=Angelos|title=After 46 years, intelligence service gets legal stature|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/04/15/after-46-years-intelligence-service-gets-legal-stature/?s|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Cyprus Mail|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Independent Authority was renamed "Cyprus Intelligence Service" and is responsible for internal and external national security, i.e. a Cypriot combination of MI5 and MI6.

Since 4 May 2016, the Cyprus President [[Nicos Anastasiades]] has been expected to appoint (Presidential proposal appointment by Council of Ministers) the director of the new CIS and the two sub-commanders under the new legislation (Article 7). The new law, N. 75(I) of 2016, was published in the official journal on 4 May 2016 and entered into force immediately. No appointments have been made to implement the new law. The decision was taken to continue with the old structure of the service until the necessary regulations required by the new law are enacted and also the prospect of a solution of the Cyprus Problem played a role for this decision.

Before the entry into force of the new law and until today, the political director has been Ambassador Kyriakos Kouros and the director Marios Christofides, who is a senior police officer. The rest of the members are either police officers or members of the Cyprus National Guard placed in the CIS Headquarters in Ayios Andreas, Nicosia.

Under the new law, the CIS will be able to have its own employees either as permanent members of the intelligence services or under contract and even be able to buy services from the private sector. Its budget will be confidential and under the control of the new director.

The new CIS Law contains 35 Articles and enacts the Cyprus Intelligence Service as an independent authority liable to the President of the Republic, currently Nikolaos Chrysanthou Anastasiades (2013-2018), and the Council of Ministers.

*A central command, consisting of a staff, support services, and 3 sub-directorates;
*A territorial command, made up of DCPAF's zonal directorates.

DCPAF has 10,088 agents as of January 1, 2013.

===Central Command===
The central command of DCPAF, headed by a central director and senior police officers from the design and management body, is composed of:
*A staff,
*Irregular immigration and territorial services sub-directorate, to which is attached the Central Office for the Suppression of Irregular Immigration and the Employment of Untitled Foreigners ([[OCRIEST]]) which coordinates and animates the activity deployed by the investigative units (mobile research brigades - BMR) of the decentralised services,
*a Resources Branch,
*a sub-directorate for cross-border international affairs and security, in particular responsible for monitoring relations with the [[European Border and Coast Guard Agency]] (FRONTEX),
*the [[Service national de la police ferroviaire|National Railway Police Service]].

===Territorial Command===
The DCPAF extends its action throughout the national territory of France and overseas through a territorial network based on 7 zonal directorates (DZPAF North, DZPAF East, DZPAF South East, DZPAF South, DZPAF South West, DZPAF West, DZPAF Antilles-Guyane), 2 airport directorates ([[Charles De Gaulle Airport]]/ [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]]), 4 directorates (DPAF [[New Caledonia]], [[French Polynesia]], [[St Pierre and Miquelon]] and [[Mayotte]]), 45 departmental directorates (DDPAF), 7 railway brigades, 7 poles of analysis and operational management, 10 brigades of aeronautical police. 15 administrative detention centers are controlled by the DCPAF.

The '''Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes''' ({{lang-fr|Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects, DGDDI}}), commonly known as ''les douanes'', is a [[France|French]] [[law enforcement agency]] responsible for levying indirect taxes, preventing smuggling, surveilling borders and investigating counterfeit money. The agency acts as a [[coast guard]], [[border guard]], sea [[rescue]] organisation and a [[customs]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=141 Missions of the DGDDI]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 1995, the agency has replaced the [[Direction centrale de la police aux frontières|Border Police]] in carrying out [[immigration]] control at smaller [[border checkpoint]]s, in particular at maritime borders and regional airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |title=Center for the Study of Democracy: Study to identify best practices on the cooperation between border guards and customs administrations working at the external borders of the EU |access-date=2012-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110123/http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directorate-general is controlled by the Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service
({{lang-fr|Ministère du Budget, des Comptes publics et de la Fonction publique}}) at the [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)|Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment]]. It is normally known simply as "''la douane''", individual officers being referred to as "''douaniers''". Officers are routinely armed.&lt;ref&gt;p [http://www.douane.gouv.fr/menu.asp?id=430 Site internet de la Douane: Son organisation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727145550/http://www.douane.gouv.fr/menu.asp?id=430 |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Renault Mégane Douane française.jpg|thumbnail|[[Renault Mégane]] of the Douanes]]
The first French customs service was called the [[Ferme générale]] ("General Farm") and operated under the [[French monarchy|monarchy]]. The ferme générale was a private company which bought each year the right to collect taxes. After the [[French revolution|Revolution]], the General Farm was dismantled and the French Customs, as a State service were created. Shortly after the instauration of [[First French Empire|Empire]], the Customs gained a military status. Some personnels were affected in ''bureaux'' (port or office-based staff who were tasked to apply customs measures to the goods entering and leaving France), others in ''brigades'' (mobile detachments organized and equipped to patrol the borders and arrest smugglers).

During French wars, notably the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="History of the French Customs"&gt;source: [http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=164 Site de la Douane: L'Histoire de la douane] History of the French Customs&lt;/ref&gt; the brigades were used to form marksmen units and to track enemy units trying to infiltrate French lines. During WW1, due to their konwledge of the areas and their experience in human tracking, they were part of ''Corps Francs'' (small units which were tasked to operate behind German lines to collect intelligence and perform sabotages on enemy targets).
The red stripe on their uniforms is a remaining of the decoration of one of their officers, ''Capitaine Cutsaert'' during the [[Napoleonic wars]]

The military customs service fought in the early part of the [[Second World War]] but was disbanded in June 22nd 1940 after the French defeat and was never reconstituted as a military service.The most plausible reason was the downsizing of the French Military due to the 1940 armistice&lt;ref name="History of the French Customs" /&gt; Nonetheless small units of customs men from customs posts in [[French Indochina]] fought against the Japanese as guerilla units until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="History of the French Customs" /&gt;

The [[Musée national des douanes]] located in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]], presents the history of French customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rue89bordeaux.com/2015/08/visite-surprise-musee-national-des-douanes/|title=Visite surprise (1) : 900 ans d’histoire au Musée des douanes|author=Marylène Iapichino|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurisdiction ==
France has land borders with other members of the [[European Union Customs Union]] [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Monaco]] and [[Spain]].
European Union laws prohibit systematic customs checks at any border between two members of its Customs Union. So, there is permanent customs facility at the borders with these countries. However, France has borders with non members of this Union : [[Switzerland]], [[Andorra]], [[Brazil]] and [[Surinam]]&lt;ref name="Status of the European Countries"&gt;source: [https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries_fr] Status of the European Countriess&lt;/ref&gt;. At these borders are located customs facilities.
Moreover, there are many facilities inland. French Customs are allowed to search vehicles, merchandises and individuals anywhere France according to the French Customs Code, article 60.

French Customs, in addition to their main missions, are also tasked to perform immigration controls at the following airports and ports at the external border of the [[Schengen Area]]:

France is divided into 12 ''Directions inter-régionales'' (Inter-region Directorates). These 12 are divided into ''Directions régionales'' (Region Directorates).
* 42 are inland directorate, which typically consists of:
**Managerial, training and logistic services ;
**Customs ''Bureaux'': dealing with commerce ;
**Customs ''Brigades'': Squads dealing with surveillance ;
**Two regional units, the ''Service Régional d'Enquêtes'' ('''SRE''') ''Regional Service of (serious frauds) Investigations'', ''Service Régioanl d'Audits'' ('''SRA''') ''Regional Service of audits (before giving them a "trustee" status)'' ;
**A wines unit ;
* 4 are maritime directorates (''Direction Régionale Garde-Côtes'', ''DRGC'', Regional Coast-guard directorate). They are located in [[English Channel|Channel]] &amp; [[North Sea]], [[Nantes]], [[Marseille]], [[Antilles]]-[[French Guiana|Guyana]]) ;

== Legal Framework ==
Unlike [[National Police (French)|French Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie]], most customs officers do not gain their powers from the ''Code de Procédure Pénale'' (Code Of Criminal Procedure) but from the ''Code des Douanes National'' (''National Customs Code'')&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=678C48AE40AB6EDE4341DB578FC0411F.tpdila09v_1?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071570&amp;dateTexte=20170509] French Customs Code, article 60 to 67 quinquies A&lt;/ref&gt;.
They can :
* search vehicles of any kind, merchandises, people, artificial islands, installations and constructions of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone, commercial buildings and habitations ;
* perform drug tests on individuals ;
* order a driver to stop, and if he does not comply use all necessary means to immobilize him ;
* divert a ship to a French port ;
* seize documents and merchandises ;
* consult files of many administrations and nearly all companies which move goods or accomplish customs operations ;
* open boxes send by postal service or express fret companies ;
* perform identity checks, infiltrate criminal organizations
* investigate both nationally and internationally with foreign customs ;
* requisition qualified people ;
* take samples ;

Some of these operations require prior approval by a magistrate.

However, the personnels of the SNDJ, nicknamed ''Officiers de Douane Judiciaire'' ('''ODJ'''), can not use these powers. They gained their powers from the Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{frf}}[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=678C48AE40AB6EDE4341DB578FC0411F.tpdila09v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000032654924&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20170902] Code of Criminal Procedure article 28-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armament and equipment ==

=== Air ===

In 2010 the aircraft fleet consisted of [[Reims-Cessna F406]] maritime patrol aircraft; and [[Eurocopter EC-135]] and [[Eurocopter AS355|Aérospatiale AS355]] helicopters. Two Reims-Cessna F406s operated out of Martinique and the rest were based in metropolitan France.

From 2012 onwards eight [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft King Air 350s]] replaced the F406s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=113443 Surveillance maritime : La Douane va acquérir 8 nouveaux avions], Mer et Marine, 14 juin 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''discouraged worker''' is a person of legal employment age who is not actively seeking employment or who does not find employment after long-term [[unemployment]]. This is usually because an individual has given up looking or has had no success in finding a job, hence the term "discouraged".

In other words, even if a person is still looking actively for a job, that person may have fallen out of the core statistics of unemployment rate after long-term unemployment and is therefore by default classified as "discouraged" (since the person does not appear in the core statistics of unemployment rate). In some cases, their belief may derive from a variety of factors including a shortage of jobs in their locality or line of work; [[discrimination]] for reasons such as [[ageism|age]], [[racism|race]], [[sexism|sex]], [[religionism|religion]], [[Sexualism|sexual orientation]], and [[Ableism|disability]]; a lack of necessary skills, training, or experience; or, a [[chronic illness]] or [[disability]].&lt;ref name="Canada discourage2"/&gt;

As a general practice, discouraged workers, who are often classified as ''marginally attached to the labor force'', ''on the margins'' of the labor force, or as part of ''hidden unemployment'', are not considered part of the labor force, and are thus not counted in most official [[unemployment rate]]s—which influences the appearance and interpretation of unemployment statistics. Although some countries offer alternative measures of unemployment rate, the existence of discouraged workers can be inferred from a low [[employment-to-population ratio]].

In the [[United States]], a discouraged worker is defined as a person not in the labor force who wants and is available for a job and who has looked for work sometime in the past 12 months (or since the end of his or her last job if a job was held within the past 12 months), but who is not currently looking because of real or perceived poor employment prospects.&lt;ref name="econbook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Arthur |authorlink1=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |last2=Sheffrin |first2=Steven M. |title=Economics: Principles in Action |url=|accessdate=|edition=2nd |series=''The Wall Street Journal'': Classroom Edition |year=2003 |origyear= January 2002|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall: Addison Wesley Longman|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |isbn=0-13-063085-3 |page= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/budget/glossary.shtml |title=Glossary |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506160319/https://www.cbo.gov/budget/glossary.shtml |archivedate=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The worker thinks no work is available.
#The worker could not find work.
#The worker lacks schooling or training.
#The worker is viewed as too young or too old by the prospective employer.
#The worker is the target of various types of discrimination.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], discouraged workers are often referred to as ''hidden unemployed'' because of their behavioral pattern, and are often described as ''on the margins'' of the labour force.&lt;ref name="Canada discourage"/&gt; Since the numbers of discouraged workers and of unemployed generally move in the same direction during the [[business cycle]] and the seasons (both tend to rise in periods of low
economic activity and vice versa), some [[economist]]s have suggested that discouraged workers should be included in the unemployment numbers because of the close association.&lt;ref name="Canada discourage" /&gt;

The information on the number and composition of the discouraged worker group in [[Canada]] originates from two main sources. One source is the monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS), which identifies persons who looked for work in the past six months but who have since stopped searching. The other source is the Survey of Job Opportunities (SJO), which is much closer in design to the approach used in many other countries. In this survey, all those expressing a desire for work and who are available for work are counted, irrespective of their past job search activity.&lt;ref name="Canada discourage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akyeampong|first=Ernest B. |date=Autumn 1989|title=Discouraged Workers|journal=Perspectives on Labour and Income|volume=1|series=2|publisher=Statistics Canada|location=Canada|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/cgi-bin/af-fdr.cgi?l=eng&amp;loc=e-pdf/2283-eng.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], while discouraged workers were once less educated than "average workers", they now have better training and education but still tend to be concentrated in areas of high unemployment.&lt;ref name="Canada discourage2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akyeampong|first=Ernest B. |date=Autumn 1992 (|title=Discouraged workers - where have they gone?|journal=Perspectives on Labour and Income|volume=4|issue=Article 5|series=3|publisher=Statistics Canada|location=Canada|id=Catalogue=75- 001E|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=75-001-X199200328&amp;lang=eng|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada discourage" /&gt; Discouraged workers are not seeking a job for one of two reasons: labour market-related reasons (worker discouragement, waiting for recall to a former job or waiting for replies to earlier job search efforts) and personal and other reasons (illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, going to school, and so on).&lt;ref name="Canada discourage2"/&gt;

==European Union==
Unemployment statistics published according to the ILO methodology may understate actual unemployment in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/mar/17/10-things-unemployment-statistics|title=10 things you didn't know about the unemployment statistics|work=the Guardian|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU statistical bureau EUROSTAT started publishing figures on discouraged workers in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-057/EN/KS-SF-11-057-EN.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204123802/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-057/EN/KS-SF-11-057-EN.PDF |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the method used by EUROSTAT there are 3 categories that make up discouraged workers;
* underemployed part-time workers
* jobless persons seeking a job but not immediately available for work,
* persons available for work but not seeking it

The first group are contained in the employed statistics of the European Labour Force Survey while the second two are contained in the inactive persons statistics of that survey.
In 2012 there were 9.2 million underemployed part-time workers, 2.3 million jobless persons seeking a job but not immediately available for work, and 8.9 million persons available for work but not seeking it, an increase of 0.6 million for underemployed and 0.3 million for the two groups making up discouraged workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Unemployment_and_underemployment_statistics|title=Unemployment and beyond|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electronic Staff Record''' or '''ESR''' is an [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]-based human resources and payroll database system currently used by 586 units of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to manage the payroll for 1.2 million NHS staff members. The Electronic Staff Record application is managed by IBM for the NHS.

==Implementation==
Starting in 2006, groups of around 50 units were implemented every two months. Implementation of ESR was completed in March 2008 when the last of twelve groups went live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicstaffrecord.nhs.uk/ ESR Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The implementation of ESR is one of the largest I.T. implementations in the world and replaced 29 payroll systems and approximately 38 human resources systems used throughout the NHS. The NHS is [[List of largest employers|fifth largest employer in the world]] as of March 2012.

==Supported versions of software to access ESR==

The ESR solution is based on Oracle's e-Business suite R12 which is certified to run with most Windows desktop operating systems currently supported by Microsoft. In general Oracle’s certification of third party client operating systems and browser products are aligned to the respective vendor’s lifetime support cycle.

Access to ESR is tested and supported on an ongoing basis against the following versions of software :-
* Windows 7 (32-bit)
* Internet Explorer version 8
* Microsoft Office 2010
* JRE version 1.6.0_39
* Flashplayer 10.3

Accepting that user organisations may wish to run more up to date versions of these software components, they are recommended to run at least one “Base” workstation on the supported levels above. The Base workstation should then be used to replicate any ESR access issues, before an access related support call is logged on the ESR Service Desk. The ESR Support Team will then work with the site to resolve the access issue on the Base workstation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2392">A '''feed additive''' is a food supplement for farm animals that cannot get enough nutrients from regular meals. Such additives include [[vitamins]], [[amino acids]], [[fatty acids]], and [[minerals]].  In some cases, if an animal does not have some specific nutrition in its diet, it may not grow properly. The nutritional values of animal feeds are influenced not only by their nutrient content, but also by many other factors. These include feed presentation, hygiene, digestibility, and effect on intestinal health. Even with all of the benefits of higher quality feed, most of a farm animal's diet still consists of maize, wheat, and soybean meal because of the higher costs of quality feed.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual October 2014 [http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/management_and_nutrition/nutrition_cattle/nutritional_requirements_of_beef_cattle.html Nutritional Requirements of Beef Cattle] Page accessed March 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual October 2014 [http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/management_and_nutrition/nutrition_cattle/nutritional_requirements_of_beef_cattle.html Nutritional Requirements of Beef Cattle] Page accessed March 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual March 2012 [http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/poultry/nutrition_and_management_poultry/nutritional_requirements_of_poultry.htmlNutritional Requirements of Beef Cattle] Page accessed March 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== EU Regulatory aspects ==

According to EU Regulation 1831/2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irmm.jrc.ec.europa.eu/SiteCollectionDocuments/EC-1831-2003.pdf "REGULATION (EC) No 1831/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL", 18.10.2003, Official Journal of the European Union (EN), L 268/29]&lt;/ref&gt; all feed additives to be placed on the market within the [[European Union]] have to undergo a thorough approval process. Products seeking approval for their use as feed additives are evaluated by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), the European Reference Laboratory, the [[European Commission]] and the member states. Evaluation criteria include safety for the animals, consumers and factory workers. For additives claiming an increase in zootechnical performance, sufficient empirical data must be presented to confirm those claims.

'''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Politics''''' is a 6x60 minutes [[documentary film|documentary]] TV-series about the relationship between singers and politics in the USA, the UK, Germany and France from the 1960s until 2003. It was made in 2003 by [[Rudi Dolezal]], [[Hannes Rossacher]] and Simon Witter as a joint production between German [[ZDF]] and the French-German culture channel [[Arte]]. It has since been shown by a number of other broadcasters in Europe, but also by Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Crying-freedom/2005/04/13/1113251640013.html|title=Crying freedom|date=2005-04-13|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features interviews with well known singers and songwriters including [[Joan Baez]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Bono]], [[David Bowie]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ice-T]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Neil Young]].

A much shorter, two-hour version, called '''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest''''', aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in September 2005, hosted and narrated by co-founder of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] [[Chuck D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/getupstandup/index.html|title=Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest|date=2005-09-01|work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PBS version focuses mainly on the American history of [[protest songs]].

The title is borrowed from the [[reggae]] protest song ''[[Get Up, Stand Up]]'' by [[Bob Marley]] and [[Peter Tosh]].

The '''Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition''' ({{lang-de|Anti-Freimaurer-Ausstellung}}, {{lang-sr|script=Latn|Antimasonska izložba}}) was the name of an [[antisemitic]] exhibition that was opened on 22 October 1941 during [[World War II]] in [[Belgrade]], the capital of the [[Nazi Germany]]-established [[Militärverwaltung]] in occupied [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]].

Financed by the Germans and opened with the support of collaborationist leader [[Milan Nedić]], it featured an estimated 200,000 brochures, 108,000 copies of nine different types of envelopes, 100,000 flyers, 60,000 copies of twenty different posters, and 176 different [[propaganda film]]s that had previously been seen during [[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)|The Eternal Jew]] exhibitions in [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]] in 1937. Despite nominally being anti-Masonic, its purpose was to promote [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] ideas and intensify hatred of Jews. Certain displays were intended to dehumanize the Jewish people and justify their extermination by the Germans. Others resembled anti-Jewish propaganda from the period of the [[Russian Empire]] and repeated the claims put forward in the book ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. The exhibition was organized by former members of the [[Fascism|fascist]] movement known as [[Yugoslav National Movement|Zbor]] and sought to expose an alleged Judeo-Masonic/[[Communism|Communist]] conspiracy for [[world government|world domination]] through several displays featuring antisemitic [[propaganda]].

Four stamps commemorating the exhibition were issued by Serbian [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] authorities in January 1942, depicting [[Judaism]] as being the source of all evil in the world and portraying a "strong and victorious Serbia triumphing over the plot of world domination." An estimated 80,000 people, including collaborationist leader [[Milan Nedić]] and some of his ministers, visited the exhibition prior to its closure on 19 January 1942.

==Background==
[[File:Posters11.jpg|thumb|A poster from the exhibition.]]
On 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} The country was then dismembered, with the [[Wehrmacht]] establishing the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]]{{sfnm|Hehn|1971|1p=350|Pavlowitch|2002|2p=141|ps=, official name of the occupied territory.}} under a [[Martial law|government]] of [[military occupation]]. The territory included most of [[Serbia proper]], with the addition of the [[Kosovo|northern part of Kosovo]] (around [[Kosovska Mitrovica]]), and the [[Banat (1941–1944)|Banat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=63–64}} It was the only area of occupied Yugoslavia in which the Germans established a military government. This was done to exploit the key rail and [[Danube|riverine transport]] routes that passed through it, and because of its valuable resources, particularly [[non-ferrous metal]]s.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=64}} The Military Commander in Serbia appointed Serbian [[puppet government]]s to "carry on administrative chores under German direction and supervision".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=177}} The Germans also promoted the fascist [[Yugoslav National Movement]] (''Zbor''), led by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]].{{sfn|Thomas|1999|p=20}}

Meanwhile, the extreme [[Croat]] nationalist and fascist [[Ante Pavelić]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of an [[Ustaše]]-led Croatian state – the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (often called the NDH, from the {{lang-hr|Nezavisna Država Hrvatska}}). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]] into an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate."{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} NDH authorities, led by the [[Ustaše militia]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=397–409}} implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] population living within the borders of the new state.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20–24}} As a result, two resistance movements emerged in Yugoslavia – the Serb royalist Chetniks, led by [[Colonel]] [[Draža Mihailović]], and the multi-ethnic, [[Communist]] [[Yugoslav Partisans]], led by [[Josip Broz Tito]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=4}}

On 29 August 1941, the Germans appointed the [[Government of National Salvation]] ({{lang-sr|script=Latn|Vlada Nacionalnog Spasa}}, Влада Националног Спаса) under General [[Milan Nedić]], to replace the short-lived Commissioner Administration.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=179}} Nedić, a pre-war politician, believed since the defeat of France in the 1940 that the Germans would emerge as the winners in [[World War II]] and sought to protect the Serbian people from German retaliation by cooperating with the Axis. Resistance to the Germans emerged immediately and caused the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] to declare that a hundred Serbs would be executed for every German soldier killed and fifty Serbs would be executed for every German soldier wounded. By October 1941, the Germans executed more than 25,000 Serbs in various revenge killings throughout the occupied territory.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|pp=141–142}}

Upon capturing Belgrade in April, the Germans ordered the city's 12,000 Jews to report themselves to the occupational authorities. Laws were then passed which prohibited Jews from various activities in the occupied territory, ranging from going to restaurants to riding streetcars.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=130–131}} Jews were ordered to wear identifying armbands on which the word "Jew" ({{lang-sr|script=Latn|Jevrejin}}) was painted in black letters.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=90}} Some Serbs accused the Jews of being behind the [[Yugoslav coup d'état]] which resulted in the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and Nedić went so far as to call the Partisans a "criminal Jewish gang."{{sfn|Israeli|2013|pp=24–25}}

The Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition opened in Belgrade on 22 October 1941 at 8 Ilija Garašanin Street.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}} The Belgrade exhibit was organized by former members of Zbor{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=302}} and sought to expose an alleged Judeo-Masonic/Communist conspiracy for [[world government|world domination]] through several displays featuring [[antisemitic]] propaganda. It was funded by the Germans and opened with Nedić's support. Despite nominally being anti-Masonic, its purpose was to promote antisemitic ideas and intensify hatred of Jews.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} Certain displays were intended to dehumanize the Jewish people and justify their extermination by the Germans.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=54}} Others resembled anti-Jewish propaganda from the period of the [[Russian Empire]] and repeated the claims put forward in the book ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. Besides the exhibits themselves, large amounts of propaganda material were prepared. An estimated 200,000 brochures, 108,000 copies of nine different types of envelopes, 100,000 flyers, 60,000 copies of twenty different posters, 176 [[propaganda film]]s and four postage stamps designed specially for the occasion were presented to visitors.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} The posters in particular have been described by historian [[Raphael Israeli]] as "[giving] a sense of the vile flavour of the exhibition and the theme of Jewish dominance."{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=25}} In general, the exhibition itself has been deemed "bizarre"{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=93}} and "heavily antisemitic" by historians.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} Author Philip J. Cohen describes it as "vicious anti-Jewish propaganda."{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=77}}

The organizers of the exhibition created advertisements that read: "This concept of exhibition will be unique not only in Serbia and the Balkans, not only in southeastern Europe and Europe, but in the world." However, the images depicted were not unique as they had been previously seen in 1937 during [[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)|The Eternal Jew]] exhibitions in [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} Serbian collaborationist newspapers such as ''Obnova'' (Renewal) and ''Naša Borba'' (Our Struggle) wrote positively of the exhibit, declaring Jews to be "the ancient enemies of the Serbian people" and that "Serbs should not wait for the Germans to begin the extermination of the Jews."{{sfn|Israeli|2013|pp=24–25}} ''Obnova'' reported that 20,000 people had visited the exhibit by 27 October.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}}

In January 1942, Serbian collaborationist authorities issued stamps commemorating the exhibition.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=25}} The stamps portrayed a "strong and victorious Serbia triumphing over the plot of world domination".{{sfn|Baum|2011|p=131}} Juxtaposing Serbian and Jewish symbols, the stamps depicted [[Judaism]] as being the source of all evil in the world while promoting the Serbian humiliation and violent subjugation of the Jews.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=25}} They also ensured that every time a person mailed a letter they would be reminded that Jews, Masons and Communists were the supposed enemies of the Serbian people.{{sfn|Baum|2011|p=131}} The exhibition lasted until 19 January 1942, when it was closed. By then, it had been visited by an estimated 80,000 people, including Nedić and some of his ministers.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}}

The community was established in the early 1900s by [[Denmark|Danish]] settlers who named their new home in honour of [[Ludvig Holberg|Baron Ludwig Holberg]], the great Danish [[playwright]].

Holberg is on the long, winding, unpaved road to [[Cape Scott Provincial Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/cape.html|title=redirect|work=gov.bc.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628230238/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/cape.html|archivedate=2006-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Josef Bay, British Columbia|San Josef Bay]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalice.ca/capescott.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206110454/http://www.portalice.ca/capescott.htm |date=February 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Winter Harbour, British Columbia|Winter Harbour]].

Nearby [[Ronning Gardens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouverisland.travel/gardentrail/|title=Vancouver Island, Victoria and the Gulf Islands&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=vancouverisland.travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anomaly in the west coast [[temperate rainforest]], was created by [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] settler Bernt Ronning around 1910.

Holberg has always been noted for [[logging]] and copious amounts of precipitation.

During the [[Cold War]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] established [[RCAF]] Station Holberg, a [[Pinetree Line]] radar base.

Up on one of the roads of Holberg is a small school called ''San Josef Elementary''.

Holberg is serviced by an AM radio station, CFHG 1490. CFHG began operations on April 16, 1963 from studios at CFS Holberg. The station primarily aired the programs of Vancouver [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] station [[CBU (AM)|CBU]], but it also aired local programs produced by volunteer staff at the station. CFHG, which produced up to 28 hours of local programming per week in the beginning, gradually increased its local programming content to as much as 68 hours a week by 1984. When [[CFS Holberg]] closed and was mostly dismantled in 1990 due to budget cuts, CFHG was sold to [[Western Forest Products|Western Forest Products Ltd.]] and became a community-owned full rebroadcaster of CBU. Like other CBC Radio One repeaters on Vancouver Island, CFHG now rebroadcasts [[CBCV-FM]] Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinetreeline.org/other/other21/other21n.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinetreeline.org/other/other21/other21a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitor guidance==
Visitors to Holberg typically pass through fabulous natural parks that are made accessible via logging roads.  With the exception of [[Winter Harbour, British Columbia|Winter Harbour]], land access to [[San Josef Bay, British Columbia|San Josef Bay]], [[Raft Cove Provincial Park]], and [[Cape Scott Provincial Park]] is all by way of Holberg.  The town itself carries its own interesting history and is worthy of a quick stop to see the remnants of what was once the world's largest floating town.

Despite the very low population, the Scarlet Ibis Pub remains in operation, providing a relaxing, family friendly stop on the way to and from the surrounding destinations.

[[File:US Debt Trend.svg|thumb|The U.S. National Debt is often cited as an example of intergenerational inequity, as future generations will have the responsibility of paying it off. The U.S. National Debt has grown substantially over the past several decades. Relative to total GDP, the debt burden has worsened in the past several years.]]
'''Intergenerational equity''' in economic, psychological, and sociological contexts, is the concept or idea of fairness or [[justice]] between generations. The concept can be applied to fairness in dynamics between [[children]], [[youth]], [[adults]] and [[Old age|seniors]], in terms of treatment and interactions. It can also be applied to fairness between generations currently living and generations yet to be born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Read: Generation wars|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15456374.The_Big_Read__Generation_wars/|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversations about intergenerational equity occur across several fields.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.globalepe.org/values_ie.html EPE Values: Intergenerational Ethics] Earth and Peace Education Associates International website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often discussed in public economics, especially with regard to [[transition economics]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/pie/Japanese/seminar/A6-workshop0503/index.html "Economics of Intergenerational Equity in Transition Economies"] 10–11 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social policy]], and [[Government budget|government budget-making]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. (2003) [http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/2002-03/03RP07.htm Research Paper no. 7 2002-03 Intergenerational Equity: Issues of Principle in the Allocation of Social Resources Between this Generation and the Next]. Social Policy Group for the Parliament of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Many cite the growing U.S. national debt as an example of intergenerational inequity, as future generations will shoulder the consequences. Intergenerational equity is also explored in [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index165.html Gosseries, A. (2008) "Theories of intergenerational justice: a synopsis". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.fathom.com/course/21701763/session3.html Understanding Sustainable Development] Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[global warming]] and [[climate change]]. The continued depletion of natural resources that has occurred in the past century will likely be a significant burden for future generations. Intergenerational equity is also discussed with regard to [[Standard of living|standards of living]], with the focus falling on inequities in the living standards experienced by people of different ages and generations.&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadji"&gt;d'Albis, Hippolyte and Ikpidi Badji (2017) [http://www.ntaccounts.org/doc/repository/Albis_Badji_2017.pdf "Intergenerational Inequalities in Standards of Living in France"], ''Economie et Statistique / Economics and Statistics'', 491-492: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadjiElMekkaouiNavaux"&gt;d'Albis, Hippolyte, Ikpidi Badji, Najat El Mekkaoui and Julien Navaux (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeoa.2017.11.002 "Private Asset Income in France: Is There a Breakdown of Intergenerational Equity between 1979 and 2011?"], ''Journal of the Economics of Ageing''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald"&gt;Rice, James M, Jeromey B Temple and Peter F McDonald (2017) [http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Consumption.pdf "Private and Public Consumption across Generations in Australia"], ''Australasian Journal on Ageing'', 36(4): 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Intergenerational equity issues also arise in the arenas of [[elderly care]] and [[social justice]].

== Public economics usage ==

=== History ===
Since the first recorded debt issuance in Sumaria in 1796 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/finciv/chapter1.htm|title=Financing Civilization|first=William|last=Goetzmann|date=|website=viking.som.yale.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the penalties for failure to repay a loan has been [[debt bondage]]. In some instances, this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtor's children, essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery. About one millennium after written debt contracts were created, the concept of [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]] appears in the Old Testament, called [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] ([[Leviticus]] 25), and in Greek law when Solon introduces [[Seisachtheia]].  Both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents' debt.

While [[slavery]] is illegal in all countries today, North Korea has a policy called, "Three Generations of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaechon internment camp]]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been documented by [[Shin Dong-hyuk]] and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents' mistakes. Stanley Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada have applied this concept (calling it "Generational Theft"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323485704578257753243530078|title=WSJ|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the large increase in government debt being left by the Baby Boomers to their children.

=== Investment management ===
In the context of institutional [[investment management]], intergenerational equity is the principle that an endowed institution's spending rate must not exceed its after-inflation rate of compound return, so that investment gains are spent equally on current and future constituents of the endowed assets. This concept was originally set out in 1974 by [[economist]] [[James Tobin]], who wrote that, "The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, James.  (1974) "[http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i2p427-32.html What is Permanent Endowment Income?]"&lt;/ref&gt;
in terms of an economical context. ''Intergenerational equity'' refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources. An example is the forest-dwelling civilians in Papua New Guinea, who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest which thus becomes their land. The adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money. If they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources, their next or future generations will lose this resource.

=== U.S. national debt ===
{{See also|National debt of the United States}}
One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:
*For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them, which by definition must correspond to the level of debt passed on.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/debt-is-mostly-money-we-owe-to-ourselves/|title=Debt Is (Mostly) Money We Owe to Ourselves|author=|date=28 December 2011|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html|title=Who Rules America: Wealth, Income, and Power|author=|date=|website=www2.ucsc.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today. 
*To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the "debt held by the public" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; 
*Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010). [http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11659 "Federal debt and the risk of a fiscal crisis"].  Congressional Budget Office:  Macroeconomic Analysis Division. Retrieved February 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via useful infrastructure projects, future generations may benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/david-brooks-is-projecting-his-self-indulgence-again|title=David Brooks Is Projecting His Self Indulgence Again|first=Dean|last=Baker|date=|website=cepr.net|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: "Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we’re doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/opinion/krugman-cheating-our-children.html|title=Opinion - Cheating Our Children|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=28 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian politician [[Christine Milne]] made similar statements in the lead up to the 2014 Carbon Price Repeal Bill, naming the Liberal National Party (elected to parliament in 2013) and inherently its ministers, as intergenerational thieves; her statement was based on the party's attempts to roll back progressive carbon tax policy and the impact this would have on the intergenerational equity of future generations.

=== U.S. Social Security ===
{{See also|Social Security (United States)}}The U.S. Social Security system has provided a greater net benefit to those who reached retirement closest to the first implementation of the system. The system is unfunded, meaning the elderly who retired right after the implementation of the system did not pay any taxes into the social security system, but reaped the benefits. Professor Michael Doran estimates that cohorts born previous to 1938 will receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, while the reverse is true to cohorts born after. Further, he admits that the long-term insolvency of Social Security will likely lead to be further unintentional intergenerational transfers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Michael Doran (2008). “Intergenerational Equity in Fiscal Policy Reform”. Tax law Rewiew. 61: 241-293&lt;/ref&gt; However, Broad concedes that other benefits have been introduced into U.S. society via the welfare system, like Medicare and government-financed medical research, that benefit current and future elderly cohorts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Environmental usage ==

Intergenerational equity is often referred to in environmental contexts, as younger age cohorts will disproportionately experience the negative consequences of environmental damage. Two perspectives can be taken on what should be done to ameliorate environmental intergenerational equity: the "[[Weak and strong sustainability|weak sustainability]]" perspective and the "strong sustainability" perspective. From the "weak" perspective, intergenerational equity would be achieved if losses to the environment that future generations face were offset by gains in economic progress. From the "strong" perspective, no amount of economic progress can justify leaving future generations with a degraded environment. According to Professor Sharon Beder, the "weak" perspective is undermined by a lack of knowledge of the future, as we do not know which intrinsically valuable resources will not be able to be replaced by technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sharon Beder, 'Costing the Earth: Equity, Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law, 4, 2000, pp. 227-243.&lt;/ref&gt; We also do not know to what extent environmental damage is irreversible. Further, more harm cannot be avoided to many species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars contest Beder's point of view. Professor Wilfred Beckerman insists that "strong sustainability" is "morally repugnant", particularly when it overrides other moral concerns about those alive today.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beckerman, Wilfred. "'Sustainable Development': Is it a Useful Concept?" Environmental Values 3, no. 3, (1994): 191–209. doi:10.3197/096327194776679700.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckerman insists that the optimal choice for society is to prioritize the welfare of current generations above future generations. He suggests placing a discount rate on outcomes for future generations when accounting for generational equity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Juliana vs. United States ===

In September 2015, a group of youth environmental activists filed to sue the U.S. federal government for insufficiently protecting against climate change. Their statement emphasized the disproportionate cost of climate-related damage younger generations would bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/23/can-citizens-sue-the-government-over-climate-change/citizens-have-a-right-to-sue-for-climate-change-action|title=Citizens Have a Right to Sue for Climate Change Action|last=Chemerinsky|first=Erwin|date=July 11, 2016|work=New York Times|access-date=April 28, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated “Youth Plaintiffs represent the youngest living generation, beneficiaries of the public trust. Youth Plaintiffs have a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in protecting the atmosphere, other vital natural resources, their quality of life, their property interests, and their liberties. They also have an interest in ensuring that the climate system remains stable enough to secure their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, rights that depend on a livable Future.”&lt;ref&gt;Juliana V. United States, First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief United States District Court, District of Oregon - Eugene Division

Filed 9/10/15 
&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the case was allowed to go to trial after US District Court Judge Ann Aiken denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss the case. In her opinion and order, she said, “Exercising my ‘reasoned judgment,’ I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society."&lt;ref&gt;Juliana V United States, Opinion and Order In the United States District Court for the District of Oregon Eugene Division

Issued 11/10/16
&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, the trial was put on hold with a stay. The Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments on the stay in November of 2017 and a ruling is expected in February of 2018.

== Standards of living usage ==

Discussions of intergenerational equity in standards of living have referenced differences between people of different ages as well as differences between people of different generations. Two perspectives on intergenerational equity in living standards have been distinguished by Rice, Temple and McDonald. The first perspective – a "cross-sectional" perspective – focuses on living standards at a particular point in time and how these living standards vary between people of different ages. The relevant issue is the degree to which, at a particular point in time, people of different ages enjoy equal living standards. The second perspective – a "cohort" perspective – focuses on living standards over a lifetime and how these living standards vary between people of different generations. For intergenerational equity, the relevant issue becomes the degree to which people of different generations enjoy equal living standards over their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald" /&gt; Three indicators of intergenerational equity in economic flows, such as income, have been proposed by D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux. Their first indicator originates from a cross-sectional perspective and describes the relative situation of an age group (retirees) with respect to the situation of another age group (younger people). Their second indicator originates from a cohort perspective and compares the standards of living of successive generations at the same age. D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux's third indicator is a combination of the two previous criteria and is both an inter-age indicator and an intergenerational indicator.&lt;ref name="d'AlbisBadjiElMekkaouiNavaux" /&gt;

In Australia, notable equality has been achieved in living standards, as measured by consumption, among people between the ages of 20 and 75 years. Substantial inequalities exist, however, between different generations, with older generations experiencing lower living standards in real terms at particular ages than younger generations. One way to illustrate these inequalities is to look at how long different generations took to achieve a level of consumption of $30,000 per year (2009-10 Australian dollars). At one extreme, people born in 1935 achieved this level of consumption when they were roughly 50 years of age, on average. At the other extreme, Millennials born in 1995 had achieved this level of consumption by the time they were around 10 years of age.&lt;ref name="RiceTempleMcDonald" /&gt;

Considerations such as this have led some scholars to argue that standards of living have tended to increase generation over generation in most countries, as development and technology have progressed. When taking this into account, younger generations may have inherent privileges over older generations, which may offset the redistribution of wealth towards older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy Fifth Edition (c) 2016|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=2016|isbn=978-0716786559|location=Massachusetts, United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elderly care usage ==

Some scholars consider the changing cultural trends that move society away from the norm of adult children caring for elderly parents to be an intergenerational equity issue. The older generation had to care for their parents, as well as their own children, while the younger generation must only care for their children. This is especially true in countries with weak social security systems. Professor Sang-Hyop Lee describes the presence of this phenomenon in South Korea, explaining that the current elderly now have the highest poverty rate among any developed country. He notes that it is particularly frustrating because the elderly usually invest a lot in their children's education, and they now feel betrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sang-Hyop Lee on the middle-income trap and demographic crisis in East Asia|last=Willian|first=Caroline|date=March 27, 2017|work=Asia Experts Forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars express different opinions on which generation is truly disadvantaged by elderly care. Professor Steven Wisensale describes the burden on current working age adults in developed economies, who must care for more elderly parents and relatives for a longer period of time. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing involvement of women in the workforce, and by the dropping fertility rate, leaving the burden for caring for parents, as well as aunts, uncles, and grandparents, on fewer children.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Wisensale PhD (2005) Aging Societies and Intergenerational Equity Issues, Journal of Feminist Family Therapy, 17:3-4, 79-103, DOI: 10.1300/J086v17n03_05 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Social justice usage ==

Conversations about intergenerational equity are also relevant to [[social justice]] arenas as well, where issues such as [[health care]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A. (1997) "Intergenerational equity: An exploration of the 'fair innings' argument." ''Health Economics. 6''(2):117-32.&lt;/ref&gt; are equal in importance to [[youth rights]] and [[youth voice]] are pressing and urgent. There is a strong interest within the legal community towards the application of intergenerational equity in law.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brein, M. (n.d.) ''Not, 'Is it Irreparable?' But, 'Is it Unnecessary?' Thoughts on a Practical Limit for Intergenerational Equity Suits.'' Eugene, OR: Constitutional Law Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islamization}}
{{Islam and China|history}}
The historical area of what is modern day [[Xinjiang]] consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] (also known as [[Altishahr]]) and [[Dzungaria]], and was populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians]] and [[Saka]] peoples, who practiced [[Buddhism]]. They came under Chinese rule in the Han dynasty as the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] due to wars between the Han dynasty and the [[Xiongnu]] and again in the Tang dynasty as the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] due to wars between the Tang dynasty and the [[Turkic Khaganate]]s. The [[Tang dynasty]] withdrew its control of Xinjiang in the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] and the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]] after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], after which the area was subjected to [[Islamification]] at the hands of Turkic Muslims.

{{Violence against Buddhists}}

==Tarim Basin==
[[File:QizilDonors.jpg|thumb|right|"Tocharian donors", 6th-century mural from the [[Kizil Caves]]]]
The Tarim Basin, populated by the [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and [[Saka]], became the place of settlement by two different Turkic Kingdoms, the Buddhist Turkic Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim Turkic [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]].

The Turfan and Tarim Basins were populated by speakers of [[Tocharian languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA15 p. 15].&lt;/ref&gt; with "Europoid" mummies found in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; The oases were populated by Iranian and Tocharian language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA374 p. 374].&lt;/ref&gt; Different historians suggest that either the Sakas or Tokharians made up the Yuezhi people who lived in Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA14 p. 14].&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Tarim Basin is where Tokharian language records were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA12 p. 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of the Tarim Basin consisted of Buddhist Indo-European, divided between [[Tocharians]] and Eastern Iranian [[Sakas]]. The influx of Turkic migrants was triggered by the collapse of the Mongolia-based [[Uyghur Khaganate]] which sent Buddhist Turkic Uyghurs migrating down into the Turfan and Tarim Basins of Xinjiang and resulted in the extincation of the Tocharians. Muslim Turkic Karluks from Transoxania in Central Asia settled in the Tarim Basin from the west and dealt the final blow to the last Indo-European Buddhists, the Saka Kingdom of Khotan, Turkicising them and converting them to Islam.

The discovery of the [[Tarim mummies]] has created a stir in the [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] population of the region, who claim the area has always belonged to their culture, while it was not until the 10th century when the Uighurs are said by scholars to have moved to the region from Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite news| last = Wong| first = Edward| title = The Dead Tell a Tale China Doesn't Care to Listen To| publisher = New York Times| date = 18 November 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/asia/19mummy.html?pagewanted=all| accessdate = 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Sinologist [[Victor H. Mair]] claims that "the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid" with "east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago", while Mair also notes that it was not until 842 that the Uighur peoples settled in the area.&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;{{cite news|first =|last =|title = The mystery of China's celtic mummies|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-meeting-of-civilisations-the-mystery-of-chinas-celtic-mummies-413638.html|work = [[The Independent]]|date = August 28, 2006|accessdate = 2008-06-28|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]], the Tocharians and Sakas of [[Xinjiang]] came under a Chinese protectorate in 60 BC, with the Chinese protecting the Tocharian and Saka city states from the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] who were based in Mongolia, and during the [[Tang dynasty]] they once again became a protectorate of China with China protecting the Tocharian and Saka city states against the [[Turkic Khaganate]] and the Turkic [[Uyghur Khaganate]].

===Uyghur migration into the Tarim Basin===

Tang China lost control of Xinjiang after it was forced to withdraw its garrisons during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]. During the rebellion China received aid from the Uyghur Khaganate in crushing An Lushan's rebels, however, multiple provocations by the Uyghurs such as selling bad quality horses to China, practicing usury when lending to Chinese, and sheltering Uyghurs who committed murder resulted in a major deterioration in relations between China and the Uyghur Khaganate. Tang China then allied with the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] and defeated and destroyed the Uyghur Khaganate in a war, triggering the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate which caused Uyghurs to migrate from their original lands in Mongolia southwards into Xinjiang.

Protected by the [[Taklamakan Desert]] from steppe nomads, elements of Tocharian culture survived until the 7th century, when the arrival of Turkic immigrants from the collapsing [[Uyghur Khaganate]] of modern-day [[Mongolia]] began to absorb the Tocharians to form the modern-day [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Celtic" /&gt;

Professor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically [[Mongoloid]], giving as an example the images in [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik]] at temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's eastern Iranian inhabitants.&lt;ref name="p. 43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43].&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist Uyghurs created the Bezeklik murals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA895#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=895–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Shule Kingdom}}The Iranic [[Saka]] peoples originally inhabited Yarkand and Kashgar in ancient times, and were ruled by the Buddhist Saka [[Kingdom of Khotan]] when the first major Turkic incursions into the area began. The Saka Kings were still culturally-influenced by the Buddhist homeland of Northern India, with their rulers adopting Hindu names. The Buddhist entitites of Khotan and Dunghuang (in present-day Gansu) had a tight-knit partnership, with intermarriage between Dunhuang and Khotan's rulers and Dunhuang's Mogao grottos and Buddhist temples being funded and sponsored by the Khotan royals, whose likenesses were drawn in the [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]] grottoes.&lt;ref name="Millward2007"&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55].&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of Khotan were aware of the menace they faced since they arranged for the Mogao grottoes to paint a growing number of divine figures along with themselves.&lt;ref name="Millward2007" /&gt;  By the time the Turkic Uyghur (Buddhist) and the Turkic Kara-Khanid (Muslim) invaded, Khotan was the only state in the area that had not come under Turkic rule.{{Infobox military conflict

A shrine dedicated to Ali Arslan or Sultan Arslan Boghra who was killed in the campaign against Khoton was the most popular shrine of the region. His body was buried on the field of battle at Ordam Padshah, to the east of Yangi Hissar, but his head is preserved at a shrine in the Dolat Bagh, near Kashgar.&lt;ref name="sykes"&gt;Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes.

A few years later both Hasan and his brother were killed by the Princes of Khotan.&lt;ref name="sykes2"/&gt;

In what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Islamicisation of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.&lt;ref name="Millward2007" /&gt;  After the occupation by the Karakhanids, [[Turki language|Turki]] became the universal language.

==== Taẕkirah Literature and the Legacy of the Khotan Conquest in Uyghur Sufism ====
The Taẕkirah is a genre of literature written about Sufi Muslim saints in [[Altishahr]]. Written sometime in the period from 1700-1849, the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur) '' Taẕkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams'' provides an account of the Muslim Kara-Khanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists. The ''Taẕkirah'' uses the story of the Four Imams as a device to frame the chronicle, the Four Imams being a group of Islamic scholars from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq), who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by the Kara-Khanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |last2= |first2= |date=6 August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher= The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=  71 |issue= 03|pages=632 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend of the conquest of Khotan is also given in the hagiology known as the Tazkirat or "Chronicles of Boghra".&lt;ref name="sykes"/&gt; Extracts from the Tazkiratu'l-Bughra on the Muslim war against the "infidel" Khotan was translated by [[Robert Barkley Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Shaw|title=A Sketch of the Turki Language: As Spoken in Eastern Turkistan ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1878|pages=102–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrines of Sufi Saints are revered in [[Altishahr]] as one of Islam's essential components and the tazkirah literature reinforced the sacredness of the shrines. It is even written in the ''Tazkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams'' that "...those who doubt Their Holinesses the Imams will leave this world without faith, and on Judgement Day their faces will be black''"'' .&lt;ref name="Thum2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rian Thum|title=The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pP6EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=tazkirah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMIhezNksWPyQIViecmCh29Kw_s#v=onepage&amp;q=tazkirah&amp;f=false|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-59855-3|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fervor of the Qarakhand elite meant that in many cases, the ancient Chinese, Tocharian, Sogdian, Sanskrit, and Khotanese language texts dealing with Christianity, Manichaeanism, and Buddhism which contain important historical information  were more or less ignored as sources of information for the region.&lt;ref name="Thum2014 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rian Thum|title=The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqOmBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-59855-3|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Khotanese "infidel Buddhists" killed Imam Shakir Padshah, a "Pigeons' Sanctuary" shrine arose in Khotan where pigeons "believed to be the offspring of a pair of doves which miraculously appeared from the heart of Imam Shakir Padshah" are taken care of and fed by pilgrims, this shrine was visited by Sir [[Aurel Stein]].&lt;ref name="Mirsky1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeannette Mirsky|title=Sir Aurel Stein: Archaeological Explorer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3YKfArws2QC&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 October 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-53177-9|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict in which Xinijang's Buddhist kingdoms were conquered are regarded as holy Jihad and the shehit (martyrs of Islam) who died in action in the wars are revered and worshiped at tombs called [[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]] by pilgrims in the present day.&lt;ref name="Bellér-Hann2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|title=Situating the Uyghurs Between China and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khotanese Buddhists killing of the martyr Imam Asim led to his grave being worshiped in a massive annual ceremony called the ''Imam Asim Khan festival''.&lt;ref name="Bellér-Hann2007 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|title=Situating the Uyghurs Between China and Central Asia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Uyghurs+Kingdom+of+Khotan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NurHVPaOOIXCggSryoKwAQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Uyghurs%20Kingdom%20of%20Khotan&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of the writing and language of the absorbed Khotanese Indo European Eastern Iranics occurred at the hands of the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eighteen Lectures on Dunhuang|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HvIa9sere_8C&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=7 June 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-25233-9|pages=397–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khotan was defeated and annexed by the war started by Kadir Khan Yusuf of the Karakhanids.&lt;ref name="Gibb1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir H.

In the 1390s, the Chagatai ruler [[Khizr Khwaja]] launched a holy war against the Kingdom of Qocho and Turfan, which were viewed as part of "Khitay" which was a name for China.&lt;ref name="GibbLewis1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb |author2=Bernard Lewis |author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=khizr+ghazat+khitay&amp;dq=khizr+ghazat+khitay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnlbCK463JAhWK5yYKHWtzA8IQ6AEIPTAF |year=1998 |publisher=Brill |page=677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Khizr Khwaja claimed to have converted to these kingdoms to Islam, the conversion was more gradual.

==Dzungaria==
{{main|Dzungar genocide|Migration to Xinjiang}}

Xinjiang consists of two main geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names, [[Dzungaria]] north of the Tianshan Mountains and the [[Tarim Basin]] south of the Tianshan Mountains, before [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] unified them into one political entity called Xinjiang province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by the [[Dzungar people|Dzongar people]],a steppe dwelling, nomadic Mongol-related ethnic group who practiced [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]]. Meanwhile, the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]]. They were governed separately until 1884. The native Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]].

The Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tianshan and Turkic Muslim south of the Tianshan, and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing and it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather it was the Chinese who held that point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing rule, no sense of "regional identity" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui, and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dzungar genocide]] the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] exterminated the native Buddhist [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongolic speaking people from their homeland of [[Dzungaria]] in Northern Xinjiang and resettled the area with a variety of different ethnic groups.

The Qing "final solution" of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungar Mongols, made the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of Han Chinese, Hui, Turkestani Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchu Bannermen in Dzungaria possible, since the land was now devoid of Dzungars.&lt;ref name="Zungar2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=Zunghar+genocide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZutWU-yoLOi_sQTcn4CgBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Zunghar%20genocide&amp;f=false Perdue 2009], p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kbpG8QEguXEC&amp;pg=PT183&amp;dq=1640+zunghar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=geATVPuYMc3jsATdoYLgBQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1640%20zunghar&amp;f=false Tamm 2013],&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dzungaria]]n basin, which used to be inhabited by (Dzungar) Mongols, is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Tyler 2004], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Dzungar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.&lt;ref name="ed. Starr 2004"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed. Starr 2004], p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like Ürümqi and Yining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 102].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing were the ones who unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic situation.&lt;ref name="Liu &amp; Faure 1996"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depopulation of northern Xinjiang after the Buddhist Öölöd Mongols (Dzungars) were slaughtered, led to the Qing settling Manchu, Sibo (Xibe), Daurs, Solons, Han Chinese, Hui Muslims, and Turkic Muslim Taranchis in the north, with Han Chinese and Hui migrants making up the greatest number of settlers. Since it was the crushing of the Buddhist Öölöd (Dzungars) by the Qing which led to promotion of Islam and the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, and migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, it was proposed by Henry Schwarz that "the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Xinjiang as a unified, defined geographic identity was created and developed by the Qing. It was the Qing which led to Turkic Muslim power in the region increasing since the Mongol power was crushed by the Qing while Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing gave the name Xinjiang to Dzungaria after conquering it and wiping out the Dzungars, reshaping it from a steppe grassland into farmland cultivated by Han Chinese farmers, 1 million mu (17,000 acres) were turned from grassland to farmland from 1760-1820 by the new colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iXVHL2mYajAC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marks 2011], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |title=Demographics and Development in Xinjiang after 1949 |first=Stanley |last=Toops |date=May 2004 |page=1|issue=1 |periodical=East-West Center Washington Working Papers |publisher=[[East–West Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they [[Zunghar genocide|exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols]] in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.&lt;ref name="ed. Starr 2004"/&gt; Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang ([[Dzungaria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Qing China renamed the conquered region, established Xinjiang ("new frontier") as a province, formally applying onto it the political system of [[China proper]]. For the 1st time the name "Xinjiang" replaced old historical names such as "[[Western Regions]]", "Chinese Turkestan", "[[Eastern Turkestan]]", "Uyghuristan", "Kashgaria", "Uyghuria", "Alter Sheher" and "Yetti Sheher".

The two separate regions, Dzungaria, known as Zhǔn bù (準部, Dzungar region) or Tiānshān běi lù (天山北路, Northern March),&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA97 p. 97].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AtduqAtBzegC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Zhunbu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IpSlU-6zBtK3yATkrIKYDA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zhunbu&amp;f=false Kim 2004], p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tarim Basin, which had been known as Altishahr, Huíbù (Muslim region), Huíjiāng (Muslim-land) or "Tiānshān Nánlù (天山南路, southern March),&lt;ref name="Millward 1998"&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AtduqAtBzegC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Kim 2004], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; were combined into a single province called Xinjiang by in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Newby 2005], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, there was never one administrative unit in which North Xinjiang (Zhunbu) and Southern Xinjiang (Huibu) were integrated together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1RuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Zhunbu&amp;dq=Zhunbu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iZKlU9-pC4GGyATE1YKABg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ ''Inner Asia, Volume 4, Issues 1-2'' 2002], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of the Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslim population who had previously settled northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) after the Qing genocide of the Dzungars, had died in the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)]]. As a result, new Uyghur colonists from Southern Xinjiang (the Tarim Basin) proceeded to settle in the newly empty lands and spread across all of Xinjiang.

After Xinjiang was converted into a province by the Qing, the provincialisation and reconstruction programs initiated by the Qing resulted in the Chinese government helping Uyghurs migrate from southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province, like the area between Qitai and the capital, which was formerly nearly completely inhabited by Han Chinese, and other areas like Urumqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor, and the Tarim River's lower reaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Qing times that Uyghurs were settled throughout all of Xinjiang, from their original home cities in the western Tarim Basin. The Qing policies after they created Xinjiang by uniting Dzungaria and Altishahr (Tarim Basin) led Uyghurs to believe that the all of Xinjiang province was their homeland, since the annihilation of the Dzungars by the Qing, populating the Ili valley with Uyghurs from the Tarim Basin, creating one political unit with a single name (Xinjiang) out of the previously separate Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin, the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)|war from 1864-1878]] which led to the killing of much of the original Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslims in Xinjiang, led to areas in Xinjiang with previously had insignificant amounts of Uyghurs, like the southeast, east, and north, to then become settled by Uyghurs who spread through all of Xinjiang from their original home in the southwest area. There was a major and fast growth of the Uyghur population, while the original population of Han Chinese and Hui Muslims from before the war of 155,000 dropped, to the much lower population of 33,114 Tungans (Hui) and 66,000 Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lockwood Silver Fern Flag over Wellington.png|thumb|261x261px|Lockwood's silver fern flag over [[Wellington]], New Zealand's capital city]]
'''Kyle Lockwood''' (born 1977) is a New Zealand [[architectural designer]] based in [[Melbourne]], Australia. He is known for leading the successful campaign for the [[Government of New Zealand]] to reintroduce the duration of the [[New Zealand passport]] to ten years, and for designing the two flags that came first and second in the first [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16|New Zealand flag referendum]]. He also successfully lobbied for the introduction of the Hospitality NZ 18+ card.

Lockwood's [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern Flag]] design was voted in as the official Preferred Alternative New Zealand Flag in the first referendum, in March 2016 the existing Flag of New Zealand won the second referendum.

==Early life==
Lockwood was born in 1977 in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. His father, Simon Lockwood, represented New Zealand in [[underwater hockey]], and was team captain. As the team used the ''[[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]]'' as their symbol, Lockwood grew fond of this symbol. His mother is Barbara Lockwood. He is descended from [[Ngāti Porou]] ki Hauraki [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silverfernflag.org/designer.html|title=Designer|last=|first=|date=|website=Silver Fern Flag|publisher=silverfernflag.org|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early life was also influenced by his grandparents, Kathy and Walter Lockwood, who were both born in the [[United Kingdom]], and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] respectively. During World War Two, Walter Lockwood served as a [[Chindit]] behind Japanese enemy lines in [[Burma]], Kyle attended Lyall Bay School and Evans Bay Intermediate School in the Wellington suburb of [[Kilbirnie, New Zealand|Kilbirnie]]. After high school at [[Rongotai College]], he volunteered in the [[New Zealand Army]] before working for the [[Wellington City Council]] for four years in the building consent department. In 1999 he attended [[Massey University]] and studied [[architectural technology]], graduating in 2001.&lt;ref name="Stuff bio" /&gt;

==Flag designs==

He considered a [[Union Jack]] but thought that a silver fern was more appropriate, and added the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] from the current [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]].&lt;ref name="Stuff bio"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Macdonald |first1=Nikki |title=Flying the flag: who is flag designer Kyle Lockwood?&lt;!-- online title shown; print title was: "Kyle Lockwood : The unlikely flagbearer" --&gt; |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/75178153/flying-the-flag-who-is-flag-designer-kyle-lockwood |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=19 December 2015 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockwood put the design away and published it about three years later in 2003.

In January 2014, John Key announced that a binding flag referendum could be held with in conjunction with the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Matt |last2=Hyslop |first2=Liam |title=Let's just get on and do it, says Mateparae |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9669046/Lets-just-get-on-and-do-it-says-Mateparae |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the date for the September 2014 election was missed, the [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16|New Zealand flag referendums]] went ahead and five of Lockwood's flags made it into an initial long list of 40 flags.&lt;ref name="longlist"&gt;{{cite news |first=Audrey |last=Young |date=11 August 2015 |title=Forty flags, and only one with a Union Jack—so which one is best? |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11495030 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a UMR poll predicting a vote of 35%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umr.co.nz/sites/umr/files/umr_flag_referendum-mar2016-mediarelease_final.pdf|title=NZ Flag Referendum Update|last=Mills|first=Stephen|date=15 March 2016|website=|publisher=UMR Research|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Silver Fern Flag gained a significant minority in the second [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16|referendum]] with 43.2% of the vote, whilst the [[Flag of New Zealand|existing flag]] won with 56.6% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/official-result-second-referendum-new-zealand-flag|title=Official result of the second referendum on the New Zealand Flag|last=New Zealand|first=Elections|date=30 March 2016|website=elections.org.nz|publisher=Elections New Zealand|access-date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16|second referendum]], the flag continued to make appearances in the International media. In the first New Zealand cricket test against Zimbabwe on 28 July 2016, the flag was featured in the opening graphics sequence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/sport/cricket/new-zealand-flag-gets-unexpected-change-in-zimbabwe|title=New Zealand flag gets unexpected change in Zimbabwe|website=1 NEWS NOW|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is also still seen flying from flagpoles around New Zealand, [[Kip Colvey]] a prominent US/NZ football player, appeared in Fairfax media on 26 December 2016, in front of the flag.

==Passport campaign==
[[File:New Zealand Passport Biometric.jpg|thumb|163x163px|[[New Zealand passport]] featuring the [[Cyathea dealbata|Silver Fern]]]]
In November 2005, the New Zealand Government reduced the validity of the [[New Zealand passport]] from ten years to five, the move was unpopular with the New Zealand travelling public. Lockwood's interest in the matter was raised when he witnessed a young mother refused travel for herself and her child because there were less than six months left on the mother's five-year passport. Lockwood set up a [[Facebook]] page called "Bring Back 10 Year NZ Passports"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/NZ10years/?fref=ts|title=Facebook|last=|first=|date=|website=Bring Back 10 Year NZ Passports|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2013 and a website [http://nzten.weebly.com/ nzten.com], which attracted much attention.&lt;ref name="first newspaper report"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Rachel |title=Minister unmoved by 10-year passport plea |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8199945/Minister-unmoved-by-10-year-passport-plea |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |agency=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media picked up on the initiative during January 2013 and the first article appeared in [[Fairfax Media]] on 20 January.&lt;ref name="first newspaper report" /&gt;

The group submitted the Petition of Kyle Lockwood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/presented/petitions/50DBHOH_PET3192_1/petition-of-kyle-lockwood-requesting-that-the-house|title=The Petition of Kyle Lockwood|last=Pāremata Aotearoa|first=New Zealand Parliament|date=4 December 2013|website=|publisher=New Zealand Government|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 15,900 signatures to parliament on 4 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five-year passport law change on hold |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10057763/Five-year-passport-law-change-on-hold |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]] Lockwood successfully negotiated with all main political parties to adopt ten-year passport policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzten.weebly.com/media/previous/2|title=Ten-Year Passports Policy|last=NZ Ten-Year Passports|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former prime minister, [[John Key]], gave his first indication that a return to a 10-year validity period could be considered, in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Vernon |authorlink1=Vernon Small |title=Ten-year passports a step closer |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/10100058/Ten-year-passports-a-step-closer |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official review of the validity period was announced in August 2014, a month before the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gulliver |first1=Aimee|title=10-year NZ passports could return – at a cost |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/kiwi-traveller/10374600/10-year-NZ-passports-could-return-at-a-cost |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law changes were passed and since 30 November 2015, 10-year passports are available again for New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gulliver |first1=Aimee |title=New Zealand passports valid for 10 years coming in November |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/kiwi-traveller/71385959/New-Zealand-passports-valid-for-10-years-coming-in-November |accessdate=20 December 2015 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18+ card campaign ==
In 1998 Lockwood successfully campaigned the New Zealand Government for a photographic [[Proof of age|evidence of age card]] to be made available to those who do not possess a driver licence or passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzten.weebly.com/18card-campaign.html|title=18+Card Campaign|website=NZ Ten Year Passports|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time [[Driving licence in New Zealand|driver licences in New Zealand]] did not include a photograph and the [[Legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages|legal age to purchase alcohol]] in New Zealand was 20 (or 18 if accompanied by a parent) Lockwood noted that many young New Zealanders who appeared to be under 25 were refused access to bars and clubs or could not purchase alcohol elsewhere unless they presented a valid passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzten.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/2/2/10222610/justice_and_law_reform_select_committee_submission_09_mar_1999_lockwood_kyle.pdf|title=Justice and Law Reform Select Committee Submission|last=Lockwood|first=Kyle|date=9 March 1999|website=nzten.weebly.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockwood appeared before the Justice and Law Reform Parliamentary [[Select committee|Select Committee]] on the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill and argued that a photographic ID was necessary for those that do not hold a driver licence or passport. the committee recommended that an evidence of age card be made official and after the Sale of Liquor Amendment Act 1999 was gazetted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/1999-go7742|title=- 1999-go7742 – New Zealand Gazette|website=www.gazette.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hospitality NZ 18+ Card Evidence of Age Document has been made available to New Zealanders and overseas citizens alike&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.18plus.org.nz/~downloads/18plusApplicationMar17.pdf|title=18 + Card Application Form|last=New Zealand|first=Hospitality Association|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who do not wish to use a passport to purchase alcohol in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backpackerguide.nz/get-id-card-new-zealand/|title=How to Get an ID Card in New Zealand|date=22 May 2015|work=Backpacker Guide New Zealand|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally developed as a means for younger people to prove they were over 18, the card has been growing in popularity amongst older people who do not have a driver licence or passport, who are looking for a cost effective, nationally recognised form of photo ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://superseniors.msd.govt.nz/webadmin/html/email/superseniors-feb-2016.html|title=SuperSeniors February Newsletter 2016|website=superseniors.msd.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homosexuality]] in [[Honduras]] was decriminalised in 1899.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While a small (but persecuted) gay-rights-oriented culture exists in Honduras, certain lower socio-economic barrios have seen the persistence of an older social construction of same-sex eroticism (roughly similar to that which existed in much of the U.S. before WWII) whereby masculine "hombres" (young, unmarried men 15-25) play the penetrative role with "locas" (effeminate but non-cross-dressing/non-transgender, older males), usually for some type of remuneration but occasionally also for friendship and mutual assistance.  For the "hombres", these acts do not carry the stigma of being seen as "homosexual" (though some taboo exists about open discussion of such relationships);  the young men consider themselves fully heterosexual and almost always marry by their mid-twenties, limiting their sexual activity thereafter to women.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], won the most seats but not an [[overall majority]]. As a result, [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] formed a [[Fourth premiership of William Ewart Gladstone|minority government]] that relied upon [[Irish Nationalist]] support. On 3 March 1894, Gladstone resigned over the rejection of his [[Home Rule Bill]] and the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]] succeeded him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9435">[[File:Stamp US 1956 5dollar.jpg|thumb|right|$5 stamp depicting Alexander Hamilton, the highest denomination in the Liberty issue]]
[[File:8cliberty.jpg|thumb|125px|&lt;center&gt;8¢ Liberty stamp&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''Liberty issue''' was a [[definitive series]] of [[postage stamp]]s issued by the United States between 1954 and 1965.  It offered twenty-four denominations, ranging from a half-cent issue showing Benjamin Franklin to a five dollar issue depicting [[Alexander Hamilton]].  However, in a notable departure from all definitive series since 1870, the stamp for a normal first-class letter—the 3-cent value—did not present the portrait of a president, but instead offered a monocolor [[:File:Stamp US 1954 3c Liberty.jpg|image of the Statue of Liberty]].  Moreover, two-color renderings of the Statue of Liberty (''Liberty Enlightening the World'')  appeared on both the 8 cent and 11 cent stamps; and it is from these three denominations that the Liberty issue takes its name.  (Oversized versions of the 3¢ and 8¢ stamps also appeared on a [[miniature sheet]] issued in 1956 for the Fifth International [[Philatelic exhibition]].) Pictures of other national landmarks, such as [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]] and [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]], are found on several values, while the rest of the stamps follow tradition, containing portraits of well-known historic Americans. The six denominations in the set that illustrate buildings ([[The Alamo]], [[Monticello]], etc.) were all designed in [[landscape format]], resulting in a free intermixture of landscape and portrait orientation for the first time in a definitive U.S. issue (in all previous mixed sets, landscape stamps had been confined to the highest denominations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1847usa.com/1954identifier.htm ''Designs of the 1954 Series - The Liberty Issue''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202053442/http://1847usa.com/1954identifier.htm |date=2015-02-02 }} by 1847 usa.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like three previous U. S. definitive issues, the Liberty series offered one—and only one—image of a prominent woman.  But while Martha Washington had played this role in the series of 1902, 1922–1925 and 1938, the Liberty Issue eliminated her, instead presenting Susan B. Anthony, portrayed on the 50-cent stamp. The Liberty Issue was the first definitive series including multiple presidents issued since 1861 which did not contain a single stamp honoring a recently deceased president.  To be sure, the only president who would have qualified, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had died quite a while before—some nine years—and, moreover, was not admired by the political party that introduced the new series. FDR was the first deceased president since Chester A. Arthur (d. 1886) to have been excluded from the next multi-president definitive series to appear after his death—denied an honor that had been accorded to his eight predecessors in office: Cleveland, Harrison, McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding and Coolidge. It is also notable that only 28% of the Liberty series stamps offered images of presidents (seven out of 25 denominations): a smaller presidential percentage than had appeared on any previous U. S. definitive issue.

Release of the Liberty series began in 1954, and the set was essentially complete by 1960, but a few values were added subsequently.  While the Liberty stamps were generally replaced by the [[Prominent Americans series]], issued starting in 1965, several of its denominations remained on sale for a considerable period of time afterwards.  Most notably, two coil stamps—the 2 cent [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the 25 cent [[Paul Revere]]—were repeatedly reprinted, continuing on sale well into the 1980s.   Remaining stocks of the 12 cent Benjamin Harrison stamp were sold at some post offices in 1981 to meet the new postal card rate as the [[United States Postal Service]] was not able to issue a new 12 cent stamp prior to the implementation of the rate increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/rates_20010716/refreshercourse.asp?uID= ''Short rate periods sometimes yield treasures''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422122152/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/rates_20010716/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=April 22, 2007 }} by Rob Haeseler&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the time span that the series was issued the technology of printing postage stamps changed.  This led to many of the stamps having varieties with different papers, perforations and the addition of a [[phosphor]] coating.  Thus at this more specialized level the series is rather complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David H.|last=Aeschliman|url=http://www.stamp-collecting-world.com/usstamps_1954d.html|title=US Stamps: General Issues of 1954-1968|work=Stamp-Collecting-World|accessdate=February 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516154844/http://www.stamp-collecting-world.com/usstamps_1954d.html|archive-date=May 16, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1/2 cent stamp was the last issued of that denomination for use as postage, although a postage due stamp of that value was issued in 1959. It was also the last appearance of Franklin on a lower value stamp in a regular series, a tradition that had been followed since 1847.  In this series, two of the fractional denominations—1¼¢ and 2½¢—appeared on U. S. postage stamps for the first time.

These were released at a few post offices in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnss.org/Liberty.htm 1954 Liberty Series (Sixth Bureau Series)]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that no more than 400 of these stamps, which have been designated "1033a", still exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theswedishtiger.com/ US Stamps, US Stamp Values and US Postage Stamp Easy Identification Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote = If the conservative feminist becomes a mother, she accepts the need to make a host of sacrifices&amp;nbsp;- personal, professional, and financial&amp;nbsp;- for her children's sake. She expects her spouse to sacrifice as well, and decides together with him how each can best contribute to the family welfare. She believes that family roles are flexible: men can become primary caregivers, for example, while women can pursue full-time careers. But as she and her spouse make choices about family responsibilities, they take one thing as a given: their primary duty is to ensure their children's physical and emotional well-being, to promote their intellectual development, and to shape their moral characters.

The women who embrace it are likely to transform both feminism and conservatism. The feminist movement ignores them at its peril.

 | quote = Internal contradictions aside, conservative feminism is not particularly new, and it is a mistake to call it an oxymoron. It is deeply religious, of course, and it views the anti-abortion fight as one of female empowerment. The argument is simply that as women&amp;nbsp;– as the motherly and feminine forces guiding our nation's ethical compass&amp;nbsp;– it is a feminine duty to defend life at its earliest stages. Women are empowered by the defense itself. This cultural theory may be out of date in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but it is at the heart of Palin's sizeable and passionate following. And it is, in its own way, a feminist argument.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;My point is that the logic of conservative feminism is plain and obvious for anyone who cares to try to comprehend. It's not new or complicated, and it shouldn't be baffling. Therefore, it is a colossal mistake for Bennett to simply dismiss the self-described pro-life feminists as an oxymoron, because that's no way for her to argue her liberal position. Conservative feminism cannot be dismissively defined away.

Because almost any variant of feminism can have a conservative element, this list does not attempt to list variants of feminism simply with conservative elements. Instead, this list is of feminism variants that are primarily conservative.

== List ==
This list may include organizations or individuals where a conservative feminism is more readily identified that way, but is primarily a list of feminisms ''per se''. Generally, organizations and people related to a feminism should not be in this list but should be found by following links to articles about various feminisms with which such organizations and people are associated.
* backlash feminism: see new conservative feminism in this list
* balanced feminism: see right-wing feminism in this list
* conservative feminism (in addition to various feminisms in this list and that are conservative):
** [[Katherine Kersten]] objects "that in many of their endeavors women continue to face greater obstacles to their success than men do",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dillard|2005|p=25}}  citing Kersten, Katherine, ''What Do Women Want?: A Conservative Feminists Manifesto.'' {{sic}}, in ''Policy Review'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; thus acknowledging that [[sexism]] exists,{{sfn|Dillard|2005|pp=25–26}} and does not reject feminism entirely but draws on a classical feminist tradition, for example [[Margaret Fuller]].{{sfn|Dillard|2005|pp=26–27}} Kersten advocates for conservative feminism based on equality and justice defined alike for women and men and acknowledgment of historical and present injustice suffered by women.{{sfn|Dillard|2005|p=26}} She also advocates building on Western ideals and institutions, with reform pursued slowly and cautiously and accepting that human failings mean that perfection is unattainable.{{sfn|Dillard|2005|p=26}} Her concerns include crime and violence against women, cultural popular media's degradation of women, noncommittal sex, and poverty's feminization,{{sfn|Dillard|2005|p=26}} but opposing affirmative action and class action litigation.{{sfn|Dillard|2005|p=27}}
** [[Sarah Palin]] "made her case for conservative feminism" in 2010, at a meeting of the [[Susan B. Anthony List]].{{sfn|Feldmann|2010}}
** [[Richard Posner|Richard A. Posner]] "suggest[s]" "'conservative feminism' .... is ... the idea that women are entitled to political, legal, social, and economic equality to men, in the framework of a lightly regulated market economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posner|1989|pp=191–192}} cited in {{harvnb|Weisberg|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner tentatively argues for taxing housewives' at-home [[unpaid work]] to reduce a barrier to paid outside work&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posner|1989|pp=192–194}} and {{harvnb|Weisberg|1993|p=7}} (without the rationale about reducing a barrier).&lt;/ref&gt; (argued by D. Kelly Weisberg to be rooted in a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]] argument for [[Wages for housework|waged housework]]){{sfn|Weisberg|1993|p=7}} and argues for sex being a factor in setting wages and benefits in accordance with productivity, health costs with pregnancy, on-the-job safety, and longevity for pensions.{{sfn|Posner|1989|pp=195–197}} Posner is against [[Equal pay for women|comparable worth]] among private employers,{{sfn|Posner|1989|pp=202–203}} against [[no-fault divorce]],{{sfn|Posner|1989|p=204 n.22}} in favour of surrogate motherhood by binding contract,{{sfn|Posner|1989|pp=205–206}} against rape even in the form of nonviolent sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posner|1989|pp=206–207}}; also see p. 203 (date and marital rape).&lt;/ref&gt; and for a possibility that pornography may either incite rape or substitute for it.{{sfn|Posner|1989|pp=207}} Posner does not argue for or against an abortion right, arguing instead for a possibility but not a certainty that the fetus is "a member of society"{{sfn|Posner|1989|pp=207–209}} because libertarianism and economics do not say one way or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posner|1989|p=208}} (libertarians being "conservatives in the classical liberal tradition of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill ..., Herbert Spencer ... and Milton Friedman", per ''id.'', p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Adam Smith]], pioneer of political economy and philosopher in the 18th century}}{{Efn|[[John Stuart Mill]], philosopher and political economist in the 19th century}}{{Efn|[[Herbert Spencer]], political theorist and philosopher in the Victorian era}}{{Efn|[[Milton Friedman]], economist in the 20th century}} Posner argues that the differences between the genders on average include women's lesser aggressiveness and greater child-centeredness{{sfn|Posner|1989|p=215}} and has "no quarrel" with law being empathetic to "all marginal groups".{{sfn|Posner|1989|p=217}}
* domestic feminism: see old conservative feminism in this list
* [[equity feminism]]
* [[individualist feminism]] was cast to appeal to "younger women ... of a more conservative generation"{{sfn|Siegel|2007|pp=122–124, nn.32–34}} and includes concepts from [[Rene Denfeld]] and [[Naomi Wolf]], essentially that "feminism should no longer be about communal solutions to communal problems but individual solutions to individual problems",{{sfn|Siegel|2007|pp=122–124, nn.32–34}} and concepts from [[Wendy McElroy]]
* [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestant Christian]] profeminism ("Karen .... articulates the Evangelical [Protestant] profeminist position particularly well. Like profeminist Catholics and Jews, she feels that the [[women's liberation movement]] was a necessary response to the oppression of women. She praises the achievements of feminism in society as well as in Evangelical communities and insists that sexism persists and that further changes are necessary. Yet Karen, too, criticizes the movement for seeking to eliminate gender differences, devaluing motherhood and homemaking, and being led by extremists who do not represent ordinary American women, particularly with respect to the issues of homosexuality and abortion. Her comments on the latter two issues ... resemble ... closely the statements made by antifeminist Evangelicals."){{sfn|Manning|1999|p=190}}
* [[National Woman's Party]], in the U.S., was led by [[Alice Paul]], described as "[articulating a] narrow and conservative version of feminism".{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=12}}
* new conservative feminism,{{sfn|Stacey|1983|p=559}} or backlash feminism,{{Efn|This is apparently not entirely the [[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women|backlash]] written about by feminist author [[Susan Faludi]].}} is arguably antifeminist{{sfn|Stacey|1983|p=574}} and is represented by [[Betty Friedan]] in ''[[The Second Stage]]'' and [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]] in ''Public Man, Private Woman'' and anticipated by Alice Rossi, ''A Biosocial Perspective on Parenting''.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Alice, ''A Biosocial Perspective on Parenting'', in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]'' 106 (special issue on the family, Spring, 1977), as cited in {{harvnb|Stacey|1983|p=[559] n.3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors do not necessarily agree with each other on all major points.{{sfn|Stacey|1983|pp=562, 567–568}} According to Judith Stacey, new conservative feminism rejects the politicization of sexuality, supports families, gender differentiation, femininity, and mothering, and deprioritizes opposition to male domination.{{sfn|Stacey|1983|pp=561–562}}
* old conservative feminism or domestic feminism, from the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stacey|1983|pp=575, n.53}} citing, ''e.g.'', Epstein, Barbara Leslie, ''The Politics of Domesticity: Women, Evangelism, and Temperance in Nineteenth-Century America'' (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan Univ. Press, 1981), Sklar, Kathryn Kish, ''[[Catharine Beecher]]: A Study in American Domesticity'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1973), &amp; DuBois, Ellen Carol, ''Feminism and Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848–1869'' (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[postfeminism]]
* right-wing feminism,{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=173}} or balanced feminism,{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=175}} includes the work of [[Independent Women's Forum]], [[Feminists for Life|Feminists for Life of America]], and ifeminists.net headed by [[Wendy McElroy]]. It generally draws on principles of [[first-wave feminism]]{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=177}} and against both [[postfeminism]] and academic or [[radical feminism]],{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=176}} the latter being defined to include left and progressive politics, not only feminism based on gender oppression.{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=174}} Right-wing feminism supports both motherhood and women having careers{{sfn|Bailey|2006|pp=180–181}} and both individuality and biological determinism;{{sfn|Bailey|2006|pp=181–182}} it accepts gender equality in careers while believing that numerical equality will naturally not occur in all occupations.{{sfn|Bailey|2006|p=182}}
* [[state feminism]]
* Womansurge: see Women's Equity Action League in this list
* [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL) was formed originally by some of the more conservative members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), when NOW was viewed as radical.{{sfn|Castro|1990|pp=62, 216-218}}{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=83}} The members who founded WEAL focused on employment and education, and shunned issues of contraception and abortion.{{sfn|Castro|1990|pp=62, 216–218}} Its founders called it a "'conservative NOW'".{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=83}} Its methods were "conventional", especially lobbying and lawsuits.{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=83}} The departures from NOW left NOW freer to pursue [[Reproductive rights|reproductive freedom]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=83}} "[T]he fragmentation process, as organizations broke up and reformed, .... retained women within the movement who might otherwise have left it. This is what happened in the case of NOW, when it split up over internal divisions, and new feminism was nevertheless able to retain the most conservative elements through the formation of WEAL. At first, in fact, WEAL called itself the 'right wing of the women's movement.' Another NOW spinoff, Womansurge, tended to attract older women, who felt more comfortable in it than in NOW, which was becoming more politically radical under the influence of a new younger generation of militants."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siegel|2007|p=176}} "new feminism" is probably the author's term not referring to the [[new feminism]] related to Roman Catholicism but perhaps to [[second-wave feminism]] generally) (fragmentation prob. referring to late 1960s–early 1970s in U.S.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[United Kingdom]], it is now common for prominent women in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to declare that they are feminists; this trend began with [[Theresa May]] wearing a t-shirt by the [[Fawcett Society]] emblazoned with the words 'This is What a Feminist Looks Like'. Today, British female Conservative Parliamentarians claim that they are feminists, and claim feminisit justification, while advocating a range of policies, from equal career opportunities for women to, in the case of [[Anna Soubry]] and others, opposing pornography. The Conservative MP [[Nadine Dorries]] has even put forward a 'feminist' argument for restricting abortion.{{sfn|Swift|2018|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6338">This is a list of '''[[indigenous rights]] organizations'''. Some of these organizations are members of other organizations listed in this article. Sometimes local organizations associated with particular groups of indigenous people will join in a regional or national organization, which in turn can join an even higher organization, along with other member [[supraorganization]]s.

The "'''International'''" section is for organizations that are open to work with indigenous peoples around the world. These organizations are not limited to a specific area or with specific Indigenous Peoples. They are '''listed by country of origin'''. The organizations in the "'''Regional'''" section are '''listed by the area in which they work'''. The regions and countries in this part of the list indicate the area in which these organizations operate.

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;

Malinchism is also associated with a societal depiction of women as the source of betrayal and nefarious behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Julia Maria|title=Recreating the Image of Women in Mexico:  A Genealogy of Resistance in Mexican Narrative Set During the Revolution|date=2010|volume=Graduate Faculty - Thesis|page=6|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717070125/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the images of Mexican popular culture, this theme plays out with [[La Malinche|Malinche]] often portrayed as both the deceiver and the deceived. In theatrical productions, she is sometimes portrayed as a victim of conquest, and sometimes the manufacturer of her own destiny; almost always, Malinche is portrayed as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]], in a form of [[victim blaming]]. If she was indeed forced to help the conquistadors against her will, it was because she didn't struggle enough; if she was a willing participant, she not only brought her own troubles, but she caused all of her people and her children to suffer.&lt;ref name="Day (2004)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Stuart A.|title=Staging Politics in Mexico: The Road to Neoliberalism|date=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg [Pa.]|isbn=0-8387-5587-9|pages=125–131|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=wjcglvaWZc8C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is represented in art as a figure showing women's [[Instinct#In biology|inborn]] deception and guilt — one who used her sexuality and in so doing betrayed her own unwitting children.&lt;ref name=Lindauer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindauer|first1=Margaret A.|title=Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo|date=1999|publisher=Wesleyan Univ.

In ''La Malinche,'' a ballet composed in 1949, by [[José Limón]], Malinche is at first an unwilling victim, then assumes the proud deportment of an aristocrat, and in the end, weighted down by the finery she wears, she gives birth to the [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] child who rejects her.&lt;ref name="Seed (2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seed|first1=edited by Patricia|title=José Limón and La Malinche: The Dancer and the Dance|date=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71735-0|pages=24–29|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pTsnFcV1V38C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Malinche has been compared to [[Eve#Mother of humanity|Eve]], the temptress who through deception, leads men astray.&lt;ref name="Cypress (1991)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cypess|first1=Sandra Messinger|title=La Malinche in Mexican literature from history to myth|date=1991|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-75131-1|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=vR7UAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:U.S. Distribution of SAT math and verbal scores 1972-2008.jpg|thumb|500px|Graph showing the Math–Verbal Achievement Gap in the [[United States]]]]
The '''math–verbal achievement gap''' is a phenomenon first observed by Richard Rothstein in a brief 2002 article written in ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;ref name="NYT.2002.Gap"&gt;{{Cite web|ref=harv|date= August 28, 2002|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/28/nyregion/lessons-sums-vs-summarizing-sat-s-math-verbal-gap.html|title = LESSONS; Sums vs. Summarizing: SAT's Math–Verbal Gap|publisher = [[New York Times]]| accessdate = June 8, 2010 | last=Rothstein| first= Richard |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement gap reveals a growing disparity in the United States between the rising national average on the math portions of the college entry [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] exams, as opposed to the flat-lining verbal portions on the same tests.

== Historical trends ==
Around 1990 the national average on the math portion of the SAT began its slow but steady ascension over the national average for the verbal portion. It took only one decade for the math average to eclipse the verbal average, continuing to widen since that point. The difference is sizable and significant. The average SAT test-taker today produces a math score that is 13 points higher than their verbal score. However, this was not always the case. In fact, in the 1970s the relationship was precisely the opposite when national verbal scores routinely trumped the national math average by similar margins.&lt;ref name="NYT.2002.Gap"/&gt;

The first academic analysis of this gap was conducted by James Lech Ed.D., M.T.S.&lt;ref name="thesis.Lech"&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree= |chapter= |title=The math–verbal achievement gap: Are we getting better at math, or are the SAT questions getting easier? |url=http://disexpress.umi.com/dxweb}}- Total Dissertation Pages: 34; United States Copyright Office Registration Number: TX 6-534-442; AAT 3263829&lt;/ref&gt;  Lech posited that this gap could  be "collateral damage" from the well-documented academic and social "erosion" known as [[Dumbing down|dumbing-down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Washburn|first=Katharine | title = Dumbing down: essays on the strip mining of American culture|edition=1997|year=1997| publisher = W.W. Norton| isbn= 978-0-393-31723-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the SAT math questions progressively eased in difficulty over time while the verbal difficulty levels 1) remained constant, or 2) dumbed-down at much slower rates.

== Testing the "dumbing down" hypothesis ==
To test that hypothesis Lech constructed scores of survey instruments compiled from the math questions derived from publicly released SATs from the early 1980s through 2005. The survey instruments were intentionally created to conceal the source of the questions in order to reduce reader-bias towards standardized testing. They were then disseminated to more than 1,500 qualified high school math teachers&lt;ref&gt;A qualified High School Math teacher was considered a person with a B.S. in mathematics and a handful of years of instruction, or a teacher without a math degree that taught Algebra II or higher for a significant number of years.&lt;/ref&gt; that were randomly selected from a pool of every high school (both public and private) in the United States.  Their responses were tabulated. Lech found that the SAT math questions were not getting easier at all in the eyes of these math teachers; in fact they were getting slightly harder.

== Alternative hypotheses ==
The research hypothesis Lech tested was rejected: the questions on the math portions of the SAT are not getting easier over time. As noted, they are getting a little harder. This confounds the math-verbal achievement gap in general. There were several proposals put forth to explain rising national averages, year-after-year, on the difficult math portions of the SAT, as opposed to stagnating national verbal averages on the same test, during the same three decades.

=== Rothstein's theories ===
Rothstein, in the 2002 ''New York Times'' article, admitted that "Nobody really knows why we seem to make more progress in math than reading. But one likely cause is that students learn math mostly in school, while literacy also comes from habits at home. Even if reading instruction improves, scores would suffer if students did less out-of-school reading or had a less literate home environment."

Rothstein also suggested that the hugely successful SAT and ACT test preparation courses are unwittingly emphasizing mathematical prowess over verbal acuity. He rationalized that successful test-taking techniques taught in these courses to boost test scores work very well for multiple-choice math questions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com.2007"&gt;{{Cite news|ref=harv |date=November 19, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/arts/19nea.html |title = Study Links Drop in Test Scores to a Decline in Time Spent Reading |publisher = [[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |last=Rich |first=Motoko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothstein also highlighted that [[English as a foreign or second language|English-language-learners]] (hereinafter, ELL) in American schools were on the increase, and certainly that could have a downward pull on the national verbal average on these standardized tests. It would seem likely that ELL status would adversely affect a student's verbal score to a greater extent as opposed to the mathematics portion on the same standardized test.

Finally, Rothstein indicated that studies revealed then, as they still do now, that student reading was on the decline while television-watching by American youth was on the increase. These dual social trends, when combined, could negatively impact student verbal scores at higher rates than their math scores.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com.2007" /&gt;  However, it should be noted these behaviors also lower math scores—a point that Rothstein could have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Fali|author2=Myoung-Jae Lee|title=Dynamic Treatment of Effect Analysis of TV Effects|journal=Journal of Applied Econometrics|year=2010|volume=25|pages=392–419|doi=10.1002/jae.1165|url=http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/flhuang/paper/TvEffect2008.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borzekowski|first=Dina|author2=Thomas N. Robinson|title=The Remote, the Mouse, and the No. 2 Pencil: The Household Media Environment and Academic Achievement Among Third Grade Students|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|year=2005|volume=159|issue=7|pages=607–613|url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/7/607|accessdate=16 May 2011|doi=10.1001/archpedi.159.7.607}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Rothstein could not anticipate in 2002 is the exponential proliferation of text messages teenagers send and receive, and the potential for negative ramifications of that activity when it comes to progressing with their verbal skills.  The New York Times notes that this "phenomenon is beginning to worry physicians and psychologists, who say it is leading to anxiety, distraction in school, falling grades, repetitive stress injury and sleep deprivation."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hafner|first=Katie|title=Texting May Be Taking a Toll|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26teen.html?_r=4&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2011|date=May 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may indeed be cause for concern as Neilsen's reported in 2008 that "American teenagers sent and received an average of 2,272 text messages per month in the fourth quarter of 2008 ... almost 80 messages a day, more than double the average of a year earlier (''Ibid.'').  Neilsen's 2010 report indicates a 47 percent increase in teen texting to 3,339 texts per month (4,050 for female teens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Teen Mobile Report: Calling Yesterday, Texting Today, Using Apps Tomorrow|url=http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/u-s-teen-mobile-report-calling-yesterday-texting-today-using-apps-tomorrow/|publisher=Neilsen Wire|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lech's theories===
Lech's alternative suggestions for further research in that 2007 dissertation indicated that it is quite likely the math–verbal achievement gap could be partially explained by the rapid proliferation of math and science [[Advanced Placement]] courses in American high schools. This wave of science and math AP courses, over that of humanities AP courses, is rising concurrently with higher math scores over that of verbal scores on these standardized tests.&lt;ref name="professionals.collegeboard.com"&gt;{{Cite web|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://professionals.collegeboard.com/data-reports-research/ap/nation|title = The College Board's Archived AP research and reports|format = |publisher = professionals.collegeboard.com| accessdate = June 8, 2010 | last=| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He added that this effect could be multiplied if large numbers of savvy students are front-loading the math and science AP courses in high school to intentionally "bone-up" for corresponding sections on the SAT/ACT. Indeed there does seem to be a solid preference for better math and science marks by college admission personnel. This would simultaneously explain both better scores on the math portions of the SAT/ACT and stagnating verbal scores on those tests. After all, AP English in 12th grade will not provide [[praxis (process)|praxis]] for college-entry tests taken in 11th grade.

Lech also contended that [[Chain migration|chain-migration]] from [[South Asia#Core countries|South Asia]], [[West Asia]], and [[East Asia#Territory and region data|East Asia]] during these same decades could also be positively influencing these rising SAT math scores (while simultaneously suppressing the verbal scores as many of those students may also be ELL students as well). That's because he noted the number of Asian students taking the SAT are disproportionately overrepresented during the very years when this math–verbal gap really takes form. Of the students taking the SAT, the proportion or percentage who are Asian is more than double the Asian proportion [or percentage] in the U.S. population.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-16.pdf |title=The Asian Population: 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is significant because, as Lech pointed out, Asian students themselves averaged 580 (out of a possible 800) on the math portion of the SAT in 2005, but the national math average that same year (which mathematically includes those high-scoring Asian students) was only 520.&lt;ref name="professionals.collegeboard.com.archive"&gt;{{Cite web|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://professionals.collegeboard.com/data-reports-research/sat/archived/|title = Archived SAT Data &amp; Reports|format = |publisher = professionals.collegeboard.com| accessdate = June 8, 2010 | last=| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Lech agreed with Rothstein that another influence on the math–verbal achievement gap could be the quality of the math teachers themselves.  Lech referenced literature indicating that U.S. math teachers tend to be much better organized than their humanities counterparts across the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ravitch|first=Diane | authorlink = | title = Left back: a century of failed school reforms|edition=2001|year=2001| publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]| isbn= 978-0-7432-0326-5 |page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein held that American math teachers tend to be better trained because they have more resources available like the extremely large {{Nowrap|$1 billion}} cash grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] for math and science instruction in high school which English teachers cannot reap.

'''Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf''' ({{lang-ar|محمد سعيد الصحاف}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN| Muḥammad Saʿīd Al-Ṣaḥḥāf}}''; born 30 July 1940), also known as '''Baghdad Bob''', is a former Iraqi diplomat and politician. He came to world wide prominence around the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], during which he was the [[Iraqi Information Minister]] under [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]], acting as spokesperson for the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] and Saddam's government.

== Before the Iraq War ==
Al-Sahhaf was born in [[Hilla]], near [[Karbala]] to a [[Shi'ite]] [[Arab]] family. After studying journalism&lt;ref name= BBC20080627&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2927031.stm|title=Profile: Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf| publisher= BBC News|date=27 June 2003|accessdate=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Baghdad University]] he graduated with a master's degree in [[English literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/13/wirq213.xml| last= Alderson| first= Andrew| title= 'True lies' make web star out of Saddam's mouthpiece| work= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date= March 2003| accessdate= 19 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to become an English teacher&lt;ref name= BBC20080627 /&gt; before joining the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] in 1963. In the early days of the Ba'athist regime, he read out regular announcements of recently executed Iraqis on state television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert| last= Fisk |title=The Great War For Civilisation |year=2006 |page=187|publisher=Harper Perennial |location=London |isbn=1-84115-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an ambassador to Sweden, Burma, the United Nations, and Italy before returning to Iraq to serve as Foreign Minister in 1992.&lt;ref name= BBC20080627 /&gt; The reasons for his removal as Foreign Minister in April 2001 are unclear, but his achievements in the position were often claimed to be less satisfactory than that of his predecessor, [[Tariq Aziz]]. At least one report suggests that [[Uday Hussein]] (son of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) was responsible for the removal.&lt;ref name= BBC20080627 /&gt;

== During the Iraq War ==
Al-Sahhaf is known for his daily press briefings in [[Baghdad]] during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. His colorful appearances caused him to be nicknamed "Baghdad Bob"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90355,00.html |title=Report: U.S. Bags 'Baghdad Bob'|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=25 June 2003 |date=25 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the style of previous propagandists with geographical aliases—some of them alliterative, such as "[[Tokyo Rose]]", "[[Hanoi Hannah]]" and "[[Seoul City Sue]]") by commentators in the United States. He was nicknamed "Comical Ali" (a wordplay allusion to "Chemical Ali" the nickname of former Iraqi Defence Minister [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]]) by commentators in the United Kingdom; commentators in Italy similarly nicknamed him "Alì il Comico".

His pronouncements included claims that American soldiers were committing suicide "by the hundreds" outside the city, and denial that there were any American tanks in Baghdad, when in fact they were only several hundred meters away{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} from the press conference where he was speaking and the combat sounds of the nearing American troops could already be heard in the background of the broadcast. On another occasion he spoke of the disastrous outcomes of previous foreign attempts to invade Iraq, citing an unspecified Western history book and inviting the journalists present to come to his home to read it. His last public appearance as Information Minister was on 8 April 2003, when he said that the Americans "are going to surrender or be burned in their tanks. They will surrender, it is they who will surrender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Howard |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations from 1897 |date=2008 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5825-0 |page=591 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=2A28fa-Bz9sC&amp;pg=PA591&amp;lpg=PA591 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked where he had got his information he replied, "authentic sources—many authentic sources".&lt;ref name= Comical-resurf&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3024046.stm |title='Comical Ali' resurfaces |publisher=BBC News |date=26 June 2003 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that he "was a professional, doing his job".&lt;ref name= Comical-resurf /&gt;

He frequently used the word ''‘ulūj'' (علوج), an obscure and particularly insulting term for [[infidel]]s, to describe the American forces in Iraq. This caused some debate in the [[Arabic-language]] media about the exact meaning of the word with most concluding it meant "bloodsucking insect". In an August 2003 interview on [[Abu Dhabi Al Oula]], al-Sahhaf said it was an archaic term attributed to [[Umar]] ibn Al-Khattāb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-175556/Al-Sahhaf-public-face-Saddam.html|title=Al-Sahhaf: the public face of Saddam|work=Daily Mail|date=5 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|page=60|author=Andrew Hammond|year=2007 |publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=9774160541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Sahhaf gained something of a cult following in the West, appearing on T-shirts, cartoons, and in [[Internet celebrity|Internet phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/ |title=We Love the Iraqi Information Minister |publisher=We Love the Iraqi Information Minister |date=30 May 2003 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a DVD documentary was sold about his exploits and televised interviews, called ''Comical Ali''.

== Post-war life ==
On 25 June 2003, the British newspaper ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' reported that al-Sahhaf had been captured by coalition troops at a roadblock in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90355,00.html |title=Report: U.S. Bags 'Baghdad Bob' |website= FoxNews.com |date= 25 June 2003|accessdate=25 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was not confirmed by military authorities and was denied by al-Sahhaf's family through [[Abu Dhabi TV]]. The next day al-Sahhaf himself recorded an interview for the [[Dubai]]-based news channel, [[al-Arabiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,85572,00.html |title=Ex-Iraqi Information Minister Could Be a TV Star | website= FoxNews.com |date= 30 April 2003| accessdate=30 April 2003 | first=Don | last=Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was reportedly paid as much as [[U.S. dollars|$]]200,000 for the television interview, during which he appeared very withdrawn in contrast with the bombastic persona he projected during the war. Many of his answers consisted of a simple "yes" or "no". He refused to speculate on the causes of the downfall of the Iraqi government and answered only "history will tell" when asked if video clips purporting to prove that [[Saddam Hussein]] was alive were genuine, amid speculation at that time that Hussein had been killed during the war.

His fame quickly evaporated as the war continued into the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|insurgency phase]]; from the middle of 2003 onward, he faded from the public spotlight, and was no longer a figure in the war. Al-Sahhaf said that he had surrendered to US forces, had been interrogated by them and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Ex-minister detained, released| url= |agency= Associated Press| date= 27 June 2003| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlTrue&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/baghdad-bob-and-his-ridiculous-true-predictions/274241/| title= 'Baghdad Bob' and His Ridiculous, True Predictions| first= Emily| last= DePrang| work= [[The Atlantic]]| date= March 21, 2013 | access-date= February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not charged for his role in Saddam Hussein's government.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In November 2014, Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' posted a video of an ill man, ostensibly Al-Sahhaf in a hospital bed in the [[UAE]], claiming that he was dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/utrikes/bagdad-bob-doende/| title=

[[File:Spines of New Math paperbacks from 1960s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Paperback introductions to the New Math]]

'''New Mathematics''' or '''New Math''' was a brief, dramatic change in the way [[mathematics]] was taught in [[United States|American]] [[Primary school|grade schools]], and to a lesser extent in [[European countries]], during the 1960s. The change involved new curriculum topics and [[Teaching method|teaching practices]] introduced in the [[United States|U.S.]] shortly after the [[Sputnik crisis]], in order to boost [[science education]] and mathematical skill in the [[Population of the United States|population]], so that the technological threat of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[engineer]]s, reputedly highly skilled [[mathematician]]s, could be met.

The [[phrase]] is often used now to describe any short-lived [[fad]] which quickly becomes highly discredited.

== Overview ==
Topics introduced in the New Math include [[modular arithmetic]], [[inequality (mathematics)|algebraic inequalities]], [[Radix|bases]] other than [[Base 10|10]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[Boolean algebra]], and [[abstract algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kline | first = Morris | title = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1973 | location = New York | isbn =  0-394-71981-6}} &lt;/ref&gt; In elementary school, in addition to bases other than 10, students were taught basic set theory and made to distinguish "numerals" from "numbers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/rarm/beberman.html | title =Chapter 1: Max | last =Raimi | first =Ralph | date =May 6, 2004 | access-date =April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Parents and teachers who opposed the New Math in the U.S. complained that the new curriculum was too far outside of students' ordinary experience and was not worth taking time away from more traditional topics, such as [[arithmetic]]. The material also put new demands on teachers, many of whom were required to teach material they did not fully understand. Parents were concerned that they did not understand what their children were learning and could not help them with their studies. In an effort to learn the material, many parents attended their children's classes. In the end, it was concluded that the experiment was not working, and New Math fell out of favor before the end of the decade, though it continued to be taught for years thereafter in some school districts.

In the [[Algebra]] preface of his book ''Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell'', Professor [[George F. Simmons]] wrote that the New Math produced students who had "heard of the [[commutative law]], but did not know the [[multiplication table]]."

In 1965, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] wrote in the essay "New Textbooks for the 'New Mathematics'":&lt;ref&gt;http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2362/1/feynman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we would like to, we can and do say, 'The answer is a whole number less than 9 and bigger than 6,' but we do not have to say, 'The answer is a member of  the set which is the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the set of those numbers which are larger than 6 and the set of numbers which are smaller than 9' ... In the 'new' mathematics,  then, first there must be freedom of thought; second, we do not want to teach just words; and third, subjects should not be introduced without explaining the purpose or reason, or without giving any way in which the material could be really used to discover something interesting. I don't think it is worth while teaching such material.}}

In his book ''Why Johnny Can't Add: the Failure of the New Math'', Morris Kline says that certain advocates of the new topics "ignored completely the fact that mathematics is a cumulative development and that it is practically impossible to learn the newer creations, if one does not know the older ones" (p.&amp;nbsp;17). Furthermore, noting the trend to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] in New Math, Kline says "abstraction is not the first stage, but the last stage, in a mathematical development" (p.&amp;nbsp;98).

== Other countries ==
In the broader context, reform of school mathematics curricula was also pursued in European countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (particularly by the [[School Mathematics Project]]), and [[France]], where the extremely high prestige of mathematical qualifications was not matched by teaching that connected with contemporary research and university topics.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} In [[West Germany]] the changes were seen as part of a larger process of ''[[Education reform|Bildungsreform]]''. Beyond the use of set theory and different approach to [[arithmetic]], characteristic changes were [[transformation geometry]] in place of the [[Natural deduction|traditional deductive]] [[Euclidean geometry]], and an approach to [[calculus]] that was based on greater insight, rather than emphasis on facility.{{clarify|date=February 2011}}{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Again, the changes met with a mixed reception, but for different reasons. For example, the end-users of mathematics studies were at that time mostly in the [[physical science]]s and [[engineering]]; and they expected manipulative skill in calculus, rather than more abstract ideas. Some compromises have since been required, given that [[discrete mathematics]] is the basic language of [[computing]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Teaching in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] did not experience such extreme upheavals, while being kept in tune, both with the applications and academic trends. "Under [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A. N. Kolmogorov]], the mathematics committee declared a reform of the curricula of grades 4–10, at the time when the school system consisted of 10 grades. The committee found the type of reform in progress in Western countries to be unacceptable; for example, no special topic for sets was accepted for inclusion in school textbooks. [[Transformation geometry|Transformation approaches]] were accepted in teaching geometry, but not to such sophisticated level presented in the textbook produced by [[Vladimir Boltyansky]] and [[Isaak Yaglom]]."&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;http://math.unipa.it/~grim/EMALATY231-240.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japanese mathematics|Japan]], the New Math was supported by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT), but not without encountering problems, leading to [[Student-centred learning|student-centred]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37261895___&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* Musician and university mathematics lecturer [[Tom Lehrer]] wrote a [[Satire|satirical]] song named "New Math" which revolved around the process of subtracting 173 from 342 in decimal and [[octal]]. The song is in the style of a lecture about the general concept of subtraction in arbitrary [[number system]]s, illustrated by two simple calculations, and highlights the New Math's emphasis on insight and abstract concepts &amp;mdash; as Lehrer put it with an indeterminable amount of seriousness, "In the new approach ... the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer." At one point in the song, he notes that "you've got thirteen and you take away seven, and that leaves five... well, six, actually, but the idea is the important thing."

* In 1965, cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] authored a series of ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]'' strips, which detailed kindergartener Sally's frustrations with New Math. In the first strip, she is depicted puzzling over "sets, one-to-one matching, equivalent sets, non-equivalent sets, sets of one, sets of two, renaming two, [[subset]]s, joining sets, number sentences, placeholders." Eventually, she bursts into tears and exclaims, "All I want to know is, how much is two and two?"&lt;ref name="gocomics"&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/2012/10/02 Peanuts strip from October 2, 1965, on GoComics.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of strips was later adapted for the 1973 ''Peanuts'' animated special ''[[There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14062">'''The Papaye Peasant Movement''', Mouvman Peyizan Papay (MPP) in [[Haitian Creole]], is recognized as both the largest peasant movement in Haiti and a grass-roots organization (GRO). MPP has approximately 60,000 members, including 20,000 women and 10,000 youths.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2005/islands|website=The Goldman Environmental Prize|publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is localized in the Central Plateau, home to about 13% of the Haitian population, the majority of whom are rural [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] or agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographical Context|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Geographical-context,53-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP focuses on re-establishing [[food sovereignty]] in [[Haiti]] through a number or programs and methods which include educating people on [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] methods and organizing skills. While these are the primary foci of MPP, the organization has expanded to provide a plethora of other services to its members, including legal aid, health care services, and university scholarships. The movement seeks to empower peasants to control their own livelihood, thus decreasing dependency on multinational organizations which have flooded the Haitian agricultural market in recent decades.

== Organization ==

Workers in the same neighborhood join together to form groups which meet weekly. At least seven groups in the same region form a local assembly, which meets monthly. The regional assembly, comprising at least four local assemblies, meets every three months, while the general assembly – which all local assemblies attend – meets once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Organisation,66-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Papaye Peasant Movement was established in 1973 by [[Jean-Baptiste Chavannes (agronomist)|Jean-Baptiste Chavannes]], a Catholic lay-worker turned [[Agronomy|agronomist]], with the intent to collaborate with rural farmworkers in order to develop more efficient and more sustainable farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chavannes Jean-Baptiste ensures a future for Haitian farmers|url=http://grist.org/article/nijhuis-jean-baptiste/|website=Grist|publisher=Grist|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Chavannes originally worked with two small groups (groupements) of workers, MPP now includes over 4,000 groups. The organizations' activities have diversified over time, in a slow but methodical manner, beginning with economic initiatives.

In 1976, MPP implemented a savings and [[credit union]], SERE POU CHOFE (Haitian Creole for "Save to Warm") in part because the heads of the movement saw increasing personal income and tackling hunger is being inherently linked to one another. SERE POU CHOFE enabled members to where members deposit savings from which other members could borrow and then replenish.

In 1978, MPP created KONBIT SÈVO MEN AK KÈ ANSANM (Union of minds, hearts, and hands), also known as KOSMIKA, a multi-sector union which focused on storing and producing agricultural products, finding and building warehouses to store farming tools, and establishing a farmer's bank. The following year, MPP founded a youth leadership program and the Young Peasant Workers association or Jeunes Travailleurs Paysan (JTP) which works to educate youths on a variety of subjects and prepares them to take on leadership roles later in life.

The Movement of Women of MPP, along with a separate association for and run by women, was established in 1981 in order to attack [[gender inequality]] within the movement. These two entities focus on tackling violence against women, defending social and cultural rights, as well as promoting economic independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MPP|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-History-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, the MPP had to maintain a relatively low profile due to political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Duvalier]] regime in Haiti. When Duvalier was forced out in 1986, the movement began to gain political traction, and played a large role in supporting Operation Lavalas, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide|Jean-Bertrand Aristide's]] party. Aristide became the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 1991, only to be [[1991 Haitian coup d'état|overthrown]] a few months later. Many of the leaders of MPP went into hiding, while others were imprisoned or tortured. Chavannes Jean-Baptiste himself went into exile from 1993 to 1994. Nevertheless, the movement continued its activities and opened an office in Boston in order to spread information on a worldwide scale. Full operations resumed in 1994 when Haiti established a constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uvin|first1=Peter|title=Fighting Hunger at the Grassroots: Paths to Scaling Up|journal=World Development|date=January 1995|volume=23|issue=6|pages=927–938|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(95)00028-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention areas ==

=== Community education and legal aid ===

MPP provides a number of training education programs and workshops for group members, while also providing university-level training for middle managers who often come back to the organization. Higher-level workshops are also provided to trained instructors.

The youth education program, JTP, is organized by a three-tier system: Pre-Nursery JTP (PPJTP) for children ages 5 to 10, Nursery JTP (PJTP) for children ages 10 to 15, and JTP for people ages 15 through 30, though members of JTP can also become group members or leaders within MPP. JTP programs provide courses on sex education, sports, music, dance, theater, and cultural activities. Some participants receive university scholarships and are sent to study in Port-au-Prince or abroad.

MPP also has a legal aid department which informs members of their rights, basic legal training, as well as legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Education|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Education.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic services ===

MPP develops [[cooperative]]s within different assemblies and trains assembly members to manage the financial aspects of their projects. The organization also conducts feasibility and productivity studies, helps grous prepare reports, and provides economic counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economy and Cooperatives|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Economy-and-Cooperatives.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February, 2013, MPP celebrated the inauguration of a modern corn storage and processing mill which was built with the help of two Canadian organizations: [[Development and Peace (Canada)|Développement et Paix]] and [[ACDI/VOCA|ACDI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration of a storage center at Marmmont|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Inauguration-of-a-storage-centre.html|website=Mouvment Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community healthcare ===

MPP has a number of health projects relating to hygiene, [[Reproductive health|sexual health]], nutrition, and parenting skills. It also has a health center with a laboratory, and a pharmacy where community members can receive services and medical consultations. MPP also has a community health worker program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Healthcare|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Community-Healthcare.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

=== Agro-ecology ===

About 75% of the Haitian population lives in rural areas, a large portion of whom practice subsistence agriculture. Until the 1980s, the country was in large part self-sustainable in terms of rice, manioc, and potato production. After the dismantlement of the Duvalier dictatorship, however, organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] urged the country to liberalize markets and undergo structural reform, leading to a rural exodus and greatly affecting the agricultural sector. The liberalization of markets caused government funding for agricultural and public-sector  development to decrease, further depleting the agricultural sector. Many [[multinational corporation]]s took advantage of the newly liberalized market to export goods, creating Haitian dependency on agricultural imports. Additionally, [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] has caused mass erosion, thus decreasing soil arability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP)|url=http://map.seedmap.org/solutions/food-sovereignty/people-farmer-led-movements/papaye-peasant-movement-mpp/|website=Seed Map|publisher=Seed Map|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP's [[Agroecology|agro-ecology]] program seeks to address the issue of dependence and food sovereignty by focusing on forms of agriculture based on environmental health. The organization teaches innovative farming practices, including germinating seedlings inside discarded tires and using other methods so as not to exhaust the land. Farmers focus on growing organic, indigenous crops in order to maintain biodiversity, and thus reject hybrid and GMO seed donations from multinational corporations. The program also comprises a reforestation component in order to help improve soil quality and prevent further erosion. Since its inception, MPP members have planted over 20&amp;nbsp;million trees, and their efforts continue.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Beverly|title=Haitian Farmers Resist GM Crops, Environmental Destruction|url=http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/89771:haitian-farmers-resist-gm-crops-environmental-destruction|accessdate=21 November 2014|agency=Truthout|publisher=Truthout|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water management ===

MPP conducts courses on [[Water resource management|water management]] and storage. Methods include draining water from kitchens and showers into ponds filled, gravel, and charcoal, thus producing clean water. This water is then used to for irrigation and fish breeding. MPP also uses cisterns to catch water on rooves, mountain-top catchment lakes, and water-drip irrigation systems in order to save and store water.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt;

=== Alternative energy ===

MPP has taken on multiple [[alternative energy]] initiatives. Leaders have conducted workshops on how to install [[solar panel]]s and how to build solar-powered batteries; they have also established a facility to manufacture solar products.&lt;ref name="Chavannes Jean-Baptiste"/&gt; Additionally, MPP promotes the use of natural fertilizer such as manure and compost.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt; They also produce alternative charcoal, bio-fuel from waste, and other alternative energy methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Energy|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/-Alternative-Energy,69-.html|website=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|publisher=Mouvman Peyizan Papay|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-villages ===

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], there was an urban exodus to rural areas like Papaye, particularly from the Haitian capital of [[Port-au-Prince]]. MMP set up a camp for internally displaced people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leitch|first1=Laurie|title=Hope in the Ruins|journal=Psychotherapy Network|date=August 2010|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaborations with partners such as [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] (UUSC), helped refugees build eco-villages. Earthquake survivors, MMP members, and volunteers built the houses, – survivors were paid a minimum salary for their work – taught urban dwellers sustainable farming methods, and set up personal and community gardens. Water management methods were also installed so that eco-village dwellers would have access to clean water. So far, the experiment has been a success and many other organizations are replicating this model in Haiti and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti Eco-village|url=http://vimeo.com/62163892|website=Vimeo|publisher=UUSC|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns and Public Events ==

=== World Environment Day Protest ===
In June, 2012, 12,000 Haitian farmers marched in the streets of the town of [[Hinche]] in order to protest multinational corporations pushing [[hybrid seed]]s and biofuels on local farmers.  They buried coffins inscribed with the names of a number of corporations as a part of the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmers say no to multinational offensive|url=http://www.mpphaiti.org/Farmers-say-no-to-multinational.html|website=Mouvement Paysan Papaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seeds for Haïti ===
The Seeds for Haïti campaign was launched inn 2012 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Sandy]] in collaboration with MPP's French partner, [[Frères des Hommes]].  The organizations were able to raise enough money to buy 20 tons of seeds in order to support Haitian farmers who lost their supply as a result of the hurricane.

The '''Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order''' (Portuguese: '''Partido de Reedificação da Ordem Nacional''', PRONA) was a [[nationalist]] [[political party]] in [[Brazil]]. Its electoral code was 56 and its colors were the traditional Brazilian green and yellow. It was founded in 1989 by the [[polymath]] [[Enéas Carneiro]], who was the president of the party.&lt;ref name="CPDOC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fgv.br/cpdoc/acervo/dicionarios/verbete-tematico/partido-de-reedificacao-da-ordem-nacional-prona|title=Partido de Reedificação da Ordem Nacional (PRONA)|last=Couto|first=André|website=Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação de História Contemporânea do Brasil (CPDOC)|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its political broadcasts during the [[Party political broadcast|pre-election campaigning periods]] became famous and distinct for the speed in which they were produced due to the very short time the party had available and also because of the use of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] as soundtrack.

The party was strongly identified with the figure of Enéas, who was candidate to the [[President of Brazil|presidency of Brazil]] in 1989, 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref name="CPDOC" /&gt;

The party was extinguished in 2006, shortly before the death of Enéas, being succeeded by the [[Party of the Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.partidodarepublica.org.br/partido/estatuto.html|title=Estatuto do Partido da República|website=partidodarepublica.org.br|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{ILL|Electoral Corruption Movement|pt|Movimento de Combate à Corrupção Eleitoral}}, based on data released by the [[Superior Electoral Court]] on 4 October 2007, released a balance sheet containing parties with the largest number of members of the judiciary who had been expelled for corruption since the year 2000.

The '''President''' is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group. The relationship between the president and the [[Chief Executive Officer]] varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similar vein to the [[Chief Operating Officer]], the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[Corporate_title#Senior_management|C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and Chief Executive Officer" or "President and Chief Operating Officer") is also loosely defined; the President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various [[Vice_president#In_business|Vice Presidents]] (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of the president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws (e.g. the president can make an "executive decision" only if the bylaws allow for it).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 456|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the term "president" was used to designate someone who presided over a meeting, and was used in the same way that "foreman" or "overseer" is used now (the term is still used in that sense today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='President' Once Meant Little More Than 'Foreman'|author=Guy Raz|date=December 14, 2013|work=npr.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=250990126|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/president?s=t|title = President|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = |publisher = Dictionary.com|quote = a person who presides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now also come to mean "chief officer" in terms of administrative or executive duties.

== Duties at meetings ==
[[File:AGM Annual General Meeting of a typical small (141 member) volunteer organisation.jpg|thumb|President presiding over the AGM of a small volunteer organization. President sitting at the left of table in the background]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the president has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:
* calling the meeting to order
* determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
* [[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* enforcing the rules of the group
* putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* adjourning the meeting
While presiding, the president should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the president votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the president should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the president only has one vote (i.e. the president cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the president such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and authority ==
The powers of the president vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the president has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the president only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the president has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the president depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplinary procedures ==
If the president exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the president may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the president has the power to discipline this officer.

== President-Elect ==
{{See also|-elect}}Some organizations may have a position of President-Elect in addition to the position of President. Generally the membership of the organization elects a President-Elect and when the term of the President-Elect is complete, that person automatically becomes President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate Past President ==
Some organizations may have a position of Immediate Past President in addition to the position of President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Immediate Past President? - Association of Information Technology Professionals|url = https://www.aitp.org/news/123604/|website = www.aitp.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-Elect/President/Immediate Past President|url = http://www.asha.org/About/governance/BOD/President/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-elect, President or Immediate Past President Position Description|url = http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/leadership/nominations-and-elections/national-leadership-positions/president-elect-or-president-position-description|website = www.eatrightpro.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those organizations, when the term of the President is complete, that person automatically fills the position of Immediate Past President. The organization can have such a position only if the bylaws provide it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of such a position would also have to be provided in the bylaws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900''' was a piece of legislation introduced by the [[British Raj]] with the aim of limiting the transfer of land ownership in [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]]. It created a 
an "agricultural tribes" category, the membership of which was almost compulsory to buy or sell land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pseweb.eu/ydepot/semin/texte0910/CAS2010BRI.pdf   British law and caste identity manipulation in colonial India: the Punjab Alienation of Land Act., Guilhem Cassan, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Laboratoire d’Economie Appliqu´ee (LEA-INRA) and Centre de Sciences Humaines de Delhi (CSH), 12 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/special/why-dera-sacha-sauda-draws-followers/20170828.htm  Why Dera Sacha Sauda draws followers, Sanjeev Nayar, Rediff, 28 August 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The advent of [[Company rule in India|British rule in India]] had led to a trend whereby ownership rights to land were increasingly concentrated in the hands of urban moneylenders and other commercial communities among the Hindu population. They were assigned the property previously held by poor peasants, who either sold or mortgaged for the short-term benefit derived from the increasing values of land caused by improved agricultural methods, irrigation and communications. Such transfers were enforceable under law but, in British eyes, potentially damaging to their colonial administration because they might ultimately result in a disaffected rural peasant population. British law was effectively supporting the growth of a class of people&amp;nbsp;— the new owners&amp;nbsp;— that might prove detrimental to its own purpose. In addition, historian Kenneth Jones says that the transfers were contrary to British sentiments: "Not only did this development threaten the stability and peace of the Punjab, it also struck at the British self-image of benevolent and paternalistic protectors of the lowly peasant".{{sfnp|Jones|1976|pp=182-183|ps=}}

== Legislation ==
Concern about developments turned to serious debate in the 1890s and on 27 September 1899 the future [[List of governors of Punjab (British India)|Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab]], [[Charles Montgomery Rivaz|Charles Rivaz]], presented the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] with a proposal titled the Punjab Alienation of Land Bill.{{efn|Kenneth Jones says that Charles Rivaz was Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in 1899 but this is incorrect. He succeeded [[William Mackworth Young]] in that office in 1902.}} The measure was viewed by educated Hindus in the province as being another example of Raj discrimination against their interests. In classifying people as being either "agriculturalist" or "non-agriculturalist" and limiting the transfer of land between those two groups, they saw the measure as preventing free investment of capital and reducing their opportunity to acquire the status traditionally associated with land ownership. More, with the majority of those classified as agriculturists being Muslim,{{sfnp|Nair|2011|p=13|ps=}} the educated elite saw it as being anti-Hindu, just as their diminishing ability to gain government employment, which was once their preserve, was considered to be such.{{sfnp|Jones|1976|pp=182-183|ps=}}{{efn|Hindus had traditionally been dominant in government offices but competition for such jobs became tougher from the 1880s for a variety of reasons rooted both in policy and in demographic changes. The [[Aitchison Commission]] was significant in this development.{{sfnp|Jones|1976|pp=182-183|ps=}}}}

Rivaz's proposed legislation reignited the interest of elite Hindu Punjabis in the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and [[Indian Association]] political movements, which had waned during the decade. When the Congress delegates at the 1899 gathering in [[Lucknow]] supported opposition to the proposal, it created a rift between the organisation and Punjabi Muslims and peasants.{{sfnp|Jones|1976|pp=247-248|ps=}} However, factional disputes among the Punjabi elite&amp;nbsp;— notably, between the [[Arya Samaj]]ists and the [[Brahmo]]s&amp;nbsp;— meant that this revived enthusiasm for Congress was short-lived.{{sfnp|Jones|1976|p=249|ps=}}

== Aftermath ==
The [[Unionist Party (Punjab)|National Unionist Party]] was established as a consequence of the 1900 legislation to protect the interests of agriculturists.{{sfnp|Nair|2011|p=71|ps=}} The subsequent Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1907 further restricted the transfer of land ownership between various groups.{{sfnp|Nair|2011|p=6|ps=}}

'''Rebecca Peters''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep-,|AO}} is a political advocate for [[gun control]] who served as Director of the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] (IANSA) from 2002 to 2010. {{as of|2012|04}}, Peters was listed on the IANSA board of directors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As chair of the [[Australia]]n [[Gun Control Australia|National Coalition for Gun Control]] at the time of the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in 1996, Peters played a key role in the introduction of stricter [[Gun politics in Australia|gun control in Australia]], an area in which she remains active today.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

According to the Umut Foundation:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929154716/http://www.umut.org.tr/eng/sempozyum/katilimcibiyog.html UMUT Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Rebecca Peters was Chair of the National Coalition for Gun Control, which campaigned to tighten Australia's gun laws in the 1990s. Her research and advocacy helped bring about sweeping changes, including a move towards uniform gun laws across the eight states ( the laws are still not entirely uniform in 2011 ), a ban on [[Semi-automatic rifle|semiautomatic]] rifles and shotguns, and a year-long [[Gun buyback program|buyback]] that destroyed nearly 700,000 weapons.}}

Peters received the 1996 [[Human Rights Medal (Australia)|Australian Human Rights Medal]],  for "her contribution to researching, educating and lobbying for gun law reforms in Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://hrawards.humanrights.gov.au/1996-human-rights-medal-and-awards-winners 1996 Human Rights Medal and Awards Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her work with IANSA, Peters worked for the [[Open Society Institute]], a private foundation funded by [[George Soros]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

{{quote|The most expensive kind of violence, is gun violence.|Rebecca Peters, ''Great Gun Debate''{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}}}

She has been criticized by the United States [[National Rifle Association]] which claims that Peters "is the voice and face of hatred of gun owners and [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070314221248/http://www.stopungunban.org/pages/mastermind “Meet the Mastermind of the U.N. Global Gun ban Treaty”] Stopthegunban.org/NRA, April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Peters was appointed an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]] for distinguished service to the community as an advocate and campaigner for gun control, and as a global leader in the reduction of the proliferation and misuse of small arms.&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2017/slkh83xzcb/AO%20Final%20Media%20Notes.pdf |title=Officer (AO) in the General Division of the Order of Australia |work=Australia Day 2017 Honours List |publisher=[[Governor-General of Australia]] |date=26 January 2017 |access-date=27 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the two major parties polarized along ethnic and religious grounds. In the North, most Protestants were Whigs or Republicans; most Catholics were Democrats.  In the South, from the 1860s to the 1980s, most whites were Democrats (after 1865) and most blacks were Republicans. see [[Ethnocultural politics in the United States]]

The majority of Americans identify themselves as [[Christianity|Christians]] (71%), while non-Christian religions (including Islam, Judaism, Hindiusm, and others) collectively make up about 6% of the adult population. Another 23% of the adult population identified as having no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Changing Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Religious Identification Survey]], religious belief varies considerably across the country: 59% of Americans living in Western states report a belief in God, yet in the South (the "[[Bible Belt]]") the figure is as high as 86%.&lt;ref name=ARIS2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://b27.cc.trincoll.edu/weblogs/AmericanReligionSurvey-ARIS/reports/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=AMERICAN RELIGIOUS IDENTIFICATION SURVEY (ARIS) 2008 |author=Barry A.

Politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning, and many [[Church body|churches]] and religious figures are highly politically active. As important as religion is in politics, Jefferson, the third president of the United States, had to fight his way into office due to his controversial thoughts about religion. His writing was often seen as anti-Christian. It is argued that Jefferson’s win can be linked to him changing the election’s narrative from one about his own religious beliefs, to one about his tolerance of religious freedom (Lambert).&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, F. (1997). `God-and a religious president... [or] Jefferson and no God': for a voter-imposed. Journal of Church &amp; State, 39(4), 769. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to keep their status as tax-exempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate. There are [[Christianity|Christians]] in both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], but [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]] tend to support the Republican Party whereas more [[liberal Christians]], Catholics and secular voters&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=174 Pew Forum: Religion and the 2006 Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; tend to support the Democratic Party.

Two former presidents, [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Herbert Hoover]], were raised as [[Quaker]]s. All the rest were raised in families affiliated with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christianity. However, many presidents have themselves had only a nominal affiliation with churches, and some never joined any church.

There has never been a [[Jew]]ish President or Vice-President. The only Jewish major party candidate for either of those offices was [[Joe Lieberman]] in the [[Al Gore|Gore]]-Lieberman [[United States presidential election, 2000|campaign of 2000]] (although [[John Kerry]] and [[Barry Goldwater]] both had Jewish ancestry). Lieberman's faith is [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Judaic]]. Some sources indicate that Jews constitute only 1.4% of the U.S. population, although others indicate that Jews comprise as much as 2.1% of the population (a significant decline from over 3% in the 1950s, chiefly due to the relatively low birthrate among Jewish Americans and high rates of out-marriage to non-Jews).

==Separation of church and state==
{{Main|Separation of church and state in the United States}}

In the 1780-1820s in New England the dominant [[Federalist Party]] was closely linked to the [[Congregational church]]; when the party collapsed, the church was disestablished.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Olds, "Privatizing the church: disestablishment in Connecticut and Massachusetts." ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1994): 277-297. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138662 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, and others elections, Federalists targeted  infidelity in any form. They repeatedly charged that Republican candidates, especially Thomas Jefferson himself, were atheistic or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan J. Den Hartog, ''Patriotism and Piety: Federalist Politics and Religious Struggle in the New American Nation'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Baptists, Methodists and other dissenters, and the religiously nonaligned, favored the Republican cause.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Porterfield, ''Conceived in Doubt: Religion and Politics in the New American Nation'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptists, in particular, made the disestablishment one of their founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;William G. McLoughlin, ''New England dissent, 1630-1833: the Baptists and the separation of church and state'' (Harvard University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence Jefferson chose the Baptists of Connecticut to pronounce there should be a "wall of separation" between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Constance B. Schulz, "'Of Bigotry in Politics and Religion': Jefferson's Religion, the Federalist Press, and the Syllabus." ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 91#1 (1983): 73-91. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4248611 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The separation of church and state is a legal and political principle which advocates derive from the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". The phrase "separation of church and state", which does not appear in the Constitution itself, is generally traced to an 1802 letter by [[Thomas Jefferson]] to the [[Danbury Baptists]], where Jefferson spoke of the combined effect of the [[Establishment Clause]] and the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]]. It has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court many times. In its 1879 [[Reynolds v. United States]] decision the high court said Jefferson's observations "may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment". In the court's 1947 [[Everson v. Board of Education]] decision, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote, "In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Bellah]] has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He argued that in effect there is an [[American civil religion]] which is a nonsectarian faith with sacred symbols drawn from national history. Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. Bellah's 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: "Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Catholics==
{{Main|Catholic Church and politics in the United States}}
[[Catholics]] represent the largest Christian denomination in [[United States|America]] with over 68 million members.&lt;ref name="officialcatholicdirectory.com"&gt;[http://www.officialcatholicdirectory.com/ ''The Official Catholic Directory'' 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of these Catholics found their faith to be "somewhat" to "very important" to them. In recent national elections Catholics cast 25 to 27 percent of the ballots.&lt;ref name="cara.georgetown.edu"&gt;[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm CARA's New Book Identifies Trends in U.S. Catholic Church], Catholicism USA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/news/pr/2008/documents/executivesummary.pdf Secular and Security-Minded: The Catholic Vote in Summer 2008], A National Opinion Survey of Likely Catholic Voters, Executive Summary, BELDEN RUSSONELLO &amp; STEWART, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Catholic Church have been active in the politics of the United States since the mid 19th century. The United States has never had an important religious party (unlike Europe and Latin America). There has never been a Catholic religious party, either local, state or national.

In 1776 Catholics comprised less than 1% of the population of the new nation, but their presence grew rapidly after 1840 with immigration from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and elsewhere in [[Catholic Europe]] from 1840 to 1914, and also from Latin America in the 20th century. Catholics now comprise 25% to 27% of the national vote, with over 68 million members today. 85% of today's Catholics report their faith to be "somewhat" to "very important" to them.&lt;ref name="officialcatholicdirectory.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cara.georgetown.edu"/&gt;

From the mid-19th century down to 1964 Catholics were solidly Democratic, sometimes at the 80%-90% level.  Religious tensions were major issues in the presidential elections of [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] when the Democrats nominated [[Al Smith]], a Catholic who was defeated. Catholics formed a core part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], with overlapping memberships in the Church, labor unions, and big city machines, and the working class, all of which promoted [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal policy positions]] in domestic affairs and [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]]. Since the election of a Catholic President in 1960, Catholics have split about 50-50 between the two major parties in national elections.

Religious tensions arose once again in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] when the Democrats nominated [[John F. Kennedy]], a Catholic who was elected. In 2004, with the nomination of [[John Kerry]] by the Democrats, who was at odds with the Church in the issues of abortion and same-sex marriage, his Catholic religion failed to attract significant votes, as slightly more Catholics voted for [[George W. Bush]] than for him.  

With the decline of unions and big city machines, and with upward mobility into the middle classes, Catholics have drifted away from liberalism and toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] on economic issues (such as taxes). Since the end of the [[Cold War]], their strong anti-Communism has faded in importance. On social issues the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and has formed coalitions with Protestant evangelicals.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Critchlow, ''Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America'' (2001) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has been a fierce opponent of liberalized abortion laws, has formed coalitions with evangelicals to oppose abortion and has inspired political resistance to such legislation in several Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Catholic Church - MSN Encarta &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573737_4/Roman_Catholic_Church.html#s15|website=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQfeiCe|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, 24 of the 100 [[U.S. Senator]]s are Catholics (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans). 132 of the 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] are Catholics. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], Republican [[Paul Ryan]] of [[Wisconsin]], is Catholic. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] is also an [[evangelical Catholic]].

===The Know Nothings===
{{Main|Know Nothing}}
The Know Nothings were a short-lived American political party in the mid-1850s.  Know Nothingism was an [[anti-slavery]] party that recruited its strength from the collapse of the equally short-lived [[Free Soil Party]] and, in turn, provided the voters who formed the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and elected Abraham Lincoln to abolish slavery. The motivators of the Party's rise are considered to have been, 1.) [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] sentiment caused by the sudden, unprecedented influx of German and Irish immigrants in the late 1840s: 2. a rapid,steep decline in factory wages caused by the sudden influx of very large numbers of Irish immigrants fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]]; 3) the threat members perceived the expansion of a slave system would pose to free labor which, in the eyes of supporters of both the Free Soil and Know Nothing movements, threatened to reduce free men to "wage slaves,"' and 4.) fear that land in the western territories  would be awarded to wealthy slave owners rather than to small farmers.  It was due to this fear that slavery would destroy the economic prospects of white working families that the Party enrolled massive numbers of voters in the wake of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854. 

The party is remembered for anti-Catholicism, an attitude that resulted not only from the fact that America was an almost entirely Protestant country confronted for the first time by a wave of Catholic immigration, but by the fact that the Catholic Church supported slavery. The influx of Catholic immigrants in several Northern states in an era when citizenship, and the vote could be attained very rapidly after immigrating, was sufficient to make it possible that even small increments of new, Catholic immigrants would tip the balance in a national election in favor of the pro-slavery Democratic Party.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Religion: pietistic Republicans versus liturgical Democrats==
{{main| Ethnocultural politics in the United States}}
Religious lines were sharply drawn.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"&gt;Kleppner (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other [[pietists]] in the North were tightly linked to the Republicans. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Winning_of_the_Midwest_Social_and_Po.html?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches constituted over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decades, and national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry Republicans.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"/&gt;

===Labor union movement===
{{Further|Knights of Labor}}

The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement. From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican politics, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.

The [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, it is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).

Yet the organization came under scrutiny from some of the church hierarchy because of its similarity to other “secret societies” (e.g., the Masons) that the Church forbade its followers to join. Others believed that unions could promote better lives for workers. The matter was resolved in 1887 when Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] of Baltimore interceded in Rome against a proposed condemnation of the Knights.

This was the context in which Pope [[Leo XIII]] wrote an encyclical letter that articulated the teaching of the Church with a view to the “new things” of the modern world. In ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), Leo criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations. He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church’s defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html |title=Rerum novarum - ENCYCLICAL OF POPE LEO XIII ON CAPITAL AND LABOR |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rerum novarum'' provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the United States provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Judaism and politics in the United States}}

While earlier Jewish immigrants from Germany tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Eastern European Jews starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or left wing and became the political majority.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"&gt;[[Hasia Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000''  (2004), ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the latter came to America with experience in the [[socialism|socialist]], [[Jewish Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[communism|communist]] movements as well as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Labor Bund]], emanating from Eastern Europe.  Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century [[American labor movement]] and helped to found unions that played a major role in left wing politics and, after 1936, in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"/&gt; For most of the 20th century since 1936, the vast majority of Jews in the United States have been aligned with the Democratic Party. Towards the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century, Republicans have launched initiatives to woo American Jews away from the Democratic Party.

Over the past century, Jews in Europe and the Americas have traditionally tended towards the [[left-wing politics|political left]], and played key roles in the birth of the [[labor movement]] as well as [[socialism]].  While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]].

There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community.  Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), have an elected leadership.  No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitism]] and [[Israel]]i policies. In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular UJC, formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], [[Zionist Organization of America]], [[Americans for a Safe Israel]], [[B'nai B'rith]] and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues. [[J Street]] was set up in 2008 to advocate for American diplomatic leadership to achieve a two-state solution and a broader regional, comprehensive peace. [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] caters for Jewish students in universities.

==Islam==
Muslim political organizations lobby on behalf of various Muslim political interests.

* The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) is the United States largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, originally established to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America. CAIR portrays itself as the voice of mainstream, moderate Islam on Capitol Hill and in political arenas throughout the United States. It has condemned acts of terrorism—while naming no one in particular—and has been working in collaboration with the White House on "issues of safety and foreign policy".&lt;ref name ="Multi1"&gt;[http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr159.pdf The Diversity of Muslims in the United States - Views as Americans] - [[United States Institute of Peace]].

* The [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]] (MPAC) is an American Muslim public service and policy organization headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and with offices in [[Washington, D.C.]] MPAC was founded in 1988. The mission of MPAC "encompasses promoting an American Muslim identity, fostering an effective grassroots organization, and training a future generation of men and women to share our vision. MPAC also works to promote an accurate portrayal of Islam and Muslims in mass media and popular culture, educating the American public (both Muslim and non-Muslim) about Islam, building alliances with diverse communities and cultivating relationships with opinion- and decision-makers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpac.org Muslim Public Affairs Council Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Islamic Congress]] is a small but growing moderate Muslim organization that promotes [[religious pluralism]]. Their official Statement of Principles states that "Muslims have been profoundly influenced by their encounter with America. American Muslims are a minority group, largely comprising immigrants and children of immigrants, who have prospered in America's climate of religious tolerance and civil rights. The lessons of our unprecedented experience of acceptance and success must be carefully considered by our community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicongress.org/principles.htm The American Islamic Congress Statement Of Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Free Muslims Coalition]] was created to eliminate broad base support for Islamic extremism and terrorism and to strengthen secular democratic institutions in the Middle East and the Muslim World by supporting Islamic reformation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemuslims.org/ Free Muslims Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RETMAN''' is a comics’ character, associated to [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). Through it, REBT tries more efficiently address children, adolescents and the general public. This form of therapy approaches the treatment of [[emotional disorders]] and the promotion of mental health by modifying maladaptive/irrational behaviors and cognitions (thoughts).

== History and evolution ==
The first RETMAN concept was thought up at the Albert Ellis Institute, US, in the 80s (Calvin Merrifield and Rebecca Merriefield: Call Me Retman and Have a Ball, 1979) inspired by the name Rational Emotive Therapy (that is how this form of [[cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy]] was referred to then). The prototype for the superhero was [[Albert Ellis]] himself. As “RET-Man”, Ellis is arrested by the police but not before helping a depressed jilted lover give up his thoughts of suicide in favor of more rational thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebt.org/professionals/prof_articles/nardiwebarticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, because of the high production costs at the time, the project was abandoned after the publication of a comic.

=== Present ===
The concept was resumed in 2008, with the approval of the Albert Ellis Institute by a team of Romanian psychologists and graphic designers led by Prof. Daniel David, with a modern technology. For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see "Meet RETMAN" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychotherapy.ro/content/view/143/122/&lt;/ref&gt;). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=12 therapeutic comics]; (2) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=13 therapeutic stories]; (3) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=14 therapeutic cartoons]; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retman.ro/?page_id=15 RoboRETMAN ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, [[Cluj-Napoca]], the “PsyTech” University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicalpsychology.ro/en/innovations/3/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used on the REThink Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rethink.info.ro/ REThink Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.

== Concept ==
The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by “Aaron T.Beck” professor [[Daniel David]]. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and [[Babes-Bolyai University]]. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character [[Superman]] as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)
The stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: “...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced “Retmagic” (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn’t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...”
The stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.

'''The Royal Gurkha Rifles''' ('''RGR''') is a [[rifle regiment]] of the [[British Army]], forming part of the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]. Unlike other regiments in the [[British Army]], RGR soldiers are recruited from [[Nepal]], which is neither a dependent territory of the [[United Kingdom]] nor a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The regiment's motto is ''Better to die than to be a coward''.

==History==
The regiment was formed as the sole [[Gurkha]] [[infantry|infantry regiment]] of the British Army following the consolidation of the four separate Gurkha regiments in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurkhabde.com/brigade-of-gurkhas/|title=Serving Brigade of Gurkhas|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]
* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]

The amalgamations took place as follows:
* 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by the consolidation of the 1st Bn, '''2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles''' and 1st Bn, '''6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles'''.
* 2nd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by renaming the 1st Bn, '''7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles'''.
* 3rd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by renaming the 1st Bn, '''10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles'''.

The 3rd Battalion was consolidated with the 2nd Battalion in 1996 as part of run down of British forces in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgrra.com/digitalPubs/nepal/files/assets/basic-html/page4.html|title=Regimental History|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gurkhas in general and the direct predecessors of the Royal Gurkha Rifles in particular are considered  to be among the finest infantrymen in the world, as is evidenced by the high regard they are held in for both their fighting skill, and their smartness of turnout on parade.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gurkhas'', Byron Farwell, W.W. Norton, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, Lieutenant-Colonel Bijaykumar Rawat became the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, the first Nepalese to become a battalion commander in the RGR. He oversaw the departure of the battalion from [[Hong Kong]] just before that city's transfer to [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] control, and the battalion's relocation to [[Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Church Crookham]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayo-gorkhali.org/index.php/timeline/last-days-of-the-raj/1950s-new-ideas|title=New Ideas: Gurkha Signals, Engineers &amp; ‘British’ Officers|accessdate=26 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234656/http://www.ayo-gorkhali.org/index.php/timeline/last-days-of-the-raj/1950s-new-ideas|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice during its most recent Brunei posting the 2nd Battalion was deployed as the '''Afghanistan Roulement Infantry Battalion''', while the 1st Battalion deployed as part of 52 Infantry Brigade in late 2007. During this tour, [[Cornet (rank)|Cornet]] Harry Wales ([[Prince Harry]]) was attached for a period to the 1st Battalion as a [[Forward Air Controller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1082172/Prince-Harry-honorary-Gurkha-fearsome-warriors-served-Afghanistan.html|title=Prince Harry made honorary Gurkha by fearsome warriors he served with in Afghanistan|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Army 2020, the regiment was intended to provide two light role battalions, rotating between Brunei and the UK, with their higher unit as 11th Infantry Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Army2020_Report.pdf|title=Army 2020 Report|accessdate=26 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610215557/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Army2020_Report.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2015, the 2nd Battalion, then based in the UK, was reassigned to form part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, in the air assault infantry role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/new-role-for-gurkhas-in-38135/|title=Gurkhas from 2 Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles based at Sir John Moore Barracks in Folkestone join army's 16 Air Assault Brigade based in Colchester|work=Kent Online|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the UK Government announced that it intended to recruit more than 800 new posts to the Brigade of Gurkhas. Approximately 300 of these are planned for the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which will see the formation of a new battalion planned for the [[Infantry_of_the_British_Army#Operations|specialist infantry role]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The first battalion (1 RGR) is based at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp|Shorncliffe]], near [[Folkestone]] in [[Kent]] as part of [[16 Air Assault Brigade]], and is available for deployment to most areas in [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/new-role-for-gurkhas-in-38135/|title=Gurkhas from 2 Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles based at Sir John Moore Barracks in Folkestone join army's 16 Air Assault Brigade based in Colchester|publisher=Kent on line|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second battalion (2 RGR) is based at the [[British Military Garrison Brunei|British garrison]] in [[Brunei]] as part of Britain's commitment to maintaining a military presence in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oD5fZGwiX8|title=Royal Gurkha Rifles return home|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third battalion (3 RGR) is being raised as of August 2018, and will become the 3rd battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles.  The battalion will also be the first battalion in the Gurkhas to accept women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/corps-regiments-and-units/infantry/royal-gurkha-rifles/|title=Royal Gurkha Rifles|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A post on the Gurkha Brigade website in August 2016 noted that the RGR will grow in personnel size in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurkhabde.com/did-you-transfer-out-of-the-brigade-of-gurkhas/|title=Did you transfer out of the Brigade of Gurkhas? |publisher=Gurkha Brigade|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training companies===
In addition to the two operation battalions, two further units are cap badged as Royal Gurkha Rifles:

*Gurkha Company (Sittang)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurkhabde.com/category/sittang/|title=Sittang|publisher=Gurkha Brigade Association|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gurkha Wing (Mandalay)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurkhabde.com/category/mandalay/|title=Mandalay|publisher=Gurkha Brigade Association|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two are formed as operational training units at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and the [[Infantry Battle School]], to provide [[Opposing force|opposing forces]] for realistic battle simulation.

===Gurkha clerks===
Prior to 2011, administrative support for the entire Brigade of Gurkhas was provided by specially trained personnel called '''Gurkha clerks''', who wore the cap badge of the Royal Gurkha Rifles. In June 2011, the Gurkha clerks were amalgamated into a single [[Company (military unit)|company]] sized unit called the '''Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support Company''' (GSPS), which was incorporated as part of the [[Adjutant General's Corps]]. As with the other Gurkha support units ([[Queen's Gurkha Engineers]], [[Queen's Gurkha Signals]], [[Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment]]), the GSPS received its own cap badge based on the badge of its parent corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurkhabde.com/gurkha-staff-and-personnel-support/ |title=Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Brigade of Gurkhas Association |publisher= |access-date=25 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable soldiers==
[[Corporal]] [[Dip Prasad Pun]] of the 1st battalion (1 RGR) was awarded the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross]] for an act of bravery during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] in 2010. He alone defended his outpost against a force of up to 12 [[Taliban|Taliban fighters]]. He fired more than 400 rounds, 17 grenades, and one mine. He resorted to fighting with his machine gun tripod after his ammunition had run out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-252398009.html "The Outstanding Examples Of A Generation - The OP Honours Recipients"].

The '''Social Democratic Party in the GDR''' ({{lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei in der DDR}}) was a reconstituted Social Democratic Party existing during the last phase of the [[East Germany|East German state]]. Slightly less than a year after its creation it merged with the West German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

==History==
===Foundation===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0215-307, Markus Meckel.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Markus Meckel]]
What became East Germany was traditionally the heartland for the SPD in united Germany.  In 1946, the Soviet occupation authorities forced the eastern branch of the SPD to merge with the eastern branch of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED).  Within a short time, however, the few independent-minded members from the SPD side of the merger had been pushed out, and the SED became a full-fledged Communist party–essentially the KPD under a new name.

Early in 1989, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theology|theologians]] [[Markus Meckel]] and Martin Gutzeit took the initiative to revive a Social Democratic Party in the GDR. The two made organisational preparations and in April 1989 produced the first draft of the foundation appeal. In August, the appeal was presented at the ''Golgathagemeinde'' parish in Berlin. The appeal was signed by Meckel, Gutzeit, director and human rights advocate [[Ibrahim Böhme]] and theologian Arndt Noack.

Calling for the foundation of a political party outside of the system of the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] was a direct challenge to the political system of the GDR and especially to the SED, whose basis was undermined by the mere existence of a Social Democratic Party. The SED based its claim to power on being the sole representative of the [[working class]].

On 7 October 1989, forty or fifty people, mostly from Berlin and the southern parts of the country, assembled at the vicarage of Schwante, a town near [[Berlin]], and founded the '''Social Democratic Party in the GDR'''. The party chose the abbreviation '''SDP''' to avoid associations with the SPD that had merged into the SED, and also to brand itself as independent of the West German SPD. Stephan Hilsberg, a programmer, was elected as the first party spokesman, while Ibrahim Böhme became manager.

===In opposition===

Between October and December, local groups of the SDP were formed in different towns. From 7 December 1989, two representatives of the party participated in the ''Round Table'' talks between Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]], who had become the de facto leader of East Germany after the SED surrendered its monopoly of power a week earlier, and various opposition groups. The talks resulted in representatives of the opposition groups joining Modrow's cabinet as [[minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]] until free elections to the [[People's Chamber]] could be held. On 29 January, [[Walter Romberg]] became the first Social Democrat appointed to the cabinet.

On 13 January 1990, the party's first ''Conference of Delegates'' assembled in Berlin and decided to change the short form of the party name to '''SPD''', to conform with (and profit from association with) the West German SPD. At the same time, party organisation was created at the level of districts and regions.

Elections were scheduled for 18 March. Three weeks before that date, the SPD held its first party congress from 22 to 25 February 1990 in [[Leipzig]]. The congress decided on a basic manifesto and a statute of the party and also elected an executive board, with Böhme serving as party chairman and Meckel as one of his deputies.

The election yielded disappointing results for the Social Democrats. Instead of gaining an absolute majority, as they had expected, they won 21.9% of the vote, resulting in 88 seats and second place. The party fared best in the [[Administrative divisions of the German Democratic Republic|districts]] of Berlin (34.9%), Potsdam (34.4%) and Frankfurt (Oder) (31.9%), and by far worst in the district of Dresden (9.7%). When the new parliament constituted itself, Social Democrat [[Reinhard Höppner]] was elected vice-president of the People's Chamber.

===In government===

After internal debates the party members agreed to coalition talks with the winner of the election, the centre-right ''[[Alliance for Germany]]'', consisting of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]], the [[German Social Union (East Germany)|DSU]] and [[Democratic Awakening]], as well as with the ''[[Alliance of Free Democrats]]'', an alliance of liberal parties. On 12 April, [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the CDU formed a [[grand coalition]] cabinet including six Social Democrats, among them Markus Meckel (foreign affairs), [[Regine Hildebrandt]] (social issues) and Walter Romberg (finance). The SPD initially supported de Maizière's policy of speedy reunification with West Germany, but left the cabinet on 20 August.

[[File:Wolfgang Thierse.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Wolfgang Thierse]]
Ibrahim Böhme was slated to have been a senior minister in the government.  However, during the coalition talks he had been unmasked as a longtime [[Stasi]] informer by the West German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. Though Böhme failed to acknowledge this, he agreed to suspend his party functions (he was later expelled from the party in 1992). On 8 April 1990, Meckel was chosen as the interim chairman, until an extraordinary meeting in [[Halle (Saale)]] on 9 June 1990 elected [[Wolfgang Thierse]] as the new party chairman. At the same time, [[Willy Brandt]], former Chancellor of West Germany and honorary chairman of the West German SPD, was elected as honorary chairman of the East German SPD as well.

===Reunification===

With [[German reunification]] approaching on 3 October 1990, the East German SPD held a final party congress on 26 September 1990, and decided to merge with the West German SPD. The following day, Wolfgang Thierse joined the unified party's executive board and was also appointed deputy chairman. He resigned from the latter position in 2005 but remained a member of the party executive until 2009.

'''''The New World Order''''' is a book written by [[H. G. Wells]], originally published in January 1940. Wells expressed the idea that a '[[New world order (politics)|new world order]]' should be formed to unite the nations of the world in order to bring peace and end war.
''The New World Order'' also advocates a legal system that would protect

      <comment>The phrasing "'ultra-left' is used to label the CP's ultra-leftism as..." rang as using a term to define term. And it just didn't fit with "label." You pejoratively "label" y as x not x as x. The latter's just identifying.</comment>

The term '''ultra-leftism''' has two overlapping uses. One usage{{By whom?|date=April 2018}} ("historical ultra-left" below) is as a generally [[pejorative]] term for certain types of positions on the far-left that are extreme or intransigent. The other usage{{By whom|date=April 2018}} refers to a particular current of [[Marxist]] [[communism]], in which the Communist International repudiated [[social democratic]] parties (and all other progressive groupings outside of the CP).{{cn|date=April 2018}} Pejoratively, ''ultra-left'' is used to label the CP's radical leftist politics as a strategy of pursuing positions without taking notice of the current situation or of the consequences that would result from following a proposed course. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

Ultra-leftism within and outside the Communist International was evident in periods when political groupings pursued [[council communism]] and [[left communism]]. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==The historical ultra-left==
The term ''ultra left'' is rarely used in English. Instead, people tend to speak broadly of [[left communism]] as a variant of traditional [[Marxism]]. The French equivalent, ''[[:fr:ultragauche|ultra-gauche]]'', has a stronger meaning in that language and is used to define a movement that still exists today: a branch of left communism developed by theorists such as [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Herman Gorter]], and [[Paul Mattick]], and continuing with more recent writers, such as [[Jacques Camatte]] and Gilles Dauvé. This standpoint includes two main traditions, a Dutch-German tradition including Rühle, Pannekoek, Gorter and Mattick, and an Italian tradition following Bordiga. These traditions came together in the 1960s French ultra-gauche.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-bring-out-your-dead Bring Out Your Dead]", ''Endnotes'' 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The political theorist Nicholas Thoburn refers to these traditions as the "actuality of... the historical ultra-left".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Thoburn "[http://www.upress.umn.edu/journal-division/journals/cultural-critique/volume-84/2519 Do not be afraid, join us, come back? On the "idea of communism" in our time]" ''Cultural Critique'' Number 84, Spring 2013, pp. 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term originated in the 1920s in the German and Dutch workers movements, originally referring to a Marxist group opposed to both [[Bolshevism]] and [[social democracy]], and with some affinities with anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bourrinet ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.6346&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The Dutch and German Communist Left (1900–68): 'Neither Lenin nor Trotsky nor Stalin!' – 'All Workers Must Think for Themselves!']'', BRILL, 8 Dec 2016, p. 8: "As for the term 'ultra-left', which is often equated with 'sectarianism', it can only define those currents which historically split from the KPD between 1925 and 1927. Left communism never appeared as a pure will to be 'as left as possible'."&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultra-left is defined particularly by its breed of anti-authoritarian Marxism, which generally involves an opposition to the [[State (polity)|state]] and to [[state socialism]], as well as to [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[wage labour]]. In opposition to Bolshevism, the ultra left generally places heavy emphasis upon the autonomy and self-organisation of the [[proletariat]]. As Dauvé put it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultra-left was born and grew in opposition to Social Democracy and [[Leninism]]—which had become [[Stalinism]]. Against them it affirmed the revolutionary spontaneity of the proletariat. The German communist left (in fact German-Dutch), and its derivatives, maintained that the only human solution lay in proletarians' own activity, without it being necessary to educate or to organize them [...] Inheriting the mantle of the ultra-left after the war, the magazine ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' appeared in France between 1949 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Dauvé]], ''[https://libcom.org/files/Gilles%20Dauv%C3%A9-%20The%20Story%20of%20Our%20Origins.pdf The Story of Our Origins]'', translation of Gilles Dauve "le roman de nos origines" ''La Banquise'' No. 2, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The ideas of the historical ultra-left were widely revived in the [[New Left]] of the 1960s, and particularly in the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] moment in [[libertarian socialist]] movements such as [[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]], the [[Situationist International]], and [[autonomism]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Ultra-leftism within the Marxist movement==
Used pejoratively, ''ultra-left'' is used to label positions that are adopted without taking notice of the current situation or of the consequences which would result from following a proposed course. The term is used to criticize leftist positions that, for example, are seen as overstating the tempo of events, propose initiatives that overestimate the current level of [[Militant (word)|militancy]], or which employ a highly militant{{buzzword-inline|date=April 2018}} tone in their propaganda.{{cn|date=April 2018}}{{buzzword-inline|date=April 2018}}
 
The mainstream Marxist critique of such a position began with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s ''[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'', which attacked{{buzzword-inline|date=April 2018}} those (such as [[Anton Pannekoek]] or [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]) in the nascent [[Communist International]], who refused{{buzzword-inline|date=April 2018}} to work with [[parliamentary]] or [[reformist]] [[socialist]]s. Lenin characterised the ultra-left as a politics of purity—the doctrinal "repetition of the 'truths' of pure communism".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, cited in Žižek ''The Idea of Communism'', p.37, see Nicholas Thoburn "[http://www.upress.umn.edu/journal-division/journals/cultural-critique/volume-84/2519 Do not be afraid, join us, come back? On the "idea of communism" in our time]" ''Cultural Critique'' Number 84, Spring 2013, pp. 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Leninists typically used the term against their rivals on the left: "the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]'s Betty Reid wrote in a 1969 pamphlet ''Ultra-Leftism in Britain'' that the CPGB made 'no exclusive claim to be the only force on the left', but dismissed the groups to the left of the CPGB as the 'ultra-left', with Reid outlining the ultra-left as groups that were Trotskyist, anarchist or [[syndicalist]] or those that 'support the line of the [[Communist Party of China]] during the Sino-Soviet Split' (pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8)".&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" in 
Smith Evan, Worley Matthew ''Against the grain: The British far left from 1956'', Oxford University Press, 1 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trotskyist]]s and others stated the Communist International was pursuing a strategy of unrealistic ultra-leftism during its [[Third Period]], which the Communist International later admitted when it turned to a [[United Front]] strategy in 1934–5.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. John Molyneux "[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/molyneux/1985/10/ultraleft.html What do we mean by ultra-leftism?]" (October 1985) in ''Socialist Worker Review'' 80, October 1985, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been popularised in the United States by the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] at the time of the Vietnam war, using the term to both describe opponents in the [[anti-war movement]] including [[Gerry Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Joseph|title=Marxism vs. Ultraleftism: The Record of Healy's Break with Trotskyism|isbn=0873486897|url=http://www.pathfinderpress.com/s.nl/sc.8/category.114/it.A/id.420/.f|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} Ultra-leftism is often associated with leftist [[sectarianism]], in which a socialist organisation might attempt to put its own short-term interests before the long-term interests of the working class and its allies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the state of [[Victoria, Australia]], designed to protect and promote human rights. 

It does so by enumerating a series of [[human rights]], largely developed from those in the [[International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]], along with a number of enforcement provisions. The Act came into full effect on 1 January 2008 and may operate in a similar way to the UK's [[Human Rights Act 1998]] or the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name="magnet"&gt;Joseph E. Magnet, [http://www.constitutional-law.net/chartersample.html ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', 8th ed., Part VI, Chapter 1], Juriliber, Edmonton (2001). URL accessed on 18 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Australia is the only democratic country in the world not have a Bill of Rights (or similar protections).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/news/2017/08/charter-rights-australia-more-urgent-ever|title=A charter of rights for Australia 'more urgent than ever'|last=|first=|date=2017-08-02|work=Law|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to go some way toward addressing this, in 2005 the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) undertook steps to implement the [[Human Rights Act 2004]] to formally protect ''de facto'' freedom, respect, equality and dignity in the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/australia-doesnt-have-a-constitutional-right-protecting-freedom-of-the-person-it-needs-one-80603|title=Australia doesn’t have a constitutional right protecting freedom of the person – it needs one|last1=Harris|first1=Bede|website=The Conversation|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Victorian Labor]] [[Government of Victoria|Government]], in 2005 under the [[Bracks Ministry]], engaged in community consultation for a Human Rights act similar to those implemented in the ACT and the UK's [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/vic-human-rights-consultation-committee|title=Vic Human Rights consultation committee|last=Australian Human Rights Commission|first=|date=2012-12-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attorney-General of Victoria]] [[Rob Hulls]] argued that a Bill of Rights would "strengthen our democracy and set out our rights in one accessible place."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/national/victoria-to-be-first-state-to-adopt-a-human-rights-charter/2007/12/07/1196813026916.html|title=Victoria to be first state to adopt a human rights charter - National|website=www.theage.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After community consultation, including input from the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], the act was introduced and debated in Parliament on 2 May 2008. The Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 received [[royal assent]] on 25 July 2006 and came into full effect on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs_Arch.nsf/5da7442d8f61e92bca256de50013d008/ca2570ce0018ac6dca257162001d4b2b!OpenDocument|title=Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel - Victorian Legislation Home Page|last=Counsel|first=Office of the Chief Parliamentary|website=www.legislation.vic.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitation and jurisdiction ==
As state-based legislation the Act does not provide protections outside of Victorian jurisdiction; any federal legislation takes precedence regardless of the infringement of any rights. The charter also affords Parliament the power to suspend or infringe rights in exceptional circumstances, such as when facing a serious security threat or a state of emergency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Courts do not have the authority to strike down impeding legislation, but are able to interpret statutory provisions in a way that is compatible with human rights.

The '''Wartime Broadcasting Service''' was a service of the [[BBC]] that was intended to broadcast in the  United Kingdom either after a nuclear attack or if conventional bombing destroyed regular BBC facilities in a [[conventional war]].

== Origins and history ==

The origins of the service lie in pre-[[World War II]] plans to disperse BBC staff to facilities such as [[Wood Norton, Worcestershire|Wood Norton]] to guarantee due functioning of the corporation if cities such as [[London Blitz|London]], [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast]], [[Cardiff Blitz|Cardiff]], [[Glasgow Blitz|Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] were attacked by the [[Luftwaffe]].

In the post-war era, plans were revised so that the Wartime Broadcasting Service would have coped with a nuclear strike by installing 54 low-powered transmitters and keeping (what remained of) the main transmitter network in reserve, in case [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bombers used them to home in on targets. Although vague, plans from the mid-1950s were to provide both a national and regional radio service 24 hours a day (mirroring peacetime BBC operations at the time) with the objective of providing "instruction, information and encouragement as far as practical by means of guidance, news and diversion to relieve stress and strain". "Diversion" was to be in the form of music and selected pre-recorded programmes.&lt;ref name="SubterraneaBritannica"&gt;Subterranea Britannica File 16&lt;/ref&gt; BBC executives drafted a schedule made up of music, drama, comedy, and religious programmes to be broadcast over a period of 100 days after a nuclear attack on the United Kingdom.

The BBC had studios and production equipment at many government nuclear bunkers such as the [[Central Government War Headquarters]] at [[Corsham]] and the [[Regional Seat of Government|Regional Seats of Government]].

By the end of the decade, existing transmitters had been fitted with emergency [[diesel generator]]s and fallout protection.

From the 1980s, the BBC planned to broadcast for only a few hours a day and for a few minutes each hour, the intention being to conserve the batteries in domestic radios. There was to be no entertainment content for this reason and so that official messages could get through. With the end of the Cold War, the BBC deactivated the studios and emergency transmitter networks in 1993 as surplus to requirements. Many of these studios have become exhibits in bunkers, like the [[Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker]], which have now been converted into museums.

===Post Cold War===

With the [[Cold War]] having ended, the BBC and [[British Telecom]] developed the National Attack Warning System in 2003. This system was able to warn by television, radio and telephone (the latter only in some areas) of an impending attack using existing infrastructure. The BBC was capable of doing so within ten minutes using their existing broadcasting procedures. By the time of the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom|2011 digital switchover]], this was becoming obsolete because television and radio have limited warning capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Attack Warning System|work=Civil Defence today|url=http://civildefence.co.uk/attack-warning.php|accessdate=7 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, there were suggestions that the warning message would be recorded by [[Jill Dando]], actress [[Joanna Lumley]] or [[Carol Vorderman]].

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/would-really-happen-britain-came-nuclear-attack/&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the [[Broadcasting Act 1980]], the government still has the legal right to take over editorial control of radio and television in the event of a [[national emergency]]. Also, the BBC agreement allows the government to ask the BBC to broadcast messages in an emergency:

"If it appears to any UK Government Minister that an emergency has arisen, that Minister may request that the BBC broadcast or otherwise distribute any announcement or other programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/about/how_we_govern/2016/agreement.pdf |title=An Agreement Between Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the British Broadcasting Corporation |publisher=BBC Trust |date=December 2016 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The decision to activate the service would have been taken at Cabinet level late in the crisis phase. On being given the order, the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] were to suspend normal programming, broadcast the frequencies for the Wartime Broadcasting Service and go off-air an hour later (with television used only to broadcast ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' [[public information film]]s and unavailable after an attack due to its susceptibility to [[electromagnetic pulse]]). At this point, one single national programme would have been broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] from ''Wood Norton''. This would have consisted of official government announcements and information interspersed with filler material, such as music, news and warnings. The [[four-minute warning]] itself was to have been injected from a special studio at [[Broadcasting House]] and been broadcast nationally on all television and radio stations when a coded signal from [[RAF High Wycombe]] was given. This studio would also have been used by government ministers to broadcast messages and announcements until the government left London late in the crisis phase (or during the precautionary period).

After an attack, there would also have been a regional service tailored to local needs located in regional seats of government. Regional controllers were to use these smaller BBC studios to give out local messages to communities and would have been manned by BBC staff. If conventional air attacks destroyed peacetime broadcasting facilities, the Wartime Broadcasting Service would also have been activated.

Regular drills and training exercises were held to give an air of realism, but many BBC staff saw them as pointless or declined to serve during a national emergency because they couldn't take their families with them. One anonymous insider said, "I can't blame them for deciding there were better ways to go than to sit in a bunker with a group of local radio engineers."&lt;ref name="BBCPABplans"&gt;BBC Post-attack broadcasting plans&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staffing the bunkers ===

Indeed, choosing staff was very difficult. In the early days of the Wartime Broadcasting Service, BBC staff were assigned to the bunkers. Later, they were invited, but some staff opted out because either  they were not allowed to take wives and children with them, saw them as pointless, or were sceptical as to whether it would work . They were not allowed to tell their families on grounds of national security. For instance, [[Huw Weldon]] "refused to take part in matters dealing with war time broadcasting".

The WTBS bunker at [[Wood Norton, Worcestershire|Wood Norton]] would be manned by ninety people, including the head of [[BBC Radio 4]], BBC engineers, twelve news editors, sub editors, announcers and what was ominously described as "two nominations from Religious Broadcasting". Regional Seats of Government would have similar arrangements, staffed by people from BBC local radio.

When staff were selected, they would be given a letter giving basic information. If war loomed closer, a second letter would be sent, telling them:

"You have been selected for emergency duty and you will be going to " (location would be given in the letter). It rather delicately told BBC staff: "The length of your stay cannot be foreseen, but it might be several weeks." Therefore, they were advised to take clothes, soap and towels enough to last a month, as well as books and "small recreational items".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzware.org/2016/07/24/the-bbcs-detailed-plans-for-nuclear-war-bbc-news/ |title=The BBC's detailed plans for nuclear war – BBC News |publisher=BuzzWare |date=24 July 2016 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although those selected were not given extra pay, they were paid a £250 advance on their wages.

== Programmes for broadcast ==
Initially, a post-attack statement (see below) was to be broadcast confirming a nuclear strike had hit the United Kingdom and warning of the dangers of [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]. It would have been broadcast every two hours on all radio frequencies set aside for the BBC for the first twelve hours after the attack.  The script was released by the BBC under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] on 3 October 2008.

Jim Black, a BBC executive, compiled a schedule consisting of classic BBC drama, comedy and religious programmes to maintain morale. These included ''[[Round The Horne]]'', ''[[I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue]]'', ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'' and the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Drama programmes included ''[[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|The Afternoon Play]]'' and ''[[Thirty-Minute Theatre]]''. From the 1980s until 1993, the entertainment content was dropped and only official announcements would have been broadcast in order to conserve energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News Magazine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34711497|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official post-attack statement ===

The following is the script of an official statement that would have been broadcast on the Wartime Broadcasting Service in the hours after an attack. It was recorded by [[Peter Donaldson]], chief [[continuity announcer]] for [[BBC Radio 4]] (the designated national broadcaster in a [[national emergency]]):&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;BBC Transcript to be used in the wake of a nuclear attack&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger. If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting. You should also refill all your containers for drinking water after the fires have been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very long.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Water must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that lavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for fourteen days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out. When the immediate danger has passed the sirens will sound a steady note. The "all clear" message will also be given on this wavelength. If you leave the fall-out room to go to the lavatory or replenish food or water supplies, do not remain outside the room for a minute longer than is necessary.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you may die. Stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out or you hear the "all clear" on the sirens.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the main points again:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Stay in your own homes, and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given stay in your fall-out room, until you are told it is safe to come out. The message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength. Make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Water must be rationed, and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. It must not be used for flushing lavatories. Ration your food supply: it may have to last for fourteen days or more.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We shall repeat this broadcast in two hours' time. Stay tuned to this wavelength, but switch your radios off now to save your batteries until we come on the air again. That is the end of this broadcast.}}
