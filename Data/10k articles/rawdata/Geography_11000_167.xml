The '''A647''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] that begins in [[Leeds]] and ends in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. The road is {{convert|17|mi}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/53.7945%C2%B0N+1.5683%C2%B0W/192+Highgate+Rd,+Queensbury,+Bradford+BD13/53.7283%C2%B0N+1.8597%C2%B0W/@53.7706343,-1.8280738,18674m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m31!4m30!1m18!2m2!1d-1.5683!2d53.7945!3m4!1m2!1d-1.6873921!2d53.8051418!3s0x487be18c8b92faa1:0x3802d672beca0691!3m4!1m2!1d-1.7281641!2d53.7922745!3s0x487be16c878e033d:0x875db0ed2488f144!3m4!1m2!1d-1.7835568!2d53.7817896!3s0x487be6c3b5ce59d7:0x80313cba3497306d!1m5!1m1!1s0x487be64decefddff:0xb6140062fa19a752!2m2!1d-1.8272224!2d53.7707993!1m3!2m2!1d-1.8597!2d53.7283!3e0?hl=en|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The road begins at the Armley Gyratory and goes via [[Armley]], by-passes [[Stanningley]] and [[Pudsey]], then onwards via [[Thornbury, West Yorkshire|Thornbury]] to the edge of [[Bradford]] city centre.

The road then becomes part of the Bradford's Inner Ring Road (''Croft Street'') heading through [[Great Horton]] and up to [[Queensbury, West Yorkshire|Queensbury]] ({{convert|1150|ft}} above sea level) before heading down hill via [[Boothtown]] to Halifax town centre.

==History==
In June 2016 the CS1 [[Bike freeway|Cycle Superhighway]] opened from Bradford to Leeds, for the most part following the corridor of the A647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cycle Superhighway|url=https://cyclecityconnect.co.uk/projects/cityconnect-cycle-superhighway/|publisher=City Connect|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However unlike similarly-named schemes in the Netherlands and London, this route relies on allocated lane space within the vehicle carriageway which has led to criticism over its effectiveness from cycling and transport consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan|title=Design of flagship £29m Leeds to Bradford cycle superhighway|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/design-of-flagship-29m-leeds-to-bradford-cycle-superhighway-will-set-cycling-back-1-7916928|accessdate=9 January 2018|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stanningley bypass===
The road is a stretch of [[dual carriageway]] on the western edge of [[Leeds]]. It was built in the 1970s to ease traffic congestion along Stanningley Road, forming part of the [[Leeds Outer Ring Road]]. Prior to this the A647 passed through the centre of Stanningley along the line of the present [[B6157 road|B6157]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A647|title=A647|publisher=The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts|accessdate=9 January 2018|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable for the fact that it had [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s first [[High Occupancy Vehicle Lane]]  (HOV lane).

{{for|the town of Malis in ancient Thessaly|Aea (Malis)}}
__NOTOC__
'''Aeaea''' or '''Eëa''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|iː|ə}} {{respell|ee|EE|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|iː|ə}} {{respell|ə|EE|ə}}; {{lang-grc|Αἰαία}}, ''Aiaíā'' {{IPA-el|aɪ.aí.aː|}}) was a  [[Greek mythology|mythological]] island said to be the home of the goddess-sorceress [[Circe]]. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Odysseus]] tells [[Alcinous]] that he stayed here for one year on his way home to [[Ithaca]]. He says that he could not resist the need to be on this island, not so much for Circe but so that he does not resist the pull. The modern Greek scholar [[Ioannis Kakridis]] insists that any attempt at realistic identification is vain, arguing that Homer vaguely located Aeaea somewhere in the eastern part of his world, perhaps near [[Colchis]], since Circe was the sister of [[Aeëtes]], king of Colchis, and because their paternal aunt the goddess [[Eos]] had her palace there.

The somewhat inconsistent [[geography of the Odyssey|geography of Homer's ''Odyssey'']] is often considered more mythic than literal, but the geography of the Alexandrian scholar and poet [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] is more specific. In his epic ''[[Argonautica]]'', he locates the island somewhere south of ''Aethalia'' ([[Elba]]), within view of the ''Tyrrhenian'' shore (western coast of Italy).&lt;ref&gt;William H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), 4.654–661&lt;/ref&gt; In the same poem, Aeëtes remarks on the great distance between Colchis and Aeaea in these terms:
{{Quote|I noted it once after taking a ride in my father [[Helius]]' chariot, when he was taking my sister Circe to the western land and we came to the coast of the Tyrrhenian mainland, where she dwells to this day, very far from the Colchian land{{spaced ndash}}''Argonautica'' 3.309–313&lt;ref&gt;translation by W. H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), p.241&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aeaea was later identified by classical Roman writers with [[Mount Circeo]] on Cape Circeo (Cape Circaeum) on the western coast of [[Italy]]&amp;mdash;about 100 kilometers south of [[Rome]]&amp;mdash;which may have looked like an island due to the marshes and sea surrounding its base but which is a small [[peninsula]]. It was already a peninsula according to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. However, it may have been still an island in the days of Homer, with a long "[[wikt:Lido|lido]]" or sandy peninsula that gradually became attached to the mainland, in a common geological process. Archeologists have identified one cave or grotto on the cape as "Grotta della Maga Circe", the cave of Circe. A second was found on the nearby Island of [[Ponza]]. It is believed that Circe had her summer home on Mount Circe and her winter home on Ponza, which may possibly be the island of Aeaea.

Before leaving Aeaea, Odysseus was given instructions by Circe about how to cross the [[ocean]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer's Odyssey [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=B827C3204A35EB73B18F02A407A340A6?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D503 10.503]&lt;/ref&gt; and assisted by [[North Wind]] to reach the [[Greek underworld|underworld]]:

{{quote|text=When your ship has traversed the stream of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore of Persephone's country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. (''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.505, tr. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]])}}

==Other hypothetical locations==

[[Robert Graves]] (''The Greek Myths'') identifies, as Aeaea, the island of [[Lošinj]], near the [[Istria|Istrian peninsula]] in the north [[Adriatic Sea]].

[[Tim Severin]] (''The Ulysses Voyage'') identifies, as Aeaea, the island of [[Paxi|Paxos]] in the [[Ionian Sea]] near the Greek coast. The island is on the furthest west on a boundary between the sea and the river of Okeanos, which is said to encircle the earth.

Gaedl Lomen (''The Sea in the Greek Imagination'') identifies, as Aeaea the island of [[Cyprus]], in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].

==Aeaea in literature==

In [[Richard Aldington]]'s novel ''All Men are Enemies'' (1933), Aeaea is the island, "twelve hours from [[Naples]]" (obviously mythical), where his heroes meet, and love between them flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753877,00.html | work=Time | title=Books: Softer Answers | date=1933-07-31 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Banville]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Ghosts (1993 novel)|Ghosts]]'' has a boating party shipwrecked on an unnamed island; one character, Sophie, speculates that it is Aeaea; another says, "Yes...yes, Aeaea: you will feel at home, no doubt", a reference to Sophie's Circean nature.&lt;ref&gt;Banville, John. ''Ghosts'', page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aeaean" was an epithet of [[Circe]] and her niece [[Medea]] ({{lang|grc|Αἰαίη}}), who were the sister and daughter of [[Aeëtes]], the ruler of Aea ({{lang|grc|Αἶα}}) in [[Colchis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], iii. 1136, iv. 559&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' ix. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 386&lt;/ref&gt;  Circe's son [[Telegonus]] is likewise given this epithet.&lt;ref&gt;''quid petis Aeaei moenia Telegoni?'', [[Propertius]] 2.32.4&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also a name of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], who was believed to have inhabited a small island of the name of Aeaea in the straits between Italy and Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Pomp. Mela, ii. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Propert. iii. 10." 81&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">'''Akilineq''' is an [[Inuit language]] toponym meaning ''the opposite country'', which has variously been theorized to be a mythical place, an area in northeastern North America, or possibly even Europe.

One theory notes that the term was used in West Greenland to refer to the territories across [[Davis Strait]], such as the [[Labrador Peninsula]] and [[Baffin Island]].&lt;ref name="Forbes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack D. Forbes|title=The American Discovery of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd8yZn7MfSQC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=24 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03152-6|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renee Fosset notes that [[Gustav Frederik Holm|Gustav Holm]] of the 1880s Danish polar expedition recorded east Greenlanders as describing Akilineq as a land far to the east, which by evidence Holm took to refer to Iceland.&lt;ref name="Fossett2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Renee Fossett|title=In Order to Live Untroubled: Inuit of the Central Arctic 1550 To 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7cac_mXGgC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-328-8|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used to refer to one or several trading sites where the Inuit and neighbouring peoples would meet, by the Akilineq Hills at the mouth of the [[Thelon River]],&lt;ref name="Nuttall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Nuttall|title=Encyclopedia of the Arctic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcucDSk4w3YC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-57958-436-8|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the north shores of [[Aberdeen Lake (Nunavut)|Lake Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name="Walls2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1718">'''Alypius of Antioch''' was a [[geographer]] and a [[vicarius]] of [[Roman Britain]], probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced [[Flavius Martinus]] after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is [[Ammianus]] XXIII 1, 3.

==Life==
He came from [[Antioch]] and served under [[Constantius II]] and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]]. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named [[Carausius II]].

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as part of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s systematic attempt to reverse the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]] by restoring [[Paganism|pagan]] and, in this case, [[Judaism|Jewish]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus#Work|Res Gestae]]'', XXIII.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to [[Rome]], the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alypius (geographer)|display=Alypius|volume=1|page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|,_|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}}) is [[Earth]]'s largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. It shares the continental landmass of [[Eurasia]] with the continent of [[Europe]] and the continental landmass of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. Asia covers an area of {{convert|44,579,000|km2|sqmi}}, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the [[human population]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World at Six Billion |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |publisher=UN Population Division |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042434/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220025/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf Table 2]&lt;/ref&gt; was the site of many of the [[first civilization]]s. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people ({{as of|2018|09}}) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationof.net/asia/|title=Population of Asia. 2018 demographics: density, ratios, growth rate, clock, rate of men to women.|website=www.populationof.net|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and [[cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from Africa; and to the east of the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, separating it from Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0792275282}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the [[Middle East]], temperate areas in the east and the &lt;!-- extremely --&gt; continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in [[Siberia]].

{{details|topic=Asian borders|Geography of Asia#Boundary|Boundaries between continents|List of transcontinental countries#Asia and Europe|Copenhagen criteria}}

===Asia–Africa boundary===
The boundary between Asia and Africa is the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the [[Suez Canal]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This makes Egypt a [[transcontinental country]], with the [[Sinai peninsula]] in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.

===Asia–Europe boundary===
[[File:Palazzo_Ferreria_statue.jpeg|thumb|right|Statue representing Asia at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |title=Geography in the News: Eurasia's Boundaries |author=Neal Lineback |publisher=National Geographic |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508224947/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |archivedate=8 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when [[Peter the Great]], king of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], defeating rival claims of [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of [[Siberia]], synthesized a new [[Russian Empire]] extending to the [[Ural Mountains]] and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The [[Maluku Islands]] in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with [[New Guinea]], to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing definition===
[[File:Afro-Eurasia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|[[Afro-Eurasia]] shown in green]]
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the [[Ancient Greeks]], being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Herodotus]] a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia |url=http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d054800 |work=AccessScience |publisher=McGraw-Hill |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archivedate=27 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127141127/http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Faccessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D054800 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sir [[Barry Cunliffe]], the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny |first=Benjamin |last=Schwartz |journal=The Atlantic |date=December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930211221/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |archivedate=30 September 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass – [[Afro-Eurasia]] (except for the Suez Canal) – and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Ptolemy's Asia]]
The idea of a place called "Asia" was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]],&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name. The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, "Asia". Whether "Asia" in other languages comes from Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Asia – Origin and meaning of Asia by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525113914/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[metonymy|metonymical]] change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as [[Skandinavia]] (from [[Scania]]).

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet ''lawiaiai'', "captives", associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia". This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)aṣû(m)'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]]
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey). There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |title=Ἀσία |author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |author3=Henry Stuart Jones |author4=Roderick McKenzie |encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon |year=2007 |location=Medford |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |origyear=1940 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042823/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |archivedate=27 April 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully,&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Articles 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], "[[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]" (''Ἀσία'') or "Asie" (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a "[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |title=Asie |work=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters |publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art |date=2000–2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604045105/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |archivedate=4 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology". For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping".&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 364ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning "Asian");&lt;ref&gt;Μ95, Π717.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as {{lang|grc|ασιος}}.&lt;ref&gt;Β461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]]'s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during [[Early Muslim conquests|its conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho. "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |title=History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605000815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |archivedate=5 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=Sailendra Nath |title=An Advanced History of Modern India |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011162115/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |archivedate=11 October 2017  |isbn=978-0230328853 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Asia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2006 |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141016/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |archivedate=18 November 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them (Russia, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Climate change===

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, Pakistan and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173957/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf |date=26 February 2014 }}, [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, [[Taiwan]], South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads.

East Asia had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161015/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present [[life expectancy]] is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and Singapore (27). [[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding [[irreligion]]), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] for example, as presented to Jews in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the narrative of [[Noah]]—and later to Christians in the [[Old Testament]], and to [[Islam|Muslims]] in the [[Quran]]—is earliest found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the [[Enûma Eliš]] and ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] similarly tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] also tells of a [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

====Abrahamic====
The [[Abrahamic religions]] including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in West Asia.

Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in [[Israel]], the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] homeland and historical birthplace of the [[Jews|Hebrew nation]]: which today consists both of those [[Jews|Israelites]] who remained in [[Mizrahi Jews|Asia/North Africa]] and those who returned from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Europe]], [[American Jews|North America]], and other regions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621102211/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |archivedate=21 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though various diaspora communities persist worldwide.

In the Philippines and [[East Timor]], Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In [[Armenia]], [[Cyprus]], Georgia and Asian Russia, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the predominant religion. In the Middle East, such as in the [[Levant]], [[Syriac Christianity]] ([[Church of the East]]) and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] are prevalent minority denominations, which are both [[Eastern Christian]] sects mainly adhered to [[Assyrian people]] or Syriac Christians. [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. 2008, p. 285. {{ISBN|978-0802824172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, which originated in the [[Hejaz]] located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia/|title=Region: Asia-Pacific|date=27 January 2011|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010061404/http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-asia/|archivedate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), [[Bangladesh]], Iran and [[Turkey]]. [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Holiest sites in Islam#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest [[Shi'a]] country.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities. [[Lotus Temple]] is a big Baha'i Temple in India.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

{{as of|2012}}, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.

[[Sikhism]] is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia.
[[Confucianism]] is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations.
Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taoism is easily syncretized with [[Mahayana Buddhism]] for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

The [[polymath]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], a [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] poet, dramatist, and writer from [[Santiniketan]], now in [[West Bengal]], India, became in 1913 the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]].

Some may consider the American writer, [[Pearl S.

He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, [[Kailash Satyarthi]] from India and [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education".

'''Caio da Silva Prado Júnior''' (February 11, 1907 – November 23, 1990) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] historian, geographer, writer and politician.

His works inaugurated a new historiographic tradition in Brazil, identified with [[Marxism]], which led to new interpretations of the Brazilian colonial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caio Prado Júnior|url = http://www.infoescola.com/biografias/caio-prado-junior/|website = InfoEscola|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Caio Prado graduated with a degree in [[law]] from Faculdade do Largo de São Francisco, [[São Paulo]] in 1928, where he would later become a [[Professor]] of Political Economy. He was politically active during the 30's and 40's, including during the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|1930 Revolution]]. In 1933, he published his first work - ''Evolução Política do Brasil'' (Political Evolution of Brazil) - an attempt to understand the country's political and social history. In 1934 he took part in the foundation of Brazilian Geographers Association.

After a trip to the Soviet Union, at the time under Stalin's dictatorship, he published ''URSS - um novo mundo'' (Soviet Union - a New World), which was banned by [[Getúlio Vargas]]' government's censorship. He then joined the [[Aliança Nacional Libertadora]] which he chaired in São Paulo.

In 1942 he published the classic ''Formação do Brasil Contemporâneo - Colônia'' (Formation of Contemporary Brazil - Colony, which should have been the first part of a work on Brazilian historic evolution. However, the following volumes were never written. In 1945 he was elected ''deputado estadual'' for the ''Brazilian Communist Party''. He published the newspaper ''A Platéia'' and, in 1943, with Arthur Neves and [[Monteiro Lobato]], he founded Editora Brasiliense (Brasiliense Publishing House), for which, later, he published ''Revista Brasiliense'', between 1956 and 1964. After 1964, he was persecuted by the military dictatorship.

In 1966 he was elected Intellectual of the Year by the União Brasileira de Escritores, following the publication of ''A revolução brasileira'' (Brazilian Revolution).

'''Cohors quarta Delmatarum''' ("4th Cohort of Dalmatae") was a [[Roman auxiliary]] infantry regiment raised in the 1st century AD and continuing to serve into the 2nd century.

== The Dalmatae ==
The cohort is named after the [[Dalmatae]], an [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]-speaking tribe that inhabited the [[Adriatic]] coastal mountain range of the eponymous [[Dalmatia]]. The ancient geographer [[Strabo]] describes these mountains as extremely rugged, and the Dalmatae as backward and warlike. He claims that they did not use money long after their neighbours adopted it and that they "made war on the Romans for a long time". He also criticises the Dalmatae, a nation of pastoralists, for turning fertile plains into sheep pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geographia'' VII.5&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the name of the tribe itself is believed to mean "shepherds", derived from the Illyrian word ''delme'' ("sheep").&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 304&lt;/ref&gt; The final time this people fought against Rome was in the [[Illyrian revolt]] of 6-9 AD. The revolt was started by Dalmatae auxiliary forces and soon spread all over [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]]. The resulting war was described by the Roman writer [[Suetonius]] as the most difficult faced by Rome since the [[Punic Wars]] two centuries earlier. But after the war, the Dalmatae became a loyal and important source of recruits for the Roman army.

== Origins and service history ==
According to Holder, a total of 12 ''cohortes Delmatarum'' appear to have been raised after the suppression of the Illyrian revolt in two series, of 7 and 5 respectively. All these units were in existence by the time of emperor [[Claudius]] (r. 41-54)&lt;ref name="Holder 1980 112"&gt;Holder (1980) 112&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 9 appear to have survived into the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 302-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment was probably raised by founder-emperor [[Augustus]] (r. 30BC-14AD) after 9 AD. It was certainly in existence by the time of [[Claudius]] (r. 41-54).&lt;ref name="Holder 1980 112"/&gt; Its early movements are unknown. Holder suggests that the regiment may have taken part in the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] (43) or the suppression of the revolt of [[Boudicca]] in 61.&lt;ref&gt;Holder (1982) 116&lt;/ref&gt; But this ignores the evidence of three 1st-century tombstones from the Rhine forts of [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] and [[Bingerbrück]] in [[Germania]], where it was clearly stationed. The regiment first appears in the datable epigraphic record in 103, in [[Britannia]]. It was still there in 126-30, the time of its last datable inscription, a building inscription at the Roman fort of [[Hardknot]] (Cumbria). The latter is incomplete, but is plausibly though not conclusively attributed to ''IV Delmatarum''. The regiment's disappearance from the epigraphic record in the early 2nd century has led Spaul to suggest that the regiment was merged with another to form the [[cohors I Pannoniorum et Delmatarum equitata c.R.]] attested in [[Germania Inferior]] in 127 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 307&lt;/ref&gt; But the record overall is too incomplete to support any firm conclusions.

== Known personnel ==
The names of 3 ''praefecti'' (regimental commanders) are attested.&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 308&lt;/ref&gt; Titus Iunius Severus was a Spaniard from [[Denia]]. A second man, whose middle name only, Pactumerius, has survived, left a votive stone at [[Madaurus|Madaura]] in [[Numidia]] (Mdaurusch, Algeria). The origin of the third, Lucius Aprius Liburnus, is revealed by his ''cognomen'' (third name): of the [[Liburni]] tribe, western neighbors of the Dalmatae. In addition, the names of 3 ''caligati'' (common soldiers) survive on the 1st-century tombstones from Bingen. All were Illyrians: 1 Dalmata, 1 Liburnus and 1 [[Daverzus]].

'''Courland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊər|l|ən|d}}; {{lang-lv|Kurzeme}}; {{lang-liv|Kurāmō}}; [[German language|German]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]]: ''Kurland''; {{lang-la|Curonia}}/{{lang|la|Couronia}}; {{lang-ru|Курляндия}}; {{lang-lt|Kuršas}}; {{lang-pl|Kurlandia}}), is one of the [[cultural regions of Latvia|historical and cultural regions]] in western [[Latvia]]. The largest city is [[Liepāja]], the third largest city in Latvia. The regions of [[Semigallia]] and [[Selonia]] are sometimes considered as part of Courland as they were formerly held by the same [[duchy of Courland|duke]].

== Geography and climate ==
[[Image:Latvian regions and latvians.png|thumb|right|350px|Historical regions of Latvia, together with Latvian cultural groups; Courland (''Kurzeme'') and [[Semigallia]] (''Zemgale'') in yellow]]
[[Image:Rundale Pilsrundale Eingangsportal.jpg|thumb|275px|Entrance to the [[Rundale Palace]], the seat of the Dukes of Courland]]
Situated in western [[Latvia]], Courland roughly corresponds to the former [[districts of Latvia|Latvian districts]] of [[Kuldiga District|Kuldīga]], [[Liepaja District|Liepāja]], [[Saldus District|Saldus]], [[Talsi District|Talsi]], [[Tukums District|Tukums]] and [[Ventspils District|Ventspils]].

When combined with Semigallia and Selonia, Courland's northeastern boundary is the river [[Daugava River|Daugava]], which separates it from the regions of [[Latgale]] and [[Vidzeme]]. To the north, Courland's coast lies along the [[Gulf of Riga]]. On the west it is bordered by the [[Baltic Sea]], and on the south by [[Lithuania]]. It lies between 55° 45′ and 57° 45′ [[Latitude|North]] and 21° and 27° [[Longitude|East]].

The area comprises 27,286&amp;nbsp;km² (10,535 sq.mi.), of which 262&amp;nbsp;km² (101 sq.mi.) is made up of lakes. The landscape generally has a low and undulating character, with flat and marshy coastlands. The interior features wooded dunes, covered with [[pine]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], and [[oak]], with swamps and lakes, and fertile patches between. Courland's elevation never rises more than 213&amp;nbsp;m (700&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

The [[Jelgava]] plain divides Courland into two parts, the western side, which is fertile and densely inhabited, except in the north, and the eastern side, less fertile and thinly inhabited.

Nearly one hundred rivers drain Courland, but only three of these rivers – the Daugava, the [[Lielupe]] and the [[Venta River|Venta]] – are navigable. They all flow northwestward and discharge into the [[Baltic Sea]].

Owing to its numerous lakes and marshes, Courland has a damp, often foggy, and changeable climate; its winters are severe.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In ancient times the [[Curonians]], a pagan tribe, inhabited Courland.  The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Brethren of the Sword]], a German [[Military order (society)|military order]], subdued the Curonians and converted them to [[Christianity]] in the first quarter of the 13th century. Thus in 1230 the Curonian king Lammekinus (Lamikis)  made peace directly with the papal legate. He accepted baptism, and became a vassal of the pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Courland|title=Courland - historical region, Europe|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1237 the area passed into the rule of the [[Teutonic Knights]] owing to the amalgamation of this order with that of the Brethren of the Sword.

=== Livonian Confederation ===
{{main|Livonian Confederation }}
The Livonian Confederation was a loosely organized confederation formed by the German-led [[Livonian Order]] and various bishoprics that encompassed much of present-day [[Estonia]] and Latvia.  It existed from 1228 to the 1560s, when it was dismembered during the [[Livonian Wars]].

=== Duchy of Courland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1561–1795 ===
[[Image:Duchy of Courland &amp; Semigallia 1740.svg|thumb|right|340px|The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] as it appeared in 1740]]
{{main|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Couronian colonization}}
The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a semi-independent [[duchy]] that existed from 1561 until 1795, encompassing the areas of Courland and Semigallia.  Although nominally a [[vassal]] state of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the dukes operated autonomously. In the 18th century Russia acquired great influence over the Duchy.

The Duchy was one of the smallest European nations to colonize overseas territories, establishing short-lived outposts on the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Tobago]] and [[Trinidad]] and at the mouth of the [[Gambia River]] in [[Africa]] on what was then known as [[Kunta Kinteh Island|James Island]].

In 1795, the last Duke, [[Peter von Biron]], ceded the Duchy to the [[Russian Empire]].

The former [[Bishopric of Courland]] was directly incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as the [[Piltene|Piltyń]] County of the [[Wenden Voivodeship|Wenden]] and later [[Inflanty Voivodeship]].

=== Courland as part of Russia ===
After annexation by the [[Russian Empire]], the territory of the former Duchy formed the [[Courland Governorate]].

From the time of the [[Northern Crusades]] in the early 13th century, most land was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders.  In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired labourers, occupying a low position in the social scale.

[[Agriculture]] was the chief occupation, with the principal crops being [[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[flax]], and [[potato]]es. The large estates conducted agriculture with skill and scientific knowledge. Fruit grew well. Excellent breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs were kept. [[Liepāja]] and [[Jelgava]] operated as the principal industrial centres, with [[ironwork]]s, agricultural machinery works, [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], glass and soap works. Flax [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] took place mostly as a domestic industry.  Iron and [[limestone]] were the chief minerals; a little [[amber]] was found on the coast. The only seaports were Liepāja, [[Ventspils]] and [[Palanga]], there being none on the Courland coast of the Gulf of Riga.

In 1870 the population was 619,154; in 1897 it was 674,437 (of whom 345,756 were women); in 1906 it was estimated at 714,200. Of the whole, 79% were [[Latvians]], 8.4% [[Baltic Germans]], about 8% [[Jews]],&lt;ref name=jewsofcourland&gt;Herman Rosenthal [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=831&amp;letter=C Courland] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1.4% [[Russians]], 1% [[Lithuanians]], 1% [[Poland|Poles]], and some [[Livonians]].

The chief towns of the ten districts were [[Jelgava]] (Mitau), Courland's capital (pop. 35,011 in 1897); [[Liepāja]] (Libau) (pop. 64,500 in 1897); [[Bauska]] (6,543); [[Jaunjelgava]] (Friedrichstadt) (5,223); [[Kuldīga]] (Goldingen) (9,733); [[Grobiņa]] (1,489); [[Aizpute]] (Hasenpoth) (3,338); [[Ilūkste]] (Illuxt) (2,340); [[Talsi]] (Talsen) (6,215); [[Tukums]] (Tuckum) (7542); and [[Ventspils]] (Windau) (7,132).

75% of the population belonged to the prevailing denomination, [[Lutheranism]]; the rest belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. There was a small but vigorous Jewish population.

=== Courland during and after World War I ===
[[File:OberOst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Public notice of the German ''[[Ober Ost]]'' region including Courland ''(Kurland)'' District in 1917]]
{{see also|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)}}
During [[World War I]], Courland formed part of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] theatre of operations that saw fighting primarily between forces of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire]]s.  Following Russia's [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Great Retreat]] of 1915, Courland came under control of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s ''[[Ober Ost]]'' commander in the person of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military hero.  (The Russian authorities of the [[Courland Governorate]] were exiled to [[Tartu]] never to return.)  With large territories coming under the ''Ober Ost'''s administration as a result of military successes on the Eastern Front, General [[Erich Ludendorff]] was charged with managing the large area now under its jurisdiction.  Courland District (which included parts of [[Semigallia]]) was made one of three districts of the region, which also came to be known as ''Ober Ost''.

* As Russian rule in the rest of what is now Latvia began collapsing at the end of World War I, [[Baltic Germans]] began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918, competing with [[Latvians|ethnic Latvians]]' moves toward independence.  With the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of 3 March 1918, Russia's new [[Soviet Russian Republic|Bolshevik government]] formally relinquished control of Courland to Germany.  The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by a Baltic German ''Landesrat'', who offered the crown of the duchy to German Kaiser Wilhelm II.  Wilhelm recognised the duchy as a German [[vassal]] that same month.  However, the duchy was absorbed on 22 September 1918 by the [[United Baltic Duchy]].  On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence and on 7 December 1918, the German military handed over authority to the pro-German [[Latvian Provisional Government]] headed by [[Kārlis Ulmanis]].  By January 1919, much of Courland had been overrun by the [[Bolsheviks]]' [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] but the provisional government with the aid of German forces pushed back and took back Courland by April.  Throughout the [[Latvian War of Independence]], much of Courland remained a German stronghold.  Latvia eventually signed a cease-fire with Germany on 15 July 1920, and the [[Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty|Treaty of Riga]] of 11 August ended the war.

=== Courland as part of interbellum Latvia ===
After World War I, Courland became one of five provinces of the newly formed nation of [[Latvia]].  These provinces corresponded to Latvia's four traditional regions plus Riga.  In 1935, Courland had an area of {{convert|5099|sqmi|order=flip}} and a population of 292,659 making it the least populous of the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;1935 census figures cited at [http://www.statoids.com/ulv.html Municipalities of Latvia] at Statoids.com. retrieved 10 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Army]] [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied]] Latvia in conformity with the terms of 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 17 June 1940.  On 5 August 1940, the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the region along with the rest of Latvia which was made a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the USSR]], the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]].

At the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer of 1941, the German Wehrmacht's [[Army Group North]] headed by [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]] overran Courland, along with the rest of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] littoral. In 1944 the [[Red Army]] lifted the [[Battle of Leningrad|siege of Leningrad]] and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].  However, some 200,000 [[Germany|German]] troops held out in Courland. With their backs to the [[Baltic Sea]], they remained trapped in what became known as the [[Courland Pocket]], blockaded by the Red Army and by the Red Baltic Fleet. [[Colonel-General]] [[Heinz Guderian]], the Chief of the [[German General Staff]], pleaded with  [[Adolf Hitler]] to allow evacuation of the troops in Courland by sea for use in the defense of Germany.   Hitler refused, and ordered the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Courland to continue the defence of the area. Hitler believed them necessary to protect Kriegsmarine submarine bases along the Baltic coast. On January 15, 1945, [[Army Group Courland]] (''Heeresgruppe Kurland'') formed under [[Colonel-General]] Dr. [[Lothar Rendulic]]. The blockade by elements of the [[Leningrad Front]] remained until May 8, 1945, when  Army Group Courland, then under its last commander, [[Colonel-General]] [[Carl Hilpert]], surrendered to Marshal [[Leonid Govorov]], the commander of the [[Leningrad Front]] (reinforced by elements of the [[2nd Baltic Front]]) on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group consisted of the remnants of some 31 divisions. After May 9, 1945, approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began to be moved to Soviet prison camps to the east. The majority of them never returned to Germany (Haupt, 1997).

Courland remained part of the Latvian SSR within the Soviet Union following World War II.  Courland was no longer an administrative unit under the Soviets but an early Liepāja Oblast, one of three [[oblasts of the Soviet Union|oblast]]s in Latvia, roughly corresponded to Courland.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Courland became part of independent Latvia once more and it remains so to this day.  Although Courland is not an administrative entity today, the [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Courland ''(Kurzeme)'' Planning Region]], with an area of {{convert|13596|km2}} and a population of 301,621 in 2008, includes much of the traditional region.  The remainder of Courland is part of the [[Planning regions of Latvia|planning region]]s of [[Riga Planning Region|Riga]] and [[Zemgale Planning Region|Semigallia ''(Zemgale)'']].

'''Emanuel Bowen''' (1694?–1767) was an English map engraver, who worked for [[George II of England]] and [[Louis XV of France]] as a geographer.

An 18th-century map and print seller, he worked in London from about 1714 producing some of the best and attractive maps of the century. A recurring feature of Bowen's work, evident even on the early road maps, was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical.

One of his earliest engraved works, ''[[Britannia Depicta]]'', published in 1720, contained over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of each of the counties of England and Wales. It followed on [[John Ogilby]]'s earlier work with updated style of historical and heraldic detail. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, and this resulted in a handier-sized book.

In spite of his royal appointments and apparent prosperity he died in poverty and his son, who carried on the business, was no more fortunate and died in a [[Clerkenwell]] workhouse in 1790.

He published "A Complete System of Geography,'' 1744-7; an 'English Atlas, with a new set of maps,' 1745(?); a 'Complete Atlas ... in sixty-eight Maps,' 1752; 'Atlas Minimus; or a new set of Pocket Maps,' 1758; and a series of separate maps of the English counties, of Germany, Asia Minor, and Persia, between 1736 and 1776.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Bowen, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Bowen (engraver)|Thomas Bowen]] was his son;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; [[Thomas Kitchin]] and [[Thomas Jefferys]] were his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37637|title=Kitchin, Thomas|first=Laurence|last=Worms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=14696|title=Jefferys, Thomas|first=Laurence|last=Worms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Complete map of the Southern Continent'' ==
[[File:Bowen- A Complete map of the Southern Continent.jpg|thumb|1744 Chart of ''Hollandia Nova – Terra Australis''.]]
[[File:Persian(IRAN) Empire 1747.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Map of Iran in Afsharid dynasty]] drawn by Emanuel Bowen in 1747]]

Bowen's map, ''A Complete Map of the Southern Continent survey'd by Capt. Abel Tasman &amp; depicted by order of the East India Company in Holland in the Stadt House at Amsterdam,'' was essentially a copy of the map [[Melchisédech Thévenot]] had published in ''Relations de divers Voyages curieux'' (Paris, 1663, v.1). Although Thévenot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of [[Joan Blaeu]] in his ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'' published in 1659 in the ''Kurfürsten Atlas (Atlas of the Great Elector)''.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection,'' Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p.32; this map is reproduced in Gunter Schilder, ''Australia Unveiled,'' Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, p.402; and in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore,'' Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp.67–84, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; The map of the world set into the floor of the great hall of the Amsterdam Town Hall was drawn from Blaeu's world map of 1648. Once Blaeu's map of the world appeared other mapmakers, such as Thévenot, copied his depiction of New Holland. ''Hollandia Nova'' in the ''Kurfürsten Atlas'' is shown as it appears in Blaeu's world map of 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Kees Zandvliet, "Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore,'' Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp.67–84, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have been Thévenot who introduced a differentiation between ''Hollandia Nova'' to the west and ''Terre Australe'' to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135° East of Greenwich, emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Cole, "No longer incognita" and Martin Woods, "'Terre Australe, east coast of New Holland'", National Library of Australia, ''Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, pp.182, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

A legend on Bowen's map emphasised the separation between ''Hollandia Nova'' and ''Terra Australis'' that had been introduced either inadvertently or intentionally by Thévenot when he placed the two names on either side of the latitude staff running down the 135° East of Greenwich meridian. Bowen's map legend identified ''Terra Australis'' as the land described by Quirós by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also requisite to observe that the Country discovered by Ferdinand de Quiros lies according to his description on the East Side of this Continent directly opposite to Carpentaria which if Attentively considered will add no small weight to the Credit of what he has written about that Country and which has been very rashly as well as very unjustly treated by some Critical Writers as a Fiction; Whereas it Appears from this Map of Actual Discoveries, that there is a Country where Ferdinand de Quiros says he found one: And if so why may not that Country be such a one as he describes? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another legend added by Bowen to the map called for discovery and settlement of ''Terra Australis'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to conceive a Country that promises fairer from its Situation than this of &lt;small&gt;TERRA AUSTRALIS&lt;/small&gt;, no longer incognita, as this Map demonstrates, but the Southern Continent Discovered. It lies precisely in the richest climates of the World....and therefore whoever perfectly discovers and settles it will become infalliably possessed of Territories as Rich, as fruitful, and as capable of Improvement, as any that have hitherto been found out, either in the East Indies or the West.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The territorial claim made by Britain when the colony of [[New South Wales]] was established in 1788 included all of Australia eastward of the meridian of 135° East dividing [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] from [[Terra Australis]], as shown on Bowen's map.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "Terra Australis, New Holland and New South Wales: the Treaty of Tordesillas and Australia", ''The Globe,'' no.47, 1998, pp.35–55, pp.48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gagauzia''' or '''Gagauz Yeri''' ({{lang-gag|Gagauz Yeri}} or {{lang|gag|Gagauziya}}; {{lang-ro|Găgăuzia}}; {{lang-ru|Гагаузия}}, ''Gagaúzija''), officially the  '''Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia''' ({{lang-gag|Avtonom Territorial Bölümlüü Gagauziya}}; {{lang-ro|Unitatea Teritorială Autonomă Găgăuzia}}; {{lang-ru|Автономное территориальное образование Гагаузия}}, {{transl|ru|Avtonomnoje territoriaľnoje obrazovanije Gagauzija}}), is an [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] of [[Moldova]]. Its name comes from the [[Gagauz people]]. ''Gagauz Yeri'' literally means "place of the Gagauz".

== History ==
According to some theories, the [[Gagauz people]] descend from the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] who settled in [[Dobruja]] following the Anatolian Seljuq [[Sultan]] [[Kaykaus II|Izzeddin Keykavus II]] (1236–1276). They may be descended from [[Pechenegs]], Uz (Oghuz) and [[Cumans|Cuman]] ([[Kipchaks|Kipchak]]) peoples.

More specifically, one clan of Oghuz Turks is known to have migrated to the Balkans during intertribal conflicts with other Turks. This Oghuz Turk clan converted from [[Islam]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] after settling in medieval [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]) and were called Gagauz Turks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A large group of the Gagauz later left Bulgaria and settled in southern [[Bessarabia]], along with a group of [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarians]].

According to other theories, Gagauz are descendants of [[Kutrigurs|Kutrigur]] Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Стойков, Руси. Селища и демографски облик в Североизточна България и Южна Добруджа, Известия на Варненското археологическо дружество, т. XV, 1964, с. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the official Gagauz museum, a plaque mentions that one of the two main theories is that they descend from the Bulgars.

===Russian Empire===
In 1812, Bessarabia, previously the eastern half of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] following the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)|Russo-Turkish War between 1806 and 1812]] (''see [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]]''). [[Nogais|Nogai]] tribes who inhabited several villages in south Bessarabia (or [[Budjak]]) were forced to leave. Between 1812 and 1846, the Russians relocated the Gagauz people from what is today eastern Bulgaria (which was then under the [[Ottoman Empire]]) to the orthodox Bessarabia, mainly in the settlements vacated by the Nogai tribes. They settled there together with [[Bessarabian Bulgarians]] in [[Avdarma]], Comrat, [[Congaz]], [[Tomai, Gagauzia|Tomai]], [[Cișmichioi]], and other former Nogai villages. Some Gagauz were also settled in the part of the Principality of Moldavia that did not come under Russian control in 1812. But, within several years, villagers moved to live with their own people in the compact area descendants inhabit in the 21st century in the south of Bessarabia.

With the exception of a five-day ''de facto'' independence in the winter of 1906, when a peasant uprising declared an autonomous ''Republic of Comrat'', ethnic Gagauzians have been ruled by other dominant groups: the Russian Empire (1812–1917), [[Romania]] (1918–1940 and 1941–1944), the Soviet Union (1940–1941 and 1944–1991), and Moldova (1917–1918 and 1991 to date).

===Soviet Union===
Gagauz nationalism remained an intellectual movement during the 1980s, but strengthened by the end of the decade, as the Soviet Union began to embrace democratic ideals. In 1988, activists from the local intelligentsia aligned with other ethnic minorities to create a movement known as the "Gagauz People". A year later, the "Gagauz People" held its first assembly; they passed a resolution demanding the creation of an [[autonomous territory]] in southern Moldova, with the city of Comrat as its capital.

The Gagauzian national movement intensified when Moldavian (Romanian) was accepted as the official language of the Republic of Moldova in August 1989, replacing Russian, the official language of the [[USSR]]. A part of the multiethnic population of southern Moldova was concerned about the change in official languages. They had a lack of confidence in the central government in [[Chișinău]]. The Gagauz were also worried about the implications for them if Moldova reunited with Romania, as seemed likely at the time. In August 1990, Comrat declared itself an autonomous republic, but the Moldovan government annulled the declaration as unconstitutional. At that time, [[Stepan Topal]] emerged as the leader of the Gagauz national movement.

===Independent Moldova===

[[File:Gagauzja.png|thumb|Schematic map of Gagauzia.]]

Support for the Soviet Union remained high in Gagauzia, with a [[referendum]] in March 1991 returning an almost unanimous vote in favour of remaining part of the USSR. Many Gagauz supported the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|Moscow coup attempt]] in August 1991, and Gagauzia declared itself an independent [[Gagauz Republic|republic]] on 19 August 1991.{{cn|date=November 2016}} In September [[Transnistria]] declared its independence, thus further straining relations with the government of Moldova. But, when the Moldovan parliament voted on independence on 27 August 1991, six of the 12 Gagauz deputies in the Moldovan parliament voted in favour, while the other six abstained. The Moldovan government began to pay more attention to [[minority rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In February 1994, President [[Mircea Snegur]] promised autonomy to the Gagauz, but opposed independence. He was also opposed to the suggestion that Moldova become a federal state made up of three republics: Moldova, Gagauzia, and Transnistria.

In 1994, the Parliament of Moldova awarded to "the people of Gagauzia" (through the adoption of the new Constitution of Moldova) the right of "external self-determination". On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova accepted the "Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia" (Gagauz: ''Gagauz Yeri''), resolving the dispute peacefully. This date is now a Gagauz holiday. Gagauzia is now a "national-territorial autonomous unit" with three official languages: Romanian, Gagauz, and Russian.

Three cities and 23 communes were included in the Autonomous Gagauz Territory: all localities with more than 50% ethnic Gagauz in population, and those localities with between 40% and 50% Gagauz which expressed their desire by referendum to be included to determine Gagauzia's borders. In 1995, [[Gheorghe Tabunșcic]] was elected to serve as the [[Governor of Gagauzia|Governor]] (Romanian: ''Guvernator'', Gagauz: ''Başkan'') of Gagauzia for a four-year term, as were the deputies of the local parliament, "The People's Assembly" (Gagauz: "Halk Topluşu"), with [[Petr Pașalî]] as [[Chairman of the People's Assembly|chairman]].

Dmitrii Croitor won the 1999 governor elections and began to assert the rights granted to the governor by the 1994 agreement. The central authorities of Moldova proved unwilling to accept the results, initiating a lengthy stand-off between the autonomy and Chișinău. Finally Croitor resigned in 2002 due to the pressure from the Moldovan government, which accused him of abuse of authority, relations with the separatist authorities of Transnistria and other charges.

The central electoral commission of Gagauzia did not register Croitor as a candidate for the post of the Governor in the subsequent elections, and Gheorgi Tabunshik was elected in what was described as unfair elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alegeri.md/en/previous-elections/ Information on previous elections of Governor of Gagauz ATU] {{en icon}} {{ru icon}} {{ro icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacebuilding.md/library/153/en/Moldova%20Strategic%20Conflict%20Assessment%202006.pdf Moldova Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025224219/http://www.peacebuilding.md/library/153/en/Moldova%20Strategic%20Conflict%20Assessment%202006.pdf |date=2007-10-25 }}, Stuart Hensel, Economist Intelligence Unit, Peace Building.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mihail Formuzal]] served as the Governor of Gagauzia from 2006 until 2015. That year [[Irina Vlah]] was elected to the position, with 51% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/moldova-semi-autonomous-region-elects-pro-russian-leader/517910.html "Moldova: Semi-Autonomous Region Elects Pro-Russian Leader"], ''The Moscow Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2014, Gagauzia held a referendum. An overwhelming majority of voters opted for closer ties with Russia over EU integration. They also said they preferred the independence of Gagauzia if Moldova chooses to enter the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=41922&amp;cHash=8ffd794ad44b029f0b95198c743709d4#.UwUW057VrdL Dumitru Minzarari: "The Gagauz Referendum in Moldova: A Russian Political Weapon?", in: ''Eurasia Daily Monitor,'' Volume: 11, Issue: 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-gagauz-referendum-counting/25251251.html "Gagauzia Voters Reject Closer EU Ties For Moldova", ''RFE/RL,'' February 03, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2015, Irina Vlah was elected as the new governor after a strongly pro-Russian campaign, dominated by the quest for closer ties with the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elia|first1=Danilo|title=E la Găgăuzia vota per Mosca|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Moldavia/E-la-Gagauzia-vota-per-Mosca-160632|website=[[Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso]]|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Italian|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent candidate Irina Vlakh elected head of Gagauzia|url=http://tass.ru/en/world/784280|publisher=TASS – Russian News Agency|accessdate=30 March 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Gagauzia is divided into three districts. It also is split into four enclaves. The main, central enclave includes the cities Comrat and [[Ceadîr-Lunga]] and is divided into two districts with those cities serving as administrative centers. The second largest [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] is located around the city of [[Vulcănești]], while two smaller enclaves are the villages of [[Copceac, Gagauzia|Copceac]] and [[Carbalia]]. The village of Carbalia falls under administration of Vulcănești, while Copceac is part of the Ceadir-Lunga district.

== Administrative divisions ==
Gagauzia consists of one municipality, two cities, and 23 communes containing a total of 32 localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cis-legal-reform.org/document.asp?id=2019 Organic Law No. 292-XIV (see Annex 4)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225334/http://www.cis-legal-reform.org/document.asp?id=2019 |date=2007-09-26 }}, Republic of Moldova, 19 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
The autonomy of Gagauzia is guaranteed by the Moldovan constitution and regulated by the 1994 Gagauz Autonomy Act. If Moldova decided to unite with Romania, Gagauzia would have the right of self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;East – West Working Group. Levente Benkö.

This includes laws on education, culture, local development, budgetary and taxation issues, social security, and questions of territorial administration. The People's Assembly also has two special powers: it may participate in the formulation of Moldova's internal and foreign policy; and, should central regulations interfere with the jurisdiction of Gagauz-Yeri, it has the right of appeal to Moldova's [[List of constitutional courts|Constitutional Court]].

The highest official of Gagauzia, who heads the executive power structure, is the Governor of Gagauzia (Gagauz: ''Başkan'';Romanian: ''Guvernatorul Găgăuziei''). She/he is elected by popular [[suffrage]] for a four-year term, and has power over all public administrative bodies of Gagauzia. She/he is also a member of the Government of the Republic of Moldova. Eligibility for governorship requires fluency in the Gagauz language, Moldovan citizenship, and a minimum age of 35 years.

Permanent executive power in Gagauz Yeri is exercised by the Executive Committee (''Bakannik Komiteti''/''Comitetul Executiv''). Its members are appointed by the Governor, or by a [[majority|simple majority]] vote in the Assembly at its first session. The Committee ensures the application of the laws of the Republic of Moldova and those of the Assembly of Gagauz-Yeri.

As part of its autonomy, Gagauzia has its own [[police]] force.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.e-democracy.md/files/elections/gagauzia2006/special-legal-status-gagauzia-ro.pdf Moldovan law on the special legal status of Gagauzia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gagauz Halkı]] is a former Gagauz separatist political party, now outlawed.

===Elections===
Elections for the local governor and parliament as well as referendums take place in the autonomous region.

The population also votes in the national legislatives elections.

[[File:Angola map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Angola map of Köppen climate classification.]]

[[Angola]] is located on the western [[Atlantic]] Coast of [[southern Africa]] between [[Namibia]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. It also is bordered by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] to the east. The country consists of a sparsely watered and somewhat sterile [[coastal plain]] extending inland for a distance varying from {{convert|50|to|160|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Slightly inland and parallel to the coast is a belt of hills and mountains and behind those a large plateau.

== Geology ==
{{main|Geology of Angola}}
{{MapLibrary|Angola_sat.jpg|Angola}}
[[Image:Angola Topography.png|thumb|Topographic map of Angola.]]
The [[List of rock formations|rock formations]] of Angola are met with in three distinct regions:

# the [[littoral]] zone,
# the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast,
# the central plateau.

The central plateau consists of ancient [[crystalline rock]]s with [[granite]]s overlain by non-[[fossiliferous]] [[sandstone]]s and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of [[Paleozoic]] age. The outcrops are largely hidden under [[laterite]]. The median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some Palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks. The [[littoral]] zone contains the only [[fossiliferous]] strata. These are of [[Tertiary]] and [[Cretaceous]] ages, the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date. The Cretaceous rocks of the Dombe Grande region (near Benguela) are of [[Albian]] age and belong to the ''[[Acanthoceras mamillari]]'' zone. The beds containing ''[[Schloenbachia inflata]]'' are referable to the [[Gault]]. Rocks of Tertiary age are met with at Dombe Grande, [[Moçâmedes]] and near Luanda. The sandstones with [[gypsum]], [[copper]] and [[sulfur]] of Dombe are doubtfully considered to be of [[Triassic]] age. Recent eruptive rocks, mainly [[basalt]]s, form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between Benguela and [[Moçâmedes]]. Nepheline basalts and [[liparite]]s occur at Dombe Grande. The presence of [[gum copal]] in considerable quantities in the superficial rocks is characteristic of certain regions.
The geology and outline of the west coast of Angola is related to the opening of South Atlantic that started in the Early Cretaceous and continued until the Eocene, which is reflected in the invertebrate and vertebrate fossil fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, L. L., Polcyn M. J., Mateus O., Schulp A. S., Gonçalves A. O., &amp; Morais M. L. (2016).  Post-Gondwana Africa and the vertebrate history of the Angolan Atlantic Coast. Memoirs of Museum Victoria. 74, 343–362.&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond mine of Catoca preserved unexpected ancient dinosaur, mammal and crocodylomorph tracks with 128 Million years.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O., Marzola, M., Schulp, A.S., Jacobs, L.L., Polcyn, M.J., Pervov, V., Gonçalves, A.O. and Morais, M.L., 2017.

== Climate ==
Like the rest of tropical Africa, Angola experiences distinct, alternating [[Monsoon|rainy]] and [[Dry season|dry]] seasons. The coastal strip is tempered by the cool [[Benguela Current]], resulting in a climate similar to coastal [[Peru]] or [[Baja California]]. It is [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] in the South and along the coast to Luanda. There is a short rainy season lasting from February to April. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild. The north has a cool, dry season.  The climate is greatly influenced by the [[prevailing wind]]s, which arc W., S.W. and S.S.W.  Two seasons are distinguished – the cool, from June to September; and the rainy, from October to May.  The heaviest [[rainfall]] occurs in April, and is accompanied by violent storms. 
The far north and Cabinda have the highest annual rainfall.

Angola has four principal natural regions: the arid coastal lowland, stretching from Namibia to [[Luanda]] and characterized by low plains and terraces; green hills and mountains, rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment; a large area of high inland plains of dry [[savanna]], called the high plateau (planalto), which extends eastward and south-east from the escarpment; and [[rain forest]] in the north and in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The highest point in Angola is [[Morro de Môco]], at 2,620 m. Elevations generally range from {{convert|3000|to|6000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

===Coastal lowland===
The coast is for the most part flat, with occasional low cliffs and bluffs of red [[sandstone]]. There is but one deep inlet of the sea – [[Great Fish Bay]] (or [[Baía dos Tigres]]). Farther north are [[Port Alexander, Angola|Port Alexander]], [[Little Fish Bay]] and [[Lobito Bay]], while shallower bays are numerous. Lobito Bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore.  The coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces. This region varies in width from about 25&amp;nbsp;km near Benguela to more than 150&amp;nbsp;km in the Cuanza River Valley just south of Angola's capital, Luanda, and is markedly different from Angola's highland mass. The Atlantic Ocean's cold, northwardflowing Benguela Current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast, making the region relatively arid or nearly so shaouth of Benguela (where it forms the northern extension of the Namib Desert), and quite dry even in its northern reaches. Even where, as around Luanda, the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters, it is not common for the rains to fail. Given this pattern of precipitation, the far south is marked by sand dunes, which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast. Portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush.

===Hills and mountains===

The approach to the great central plateau of Africa is marked by the west-central highlands, a series of irregular [[escarpment]]s and [[cuesta]]s parallel to the coast at distances ranging from 20&amp;nbsp;km to 100&amp;nbsp;km inland  as [[Tala Mugongo]] ({{convert|1300|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Chella (mountains)|Chella]] and [[Vissecua]] ({{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The Cuanza River divides the mountain zone into two parts. The northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of 500 meters, with crests as high as 1,000 to 1,800 meters. South of the Cuanza River, the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment, extending from a point east of Luanda and running south through Namibia. The highest peak is [[Mount Moco]] ({{convert|2620|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and the escarpment is steepest in the far south in the [[Serra da Chella]] mountain range. In [[Benguela Province]] other high points are [[Loviti]] ({{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}),  in 12° 5' S., and [[Mt. Elonga]] ({{convert|2300|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). South of the Cuanza is the volcanic mountain [[Caculo-Cabaza]] ({{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

===High plateau===
The high plateau, with an altitude ranging from {{convert|1200|to|1800|m|abbr=on}}, lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates Angola's terrain. This plateau dominates the land.

===Rain forest===

==Drainage==
The [[Zambezi River]] and several tributaries of the [[Congo River]] have their sources in Angola. A large number of rivers originate in the central uplands, but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied. A number flow in a more or less westerly course to the Atlantic Ocean, providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power, only some of which had been realized by 1988. Two of Angola's most important rivers, the [[Cuanza River|Cuanza]] (Kwanza) and the [[Cunene River|Cunene]] (Kunene), take a more indirect route to the Atlantic, the Cuanza flowing north and the Cunene flowing south before turning west. The Cuanza is the only river wholly within Angola that is navigable—for nearly 200 kilometers from its mouth- -by boats of commercially or militarily significant size. The Congo River, whose mouth and western end form a small portion of Angola's northern border with Zaire, is also navigable.

North of the Lunda Divide the [[Kwango River|Kwango]] and many other streams flow north from the tableland to join the [[Kasai River]] (one of the largest affluents of the Congo), which in its upper course forms for fully {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} the boundary between Angola and the Congo. South of the divide some rivers flow into the Zambezi River system and thence to the Indian Ocean, others to the Okavango River (as the Cubango River is called along the border with Namibia and in Botswana) and thence to [[Lake Ngami]] and the Okavango Swamp in Botswana. The tributaries of the Cubango River and several of the southern rivers flowing to the Atlantic are seasonal, completely dry much of the year.

==Land use and hazards==

* ''per capita:'' {{convert|40.27|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}/yr (2005)

'''Natural hazards:''' locally heavy rainfall causes periodic flooding on the plateau

== Environment—current issues ==
Overuse of [[pasture]]s and subsequent [[soil erosion]] attributable to population pressures; [[desertification]]; [[deforestation]] of tropical rain forest, in response to both international demand for tropical [[timber]] and to domestic use as fuel, resulting in loss of [[biodiversity]]; soil erosion contributing to [[water pollution]] and [[silting]] of rivers and dams; inadequate supplies of potable water.

'''Environment—international agreements:'''
* ''party to:'' Biodiversity, [[Climate Change]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|Marine Dumping]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])
* ''signed, but not ratified:'' none of the selected agreements

== Flora and fauna ==

Both [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] are those characteristic of the greater part of tropical Africa.  As far south as Benguela the coast region is rich in [[oil palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s.  In the northern part of the province are dense forests.  In the South towards the Kunene are regions of dense [[thorn scrub]].  [[Rubber]] vines and trees are abundant, but in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the primitive methods adopted by native collectors of rubber.  The species most common are various root rubbers, notably the ''Carpodinus chylorrhiza''.  This species and other varieties of carpodinus are very widely distributed. [[Landolphia]]s are also found.  The [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[Guinea pepper (disambiguation)|Guinea pepper]] plants are indigenous, and the [[tobacco]] plant flourishes in several districts.  Among the trees are several which yield excellent timber, such as the [[tacula]] (''Pterocarpus tinctorius''), which grows to an immense size, its wood being blood-red in colour, and the Angola [[mahogany]].  The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the [[musuemba]] (''Albizzia coriaria'') is largely used in the tanning of [[leather]].  The [[mulundo]] bears a fruit about the size of a cricket ball covered with a hard green shell and containing scarlet pips like a [[pomegranate]].

The fauna includes the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[cheetah]], [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], [[rhinoceros]], [[hippopotamus]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[zebra]], [[kudu]] and many other kinds of [[antelope]], [[Sus (genus)|wild pig]], [[ostrich]] and [[crocodile]]. Angola previously served as a [[habitat]] for the [[endangered]] [[African wild dog]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209234758/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 |date=December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now deemed to be extinct within the entire country, stemming from human activities during the period 1965 to 1991. Among fish are the [[Barbus barbus|barbel]], [[bream]] and [[African yellow fish]].

===Ecoregions ===
The following [[ecoregions]] have been described in Angola:
* [[Angolan Scarp savanna and woodlands]], the steep coastal escarpment.
* [[Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic]], the inland slopes of the central highlands which are covered in grassland and contain the remaining patches of mountain woodland; 
* [[Angolan miombo woodlands]], much of the large inland plain, indeed most of central Angola.
* [[Angolan mopane woodlands]], an area in the south, mostly comprising [[Cunene Province]] and extending across the border into neighbouring [[Namibia]].

Between 57.3 and 59.5 [[latitude]] and 21.5 and 28.1 [[longitude]], [[Estonia]] lies on the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] on the level northwestern part of the rising [[East-European Platform|East European Platform]]. It borders the [[Gulf of Finland]], between [[Latvia]] and [[Russia]]. Average elevation reaches only {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.
 
The climate is maritime, wet, with moderate winters and cool summers. [[Oil shale]] and [[limestone]] deposits, along with [[forest]]s which cover 47% of the land, play key economic roles in this generally resource-poor country. Estonia boasts over 1,500 [[lakes]], numerous [[bog]]s, and 3,794 kilometers of [[coastline]] marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets. [[Tallinn]]'s [[Port of Muuga|Muuga port]] offers one of Europe's finest [[ice-free port|warm-water harbor]] facilities.

Estonia's strategic location has precipitated many wars that were fought on its territory between other rival powers at its expense. In 1944, under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation, the [[Ivangorod|Jaanilinn]] and [[Pechory|Petseri]] regions were annexed to [[Russian SFSR]] territory. The legal status of these territories has not been fully settled yet, though neither Estonia or Russia has not any territorial claims.

'''Geographic coordinates:''' {{coord|59|00|N|26|00|E|type:country}}.

==Geographic features==
{{See also|List of islands of  Estonia}}
{{See also|List of rivers of  Estonia}}
Estonia is a flat country covering {{convert|45339|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. Estonia has a long, shallow coastline ({{convert|3794|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) along the Baltic Sea, with 1,520 islands dotting the shore. The two largest islands are [[Saaremaa]] (literally, island land), at {{convert|2673|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and Hiiumaa, at {{convert|989|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. The two islands are favorite Estonian vacation spots. The country's highest point, Suur Munamägi (Egg Mountain), is in the hilly southeast and reaches {{convert|318|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Estonia is covered by about {{convert|18000|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of forest. Arable land amounts to about {{convert|9260|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. Meadows cover about {{convert|2520|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and pastureland covers about {{convert|1810|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. There are more than 1,400 natural and artificial lakes in Estonia. The largest of them, [[Lake Peipus]] ({{convert|3555|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), forms much of the border between Estonia and Russia. Located in central Estonia, [[Võrtsjärv]] is the second-largest lake ({{convert|270|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The [[Narva River|Narva]] and [[Emajõgi]] are among the most important of the country's many rivers.

A small, recent cluster of meteorite craters, the largest of which is called [[Kaali crater|Kaali]] are found near [[Saaremaa]], Estonia. It is thought that the impact was witnessed by the Iron Age inhabitants of the area.

Estonia has a temperate climate, with four seasons of near-equal length. Average temperatures range from {{convert|16.3|°C|1|lk=on}} on the Baltic islands to {{convert|17.1|°C|1}} inland in July, the warmest month, and from {{convert|−3.5|°C|1}} on the Baltic islands to {{convert|−7.6|°C|1}} inland in February, the coldest month. Precipitation averages {{convert|568|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year and is heaviest in late summer.

Estonia's land border with Latvia runs {{convert|333|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; [[Estonia-Russia border|the Russian border]] runs {{convert|324|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. From 1920 to 1945, Estonia's border with Russia, set by the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, extended beyond the Narva River in the northeast and beyond the town of [[Petseri]] in the southeast. This territory, amounting to some {{convert|2300|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, was incorporated into Russia by [[Joseph Stalin]] at the end of [[World War II]].

==Environmental issues==
{{See also|Protected areas of Estonia}}
[[File:Suur-Pakri - kaugpommitajate polügoon.JPG|thumb|The Soviet army used the [[Pakri Islands]] as sites for aerial bombardment. The collection and destruction of thousands of Soviet explosive devices was mostly complete by 1997.]]
One of the most burdensome legacies of the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is widespread environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, M.R., Raukas, A. (2002). Determinants of environmental cleanup in Estonia. ''Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy'', 20: 679–698.&lt;/ref&gt; The worst offender in this regard was the Soviet army. Across military installations covering more than 800&amp;nbsp;km² of Estonian territory, the army dumped hundreds of thousands of tons of jet fuel into the ground, improperly disposed of toxic chemicals, and discarded outdated explosives and weapons in coastal and inland waters. In the 1990s, during the army's withdrawal from Estonia, extensive damage was done to discarded buildings and equipment. In October 1993, the Estonian Ministry of Environment issued a preliminary report summing up part of the degradation it had surveyed thus far. The report described the worst damage as having been done to Estonia's topsoil and underground water supply by the systematic dumping of jet fuel at six Soviet army air bases. At the air base near Tapa, site of the worst damage, officials estimated that six square kilometers of land were covered by a layer of fuel; 11 square kilometers of underground water were said to be contaminated. The water in the surrounding area was undrinkable, and was sometimes set fire by locals to provide heat during the winter. With Danish help, Estonian crews began cleaning up the site, although they estimated the likely cost to be as much as 4 million EEK. The Ministry of Environment assigned a monetary cost of more than 10 billion EEK  {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} to the damage to the country's topsoil and water supply. However, the ministry was able to allocate only 5 million EEK in 1993 for cleanup operations.

In a 1992 government report to the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, Estonia detailed other major environmental concerns. For instance, for several consecutive years Estonia had led the world in the production of sulfur dioxide per capita. Nearly 75% of Estonia's air pollution was reported to come from [[Narva Power Plants|two oil shale-based thermal power stations operating near Narva]]. The [[Oil shale in Estonia|mining of oil shale]] in northeastern Estonia has also left large mounds of limestone [[tailings]] and ash dotting the region. Near the town of [[Sillamäe]], site of a former uranium enrichment plant, about 1,200 tons of uranium and about 750 tons of thorium had been dumped into a reservoir on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. This was said to have caused severe health problems among area residents. In the coastal town of Paldiski, the removal of waste left by Soviet army nuclear reactors was also a major concern. The combined cost of environmental cleanup at both towns was put at more than EKR3.5 billion.

'''Natural hazards:''' flooding occurs frequently in the spring in certain areas

'''Environment – current issues:'''  air polluted with sulfur dioxide from oil-shale burning power plants in northeast; however, the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have fallen steadily, the emissions of 2000 were 80% less than in 1980; the amount of unpurified wastewater discharged to water bodies in 2000 was 1/20 the level of 1980; in connection with the start-up of new water purification plants, the pollution load of wastewater decreased; Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and man-made lakes, the smaller of which in agricultural areas need to be monitored; coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations.

A '''huaico''' (from the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''wayqu'', meaning "depth, valley") is an [[Andes|Andean]] term that refers to the [[mudslide]] and [[flash flood]] caused by torrential [[rain]]s occurring high in the mountains, especially during the weather phenomenon known as ''[[El Niño]]''.

National forests such as the [[San Matías–San Carlos Protection Forest]] were created in [[Peru]] to protect vegetation, which reduces runoff, and prevent huaicos.

The indigenous [[Mapuche]] residents of ''[[Lo Barnechea]]'', in present-day [[Santiago Province, Chile]], were called ''Huaicoches'' in their [[Mapudungun language]]: ''Huaico'' ([[flash flood]]) and ''che'' (people).

'''Ibn Jubayr''' (1 September 1145{{sfn|Peters|1996|p=91}} –29 November 1217; {{lang-ar|'''ابن جبير'''}}&lt;ref&gt;Full name: ''Abū l-[[Husayn]] [[Muhammad (name)|Muhammad]] ibn [[Ahmad (name)|Ahmad]] ibn [[Jubayr (name)|Jubayr]] al-Kenani'' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسين محمد بن أحمد بن جبير الكناني}}), also called simply ''Jabair''.&lt;/ref&gt;), also written Ibn Jubair, Ibn Jobair, and Ibn Djubayr, was an [[Arab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yann|first1=Dejugnat,|title=Ibn Jubayr|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/ibn-jubayr-COM_30845?s.num=1&amp;s.q=Ibn+Jubayr|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[geography|geographer]], traveller and poet from [[al-Andalus]].  His travel chronicle describes the pilgrimage he made to Mecca from 1183 to 1185, in the years preceding the [[Third Crusade]].  His chronicle describes Saladin's domains in Egypt and the [[Levant]] which he passed through on his way to Mecca.  Further, on his return journey he passed through Christian Sicily, which had only been recaptured from the Muslims a century before, and he makes several observations on the hybrid polyglot culture which flourished there.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ibn Jubayr was born in 1145 A.D. in [[Taifa of Valencia|Valencia]], Spain, to an [[Arab]] family of the [[Banu Kinanah|Kinanah]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yann|first1=Dejugnat,|title=Ibn Jubayr|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/ibn-jubayr-COM_30845|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of 'Abdal-Salam ibn Jabayr who in 740 A.D. had accompanied an army sent by the Caliph of Damascus to put down a Berber uprising in his Spanish provinces.{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|p=15}} Ibn Jubayr studied in the town of [[Xàtiva]] where his father worked as a civil servant. He later became secretary to the [[Almohad]] governor of [[Granada]].{{sfn|Pellat|1986}}

In the introduction to his ''[[Rihla]]'' Ibn Jubayr explains the reason for his travels. As secretary for the ruler of Granada in 1182, he was forced, under threat, to drink seven cups of wine. Seized by remorse, the ruler then filled seven cups of [[gold dinar]]s which he gave him. To expiate his godless act, although forced upon him, Ibn Jubayr decided to perform the duty of Hajj to Mecca. He left Granada on 3 February 1183 accompanied by a physician from the city.

===Travels===
[[File:Yabar-IbnJubair.PNG|thumb|right|400px| Map of the first journey by Ibn Jubair from [[Ceuta]] until [[Makkah]]]]

====The sea journey from Ceuta to Alexandria====
Ibn Jubayr left [[Granada]] and crossed over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Ceuta]], then under Muslim rule. He boarded a [[Genoa|Genoese]] ship on February 24, 1183 and set sail for [[Alexandria]]. His sea journey took him past the [[Balearic Islands]] and then across to the west coast of [[Sardinia]]. Whilst offshore he heard of the fate of 80 Muslim men, women and children who had been abducted from [[North Africa]] and were being sold into slavery. Between Sardinia and [[Sicily]] the ship ran into a severe storm. He said of the Italians and Muslims on board who had experience of the sea that "all agreed that they had never in their lives seen such a tempest".{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|p=28}} After the storm the ship went on past Sicily, [[Crete]] and then turned south and crossed over to the North African coast. He arrived in Alexandria on March 26.

====In Egypt====
[[File:Isle of Graia3.jpg|left|thumb|Saladin and the [[Mamluk]]s assured the protection of [[Camel train|Caravan]] routes that allowed travel to distant lands.]]
Everywhere that Ibn Jubayr travelled in Egypt he was full of praise for the new [[Sunni]] ruler, [[Saladin]]. For example, he says of him that: "There is no congregational or ordinary mosque, no mausoleum built over a grave, nor hospital, nor theological college, where the bounty of the Sultan does not extend to all who seek shelter or live in them."{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|pp=44-45}} He points out that when the Nile does not flood enough, Saladin remits the land tax from the farmers. He also says that "such is his (Salahuddin's) justice, and the safety he has brought to his high-roads that men in his lands can go about their affairs by night and from its darkness apprehend no awe that should deter them."{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|p=49}} Ibn Jubayr is, on the other hand, very disparaging of the previous [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] dynasty of the [[Fatimids]].

Of [[Cairo]], Ibn Jubayr notes, are the colleges and hostels erected for students and pious men of other lands by the Sultan [[Saladin]]. In those colleges students find lodging and tutors to teach them the sciences they desire, and also allowances to cover their needs. The care of the sultan also grants them baths, hospitals, and the appointment of doctors who can even come to visit them at their place of stay, and who would be answerable for their cure. One of the Sultan [[Saladin]]'s other generous acts was that every day two thousand loaves of bread were distributed to the poor. Also impressing Ibn Jubayr in that city was the number of mosques, estimated at between 8 and 12 thousand; often four or five of them in the same street.

====In Alexandria====
Upon arrival at Alexandria Ibn Jubayr was angered by the customs officials who insisted on taking [[zakat]] from the pilgrims, regardless of whether they were obliged to pay it or not. In the city he visited the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], which at that time was still standing, and he was amazed by its size and splendour.
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the greatest wonders that we saw in this city was the lighthouse which Great and Glorious God had erected by the hands of those who were forced to such labor as 'Indeed in that are signs for those who discern'. [https://quran.com/15/75 Quran 15:75] and as a guide to voyagers, for without it they could not find the true course to Alexandria. It can be seen for more than seventy miles, and is of great antiquity. It is most strongly built in all directions and competes with the skies in height. Description of it falls short, the eyes fail to comprehend it, and words are inadequate, so vast is the spectacle.{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|pp=32-33}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was also impressed by the free colleges, hostels for foreign students, baths and hospitals in the city. These were paid for by [[waqf|awqaf]] and taxes on the city's [[Jews]] and [[Christians]]. He noted that there were between 8,000 and 12,000 mosques in Alexandria. After a stay of eight days he set off for [[Cairo]].

====In Cairo====
[[File:Mameluke-in-Full-Armour.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk]] in full armor and armed with [[lance]], [[shield]] and [[sabre]]]]

He reached Cairo three days later. In the city he visited the [[cemetery]] at [[al-Qarafah]], which contained the graves of many important figures in the history of Islam. He noted while in the Cairo of [[Saladin]], the walls of the [[citadel]] were being extended by the [[Mamluks]] with the object of reinforcing the entire city from any future [[Crusades|Crusader]] siege. Another building work that he saw was the construction of a [[bridge]] over the [[Nile]], which would be high enough not to be submerged in the annual [[flood]]ing of the river. He saw a spacious free [[hospital]] which was divided into three sections: one each for men, women and the [[insanity|insane]]. He saw the [[Giza pyramid complex|pyramids]], although he was unaware of who they had been built for, and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]]. He also saw [[Nilometer|a device]] that was used for measuring the height of the Nile flood.

===Ibn Jubayr in Sicily===
In [[Sicily]], at the very late stages of his travels (Dec 1184-Jan 1185), Ibn Jubayr recounts other experiences. He comments on the activity of the volcanoes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the close of night a red flame appeared, throwing up tongues into the air. It was the celebrated volcano ([[Stromboli]]). We were told that a fiery blast of great violence bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and makes the fire. Often a great stone is cast up and thrown into the air by the force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and settling at the bottom. This is one of the most remarkable of stories, and it is true.

As for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal al-Nar [Mountain of Fire], it also presents a singular feature in that some years a fire pours from it in the manner of the `bursting of the dam'. It passes nothing it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its surface and then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of all things for His marvelous creations. There is no God but He.{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|pp=343-344}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also striking Ibn Jubayr is the city of [[Palermo]]. He describes it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits of wealth and splendour, and having all that you could wish of beauty, real or apparent, and all the needs of subsistence, mature and fresh. It is an ancient and elegant city, magnificent and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly set between its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone known as kadhan [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town, and four springs gush in its suburbs... The King roams through the gardens and courts for amusement and pleasure... The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of Muslim women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about them, and are veiled.{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|pp=348-350}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Further journeys===
[[File:Saint-John of the Hermits(1840Lithograph).JPG|thumb|upright|[[San Giovanni degli Eremiti]], an example of [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Arab-Norman architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church of San Giovanni Degli Eremiti|url=http://palermoarabonormanna.com/en/percorso/church-of-san-giovanni-degli-eremiti/|website=Palermo Arabo Normanna|publisher=Palermo Arabo Normanna|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] walls with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] [[dome]]s; built in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]] by the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ibn Jubayr also travelled to [[Medina]], [[Mecca]], [[Damascus]], [[Mosul]], [[Acre (city)|Acre]] and [[Baghdad]] at [[Basra]] he saw how Indian timber was carefully used to make [[Lateen]] sail ships, returning in 1185 by way of [[Sicily]]. His path was not without troubles, including a [[shipwreck]]. On both occasions he travelled on [[Genoa|Genoese]] ships.

Frequently quoted is Jubayr's famous description of Muslims prospering under the Christian [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We moved from [[Toron|Tibnin]] - may God destroy it - at daybreak on Monday. Our way lay through continuous farms and ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were all Muslims, living comfortably within the Franks... They surrender half their crops to the Franks at harvest time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one dinar and five qirat for each person. Other than that they are not interfered with, save for a light tax on the fruit of their trees. The houses and all their effects are left to their full possession. All the coastal cities occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their rural districts, the villages and farms, belong to the Muslims. But their hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike them in ease and comfort are their brethren in the Muslim regions under their (Muslim) governors. This is one of the misfortunes afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim community bewails the injustice of the landlord of its own faith, and applauds the conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and is accustomed to justice from him.{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952|p=316}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jubayr travelled to the East on two further occasions (1189–1191 and 1217), without leaving any account. He died on the 29 November 1217 in [[Alexandria]] during the second of these trips.{{sfn|Pellat|1986}}

==Overview and publication==
Ibn Jubayr provides a highly detailed and graphic description of the places he visited during his travels. The book differs from other contemporary accounts in not being a mere collection of toponyms and descriptions of monuments, but contains observation of geographical details as well as cultural, religious and political matters. Particularly interesting are his notes about the declining faith of his fellow Muslims in [[Palermo]] after the recent [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] conquest, and about what he perceived as the Muslim-influenced customs of king [[William II of Sicily]] (see [[Arabo-Norman civilization]]).

His writing is a foundation of the genre of work called [[Rihla]], or the creative travelogue. This is a mix of personal narrative, description of the areas traveled and personal anecdotes.{{sfn|Grammatico|Werner|2015}}

Ibn Jubayr's travel chronicle served as a model for later authors, some of whom copied from it without attribution. [[Ibn Juzayy]], who wrote the account of [[Ibn Battuta]]'s travels in around 1355 A.D., copied passages that had been written 170 years earlier by Ibn Jubayr describing Damascus, Mecca, Medina and other places in the Middle East.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|pp=313–314}} Passages copied from Ibn Jubayr are also found in the writings of al-Sharishi, [[Mohammed al-Abdari al-Hihi|al-Abdari]] and [[Al-Maqrizi]].{{sfn|Pellat|1986}}

A surviving copy of Ibn Jubayr's  manuscript is preserved in the collection of the [[Leiden University Library]]. The 210 page manuscript was produced in [[Mecca]] in 875 A.H. (1470 A.D.) and appears to have been written at high speed: diacritic marks are often missing, words are omitted and there is confusion between certain pairs of letters.{{sfn|Ibn Jubayr|Wright|de Goeje|1907|pp=14-15}} The complete Arabic text was first published in 1852 by the orientalist [[William Wright (orientalist)|William Wright]].{{sfn|Ibn Jubayr|Wright|1852}} An updated edition was published in 1907 by [[Michael Jan de Goeje]].{{sfn|Ibn Jubayr|Wright|de Goeje|1907}} A translation into Italian by Celestino Schiaparelli was published in 1906,{{sfn| Ibn Jubayr| Schiaparelli|1906}} a translation into English by [[Ronald Broadhurst]] was published in 1952,{{sfn|Broadhurst|1952}} and a translation into French by [[Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes]] appeared in three volumes between 1949 and 1956.{{sfn|Ibn Jobair|Gaudefroy-Demombynes|1949–1956}}

==In popular culture==
Jubair is widely identified as Jubair Al-Hakim from the video game series ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'', where he preaches in [[Damascus]] before being killed by the protagonist, [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Markley |first=John Drew |title=Assassin’s Creed 3 box art unveiled |url=http://www.gamingandtech.com/2012/03/02/assassins-creed-3-box-art-unveiled/ |work=Gaming and Tech |access-date=26 September 2016 |date=2 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011184129/http://www.gamingandtech.com/2012/03/02/assassins-creed-3-box-art-unveiled/ |archive-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Crane Foundation''' (ICF) is a non-profit [[conservation organization]] that works to conserve [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and the [[ecosystems]], [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], and [[flyways]] on which they depend. Founded in 1973, the International Crane Foundation is headquartered in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]] on a 250-acre property that includes live crane exhibits with 15 crane species, a visitor center, breeding facilities, a research library and nature trails. The foundation works worldwide and in the US with local partners to raise and conserve cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Helps One Program Annual Report|url=https://icfchina.wordpress.com/category/one-helps-one-program/|publisher=International Crane Foundation China Program|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://wetlandnetwork.org/projects|publisher=Wetland University Network|accessdate=3 October 2017|quote=Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), a survey of 531 wetlands in the whole Mekong Basin, involved scientists of US Geological Survey (USGS), International Crane Foundation (ICF), examined a landscape never before studied in the region.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranes and Wetlands|url=http://ncf-india.org/programmes/cranes-and-wetlands|publisher=Nature Conservation Foundation|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation maintains a regional base in [[China]] and shares program offices with partner organizations in [[Cambodia]], [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Texas]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.savingcranes.org/about-icf/|publisher=International Crane Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Crane Foundation's approximately 80 staff work with a network of hundreds of specialists in over 50 countries on five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.savingcranes.org/about-icf/|publisher=International Crane Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The International Crane Foundation was founded in 1973 by two [[ornithology]] students at [[Cornell University]], Ron Sauey and [[George W. Archibald]], who envisioned an organization that would combine research, captive breeding and reintroduction, landscape restoration, and education to safeguard the world’s 15 crane species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.savingcranes.org/about-icf/history/|publisher=International Crane Foundation|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Answering The Cranes' Call: 40 Years Of Preserving Grace|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/08/219764625/answering-the-cranes-call-40-years-of-preserving-grace|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the Sauey family rented their horse farm to Ron and George for $1 a year to found the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Archibald on His Work Saving Cranes from Extinction|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2015/09/29/george-archibald-his-work-saving-cranes-extinction|publisher=Chicago Tonight|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization moved to its current location in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIRDS OF A FEATHER: 40 years later, the International Crane Foundation is saving more than birds — they are saving environments|url=http://www.wiscnews.com/portagedailyregister/news/local/article_53ccacd8-eb3f-11e2-8d22-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Portage Daily Register|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranes of Wisconsin Near Wisconsin Dells, a global village of birds lives, loves and thrives.|url=https://midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/nature/birds_wildlife/crane_foundation_wisconsin.html|publisher=Midwest weekends|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald was the organization's director from 1973 to 2000. He pioneered several techniques there to rear cranes in captivity, including the use of crane costumes by human handlers. Archibald spent three years with a highly endangered whooping crane named Tex, acting as a male crane – walking, calling, dancing – to shift her into reproductive condition. Through his dedication and the use of [[artificial insemination]], Tex eventually laid a fertile egg which hatched a chick named Gee Whiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tex, the whooping crane who needed a little encouragement...|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/06/24/Tex-the-whooping-crane-who-needed-a-little-encouragement/8571393739200/|publisher=UPI|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=June 24, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man courts whooping crane for three years to save it from extinction|url=https://www.treehugger.com/endangered-species/man-courts-whooping-crane-save-its-species-extinction-george-archibald-tex.html|publisher=Tree Hugger|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Crane Foundation's office in [[Rockport, Texas]] was demolished in 2017 by [[Hurricane Harvey]], but will be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Crane Foundation loses office after hurricane|url=https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2017/sep/12/international-crane-foundation-loses-office-after-/|publisher=Victoria Advocate|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was located near the [[Aransas National Wildlife Refuge]], an area that sustains the last naturally occurring flock of whooping cranes.

In 1919, at the time of its annexation, the middle part of the [[County of Tyrol]] which is today called [[South Tyrol]] (in Italian ''Alto Adige'') was inhabited by almost 90% [[German language|German]] speakers.&lt;ref name="Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol"&gt;Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): "[http://www.provincia.bz.it/Astat/downloads/Siz_2008-eng.pdf South Tyrol in Figures 2008", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol], Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1939 [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] determined the status of the German and Ladin (Rhaeto-Romanic) ethnic groups living in the region. They could emigrate to [[Germany]], or stay in Italy and accept their complete [[Italianization]]. As a consequence of this, the society of South Tyrol was deeply riven. Those who wanted to stay, the so-called ''Dableiber'', were condemned as traitors while those who left (''Optanten'') were defamed as [[Nazis]]. Because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], this agreement was never fully implemented. Illegal [[Katakombenschulen]] ("Catacomb schools") were set up to teach children the German language.
== Italianization programme ==

=== Fascist period (1922-1945) ===
[[File:Südtiroler Platz - Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|Street sign in [[Innsbruck]], [[Tyrol (state)|North Tyrol]], commemorating the separation of South Tyrol, set up in 1923 in response to the prohibition of the original southern Tyrolean place names.]]
In 1923, three years after [[South Tyrol]] had been formally [[annexation|annexed]], Italian place names, almost entirely based on the ''[[Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige]]'', were made official by means of a [[decree]].&lt;ref name="Steininger, 21-23"/&gt; The German name "Tyrol" was banned, likewise its derivants and compound words such as "Tyrolean" and "South Tyrolean".&lt;ref name="Steininger, 21-23"/&gt; German newspapers, publishing houses, organized clubs and associations, including the [[Alpenverein Südtirol|South Tyrolean Alpine Club]] had to be renamed, with the decree said to have been strictly enforced by Italian ''[[carabinieri]]'' on the ground.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 21-23"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for these actions was a manifesto published by [[Ettore Tolomei]] on July 15, 1923, called the ''Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige'' ("Measures for the Alto Adige"), becoming the blueprint for the Italianization campaign. Its 32 measures were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uibk.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/zis/library/19230715.html Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige, in: Gruber, Alfons: ''Südtirol unter dem Faschismus'', Schriftenreihe des Südtiroler Kulturinstitutes 1, Bozen 1974, p. 21f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1923, the "use of the Italian language became mandatory on all levels of federal, provincial and local government".&lt;ref name="Steininger, 23-24"/&gt; Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices had to be in Italian only, while maps, postcards and other graphic material had to show Italian place names.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 23-24"/&gt; In September 1925, Italian became the sole permissible language in courts of law, meaning that cases could be heard from now on only in Italian.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 23-24"/&gt; The fascist law regulations remained in effect after [[World War II]], becoming a bone of contention for decades until they were eventually reconsidered in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 23-24"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German-language press, which was still published, was harassed by the authorities and subjected to censorship prior to publication.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 25-26"/&gt; In 1926 the fascist authorities began to publish their own German-language newspaper, the ''Alpenzeitung''.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 25-26"/&gt; Other German-language papers were obliged to follow a strictly pro-regime editorial policy.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 25-26"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; 

The programme of Italianization was particularly forcefully applied in schools, aiming at the destruction of the German school system.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 26-27"/&gt; As of 1928, Italian had become the only language of instruction in 760 South Tyrolean classes, affecting over 360 schools and 30,000 pupils.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 26-27"/&gt; Likewise, German [[Kindergarten]] were required to use Italian, while substitutes were forced to shut down.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 26-27"/&gt; German teachers were systematically dismissed on the grounds of "insufficient [[didactics]]", or transferred to the south, from where Italian teachers were recruited instead.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 26-27"/&gt; Degrees from [[Austria]]n or [[Germany|German]] universities became valid only through an additional stay of one year at an Italian university.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 26-27"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

In religious affairs, a royal decree of November 1923 required religious instruction in Italian for all Italianized schools.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 27-28"/&gt; Fascist calls for the Italianization of German charitable organizations, religious orders and the complete abolition of German religious instruction to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] were not entirely successful, not in the least due to the repeated interventions of the [[Bishop of Brixen]] and the setting up of informal [[Parish]] schools.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 27-28"/&gt; In state schools, though, Italian became mandatory for the last five classes, while the use of German was only allowed in teaching the Italian [[catechism]] in the first three years.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 27-28"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German-speaking population reacted by the establishment of [[Katakombenschule]]n ("catacomb schools"), clandestine home schools outside the Italianized standard educational system.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 29-32"/&gt; German schoolbooks were secretly smuggled across the border, often hidden in religious buildings before being distributed to the South Tyroleans pupils.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 29-32"/&gt; After initial difficulties, secret seminars for the instruction of teachers were organized throughout the province, usually under the protection of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]].&lt;ref name="Steininger, 29-32"/&gt; Fascist countermeasures ranged from searches and confiscations to imprisonments and deportations.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 29-32"/&gt; The balancing act between the instruction in Italian and German schools, where often the exact opposite was taught, especially in history and the social fields, is said to have left many Tyrolean pupils with a torn identity.&lt;ref name="Steininger, 29-32"&gt;Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 29-32&lt;/ref&gt; The newly composed ''[[Bozner Bergsteigerlied]]'' quickly became one of South Tyrol's unofficial hymns by celebrating an unbroken attachment of the South Tyroleans to their homeland.

=== Post-war period ===
[[File:Suedtirol ist nicht Italien - Brennero.JPG|thumb|Poster saying "South Tyrol is not Italy!" on the background of an [[Flag of Austria|Austrian flag]]. The poster is located in the Austrian side of the border, not in South Tyrol.]]
After the end of the [[Second World War]], reform processes tolerated the dual use of names on street signs, while the Italian names remain as the official ones, based on the 1940 law.

In the 1990s, a commission consisting of the Professors Josef Breu (Vienna, representing Austria in the Toponymy commission of the UN), Peter Glatthard (Berne) and Carlo Alberto Mastrelli (Florence, current "Archivio per l'Alto Adige") failed as Mastrelli insisted on the fascist decrees, while Breu and Glatthard promoted the UN-Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schuetzen.com/html/news/treplies.asp?message=%2015 Namen in Südtirol wecken nationale Leidenschaften] Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 28 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6895">'''Jacob Roelofs van Deventer''' (c. 1500/1505 in [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]] &amp;ndash; 1575 in [[Cologne]]) was a Dutch [[cartographer]] of the [[Renaissance]]. He is today best known for his work in systematically cartographing all Dutch towns and cities of his time.

== Biography ==

Little biographical information exists about Jacob van Deventer. His patronage would suggest he was Catholic. Despite his name, he was probably not born in [[Deventer]], but in [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]] in the north of the [[Netherlands]]. His mother married a man called Roelof in Deventer in 1510, and Jacob probably grew up there. He first appears in the sources on 24 April 1520, when he enrolled at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] under the name of "Jacobus de Daventria". On this basis, his date of birth is conjectured to have been around 1500–1505. In Leuven, Jacob's interests were first directed towards medicine and philosophy, but he then began to take an interest in geography and cartography. he later moved to [[Mechelen]], from where in 1572 he relocated to [[Cologne]] to flee the upheavals of the [[Dutch Revolt]] against the Spanish rule. During his career as a cartographer in the Spanish royal service, he earned himself the title of "Imperial Cartographer" from emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1540 (later changed to that of "Royal Cartographer", after the emperor's abdication in 1555).

== Works ==

Jacob van Deventer was among the first to make systematic use of [[triangulation]], a technique whose theory was described by his contemporary [[Gemma Frisius]] in his 1533 book, ''Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione''. In 1536 he produced a printed map of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], the first such map to be published in the Netherlands. He then launched into an impressive career as a mapmaker. In 1559, he was tasked by King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] with the project that was to become his life's work: the systematic cartography of all cities of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Utrecht University Library]], [http://kaarten.library.uu.nl/overkaart.php?lang=nl&amp;ItemID=568 Digital Map Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623095637/http://kaarten.library.uu.nl/overkaart.php?lang=nl&amp;ItemID=568 |date=23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting maps were kept unpublished because of their military value. As a result, they later became forgotten and were rediscovered only in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belgica.kbr.be/pdf/cp/DeventerNapoli.pdf Wouter Bracke, ‘Jacob van Deventer e l'atlante di città dei Paesi Bassi’, in ''Le città dei cartografi. Studi e ricerche di storia urbana,'' ed. Cesare de Seta and Brigitte Marin, Naples: Electa, 2008, p. 38-48.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobus van Deventer worked on this monumental project until his death in 1575. In the course of fifteen years, he created between 250 and 260 [[city map]]s, covering an area from [[Friesland]] to what is today the north of [[France]], and reaching into [[Luxembourg]] and the west of [[Germany]].

All maps were made according to the same scheme, using a scale of c. 1:8,000. Most were made in three versions: the first was a "minute" version or first draft of the city in its nearer surroundings, based on topographical data that was collected by surveying on the site, with texts in Dutch. Of these draft versions, 152 were discovered in 1859 in various provincial archives in the Netherlands and in the Royal Library of Brussels. (A number that were kept in [[Middelburg]] were later destroyed during [[World War II]] and are preserved only as copies).

The second stage was a "main chart" (''netkaart'' or ''hoofdkaart''), representing a cleaned-up elaborated version of the previous minute map, with texts in Latin.

A third map, termed a ''bijkaart'' (ancillary chart) was produced that showed only the city itself, without the surroundings. It contains only the fortification works and canals, and the principal buildings and streets. The main charts with their ancillary charts were preserved as a three-volume atlas in the National Library of Madrid. Of this, one volume has been lost; 179 maps are preserved (in addition to 152 drafts).

This is a list of current and former programmes broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]].

When it came into existence – on 30 September 1967 – Radio 4 inherited a great many continuing programme series which had been initiated prior to that date by its predecessor, the [[BBC Home Service]] (1939–1967), and in some cases even by stations which had preceded the Home Service. Such inherited programmes are included in the list.

The years indicated in brackets after programme titles refer to the dates, where known, of each programme's first, subsequent, and final broadcasts – and, in cases where Radio 4 programmes began their run on stations other than the Home Service, the names of those originating stations are also shown.

Note that many of Radio 4's past [[comedy]] and [[drama]] productions have been, and continue to be repeatedly [[rerun]] on Radio 4, as well as on the digital radio channel [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] (previously [[BBC Radio 7]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">This is a list of the '''[[Extreme points of Earth|extreme points]] of China''', compared both globally and within the country.

==Global extreme points in China==

===Altitude===
* The '''highest point''' measured from sea level is the summit of [[Mount Everest]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] on the Sino-[[Nepal]]ese border. While [[Mount Everest#Measurement|measurements of its height]] vary slightly, the elevation of its peak is usually given as 8,848 m (29,028 feet) above sea level.
* The '''lowest point in Central Asia''' is {{Convert|154|m|ft}} below sea level at [[Ayding Lake]] within the [[Turpan Depression]], near the oasis city of [[Turpan Pendi]], [[Xinjiang]].

====Highest attainable by transportation====
The following are all located partially or completely in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].

*'''Road (mountain pass):''' Possibly [[Semo La]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} {{Convert|5565|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, depending on definition of "attainable by transportation". There may be higher motorable passes in Tibet in areas affected by lack of information and restricted access. See [[Khardung La]], {{convert|5359|m|abbr=on}} for more information.
*'''Train:''' [[Tanggula Mountain Pass]], in the [[Tanggula Mountains]], on the Qinghai&amp;ndash;Tibet border {{Convert|5072|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}
*'''Airport:''' [[Daocheng Yading Airport]], Sichuan province {{Convert|4411|m|ft|0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-china-airport-idUSBRE98F0AG20130916 | title = China opens world's highest civilian airport | accessdate = 2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Highest geographical features====
The following are all located partially or completely in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].

*'''Lake:'''   Lhagba Pool on the northeast slopes of [[Mount Everest]], at an altitude of {{Convert|6368|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html#Lhagba | title = The Highest Lake in the World | accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''River:''' One candidate from among many possibilities is the Ating Ho (Ho meaning river), which flows into the [[Aong Tso]] (Hagung Tso), a large lake about {{Convert|6100|m|ft|0}} at its source at {{coord|32|49|30|N|81|03|45|E|display=inline|name=Ating Ho (source)}}.  A very large high river is the [[Yarlung Tsangpo]], the Tibetan section of the [[Brahmaputra River]], whose main stem, the [[Maquan River]] has its source at about {{Convert|6020|m|ft|0}} above sea level at {{coord|30|48|59|N|82|42|45|E|display=inline|name=Maquan River (source)|type:waterbody_region:CN-54}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100gogo.com/bigben.htm |title=The Mystery of World's highest river and largest Canyon |accessdate=2007-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921032822/http://www.100gogo.com/bigben.htm |archivedate=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Wilhelm''' ({{lang-de|Wilhelmsberg}}) is the highest [[mountain]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] at {{Convert|4509|m|ft|0}}. It is part of the [[Bismarck Range]] and the peak is the point where three provinces, [[Simbu Province|Simbu]], [[Jiwaka Province|Jiwaka]] and [[Madang Province|Madang]], meet. The peak is also known as ''Enduwa Kombuglu'', or ''Kombugl'o Dimbin'', in the local Kuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Riall W. |last=Nolan |title=Bushwalking in Papua New Guinea |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |edition=1 |year=1983 |isbn=0-908086-41-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is on the island of [[New Guinea]], which incorporates [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. It is surpassed by [[Puncak Jaya]], {{Convert|4884|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and several other peaks in Indonesian Papua.

Mount Wilhelm may be claimed as the highest mountain in [[Oceania]] (including [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]), on account of [[Indonesia]] being in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2007/51-bind.pdf|title=Statistical Yearbook of Croatia, 2007|website=dzs.hr|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Seven Summits]] list may therefore sometimes include Mount Wilhelm.

==History==
===Discovery===
Mount Wilhelm received its name in 1888 when a German newspaper correspondent, [[Hugo Zöller]], climbed the [[Finisterre Range]], south-east of [[Madang]], and named the Bismarck Range after the German Chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], and the four highest peaks of the range after him and his children: Ottoberg, Herbert-berg, Marienberg and Wilhelm-berg.&lt;ref name=LP2&gt;{{Cite book |first=Yvon |last=Pérusse |title=Bushwalking in Papua New Guinea |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |edition=2 |date=July 1993 |isbn=0-86442-052-8 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto-berg seemed to Zöller to be the highest of the range, but it was later discovered to be only {{Convert|11600|ft|m|-1}} and the distant Wilhelmberg was much taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Guinea: The Last Unknown |first=Gavin |last=Souter |year=1963 |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson |isbn=0-207-94627-2|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until August 1938 when [[Leigh Vial]], a government patrol officer, and two Niu Ginians, his "Mangi mastas", "Namba Wan Bare Kuakawa" (Kugl'kane) and "Gend" ("Mondia Nigle"), made the first recorded ascent.&lt;ref name=LP2/&gt; It was noted by Vial that even though the mountain was close to the equator, snow existed on top of the mountain at the time of ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=L.G. |last=Vial |title=The Kamans |journal=Walkabout |date=May 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWII bomber crash===
[[File:Mt Wilhelm US Plane.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A wing from the wreckage of a US Air Force plane that crashed into Mount Wilhelm]]
During the [[Second World War]] in the early hours of May 22, 1944, an [[United States|American]] F-7A (a converted [[B-24 Liberator]]) named "Under Exposed" crashed into the mountain while flying too low. The aircraft left from Nadzab airbase, close to [[Lae]], and had been assigned for a reconnaissance mission to photograph Padaidori Island in [[Dutch New Guinea]]. Around 0400 the plane crashed into Wilhelm at about {{convert|13000|ft|m|}} above the twin lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/b-24/42-73052.html |title=F7-A "Under Exposed" Serial Number 42-73052 |work=Pacific Wreck Database |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All crew were killed and most of the wreckage landed in the topmost lake although some can still be seen today. The only remains at the site are from the plane, as all bodies have been recovered.

===Climbing deaths===
A number of people have died trying to climb the mountain. An Australian Army Sergeant, Christopher Donnan, died in December 1971 when he fell down a steep slope. There is a plaque at the point where he was last seen. In August 1995 an Israeli backpacker died after he sprained his ankle and stayed behind while his group continued. He subsequently wandered off the track and fell into a ravine in the pre-dawn darkness. His body was found about a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Papua New Guinea |author=Adrian Lipscomb |author2=Rowan McKinnon|author3=Jon Murray |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=0-86442-402-7 |edition=6 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July 2005 58-year-old Bob Martin, a marketing manager at [[Air Niugini]], suffered a heart attack and died near the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pngbd.com/forum/showpost.php?p=46299&amp;postcount=2 |title=PNG Loses Great Tourism Ambassador |work=Papua New Guinea Business and Tourism Forum |accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TPA Monthly Newsletter Update ISSUE 17 - July - August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, a student from Muaina High School (Muaina High school Mt Wilhelm Expedition) died at Piunde-foot of Mt Wilhelm.  He was later found to be an asthmatic patient.  Another, local Papua New Guinean, from Tari in the Southern Highlands Province, died in 2007 a few meters south of the Christopher Donnan plaque.  Local sources revealed that the deceased was unaware of the warning and was wearing only his sporting suit, T-shirt and Dunlop shoes.  He was covered by debris and fallen rock fragments, forming a talus at the base of the southern tip of the Christopher Donnan section.

== Ascending ==
[[File:Wilhelm sil.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dawn breaking on top of Mount Wilhelm]]
[[File:Mount Wilhelm.png|thumb|250px|right|NASA Landsat image of Mount Wilhelm]]
Mount Wilhelm is the most accessible mountain to climb in Papua New Guinea. Climbers have a choice of two different routes to the top. The most common route starts from the village of Keglsugl at the end of the road from [[Kundiawa]] in [[Simbu Province|Simbu]] province. A harder hike and climb starts from the village of Ambullua in [[Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea|Western Highlands]] province.

The Keglsugl route involves climbing up and through a mountain rain forest and then along an alpine grassland glacial valley to the twin lakes of Piunde and Aunde.  At Piunde there are two huts, one being an old [[Australian National University]] monitoring station and the other an 'A-Frame' hut. Though not a technical climb, various sections can be treacherous in wet weather.  The climb is usually started during the night; the ascent and subsequent descent can take anywhere from nine to 24 hours. Reaching the peak at dawn allows a better chance of clear weather.

The other route from Ambullua is a much more challenging 4-day hike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4396">'''Otis Willard Freeman''' (1889–1964) was an [[United States|American]] [[academic]], writer and [[geographer]].

Freeman was the founding President of the [[Association of Pacific Coast Geographers]] ([[Association of Pacific Coast Geographers|APCG]]); and he was also the first editor of the [[Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers]].

Freeman earned an undergraduate degree [[Albion College]] in 1910.  He continued his studies, earning a master's degree in science from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1913 and post-doctoral work at [[Northwestern University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/5580/1/5.2.pdf  "Register of Officers and Students,"] ''University of Hawaii Quarterly Bulletin.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="579">The '''Poligono di Furbara''' was a small launchpad at the Furbara airport, in the municipality of [[Santa Marinella]], on the Italian coast north of [[Rome]].  It was used for testing the first Italian-designed and built missiles.

It was later abandoned as a launch site.  In the mid-1950s its activities were transferred to the new [[Aeronautica Militare#Target|ITAF]] facilities at [[Salto di Quirra]], on Sardinia.

The formula was developed and  patented in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Rossmo, D. K. (1996). U.S. Patent No. 5,781,704. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[criminologist]] [[Kim Rossmo]] and integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called [http://www.ecricanada.com/rigel/ Rigel].  The Rigel product is developed by the software company [[Environmental Criminology Research Inc.]] (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, T. and Shively, M (2004, December).P. 14.

==Formula==
Imagine a map with an overlaying grid of little squares named sectors. If this map is a [[raster image]] file on a computer, these sectors are pixels. A sector &lt;math&gt;S_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the square on row ''i'' and column ''j'', located at coordinates (''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''Y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'').
The following function gives the probability &lt;math&gt;p_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; of the position of the serial criminal residing within a specific sector (or point) &lt;math&gt;(X_{i},Y_{j})&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Here the summation is over past crimes located at coordinates (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'').
&lt;math&gt;\phi_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] that returns 0 when a point &lt;math&gt;(X_{i},Y_{j})&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the buffer zone B (the neighborhood of a criminal residence that is swept out by a radius of B from its center). &lt;math&gt;\phi_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; allows ''p'' to switch between the two terms.
If a crime occurs within the buffer zone, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt; and, thus, the first term does not contribute to the overall result.
This is a prerogative for defining the first term in the case when the distance between a point (or pixel) becomes equal to zero.
When &lt;math&gt;\phi_{ij} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the 1st term is used to calculate &lt;math&gt;p_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mid X_i - x_n \mid + \mid Y_j - y_n \mid&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Manhattan distance]] between a point &lt;math&gt;(X_{i},Y_{j})&lt;/math&gt; and the ''n''-th crime site &lt;math&gt;(x_{n},y_{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- hiding this until the math gets corrected
==Alternative Implementation==
&lt;math&gt;p_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is not well suited for image processing because of the asymptotic behavior near the coordinates of a crime site.

Alternatively, Rossmo's function may use other [[distance decay]] functions instead of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(\mathrm{Mathattan\;Distance})^f}&lt;/math&gt;.

One method would be to use a probability distribution similar to the [[Gaussian Distribution]] as a distance decay function:

&lt;math&gt;
1^{\mathrm{st}}\mathrm{\;term}(x,y) =
\left\lfloor
(\mathrm{\#\;of\;colors}) \times \sum_{n=1}^{(\mathrm{total\;crimes})}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{(\mid x - C_{n}(x) \mid^{2} + \mid y - C_{n}(y) \mid^{2})}}}
\right\rfloor
&lt;/math&gt;

If implementing on a computer, the maximum value of p() matches the maximum value of a set of colors being used to create the n by m '''Jeopardy Surface''' matrix J. The elements of the matrix J may represent the pixel values of an image.

Where:
&lt;math&gt;
J =
\begin{bmatrix}
p(n,0)   &amp; \cdots   &amp; \;       &amp; p(n,m) \\
\vdots   &amp; \ddots   &amp; \;       &amp; \vdots \\ 
p(x,0)   &amp; \cdots   &amp; p(x,y)   &amp; \vdots \\
\vdots   &amp; \;       &amp; \;       &amp; \vdots \\ 
p(0,0)   &amp; p(1,0)   &amp; p(2,0)   &amp; \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

--&gt;

==Explanation==
The summation in the formula consists of two terms. The first term describes the idea of ''decreasing probability with increasing distance''. The second term deals with the concept of a ''buffer zone''. The variable &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is used to put more weight on one of the two ideas. The variable &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; describes the radius of the buffer zone. The constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is empirically determined.

The main idea of the formula is that the probability of crimes first increases as one moves through the buffer zone away from the ''hotzone'', but decreases afterwards. The variable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen so that it works best on data of past crimes. The same idea goes for the variable &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The distance is calculated with the [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance formula]].

==Applications==
The formula has been applied to fields other than forensics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the buffer zone idea, the formula works well for studies concerning predatory animals such as white sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

This formula and math behind it were used in crime detecting in the [[Pilot (Numb3rs)|Pilot]] episode of the TV series ''[[Numb3rs]]'' and in the 100th episode of the same show, called "[[Disturbed (Numb3rs)|Disturbed]]".
&lt;!-- hiding unused stuff
 ==Distance formula==
Let C be a set of coordinates of sectors of crimes.
:&lt;math&gt;
C = \{
(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots ,  (x_c, y_c)
\} \qquad c \in \mathbb{N}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \in C&lt;/math&gt; is an element in a two-dimensional vector space.
The distance from a given sector ''s'' to all other sectors &lt;math&gt;e \in C_s&lt;/math&gt; is calculated with the [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n |s-e_i| \qquad e_i \in C_s&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Church of St Michael the Archangel and St Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr (interior), 15 Skałeczna street, Kazimierz, Krakow, Poland.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of church]]
'''Church of St Michael the Archangel and St Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr and Pauline Fathers Monastery''', '''Skałka''', which means "a small rock" in [[Polish language|Polish]], is a small outcrop in [[Kraków]] where the Bishop of Kraków [[saint]] [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów]] was slain by order of Polish king [[Bolesław II the Bold]] in 1079. This action resulted in the king's exile and the eventual [[canonization]] of the slain bishop.

== History ==

Located on the [[Vistula]] River south of [[Wawel]], Skałka was part of the island city of [[Kazimierz#Early_history|Kazimierz]] until the nineteenth century, when the Old Vistula was filled in.

Originally, a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church was built there. King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] raised a new [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] church in its place and since 1472 this shrine has been in the possession of a monastic community of [[Pauline Fathers]]. In 1733-1751 the church received a [[baroque]] decor. It is one of the most famous Polish sanctuaries.

== Interior ==

The crypt underneath the church serves as one of [[Poland]]'s "national [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]]s", a burial place for some of the most distinguished Poles, particularly those who lived in Kraków.

* [[Jan Długosz]] (1415–1480), diplomat and historian
* [[Wincenty Pol]] (1807–1872), poet, geographer and freedom fighter
* [[Lucjan Siemieński]] (1809–1877), poet, writer and freedom fighter
* [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] (1812–1887), writer and historian
* [[Teofil Lenartowicz]] (1822–1893), poet and sculptor
* [[Adam Asnyk]] (1838–1897), poet, playwright and freedom fighter
* [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]  (1843–1902), painter
* [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] (1869–1907) poet, playwright and painter
* [[Jacek Malczewski]] (1854–1929), painter
* [[Karol Szymanowski]] (1882–1937), composer and pianist
* [[Ludwik Solski]] (1855–1954), theatre actor and director
* [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] (1882–1954), astronomer and mathematician
* [[Czesław Miłosz]] (1911–2004), poet and essayist, Nobel Prize recipient

== Exterior ==

Outside the church is the Well of Saint Stanislaus.  According to legend, this well is where King Bolesław discarded the bishop's dismembered body, which then miraculously reassembled.  Water from the well is dispensed from a fountain for pilgrims to drink.&lt;ref&gt;http://polishgrammar.com/miracle-water-krakow-st-stanislaus-well/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Pauline fathers added the open-air Altar of the Three Millennia, with statues representing seven important people in Polish history.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George. ''City of Saints''. IMAGE Press, 2015, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Augustyn Kordecki]] (1603–1673), prior of [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] during the [[Siege of Jasna Góra]]
* [[Jadwiga of Poland]] (1374-1399), first female monarch of the [[Kingdom of Poland]]
* [[Adalbert of Prague]] (956-997), bishop of [[Prague]] and martyr
* [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów]] (1030-1079), bishop of [[Kraków]] and martyr
* [[Pope John Paul II]] (1920-2005), archbishop of [[Kraków]], elected Pope in 1978 
* [[Faustina Kowalska]] (1905-1938), nun whose mystical revelations inspired the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion
* [[John Cantius | Jan Kanty]] (1390-1473), priest and professor of philosophy and theology at the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]]

Six of these people (the exception being Kordecki) are venerated as saints in the [[Catholic Church]].

The '''spice trade
refers to the [[trade]] between historical civilizations in [[Asia]], [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]] and [[Europe]]. Spices such as [[cinnamon]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], and [[turmeric]] were known and [[Spice use in Antiquity|used in antiquity]] for commerce in the [[Eastern World]].&lt;ref name=EB1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/spice-trade |title=Spice Trade |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opium was a part of the spice trade and some people involved in the spice trade were driven by opium addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|title=Opium Throughout History {{!}} The Opium Kings {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, M.

Kerala, referred to as the land of spices or as the "Spice Garden of India", was the place traders and explorers wanted to reach, including [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Vasco da Gama]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/of-kerala-egypt-and-the-spice-link/article5625620.ece | location=Thiruvananthapuram, India | work=The Hindu | title=Of Kerala Egypt and the Spice link | date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greco-Roman world]] followed by trading along the [[Incense route]] and the [[Roman trade with India|Roman-India routes]].&lt;ref name="Fage 1975: 164"&gt;Fage 1975: 164&lt;/ref&gt; During the first millennium, the sea routes to India and [[Sri Lanka]] (the Roman – [[Taprobane]]) were controlled by the Indians and [[Ethiopian]]s who became the maritime trading power of the [[Red Sea]]. The [[Aksumite Empire|Kingdom of Axum]] (c. 5th-century BC–AD 11th century) had pioneered the [[Red Sea]] route before the 1st century AD. By mid-7th century AD after the [[rise of Islam]], Arab traders started dominating the maritime routes.

Arab traders eventually took over conveying goods via the [[Levant]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchants to [[Europe]] until the rise of the [[Ottoman Turks]] cut the route again by 1453. Overland routes helped the spice trade initially, but maritime [[trade route]]s led to tremendous growth in commercial activities.&lt;ref name=EB1/&gt; During the [[High Middle Ages|high]] and [[Late Middle Ages|late]] medieval periods Muslim traders dominated maritime spice trading routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in East Asia and shipping spices from trading emporiums in India westward to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the Red Sea, from which overland routes led to Europe.

The trade was changed by the European [[Age of Discovery]],&lt;ref name=Donkin/&gt; during which the spice trade, particularly in [[black pepper]], became an influential activity for European traders.&lt;ref name=CornPrologue&gt;Corn &amp; Glasserman 1999: Prologue&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cape Route]] from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.&lt;ref name=Columbia1/&gt;

This trade, which drove the world economy from the end of the [[Middle Ages]] well into the [[Early Modern|modern times]],&lt;ref name=CornPrologue/&gt; ushered in an age of European domination in the East.&lt;ref name=Columbia1/&gt; Channels, such as the [[Bay of Bengal]], served as bridges for cultural and commercial exchanges between diverse cultures&lt;ref name=Donkin/&gt; as nations struggled to gain control of the trade along the many spice routes.&lt;ref name=EB1/&gt; European dominance was slow to develop. The Portuguese trade routes were mainly restricted and limited by the use of ancient routes, ports, and nations that were difficult to dominate. The Dutch were later able to bypass many of these problems by pioneering a direct ocean route from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to the [[Sunda Strait]] in [[Indonesia]].

[[File:Spices in an Indian market.jpg|thumb|The spice trade from India attracted the attention of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], and subsequently the [[Roman empire]].]]
[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|Roman trade with India according to the ''Periplus Maris Erythraei,'' ([[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]) 1st century CE.]]

The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had traded in the [[Red Sea]], spices from the "[[Land of Punt]]" and from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2001: 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxury goods]] traded along the [[Incense Route]] included Indian spices, [[ebony]], [[silk]] and fine [[textiles]]. The spice trade was associated with overland routes early on but maritime routes proved to be the factor which helped the trade grow.&lt;ref name=EB1/&gt; The [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] had developed trade with India using the Red Sea ports.&lt;ref name=Shaw1&gt;Shaw 2003: 426&lt;/ref&gt;

People from the [[Neolithic]] period traded in [[spice]]s, [[obsidian]], [[sea shells]], [[precious stones]] and other high-value materials as early as the 10th millennium BC. The first to mention the trade in historical periods are the Egyptians. In the 3rd millennium BC, they traded with the [[Land of Punt]], which is believed to have been situated in an area encompassing northern [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]] and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first millennium BC the [[Arabs]], [[Phoenicians]], and Indians were engaged in sea and land trade in luxury goods such as spices, gold, precious stones, leather of rare animals, ebony and pearls. The sea trade was in the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The sea route in the Red Sea was from [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] to Berenike and from there by land to the [[Nile]] and then by boats to [[Alexandria]]. The land trade was in deserts of Western Arabia using camels. The [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]] were trading in spices (mainly [[cinnamon]] and [[Cassia bark|cassia]]) with [[East Africa]] using [[Catamaran]] boats and sailing with the help of the [[Westerlies]] in the Indian Ocean.

In the second half of the first millennium BC the [[Arab tribes]] of South and West Arabia took control over the land trade of spices from [[South Arabia]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The tribes were the [[M'ain]], [[Qataban]], [[Hadhramaut]], [[Saba]] and [[Himyarite]]. In the north the [[Nabateans]] took control of the trade route that crossed the [[Negev]] from [[Petra]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The trade made the Arab tribes very rich. The [[South Arabia]] region was called [[Arabia Felix|Eudaemon Arabia]] (the elated Arabia) by the Greeks and was on the agenda of conquests of [[Alexander of Macedonia]] before he died. The Indians and the Arabs had control over the sea trade with India. In the late second century BC, the [[Greeks]] from [[Egypt]] learned from the Indians how to sail directly from [[Aden]] to the West coast of India using the monsoon winds ([[Hippalus]]) and took control over the sea trade.

==Arab trade and medieval Europe==
[[File:Italy to India Route.svg|thumb|Trade route in the [[Red Sea]] linking Italy to south-west India]]

Rome played a part in the spice trade during the 5th century, but this role, unlike the Arabian one, did not last through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=EB1/&gt; The rise of Islam brought a significant change to the trade as [[Radhanite]] Jewish and Arab merchants particularly from [[Egypt]] eventually took over conveying goods via the [[Levant]] to [[Europe]].

The Spice trade had brought great riches to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and even inspired famous legends such as that of [[Sinbad the Sailor]]. These early sailors and merchants would often set sail from the port city of [[Basra]] and eventually after many voyages they would return to sell their goods including spices in [[Baghdad]]. The fame of many spices such as [[nutmeg]] and [[cinnamon]] are attributed to these early Spice merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-3sindbad.htm |title=The Third Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman – The Arabian Nights – The Thousand and One Nights – Sir Richard Burton translator |publisher=Classiclit.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2012}}

The Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and [[Persia]] during the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref name=Donkin1&gt;Donkin 2003: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Arab traders – mainly descendants of sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] – dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the [[Far East]] – linking to the secret "spice islands" ([[Maluku Islands]] and [[Banda Islands]]). The islands of [[Molucca]] also find mention in several records: a Javanese chronicle (1365) mentions the Moluccas and ''Maloko'';&lt;ref name=Donkin6&gt;Donkin 2003: 88&lt;/ref&gt; and navigational works of the 14th and 15th centuries contain the first unequivocal Arab reference to Moluccas.&lt;ref name=Donkin6/&gt; Sulaima al-Mahr writes: "East of [[Timor]] [where [[sandalwood]] is found] are the islands of ''Bandam'' and they are the islands where nutmeg and mace are found. The islands of [[cloves]] are called ''Maluku'' ....."&lt;ref name=Donkin6/&gt;

Moluccan products were then shipped to trading emporiums in India, passing through ports like [[Kozhikode]], and through [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Donkin4&gt;Donkin 2003: 92&lt;/ref&gt; from there they were shipped westward across the ports of Arabia to the Near East, to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]] and sometimes shipped to [[East Africa]], where they would be used for many purposes, including burial rites.&lt;ref name=Donkin4/&gt; The [[Abbasids]] used Alexandria, [[Damietta]], [[Aden]] and [[Siraf]] as entry ports to India and China.&lt;ref name=Donkin3&gt;Donkin 2003: 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of [[musk]], [[camphor]], [[ambergris]] and [[sandalwood]] to [[Ibn Ziyad]], the [[sultan]] of [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=Donkin3/&gt;

Indian spice exports find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century).&lt;ref name=Donkin4/&gt; Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] mentions the town of [[Puri]] where "merchants depart for distant countries."&lt;ref name=Donkin2&gt;Donkin 2003: 65&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. From the 8th until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighboring [[Maritime Republics|maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and in-demand products of the Middle Ages, used in [[medicine]]. They were all imported from Asia and Africa. Venetian merchants distributed then the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined land-sea routes.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The [[Republic of Venice]] had become a formidable power, and a key player in the Eastern spice trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migration-diffusion.info/article.php?id=40 |title=The spice trade and its importance for European expansion |last1=Pollmer |first1=Priv.Doz. Dr. Udo

Other powers, in an attempt to break the Venetian hold on spice trade, began to build up maritime capability.&lt;ref name=EB1/&gt; Until the mid-15th century, trade with the east was achieved through the [[Silk Road]], with the Byzantine Empire and the [[Italian city-states]] of [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]] acting as a middle man.

In 1453, however, the Ottomans took [[Constantinople]] and so the [[Byzantine Empire]] was no more. Now in control of the sole spice trade route that existed at the time, the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in a favorable position to charge hefty taxes on merchandise bound for the west. The Western Europeans, not wanting to be dependent on an expansionist, non-Christian power for the lucrative commerce with the east, set out to find an alternate sea route around [[Africa]].

The first country to attempt to circumnavigate Africa was Portugal, which had, since the early 15th century, begun to explore northern Africa under [[Henry the Navigator]]. Emboldened by these early successes and eyeing a lucrative monopoly on a possible sea route to the [[Indies]] the Portuguese first crossed the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488 on an expedition led by [[Bartolomeu Dias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04775b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Bartolomeu Dias] Retrieved November 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Just nine years later in 1497 on the orders of [[Manuel I of Portugal]], four vessels under the command of navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to [[Malindi]] to sail across the [[Indian Ocean]] to [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], on the [[Malabar Coast]].&lt;ref name=Columbia1&gt;Gama, Vasco da. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in south India – the capital of the local [[Zamorin]] rulers. The wealth of the [[Indies]] was now open for the Europeans to explore; the [[Portuguese Empire]] was the earliest European seaborne empire to grow from the spice trade.&lt;ref name=Columbia1/&gt;

[[File:Anonymous The Noord-Nieuwland in Table Bay, 1762.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Dutch ships in [[Table Bay]] docking at the [[Cape Colony]] at the Cape of Good Hope, 1762.]]

It was during this time that Spanish and Portuguese explorers first set foot on the [[New World]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first to do so in 1492 while sailing westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on an expedition to the indies. Instead of reaching Asia, Colombus [[Discovery of the Americas|discovered the Americas]], landing on an island in what is now [[the Bahamas]]. Believing to have in fact reached India, the crew named the natives "Indians", a name which has continued in use to this day, to describe the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1.shtml  The First Voyage of Columbus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231834/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1.shtml |date=2007-10-12 }} Retrieved November 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Just eight years later in 1500, the Portuguese navigator, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] while attempting to reproduce Vasco da Gama’s Atlantic route to the Cape and India was blown westwards to what is today [[Brazil]]. After taking possession of the new land, Cabral resumed his voyage across the Atlantic to the southern tip of Africa and India, finally arriving there in September 1500&amp;nbsp;– opening for the first time a route from the New World to Asia&amp;nbsp;– and returning to Portugal by 1501.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03128a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pedralvarez Cabral] Retrieved November 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the center of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic and exploratory missions, including to the Moluccas. Getting to know the secret location of the ''[[Spice Islands]]'', mainly the Banda Islands, then the world source of nutmeg and cloves, he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda, where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nathaniels-Nutmeg-Courage-Changed-History/dp/0340696761] ''Nathaniel's Nutmeg: How One Man's Courage Changed the Course of History'', Milton, Giles (1999), pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Abreu`s expedition reached [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram Island|Seram]] Islands, and then Banda. Later, after a forced separation and a shipwreck, his vice-captain, [[Francisco Serrão]] went again to the north, to Ambon, and reached [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the {{Interlanguage link multi|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate|pt}}.

From 1507–1515 Albuquerque tried to completely block Arab and other traditional routes that stretched from the shores of Western Pacific to the Mediterranean sea, through the conquest of strategic bases in the Persian Gulf and at the entry of the Red Sea. By the early 16th century the Portuguese had complete control of the African sea route, which since 1512, through a long network of routes that linked three oceans, extended from the Moluccas (the Spice Islands), in the Pacific Ocean limits, through Malacca, India and Sri Lanka (linked years later to [[China]] and [[Japan]]), to [[Lisbon]] in Portugal (Europe), via the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans.

The [[Crown of Castile]] organized the expedition of Christopher Columbus to compete with Portugal for the spice trade with Asia, but instead, landed in a New World. The search for a route to Asia was resumed a few years later, after explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in 1513 and became the first European to sight the Pacific Ocean from the New World, confirming that the Americas were separate continents. The Spanish crown then prepared a [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|great westward voyage]] with [[Ferdinand Magellan]], in order to reach Asia from Spain across the Atlantic, and then Pacific Oceans. On October 21, 1520, his expedition crossed [[Strait of Magellan|the strait that bears his name]] in the southern tip of South America, opening the Pacific to European exploration. On March 16, 1521, the ships reached the [[Philippines]] and soon after the Spice Islands, ultimately resulting in the [[Manila Galleons|Manila Galleon]] trade, the first westward spice trade route to Asia.

After Magellan's death in the Philippines, navigator [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] took command of the expedition and drove it across the Indian Ocean and back to Spain, where they arrived in 1522 aboard the last remaining ship: the ''Victoria''. These explorers became the first men to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe. For the next two and half centuries, Spain controlled a vast trade network that linked three continents: Asia, the Americas and Europe. A global spice route had been created: from [[Manila]] in the Philippines (Asia) to [[Seville]] in Spain (Europe), via [[Acapulco]] in [[Mexico]] (North America).

==Cultural diffusion==

[[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with economic activity and commerce as patrons entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economy by estate management, craftsmanship promotion of trading activities.&lt;ref name=Donkin67&gt;Donkin 2003: 67&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], in particular, traveled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art and literacy.&lt;ref name=Donkin69&gt;Donkin 2003: 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] spread throughout the East, reaching [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] in the 10th century; Muslim merchants played a crucial part in the trade.&lt;ref name=Corn0&gt;Corn &amp; Glasserman 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries, such as [[Saint Francis Xavier]], were instrumental in the spread of [[Christianity]] in the East.&lt;ref name="Corn0"/&gt; Christianity competed with Islam to become the dominant religion of the Moluccas.&lt;ref name="Corn0"/&gt; However, the natives of the Spice Islands accommodated aspects of both religions easily.&lt;ref&gt;Corn &amp; Glasserman 1999: 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese colonial settlements saw traders such as the Gujarati [[Vanika|banias]], South Indian Chettis, [[Syriac Christians|Syrian Christians]], Chinese from [[Fujian]] province, and Arabs from [[Aden]] involved in the spice trade.&lt;ref name=Collingham56&gt;Collingham 56: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Epics, languages, and cultural customs were borrowed by Southeast Asia from India, and later China.&lt;ref name=Donkin&gt;Donkin 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of [[Portuguese language]] became essential for merchants involved in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Corn &amp; Glasserman 1999: 203&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial pepper trade drastically changed the experience of modernity in Europe and in Kerala and it brought, along with colonialism, early capitalism to India's Malabar Coast, changing cultures of work and caste.&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Kottayil Kalidasan, 'The Routes of Pepper: Colonial Discourses around the Spice Trade in Malabar', Kerala Modernity: Ideasa, Spaces and Practices in Transition, Ed.

Indian merchants involved in spice trade took [[Indian cuisine]] to Southeast Asia, notably present day [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], where spice mixtures and [[Curry|curries]] became popular.&lt;ref name=Collingham245&gt;Collingham 245: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; European people intermarried with the Indians, and popularized valuable culinary skills, such as [[baking]], in India.&lt;ref name=Collingham61&gt;Collingham 61: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese also introduced vinegar to India, and [[Franciscan|Franciscan priests]] manufactured it from coconut toddy.&lt;ref name=Collingham69&gt;Collingham 69: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indian food, adapted to the European palate, became visible in England by 1811 as exclusive establishments began catering to the tastes of both the curious and those returning from India.&lt;ref name=Collingham129&gt;Collingham 129: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lifezones Pengo, TSMF.svg|thumb|right|350px|Tropical and subtropical moist forests (TSMF) as shown within the [[Holdridge Life Zones]] classification scheme, and includes moist forests, wet forests, and rainforests.]]

'''Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests''' (TSMF), also known as '''tropical moist forests''', are a [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] [[forest]] [[biome]], sometimes referred to as [[jungle]].

== Definition ==
[[File:800px-tropical wet forests.png|thumb|left|General distribution of tropical moist forests]]

The biome includes several types of forests:

*'''Lowland equatorial evergreen rain forests''', commonly known as '''[[tropical rainforest]]s''', are forests which receive high rainfall ([[tropical rainforest climate]] with more than 2000&amp;nbsp;mm, or 80&amp;nbsp;inches, annually) throughout the year. These forests occur in a belt around the equator, with the largest areas in the [[Amazon basin]] of South America, the [[Congo basin]] of central [[Africa]], and parts of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. [[File:Fluss Dja Somalomo.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Rainforest]] lining a river bank, [[Cameroon]]]]
* '''[[Tropical seasonal forest]]s''', also known as '''moist deciduous''', '''monsoon''' or '''semi-evergreen (mixed) seasonal''' forests, have a [[tropical monsoon climate|monsoon]] or wet [[Tropical savanna climate|savannah]] climates (as in the [[Köppen climate classification]]): receiving high overall rainfall with a warm summer [[wet season]] and (often) a cooler winter [[dry season]]. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season. These forests are found in [[South Florida]], parts of South America, in [[Central America]] and around the [[Caribbean]], in coastal [[West Africa]], parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and across much of [[Indochina]].
* '''Montane rain forests''' are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas. Those with elevations high enough to regularly encounter low-level cloud cover are known as [[cloud forest]]s.
* '''Flooded forests''', including [[freshwater swamp forest]]s and [[peat swamp forest]]s.

In contrast to TSMF, tropical forest regions with lower levels of rainfall are home to [[tropical dry broadleaf forest]]s and [[tropical coniferous forests]]. [[Temperate rain forest]]s also occur in certain humid temperate coastal regions. Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests are common in several terrestrial [[ecozone]]s, including parts of:

* The '''[[Afrotropic]]''' (equatorial [[Africa]])
* '''[[Indomalaya]]''' (parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]])
* The '''[[Neotropic]]''' (northern [[South America]] and [[Central America]])
* '''[[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]]''' (eastern [[Indonesia]], [[New Guinea]], northern and eastern [[Australia]])
* '''[[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]]''' (the tropical islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]])

About half of the world's tropical rainforests are in the South American countries of [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]. [[Rainforest]]s now cover less than 6% of Earth's land surface. Scientists estimate that more than half of all the world's plant and animal species live in tropical rainforests.

'''Värriö Strict Nature Reserve''' (''Värriön luonnonpuisto'') is a [[strict nature reserves of Finland|strict nature reserve]] located in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], [[Finland]]. It was established in 1981.  Moving in the natural park happens under license. In the area there is a research station and the only way to go there is by trail. The studies there are connected to [[reindeer herding]] and predators, such as [[wolves]] and [[wolverines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">'''Xerox PARC Map Viewer''' was one of the earliest static [[web mapping]] sites, developed by [[Steve Putz]] in June 1993 at [[Xerox Corporation]]'s [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC). The Xerox PARC Map Viewer was an experiment in providing interactive [[information retrieval]], rather than access to just static files, on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Putz |first=Steve |title=Interactive Information Services Using World-Wide Web Hypertext |url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/www94/iisuwwwh.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628195239/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/www94/iisuwwwh.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Map Viewer used a customized [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] [[server (computing)|server]] module written in [[Perl]].  Map images were generated in [[GIF]] format from two server side programs.  MAP-WRITER created the [[raster image]]s from the geographic database and RASTOGIF would convert the raster image into the GIF format.

Xerox has since discontinued the Map Viewer service.
