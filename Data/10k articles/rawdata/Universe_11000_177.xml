Its name derives from the Latin ''arachis''—peanut. It can be formed by the [[hydrogenation]] of [[arachidonic acid]].

Reduction of arachidic acid yields [[arachidyl alcohol]].

Arachidic acid is used for the production of detergents, photographic materials and lubricants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11880">The '''Archard wear equation''' is a simple [[mathematical model|model]] used to describe sliding [[wear]] and is based on the theory of [[Asperity (materials science)|asperity]] contact. The Archard equation was developed much later than '''{{ill|Reye's hypothesis|it|Ipotesi di Reye}}''' (sometimes also known as '''energy dissipative hypothesis'''), though both came to the [[multiple discovery|same physical conclusions]], that the volume of the removed debris due to [[wear]] is proportional to the work done by friction forces. [[Theodor Reye]]'s model&lt;ref name="Reye_1860"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rühlmann_1979"/&gt; became popular in Europe and it is still taught in university courses of [[applied mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Villaggio_2001"/&gt; Until recently, Reye's theory of 1860 has, however, been totally ignored in English and American literature&lt;ref name="Villaggio_2001"/&gt; where subsequent works by [[Ragnar Holm]]&lt;ref name="Holm_1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holm_1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holm_1967"/&gt; and [[John Frederick Archard]] are usually cited.&lt;ref name="Ponter_2013"/&gt; In 1960, {{ill|Mikhail Mikhailovich Khrushchov|ru|Хрущов, Михаил Михайлович}} and Mikhail Alekseevich Babichev published a [[multiple discovery|similar model]] as well.&lt;ref name="Khrushchov_1960"/&gt; In modern literature, the relation is therefore also known as '''Reye–Archard–Khrushchov wear law'''.

==Equation==
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac {KWL}H&lt;/math&gt;
where:&lt;ref name="Archard_1953"/&gt;

: ''Q'' is the total volume of wear debris produced 
: ''K'' is a dimensionless  constant
: ''W'' is the total normal load
: ''L'' is the sliding distance
: ''H'' is the [[hardness]] of the softest contacting surfaces

Note that &lt;math&gt;WL&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the work done by the friction forces as described by Reye's hypothesis.

==Derivation==
The equation can be derived by first examining the behavior of a single asperity.
:
The local load &lt;math&gt;\, \delta W &lt;/math&gt;, supported by an asperity, assumed to have a circular cross-section with a radius &lt;math&gt;\, a &lt;/math&gt;, is:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = P \pi {a^2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the yield pressure for the asperity, assumed to be deforming plastically. ''P'' will be close to the indentation [[hardness]], ''H'', of the asperity.

If the volume of wear debris, &lt;math&gt;\, \delta V &lt;/math&gt;, for a particular asperity is a hemisphere sheared off from the asperity, it follows that:
: &lt;math&gt; \delta V = \frac 2 3 \pi a^3 &lt;/math&gt;

This fragment is formed by the material having slid a distance 2''a''

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\, \delta Q &lt;/math&gt;, the wear volume of material produced from this asperity per unit distance moved is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta Q = \frac {\delta V} {2a}  = \frac {\pi a^2} 3 \equiv \frac {\delta W} {3P} \approx \frac {\delta W} {3H}&lt;/math&gt;     making the approximation that &lt;math&gt;\,P \approx H&lt;/math&gt;

However, not all asperities will have had material removed when sliding distance 2''a''. Therefore, the total wear debris produced per unit distance moved, &lt;math&gt;\, Q &lt;/math&gt; will be lower than the ratio of ''W'' to ''3H''. This is accounted for by the addition of a dimensionless constant ''K'', which also incorporates the factor 3 above. These operations produce the Archard equation as given above. Archard interpreted ''K'' factor as a probability of forming wear debris from asperity encounters.&lt;ref name="Archard_1956"/&gt; Typically for 'mild' wear, ''K''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas for 'severe' wear, ''K''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Recently,&lt;ref name="Aghababaei_2016"/&gt; it has been shown that there exists a critical length scale that controls the wear debris formation at the asperity level. This length scale defines a critical junction size, where bigger junctions produce debris, while smaller ones deform plastically.

An '''aspirator''' is a type of [[Injector|ejector-jet pump]], which produces [[vacuum]] by means of the [[Venturi effect]].

In an aspirator, fluid (liquid or gaseous) flows through a tube that first narrows and then expands in cross-sectional area. When the tube narrows, the fluid pressure decreases. In this narrow area the fluid velocity must increase to conserve mass continuity. Where the tube narrows, a vacuum is drawn because of the Venturi effect.

==Operation==
The cheap and simple '''water aspirator''' is the most common type of aspirator. It is used in [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] [[laboratories]] and consists of a [[tee]] fitting attached to a [[Tap (valve)|tap]] and has a [[Hose barb fitting|hose barb]] at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. In the past, water aspirators were common for low-strength vacuums in chemistry benchwork. However, they are water-intensive, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for (i.e. solvent removal), they can violate environmental protection laws such as the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976|RCRA]] by mixing potentially hazardous chemicals into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.

If a liquid is used as the working fluid, the strength of the [[vacuum]] produced is limited by the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (for water, {{convert|3.2|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or|lk=on}} or 32 [[mbar]] at {{convert|25|°C|°F|lk=on|disp=or}}).  If a gas is used, however, this restriction does not exist. The industrial [[Injector|steam ejector]] (also called the "steam jet ejector", "steam aspirator", or "steam jet aspirator") uses steam as a working fluid.

In order to avoid using too much steam, a single steam-ejector stage is generally not used to generate vacuum below approximately 10 [[kPa]] (75 [[mmHg]]).&lt;ref name="hv"&gt;''High Vacuum Pumping Equipment'', B. D. Power, New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966, chapter 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To generate higher vacuum, multiple stages are used; in a two-stage [[Injector|steam ejector]], for example, the second stage provides vacuum for the waste steam output by the first stage. Condensers may be used between stages to reduce the load on the later stages. Steam ejectors with two, three, four, five and six stages may be used to produce vacuums down to 2.5 [[Pascal (pressure)|kPa]], 300 Pa, 40 Pa, 4 Pa, and 0.4 Pa, respectively.&lt;ref name="hv" /&gt;

The '''air ejector''' or '''Venturi pump''' is similar to the steam ejector but uses high-pressure air as the working fluid. They are called Vacuum Ejectors and they generate vacuum by changing the pressure of the compressed air. Multistage air ejectors can be used, but since air cannot easily be condensed at room temperature, an air ejector is usually limited to two stages.

'''''Astrocaryum murumuru''''' (Portuguese [[common name]]'' murumuru'') is a [[Arecaceae|palm]] native to [[Amazon Rainforest]] [[vegetation]] in [[Brazil]], which bears [[Eating|edible]] fruits.  ''Murumuru'' butter, extracted from the seeds of the plant, may be used as a moisturizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/image/la-ig-edible-20100613,0,7284731.story |date=13 June 2010 |title=Makeup and skin products that are fresh, new and natural |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=10 July 2010 | first=Kavita | last=Daswani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''murumuru'' palm trees grow in Brazil and around the Amazon and are one of the dominant trees in this region. It has a thick trunk and a shuttlecock-shaped, bushy crown.  The nutritious, edible fruits are an important local food source and materials made from the tree, fruit, and seed kernels are commercially significant to the region.  Hammocks are made from the tree’s fibres.  ''Murumuru'' butter is highly emollient and moisturizing. It is also film-forming and naturally glossy. These qualities make it very protective. It contains vitamins and has a high content of beneficial oleic acid. The oil from the seeds is traditionally used to soften and protect hair.  ''Murumuru'' butter is the white to yellowish fat obtained from the seeds of the ''murumuru'' palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lushusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Lush-Site/en_US/Lushopedia-Start?iid=10219|title=Murumuru Butter Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics US|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lushusa.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

The Murumuru palm (Astrocaryum murumuru) is abundant in the Brazilian Amazon, extending to the borders of Bolivia and Peru. It prefers to grow in periodically flooded areas, especially on islands and in lowlands along the rivers throughout the Amazon River estuary and its tributaries, in dense or semi-open forests.&lt;ref&gt;LORENZI, H. Árvores Brasileiras. Op. cit., 2002, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also frequently found in the lowlands of Marajo Island. The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting. When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean. The seed’s hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100&amp;nbsp;kg of dry seeds (12%– 15% water) yields 27&amp;nbsp;kg to 29&amp;nbsp;kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil. A single Murumuru palm produces about 11&amp;nbsp;kg of dry seeds. Hydraulic extraction can produce 35% oil relative to the dry weight of the kernel, which is equivalent to about 3.8 liters of oil per Murumuru palm. The kernels must be ground with grinding discs before hydraulic extraction. A kilogram of fruit pulp contains approximately 50 seeds. Seed germination is moderate and growth in the field is slow. .&lt;ref&gt;MORAIS, L.: Banco de Dados Sobre Espécies Oleaginosas da Amazônia, não-publicado.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PINTO, G.P.

==Astrocaryum murumuru butter==
[[File:Murumuru butter.JPG|thumb|Murumuru butter]]

Murumuru butter contains [[lauric acid|lauric]], [[myristic acid|myristic]], and [[oleic acid]]s. The fruit contains a white butter that is odorless and tasteless and has the advantage of not becoming rancid easily. The quality of Murumuru butter is similar to the seed fat of the [[Tucumã palm]] and [[coconut palm]], but it has the advantage of providing greater consistency because of its melting point (33 C), which is superior to that of the Tucumã palm (30&amp;nbsp;°C) and coconut palm (22.7&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;LORENZI, H. Árvores Brasileiras. Op. cit., 2002, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Murumuru butter makes it possible to mix it with other vegetable butters that have a lower melting point. It can also be used to partially substitute cocoa butter in chocolate, providing a firmer consistency in environments where the temperature is higher.&lt;ref&gt;MORAIS, L.: Banco de Dados Sobre Espécies Oleaginosas da Amazônia, não-publicado.&lt;/ref&gt;
Murumuru butter has the great advantage of having a low acidity value (4% to 5%), especially when made from fresh seeds, which reduces the cost of refinement.&lt;ref&gt;PESCE, C. Oleaginosas da Amazônia, 1941, Oficinas Gráficas da Revista Veterinária, Belém/PA.&lt;/ref&gt;
Murumuru butter was highly valued in Europe and the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, when it served as an ingredient in vegetable creams and soaps. Today, soaps containing Murumuru butter together with Ucuuba butter leave a protection layer on the skin similar to silicone, only it does not clog the pores.&lt;ref&gt;PINTO, G.P. Características físico-químicas e outras informações sobre as principais oleaginosas do Brasil. Recife: Instituto de Pesquisas e Experimentação Agropecuárias do Nordeste, Boletim Técnico 18, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of these two butters is a treatment for dry and tired skins.{{medcn|date=September 2017}}. In hair products, Murumuru butter helps to maintain curls, while nourishing and strengthening hair roots. Murumuru butter is used in small amounts in shampoos (0.5% to 1%) and formulas for conditioners, creams, soaps, lipsticks and deodorants (0.5% to 8%).&lt;ref&gt;PINTO, G.P.

[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|alt=A black symbol on a yellow background|thumb|The biohazard symbol]]'''Biological hazards''', also known as '''biohazards''', refer to [[biological]] substances that pose a threat to the health of [[living organisms]], primarily that of humans. This can include samples of a [[microorganism]], [[virus]] or [[toxin]] (from a biological source) that can affect human [[health]]. It can also include substances harmful to other animals.
[[File:Biohazard Symbol Specification.png|thumb|alt=The Biohazard Symbol with dimensions as defined in https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up]]

The term and [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|its associated symbol]] are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions.  The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the [[Dow Chemical Company]] on the containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm |title=Biohazard Symbol History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213165520/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/biosafetyresources/history-of-biohazard-symbol.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]].

In [[Unicode]], the [[biohazard symbol]] is U+2623 (&lt;span style="font-size: larger;"&gt;☣&lt;/span&gt;).

==Classification==
Bio hazardous agents are classified for transportation by [[UN number]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocio.usda.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012/DR9630-001_0.htm |title=USDA Policies and Procedures on Biohazardous Waste Decontamination, Management, and Quality Controls at Laboratories and Technical Facilities |publisher=USDA |author= |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305032934/https://www.ocio.usda.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012/DR9630-001_0.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category A, UN 2814 – Infectious substance, affecting humans: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs.
* Category A, UN 2900 – Infectious substance, affecting animals (only): An infectious substance that is not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans and animals when exposure to themselves occurs.
* Category B, UN 3373 – Biological substance transported for diagnostic or investigative purposes.
* Regulated Medical Waste, UN 3291 – Waste or reusable material derived from medical treatment of an animal or human, or from biomedical research, which includes the production and testing.

== Levels of biohazard ==
{{Main|Biosafety level}}
[[File:Sharps Container.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Immediate disposal of used needles into a [[sharps container]] is standard procedure.]]
[[File:Army trainers teach NHS medics how to put on Ebola safety suits (15650293350).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NHS medics practice using protective equipment used when treating [[Ebola]] patients]]

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) categorizes various diseases in levels of biohazard, Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk.  Laboratories and other facilities are categorized as BSL ([[Biosafety Level]]) 1–4 or as ''P1'' through ''P4'' for short (Pathogen or Protection Level).

* '''Biohazard Level 1:''' Bacteria and viruses including ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', [[Canidae|canine]] [[hepatitis]], ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and [[varicella]] ([[chicken pox]]), as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the biohazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection.
* '''Biohazard Level 2:''' Bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via [[aerosol]] in a lab setting, such as hepatitis [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], and [[hepatitis C|C]], some [[influenza A]] strains, [[Lyme disease]], [[salmonella]], [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[scrapie]], [[dengue fever]], and [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]. Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work (including co-cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 (P2) '''facility''', using BSL-3 practices and procedures.
* '''Biohazard Level 3:''' Bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatments exist, such as [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]], [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS virus]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS coronavirus]], [[hantaviruses]], [[tuberculosis]], [[typhus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. 
* '''Biohazard Level 4:''' Viruses that cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which vaccines or other treatments are ''not'' available, such as [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]], [[Marburg virus]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever]], and other [[viral hemorrhagic fever|hemorrhagic]] diseases and rishibola.  [[Variola virus]] ([[smallpox]]) is an agent that is worked with at BSL-4 despite the existence of a vaccine, as it has been eradicated.  When dealing with biological hazards at this level the use of a [[positive pressure personnel suit]], with a segregated air supply, is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an [[ultraviolet]] light room, [[Autonomous Detection System|autonomous detection system]], and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent both doors opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a [[Biosafety level#Levels|Biosafety Level 4]] (P4) lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Currently there are no bacteria classified at this level.

==Symbol==
{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign}}
The [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|biohazard symbol]] was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article he wrote for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iconglobe.net/blog/2011/01/07/biohazard-symbol-history/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria:
# Striking in form in order to draw immediate attention;
# Unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes;
# Quickly recognizable and easily recalled;
# Symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach;
# Acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds.
The chosen symbol scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072239/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was first specified in [https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up 39 FR 23680] but was dropped in the succeeding amendment. However, various US states adopted the specification for their state code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm WAC 296-800-11045] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210222735/http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm |date=February 10, 2012 }}, see PDF for a high resolution graphic&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four circles within the symbol, signifying the chain of infection.
# Agent: The type of microorganism, that causes infection or hazardous condition.
# Host: The organism in which the microorganism Infect. The new host must be susceptible.
# Source: The host from which the microorganism originate. The carrier host might not show symptoms.
# Transmission: The means of transmission, mostly direct or indirect. Some routes of transmission include air, insect, direct contact and contaminated surfaces.

==Operators==
The Kazakhstan section of pipeline is operated by KazTransGas, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[KazMunayGas]]. The Kyrgyzstan section of pipe line is operated by KyrKazGas, the joint venture of KazTransGas and Kyrgyzgas.

==Future developments==
The technical condition of the pipeline is alarming, particularly in Kyrgyzstan.  Therefore, there are plans for construction of a second trunk gas pipeline and renovation of the existing pipeline.&lt;ref name=tacis&gt;

[[Image:Einot-Zukim001.JPG|thumb|250px|Canebrake in [[Ein Feshkha]], [[West Bank]]]]
A '''canebrake''' or '''canebreak''' is a [[thicket]] of any of a variety of ''[[Arundinaria]]'' grasses: ''[[Arundinaria gigantea|A. gigantea]]'', ''A. tecta'' and ''A. appalachiana''. As a [[bamboo]], these giant [[grasses]] grow in thickets up to 8 m tall. ''A. gigantea'' is generally found in stream valleys and ravines throughout the [[southeastern US]]. ''A. tecta'' is a smaller stature species found on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains. Finally, ''A. appalachiana'' is found in more upland areas at the southern end of the [[Appalachian mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmvjv.org/library/Mgt_Board_June_2007/Tab7/MAV_Desired_Forest_Conditions_Final_Report_2007.pdf | title=Restoration, Management, and Monitoring of Forest Resources in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley: Recommendations for Enhancing Wildlife Habitat | date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canebrakes were formerly widespread in the [[Southern United States]] but have been widely replaced by [[agriculture]]. Concomitant with this destruction have been challenges to the survival of the [[Florida panther]] (''Puma concolor'' subsp. ''coryi'') and [[Bachman's warbler]] (''Vermivora bachmanii''), the latter of which is critically endangered and may in fact be extinct. Other species considered canebrake specialists include several [[butterfly]] species, and [[Swainson's warbler]] (''Limnothlypis swainsonii''). Swainson's warbler has recently been found to use pine plantations (widespread across the Southeastern United States) of a particular age, as they may provide the structural features and prey base that the species seeks.&lt;ref&gt;Graves 2014 http://macroecointern.dk/pdf-reprints/Graves_BCI_2014b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Canes can reproduce asexually and rapidly, an adaptation that allows them to persist quietly in the shade of a forest for years and rapidly take advantage of disturbance which disrupts the overstory, such as blowdowns, [[floods]] or [[hurricanes]]. When released in this way, canes can quickly reoccupy these gaps.

The '''Chevrolet Volt''' is a [[plug-in hybrid]] car manufactured by [[General Motors]], also marketed in [[rebadging|rebadged]] variants as the '''Holden Volt''' in Australia and New Zealand, '''Buick Velite 5''' in China, and with a different [[fascia (car)|fascia]] as the '''Vauxhall Ampera''' in the United Kingdom and as the '''Opel Ampera''' in the remainder of Europe. In November 2018, GM announced it would cease Volt production in March 2019.&lt;ref name="End2019"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1120090_gm-to-kill-chevy-volt-production-in-2019|title=GM to kill Chevy Volt production in 2019 (Updated)|last=Evarts|first=Eric C.|date=2018-11-26|work=Green Car Reports|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the 2011 Volt began in the United States in mid-December 2010, followed by various European countries and other international markets in 2011. Global combined Volt/Ampera-family sales totaled about 177,000 units by the end of October 2018.&lt;ref name=Top5Global102018/&gt; The U.S. is the leading market, with 148,556 Volts delivered through October 2018, followed by Canada with 16,653 Volts sold through September 2018. Just over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Ampera cars had been sold in Europe {{as of|2016|06|lc=y}}, with the Netherlands leading the European region. {{Asof|2018|09}}, the Volt/Ampera family of vehicles is the world's all-time best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle, and the Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling [[plug-in electric car]].

The Volt operates as a pure [[battery electric vehicle]] until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there, its [[internal combustion engine]] powers an electric [[Electric generator|generator]] to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a [[planetary gear]] set, and hence the output drive axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's [[regenerative braking]] also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 [[model year]] Volt [[all-electric range]] is {{convert|38|mi|abbr=on}}, with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of {{Convert|62|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]] (MPG-equivalent).

The [[Chevrolet Volt (second generation)|second-generation Volt]]'s improved battery system and drivetrain increased the all-electric range to {{Convert|53|mi}}, its EPA-rated fuel economy in [[charge-sustaining]] mode to {{Convert|42|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, and the combined city/highway fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] to 106 MPG-e, up from 98 MPG-e. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. and Canada began in October 2015 as a 2016 [[model year]].

The Volt has won several awards, including the 2009 [[Green Car Vision Award]], 2011 [[Green Car of the Year]], 2011 [[North American Car of the Year]], 2011 [[World Car of the Year|World Green Car]], 2012 [[European Car of the Year]], and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include the extent to which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through [[GM bankruptcy|General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy]],&lt;ref name=niedermeyer2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT032412&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/sunday-review/the-electric-car-unplugged.html?ref=automobiles |title=The Electric Car, Unplugged |last=Broder |first=John |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate= 2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USA031312&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/03/gm-executive-bob-lutz-defends-chevrolet-volt/1#.T9lHmNUV3nh |title=Ex-GM Honcho Bob Lutz Defends Embattled Chevrolet Volt |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns about the battery-pack fire risk following a crash test that the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011.&lt;ref name=NYT032412/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA031312/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire5/&gt; At the completion of its investigation, NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind01/&gt;&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind02/&gt;

== History ==

=== Concept vehicle ===
The Chevrolet Volt [[concept car]] debuted at the January 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]], becoming the first-ever [[series hybrid|series]] [[plug-in hybrid]] concept car shown by a major car manufacturer.&lt;ref name=IEEE2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010607&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/01/gm_introduces_e.html?cid=27360790 |title=GM Introduces E-Flex Electric Vehicle System; Chevrolet Volt the First Application |work=[[Green Car Congress]] |publisher=BioAge Group |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Volt concept vehicle had four doors with a rear [[liftgate]] and seating for four passengers. This was a significant change in design when compared to the [[General Motors EV1]] of the 1990s, which only seated two to reduce weight and to make the necessary room for the [[lead-acid battery]] pack. The top speed was also increased on the Volt, from the electronically limited {{convert|80|mph|km/h|-1}} to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|-1}}. The battery pack size was reduced, from about {{convert|300|L|cuft|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in volume in the EV1, to {{convert|100|L|cuft|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in the Volt.&lt;ref name=IEEE2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/lithium-batteries-for-hybrid-cars |title=Lithium Batteries for Hybrid Cars |last=Voelcker |first=John |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102837/http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/lithium-batteries-for-hybrid-cars |archivedate=2011-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|p=43}}

General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]] said the two-seater sports car being developed by [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]], the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], and the rapid advancement of [[lithium-ion]] battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/81580 |title=Bob Lutz: The Man Who Revived the Electric Car |work=Newsweek.com |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91–16&lt;!-- is this to page 116? --&gt; }}{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=4,5}} overcoming internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friend |first=Tad |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/24/090824fa_fact_friend |title=Elon Musk and electric cars |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2009-09-14 |quote= All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us—and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz's initial idea was to develop an [[all-electric car]], but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, [[range anxiety]] concerns, and lack of public [[charging station|charging infrastructure]], they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, so it would be a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}

Most of the Volt initial design parameters defined for the development of the concept car, then referred as the "iCar" in homage to the [[iPod]], were kept throughout the process up to the final production version. A key design parameter was a target of {{convert|40|mi|km}} for the [[all-electric range]], selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs, and mainly because research showed that in the U.S. 78 percent of daily [[commuting|commuters]] travel 40 miles or less. This target range lets drivers make most travel electrically driven, with the assumption that charging takes place at home overnight. This requirement translated to using a [[lithium-ion battery]] pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 {{kWh|link=yes}} considering that the battery would be used until the [[state of charge]] (SOC) of the battery reached 30%. This limit to the SOC was necessary in order to maintain operational performance under a wide range of environments, and to minimize the [[Battery (electricity)#Lifespan of rechargeable batteries|battery degradation]] to allow at least a ten-year life span. The initial target range for the gasoline engine/generator was set between {{Convert|250|to|300|mi}} and the vehicle had to be family size for four or five passengers.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16503845/ns/business-autos/t/gm-unveil-volt-electric-concept-car/|title=GM to unveil Volt electric concept car|agency=Associated Press|work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key design decision was to develop the concept car based on a new family of common [[powertrain]] components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed [[Voltec]] drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain is an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric]], to [[fuel cell vehicle|fuel cell-powered]] or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as [[engine-generator]] sets (genset) fueled by [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[biodiesel]], [[ethanol fuel]] ([[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]]), or [[flex-fuel]] ([[E85]]). [[Regenerative braking]] would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=29–33}}&lt;ref name=ABG010707/&gt; In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=29–33}}

The Volt concept car became the first application of the E-Flex (Voltec) drive system with a combination of an [[electric motor]], the same used in the [[Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell]], a {{convert|16|kW.h|MJ|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[lithium-ion]] battery pack with 136 [[kW]] of peak power, and a genset consisting of a small 1.0 L, 3-cylinder [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[flex-fuel]] capable engine linked to a {{convert|53|kW|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} generator. General Motors called this genset an electric vehicle (EV) range extender. The vehicle was propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of {{convert|120|kW|hp|abbr=on}} delivering 236&amp;nbsp;lb ft (320 Nm) of motoring [[torque]]. The concept car featured several advanced materials from GE Automotive Plastics that helped GM reduce the vehicle weight by up to 50 percent.

The Volt concept featured a {{Convert|12|USgal|L impgal|abbr=on}} fuel capacity providing the vehicle a total driving range of around {{Convert|640|mi|abbr=on}}, which considered a gasoline fuel efficiency of about {{Convert|50|mpgus|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[all-electric range]]. According to General Motors estimates, a daily drive of {{Convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}}, combined with an overnight recharge to support the first 40 all-electric miles, would yield an effective gasoline fuel economy of {{Convert|150|mpgus|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABG010707&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/01/07/detroit-auto-show-general-motors-e-flex-platform/ |title=A Look at the GM E-Flex Platform| last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam|work=Autoblog Green |date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also emphasized that the Volt would further reduce dependence on imported oil if E85 ethanol was used instead of gasoline to power the on-board generator engine. Robert Lutz added that if the driver used E85, "''the fuel economy figure became 525 miles per'' (equivalent) ''petroleum gallon''", as only 15% of gasoline is used in this blend.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=35}}{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=73, 74}} General Motors also noted that actual production of the Volt depended on further battery development, because the required rechargeable batteries needed to make the Volt a viable vehicle did not exist in the market and had yet to be developed.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=73, 74}} The concept car was actually powered by two 12-volt [[Lead–acid battery|conventional car batteries]], just enough power to allow the vehicle to move at low speeds in the stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lutz|first=Bob|title =Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business|year=2011|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover, [[Penguin Group]]|isbn = 978-1-59184-400-6|pages=}} Location 2234 [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production model ===
[[File:2008 Chevrolet Volt hatchback (concept) 01.jpg|thumb|right|First production version of the Chevrolet Volt at the 2008 [[Australian International Motor Show]]]]
The production design model officially unveiled on September 16, 2008, as part of General Motors centennial celebration at the [[Renaissance Center|Wintergarden]] headquarters in Detroit.&lt;ref name=GMPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefix.com/Downloads/Volt.pdf|title=Chevrolet Volt Leads General Motors Into Its Second Century|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2009-12-21|publisher=General Motors Company|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324034213/http://www.prefix.com/Downloads/Volt.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production model differed greatly in design from the original concept car. The carmaker cited necessary [[aerodynamic]] changes needed to reduce the concept car's high [[drag coefficient]] of {{Cd|0.43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/automobiles/21AERO.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Edgy, Yet Still Aerodynamic |last=Patton |first=Phil |work=The New York Times |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to a more efficient {{Cd|0.28}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Don|title=2011 Chevrolet Cruze Eco|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2011-chevrolet-cruze-eco-page-3|work=Car and Driver|accessdate=2012-02-21|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though still somewhat higher than the [[Toyota Prius]] {{Cd|0.25}}. Another reason was the use of General Motors' new global compact vehicle platform [[Delta II platform|Delta II]] to keep costs reasonable, and shared with the 2010 model year [[Chevrolet Cruze]].{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|p=71}} Another significant difference from the concept car is the seating, as the production Volt seats four rather than five passengers. This change was due to the higher-than-usual central tunnel that runs from the front console to the rear seat that houses the car's T-shaped battery pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Motavalli |first=Jim |date=2008-09-21 |title=G.M.

After the concept was put into the pipeline for production, General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt's [[lithium-ion battery]] pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different [[battery cell]] chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=48–57}} Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, [[Compact Power]] (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) cell made by its parent company, [[LG Chemical]]; and [[Continental Automotive Systems]], which uses [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate]] based [[Commodity cell|cylindrical cells]] made by [[A123Systems]].{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=48–57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2007/06/05/breaking-gm-awards-two-battery-development-contracts-for-chevy/|date=2007-06-05|title=GM awards two battery development contracts for Chevy Volt|work=AutoblogGreen |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=84–89}} By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack [[prototype]]s, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008.

In April 2008 General Motors started extensive battery testing.

The 2011 Chevrolet Volt has a {{kWh|16}} / 45 A·h ({{kWh|10.4}} usable) [[lithium-ion battery]] pack that can be [[state of charge|charged]] by plugging the car into a 120-240 VAC residential electrical outlet using the provided [[SAE J1772]]-compliant charging cord. No external charging station is required.&lt;ref name="SAEJ1771" /&gt; The Volt is propelled by an [[electric motor]] with a peak output of {{convert|111|kW|hp|abbr=on}} delivering {{convert|273|lbft|Nm|abbr=on|0}} of torque. Capacity of the battery pack was increased to {{kWh|16.5}} ({{kWh|10.9}} usable) for 2013 models, which increased the all-electric range from {{convert|35|to|38|mi|abbr=on}}. Other specifications remained the same. The battery pack capacity was increased to {{kWh|17.1}} for 2015 models. This incremental upgrade is likely to reflect in an improvement in range over previous model years, but {{as of|2014|07|lc=y}}, the 2015 Volt has not been re-certified with the EPA.&lt;ref name="2015Volt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/2015-volt-gets-17-1-kwh-battery/|title=2015 Volt Gets Larger 17.1-kWh Battery|author=Jeff Cobb|work=HybridCars.com|date=2014-07-06|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While driving, after the Volt battery has dropped to a predetermined threshold from full charge, a small [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 1.4 L [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] gasoline fueled [[internal combustion engine]] (Opel's [[GM Family 0 engine|Family 0]]&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable transportation based on electric vehicle concepts: a brief overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224880220_Sustainable_transportation_based_on_electric_vehicle_concepts_a_brief_overview|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Rittmar|last2=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |date=2010-05-14| accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with approximately {{convert|80|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, powers a 55&amp;nbsp;kW [[electrical generator|generator]] to extend the Volt's range.

Prior to the 2016 model year, the Volt required premium gasoline of [[octane rating|(R+M)/2 octane rating]]{{Sfn|General Motors|2012|pp=9–53}} of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 [[compression ratio]] engine to use more ignition timing advance to maximize fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% compared to regular gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://gm-volt.com/2010/07/30/why-the-volt-requires-premium-gasoline/| title = Why the Volt Requires Premium Gasoline| publisher = GM-Volt | date = 2010-07-30 | accessdate = 2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2010/07/2011-chevy-volt--fill-er-up-with-premium.html|title = 2011 Chevy Volt : Fill 'er Up.

As a result, the fuel filler must be depressurized before opening the tank. Also, the engine management system monitors the time since the engine last ran, and prompts the driver to run past the {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} [[all-electric range]] before recharging to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system automatically runs the maintenance mode, which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate fluids within the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/09/13/new-problem-new-solution-chevrolet-volts-maintenance-mode-w/|title=New Problem, New Solution: Chevrolet Volt's "Maintenance Mode" Will Burn Gas To Prevent Aging |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |publisher=AOL |website=AutoblogGreen |date=2010-09-13|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A configuration with an [[E85]] [[flex-fuel]] capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013.&lt;ref name="NYTVolt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/automobiles/17VOLT.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Chevy%20Volt&amp;st=cse |title=Sorting Myth From Fact as Volt Makes Its Debut |work=The New York Times |last=Mayersohn |first=Norman |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These units are connected via a [[planetary gear]] and three electrically controlled hydraulic [[clutch]]es to provide power output for propulsion in any of four programmed operating modes:&lt;ref name="GM-drive_unit" /&gt;

# Single motor electric – The primary motor runs solely on battery power, maximum propulsion power is 111&amp;nbsp;kW.
# Dual motor electric – At higher vehicle speeds the secondary motor engages over the planetary gear such that it reduces the speed of the primary motor. This facilitates higher efficiency and better mileage for the combined system, without increasing the maximum power.
# Single motor extended – The battery reaches its minimum charge, which triggers the combustion engine. The engine drives the secondary motor as a generator, via the charging electronics, to keep the minimum battery charge level. The primary motor can still provide its 111&amp;nbsp;kW for short acceleration, albeit not sustained.
# Dual motor extended – The electric motors are used again in dual configuration with increased efficiency at higher speeds. Additionally the gasoline engine contributes propulsion power via the planetary gear. While power is drained from the battery the amount is less than in mode 2 for the same propulsion power, thus extending the range.

The drivetrain permits the Volt to operate as a pure [[battery electric vehicle]] until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level, at which time it commences to operate as a [[Types of hybrid vehicle#Series hybrid|series hybrid]] design where the gasoline engine drives the generator, which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors. The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the [[electrical grid]].&lt;br /&gt; While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads, (typically above {{Convert|30|mph}} at light to moderate loads) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels, in which case the Volt operates as a [[Series-parallel hybrid|power-split or series-parallel hybrid]]. After its all-electric range has been depleted, at speeds between {{Convert|30|to|70|mph}}, the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient drive mode, which improves performance and boosts high-speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="NYTVolt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/10/chevy-volt-delivers-novel-two-motor-four-mode-extended-range-electric-drive-system-seamless-driver-e.html#more|title=Chevy Volt Delivers Novel Two-Motor, Four-Mode Extended Range Electric Drive System; Seamless Driver Experience Plus Efficiency|work=Green Car Congress|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While operating modes are switched automatically the Volt allows the driver to choose from three drive modes: normal, sport and mountain. The mountain mode, which is expected to be required only under unusual power demand conditions, increases minimum battery [[state of charge]] (SOC) to around 45%, thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades. The driver hears more engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode.&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode" /&gt; The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher, and the response to the throttle pedal is quicker.&lt;ref name="PM101001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/hybrid-electric/volt-reliability-report-test|title=900 Miles Reliability Report in the Chevy Volt|work=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ampera has an additional option, the "City Mode" or "battery hold", allowing the driver to save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones.&lt;ref name="GCC021711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Differences" /&gt; The 2013 model year Volt includes a "Hold" option to provide the same choice.&lt;ref name="Volt2013_02" /&gt;

The 2011 Volt's [[lithium-ion battery]] (Li-ion) battery pack weighs {{convert|435|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and "consists of 288 individual cells arranged into nine modules. Plastic frames hold pairs of lithium-ion cells that sandwich an aluminum [[cooling fin]]. The design and construction of that aluminum plate was critical to ensuring an even temperature distribution with no hot or cool spots across the flat, rectangular cell. The battery pack has its own cooling circuit that is similar to, but independent from, the engine cooling system."&lt;ref name="Holden2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.print.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Feb/0214_battery.html |title=Cooling Fins Help Keep Chevrolet Volt Battery at Ideal Temperature |publisher=General Motors |location=US |work=GM Volt Media Portal |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chevrolet Volt charging WAS 2011 833.jpg|thumb|left|Inlet for the electrical charger in the left side of the Chevrolet Volt with the manufacturer's provided charging cord]]
For the 2011/2012 model years, the battery pack stores {{kWh|16}} of energy but it is controlled or buffered via the energy management system to use only {{kWh|10.3}} of this capacity to maximize the life of the pack. For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes, as the software only allows the battery to operate within a [[state of charge]] (SOC) window of 65%, after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level. The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions. When the car needs more power, such as in mountain mode, the lower limit of the SOC rises to 45% to ensure enough power is available.&lt;ref name="Holden2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode" /&gt; The battery capacity was increased to {{kWh|16.5}} for the 2013 [[model year]], the SOC window was increased to use {{kWh|10.8}} of the total battery energy, and the buffer to ensure battery life is not reduced. These changes increases the Volt's [[all-electric range]], but charging takes slightly longer. GM achieved the improved battery performance and durability through minor changes to the material composition of the battery cell chemistry.&lt;ref name="Volt2013_02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076766_2013-chevy-volt-gets-38-mile-electric-range-higher-98-mpge-rating|title=2013 Chevy Volt Gets 38-Mile Electric Range, Higher 98-MPGe Rating |last=Voelcker |first=John |website=Green Car Reports |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volt2013_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/06/2013volt-20120607.html |title=GM tweaks battery materials, pack size, SOC window to increase 2013 Chevrolet Volt EV range to 38 miles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Green Car Congress |date=2012-06-07|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite containing near identical energy (+/- {{kWh|0.5}}), the Volt's battery pack is over 70% lighter than the [[EV1]]'s original {{convert|1310|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, {{kWh|16.5}} AC Delco [[lead-acid battery]] pack, mainly because the Volt uses higher [[specific energy]] Li-ion batteries.

==== Fuel economy ====
;United States
[[File:2012 Chevrolet Volt EPA window sticker 0483.jpg|thumb|2012 Volt EPA/DOT Window sticker showed potential fuel cost saving.]]
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) officially rated the 2011 model year Volt's combined city/highway [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in [[all-electric mode]] at 93 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) (2.5 L gasoline equivalent/100&amp;nbsp;km; 112 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent) and 94 MPG-e for the 2012 model year.&lt;ref name="EPA2012mpge" /&gt; 

For the 2012 model year, EPA revised the Volt's fuel economy ratings, increasing the combined city/highway rating in all-electric mode from 93 MPG-e to 94 MPG-e, and the highway rating was increased from 90 MPG-e to 93 MPG-e.&lt;ref name="EPA2012mpge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevsbs.shtml |title=2011–12 Chevrolet Volt|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Fueleconomy.gov |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its improved battery pack, the 2013 model year EPA rating climbed to a combined city/highway fuel economy of 98 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.4 L gasoline equivalent/100&amp;nbsp;km; 118 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent).

;Europe
The Opel Ampera official equivalent fuel consumption under the EU-approved UN ECE R101 standard for plug-in hybrids is {{convert|1.2|L/100 km|mpgus mpgimp|abbr=on|1}} (83.3&amp;nbsp;km/L).&lt;ref name="hede"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hedevang |first=Kurt |url=http://fpn.dk/motor/bil/article2560207.ece |title=Opel Ampera below 600,000 DKK |language=Danish |publisher=Consumer Online |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006071224/http://fpn.dk/motor/bil/article2560207.ece |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a leading Opel engineer prefers saying 169 Wh/km (16.9 kWh/100 km) while battery-powered, and then 20&amp;nbsp;km/L (5 L/100 km) petrol-powered.

===Operating cost and payback period===

According to ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' in December 2011, the Chevrolet Volt fuel cost in electric mode was 3.8[[Cent (currency)|¢]]/mile. &lt;ref name="CR1211"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108013333/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-08 |title=Leaf, Volt Tests Show Electric Cars Cost Less per Mile To Operate |last=Evarts |first=Eric |work=Consumer Reports |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmunds.com]], the price premium paid for the Volt in 2012, after discounting the {{USD|7,500}} [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#New plug-in electric vehicles|U.S. federal tax credit]], takes a long time for consumers to recover in fuel savings, often longer than the normal ownership time period. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/analysis/will-higher-gas-prices-boost-hybrid-ev-sales.html|title=Will Higher Gas Prices Boost Hybrid, EV Sales? |last=Krebs |first=Michelle |website=Edmunds.com|date=2012-02-28|accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Volt received a five-star overall crash safety rating from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), the highest-possible score. This rating was obtained with NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program for 2011 [[model year]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/06/03/chevy-volt-earns-five-star-nhtsa-crash-rating-w-videos |title=Chevy Volt earns five-star NHTSA crash rating |work=AutoblogGreen |last=Blanco |first=Sebastien |date=2011-06-03 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Accident and rescue handling
In August 2010, General Motors began a training program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. .&lt;ref name="1stResponders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/gmfr-20100827.html|title= General Motors Kicks Off National Electric Vehicle Training Tour For First Responders|work=Green Car Congress|date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Warning sounds
Due to significant noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in [[all-electric mode]] at low speeds, the Volt is fitted with a manually activated [[Electric vehicle warning sounds|electronic warning sound system]] called ''Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System'' for use when the car is operating at low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car's presence.&lt;ref name="NYTRingT"&gt;{{cite web |last=Motavalli |first=Jim |date=2010-06-01 |title=Electric Car Warning Sounds: Don’t Expect Ring Tones |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/electric-car-warning-sounds-dont-expect-ringtones/ |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |at=Wheels |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chevrolet Volt WAS 2017 1731.jpg|thumb|left|2017 model year Chevrolet Volt]]

These improvements allow the 2016 Volt to deliver better EPA ratings than the first generation model. The all-electric range was officially rated at {{Convert|53|mi|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|38|mi|abbr=on}} attained by the 2015 Volt. The gains in efficiency allow the second generation Volt to improve its combined fuel economy in gasoline-only ([[charge-sustaining]]) mode to {{Convert|42|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|37|mpgUS|abbr=on}} for the previous model. The official second generation Volt's rating for combined city/highway fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] is 106 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e; 2.2Le/100Km), up from 98 MPG-e (2.4Le/Km) for the 2015 first generation model.&lt;ref name=EPAVolt2016&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/2016-chevrolet-volt-rated-for-53-miles-electric-range/|title=2016 Chevrolet Volt Rated For 53 Miles Electric Range|author=Jeff Cobb|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Volt2015_2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=36863&amp;id=35246|title=Compare Side-by-Side - 2016/2015 Chevrolet Volt|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|date=2015-09-01|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined gasoline-electricity fuel economy rating of the 2016 model year Volt is {{Convert|77|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]], 82 MPG-e (2.9Le/Km) in city driving and 72 MPG-e (3.3Le/Km) in highway.&lt;ref name=EPAtop10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/topten.jsp|title=Fueleconomy.gov's Top Fuel Sippers (EPA Ratings, All Years)

In February 2012 General Motors began deliveries of a low emission version destined for California that features a new low emissions package that allows the 2012 Chevrolet Volt to qualify as an enhanced, advanced technology –partial zero emissions vehicle (enhAT-PZEV) and have access to California’s [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s (HOV).&lt;ref name=HOV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2012/02/24/gm-starts-deliveries-of-2012-hov-lane-eligible-chevy-volts-in-ca/|title=GM starts deliveries of 2012 HOV-lane-eligible Chevy Volts in California |last=King |first=Danny |work=AutoblogGreen |date=2012-02-24|accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new standard California version of the Volt features a modified engine and exhaust components. The [[catalytic converter]] was modified to add a secondary air-injection pump that "''streams ambient air into the exhaust stream to increase its ability to remove pollutants''." Owners of a 2012 Volt with the low emissions package are eligible to apply for one of 40,000 available HOV lane stickers issued to vehicles that qualify as a California AT-PZEV. The permits are handed out on a first-apply, first-served basis. Additionally, the new low emissions package makes the 2012 Volt eligible for owners to receive up to {{USD|1,500}} in state rebates through the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP). This incentive is in addition to the federal government’s {{USD|7,500}} tax credit.&lt;ref name=PZEV01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/11/16/new-enhat-pzev-chevy-volt-ready-for-california-hov-access-extra/#continued|title=2012 Volt Moves Into California's HOV Fast Lane|work=AutoblogGreen |date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2011-11-17}} ''See details in GM Press Release''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PZEV02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/11/volt-20111117.html|title=Chevy Volt gets a Low Emissions Package for California; HOV lanes access|work=Green Car Congress|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the 2012 Volts manufactured after February 6, 2012, are fitted with the low emission package and sold as standard models in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1071925_can-your-2012-chevy-volt-use-california-hov-lanes-it-depends|title=Can Your 2012 Chevy Volt Use California HOV Lanes?

;Resale value
[[File:Chevy Volt EDTA DC 04 2011 1787.jpg|thumb|left|Production Volts at a test drive event in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In May 2011 [[Kelley Blue Book]] (KBB) projected the 2011 Chevrolet Volt resale value at just over {{USD|17,000}} after 36 months, the length of a typical lease, which represents 42% of the car's {{USD|41,000}} [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP). KBB explains that even though the residual value seems low, the projection considered that the first 200,000 Volts sold qualified for a {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit, which effectively reduces the MSRP to {{USD|33,500}}, making the {{USD|17,000}}represent 51% of its original value after the tax credit. In comparison, KBB notes, the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46% after 36 months. KBB's estimate assumed a gasoline price around {{USD|4}} per gallon in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/05/17/kbb-sets-chevy-volt-resale-value-at-17-000-after-36-months/ |title=KBB sets Chevy Volt resale value at $17,000 after 36 months |author=Automotive News|work=AutoblogGreen|date=2011-05-17|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRresale/&gt; For 2012, Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42% of its original value after 3 years and 27% after 5 years. Based on these figures, in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the [[plug-in electric car]] category.&lt;ref name=KBB2012/&gt; KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35.5% average due to the {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit, which lowers the transaction price and pushes down the residual value.&lt;ref name=NYT1116&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/toyota-and-lexus-are-back-on-top-in-kelley-blue-book-resale-value-survey/?ref=automobiles|title=Toyota and Lexus Are Back on Top in Kelley Blue Book Resale Value Survey|author=Cheryl Jensen|work=The New York Times|date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer Reports]]' analysis show that many Chevrolets lose about half of their purchase price after three years of ownership, and if the Volt depreciates the same, {{USD|17,000}} seems a reasonable estimate. However, Consumer Reports have noted that fuel-efficient hybrids and diesel models often depreciate far less than most vehicles, which might increase the Volt's resale value after three years above the {{USD|17,000}} estimate. Additionally, if gasoline prices continue to rise or if the tax credits expire, the demand for used Chevrolet Volts could quickly increase, raising their market value. On the other hand, if the next-generation Volt’s battery has twice the capacity and cost less, as General Motors has claimed, the first generation Volts would be obsolete when the new ones come out in 2015. Considering these assumptions, Consumer Reports said, "At this point we believe it’s still unclear how the Volt will fare."&lt;ref name=CRresale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/05/cheverolet-volts-resale-value-after-three-years-17000.html|title=Chevrolet Volt resale value after three years? $17,000|work=Consumer Reports|date=2011-05-18|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pecan Street demonstration project
General Motors is sponsoring the [[Pecan Street demonstration project]] at the Mueller neighborhood in [[Austin, Texas]]. The project objective is to learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, which is what the preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. {{As of|2013|06}}, the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's {{USD|7,500}} rebate incentive, which halves the purchase price of the Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=remote-control-of-electric-cars|title=Will You or the Grid Control Your Electric Car?|author=David Biello|work=[[Scientific America]]|date=2013-06-18|accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main differences between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling. The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear [[Fascia (car)|fascia]], with a large cut-out in the rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]]. The Opel Ampera features more stylized alloy wheels as standard, and the side skirts are body-colored rather than black. In the inside there are only minor differences and both versions share the same exact powertrain and battery pack.&lt;ref name=Differences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcarselectric.com/blog/1056301_chevrolet-volt-and-opel-ampera-what-are-the-differences |title=Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera: What Are The Differences? |author=Antony Ingram |work=AllCarsElectric.com |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GreenMuk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenmotor.co.uk/2011/04/enno-fuchs-ampera-volt-uk-europe.html|title=Is the Ampera any more than a Volt with a nose job?|work=GreenMotor.co.uk|date=2011-04-17|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key operational difference was that the Ampera has four drive modes, one more than the 2011/12 model year Volt. The additional option is ''City Mode'', which adapts battery management to the needs of [[commuting|commuter travel]]. City mode or "battery hold" engages the range-extender immediately, allowing to save the energy currently stored in the battery, and when switched off, the range-extender stops and the Ampera is then able to use the energy saved in the battery for pure electric driving, for example for traveling urban areas or restricted zones, such as the European [[low emission zone]]s or to allow the Ampera to qualify for an exemption of the [[London congestion charge]]&lt;ref name=GCC021711/&gt;&lt;ref name=Differences/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/05/20/bibendum-2011-opel-ampera-not-only-looks-better-than-the-chevy/|title=Bibendum 2011: Opel Ampera not only looks better than the Chevy Volt, it can do more, too|author=Sebastian Blanco|work=AutoblogGreen|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 model year Volt included the "Hold Drive" button to allow drivers to conserve battery-pack energy for use at a particular time of their choice.&lt;ref name=Volt2013_02/&gt;

The [[Opel Monza Concept]] is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid concept car with [[gullwing door]] unveiled at the 2013 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The concept shares the same basic plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder [[natural gas]]-powered engine as its [[range extender]] instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model for the next generation of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/frankfurt-motor-show-the-opel-monza-returns/?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=0|title=Frankfurt Motor Show: The Opel Monza Returns|author=Stephen Williams|work=The New York Times|date=2013-09-10|accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/10/opel-monza-concept-frankfurt-2013/|title=Opel Monza Concept soars into Frankfurt [w/video]|author=Jeffrey N.

== Controversies and criticism ==

=== EPA fuel economy testing ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Erev PHEVseries 98mpg 500px.jpg|image2=Phev-blended paralell 65mpge 500px.jpg|width=220|caption2=Typical EPA's new [[Fuel economy and environment label|fuel economy label]] for an [[series hybrid|extended-range electric]] vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt (top), and for a blended or [[Series-parallel hybrid|series-parallel]] plug-in hybrid (bottom)}}

In 2008, [[General Motors]] was concerned about how the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) would test the Volt to determine its official [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating. The controversy centered on whether, by including a gasoline engine, the Volt should be classified as a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] rather than an [[electric car]] as claimed by General Motors. If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around {{Convert|48|mpgus|abbr=on}} due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle that the EPA's current fuel economy tests are not suited to rate, and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid-electrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/080908-Chevy-Volt-100-mpg-or-48-mpg-/|title=Chevy Volt – 100 mpg, or 48 mpg?|date=2008-09-08|work=U.S. News, Rankings and Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method to take into account the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel {{convert|40|mi|km}} on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6293345/government/could-the-epa-cripple-the-chevy-volt/index.html|title=Could the EPA cripple the Chevy Volt?|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Motor Trend]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA official rating issued in November 2010 included separate fuel economy ratings for [[all-electric mode]] and gasoline-only mode, with an overall combined city/highway gasoline-electricity fuel economy rating of {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]] (MPG-e).&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAmpge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevsbs.shtml |title=2011 Chevrolet Volt |website=Fueleconomy.gov |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey2010&gt;{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=David |last2=Krolicki |first2=Kevin |date=2010-11-24 |title=Chevy Volt Tops Prius in Fuel Economy Rating |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AN65K20101124 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges, EPA also included in the Volt's [[fuel economy label]] a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios driven between a full charge, and a never-charge scenario.&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt; According to this table the Volt's fuel economy goes up to {{Convert|168|mpgus|abbr=on}} equivalent (MPG-e) if driven {{Convert|45|mi}} between full charges.&lt;ref name=EPAmpge/&gt; Also, in recognition of the multiple operating modes that a plug-in hybrid can be built with (all-electric, blended, and gasoline-only), for the new [[fuel economy and environment label]] that will be mandatory in the U.S. beginning in [[model year]] 2013, EPA and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids. One label is for extended-range electric vehicles, like the Chevy Volt, with two modes: all-electric and gasoline-only; and a second label for blended mode that includes a combination of all-electric, gasoline and electric operation, and gasoline only, like a [[hybrid electric vehicle|conventional hybrid vehicle]].&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels|work=Green Car Congress|date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/420f11017.htm|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles|author=EPA|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-31}}''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EPA fuel economy rating ===

In August 2009, General Motors released its estimated city [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating for the Volt of {{convert|230|mpgUS|abbr=on}} of gasoline plus {{kWh|25}}/100&amp;nbsp;mi (560 kJ/km) of electricity using the EPA's proposed method for evaluating plug-in hybrids.&lt;ref name=NYT230&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/business/12auto.html|title=G.M.

The official EPA rating was issued in November 2010 and became the agency's first [[fuel economy label]] for a [[plug-in hybrid]]s. The EPA rated the 2011 Volt combined fuel economy at 93 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) in [[all-electric mode]], and {{Convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} in gasoline-only mode, for an overall combined fuel economy rating of {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on}} equivalent (MPG-e). The label also shows the combined city-highway fuel economy in all-electric mode expressed in traditional energy consumption units, rating the Volt at 36 {{kWh|link=yes}} per {{Convert|100|mi}}.&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey2010/&gt;

=== Production cost and sales price ===

In 2009, the [[Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry]] said that "GM is at least one generation behind [[Toyota]] on advanced, “green” powertrain development. In an attempt to leapfrog Toyota, GM has devoted significant resources to the Chevy Volt" and that "while the Chevy Volt holds promise, it is currently projected to be much more expensive than its gasoline-fueled peers and will likely need substantial reductions in [[manufacturing cost]] in order to become commercially viable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Determination of Viability Summary: General Motors Corporation |date=2009-03-30 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/GM_Viability_Assessment.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407084946/http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/GM_Viability_Assessment.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2009 [[Carnegie Mellon University]] study found that a [[Plug-in hybrid|PHEV]]-40 will be less cost effective than a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|HEV]] or a PHEV-7 in all of the scenarios considered, due to the cost and weight of the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cmu.edu/me/ddl/publications/2009-EP-Shiau-Samaras-Hauffe-Michalek-PHEV-Weight-Charging.pdf|title=Impact of battery weight and charging patterns on the economic and environmental benefits of plug-in hybrid vehicles|last1=Shiau|first1=Ching-Shin Norman|last2=Samaras|first2=Constantine|last3=Hauffe|first3=Richard|last4=Michalek|first4=Jeremy J.|journal=Energy Policy|pages=2653–2663|year=2009|volume=37|accessdate=2011-05-22|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.02.040 |issue=7}} ''See Figure 6, pp. 2661–2662''&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Lauckner, a Vice President at General Motors, responded that the study did not consider the inconvenience of a {{Convert|7|mi}} [[all-electric range|electric range]] and that the study's cost estimate of {{USD|1,000}} per {{kWh|link=yes}} for the Volt's battery pack was "many hundreds of dollars per [[kilowatt hour]] higher" than what it costs to make today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/03/gm-fights-back-chevy-volt-plug-in-hybrid-battery-cost.php|title=GM Fights Back: Volt Battery Pack "Hundreds Less" than $1,000/({{kWh}}) |work=Treehugger |author=Michael Graham Richard |date=2009-03-04|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barack Obama drives Chevy Volt.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] behind the wheel of a new Chevy Volt during his tour of the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|General Motors Auto Plant in Hamtramck]], [[Michigan]]]]

In early 2010, it was reported that General Motors would lose money on the Volt for at least the first couple of generations, but it hoped the car would create a green image that could rival the Prius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-exechybrids-unlikely-to-take-more-than-10-of-us-market-2010-02-13|title=GM exec:Hybrids unlikely to take more than 10% of U.S. market|author=Sharon Terlep|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Volt's sales price was announced in July 2010, there was concern expressed of the launch price of the Volt and its affordability and resulting popularity, especially when the federal subsidies of {{USD|2.4 billion}} were taken into account in the development of the car.&lt;ref name=niedermeyer2010&gt;{{cite news |last=Niedermeyer |first=Edward |title=G.M.’s Electric Lemon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/opinion/30neidermeyer.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=electric%20car%20lemon&amp;st=cse |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |at=Opinion |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010-08-01 |title=Low Voltage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/31/AR2010073102589.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |at=Editorials |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors CEO [[Edward Whitacre Jr.]] rejected as "ridiculous" criticism that the Volt's price is too expensive. He said that "I think it's a very fair price. It's the only car that will go coast to coast on electricity without plugging it in, and nobody else can come close."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cheersandgears.com/topic/64689-whitacre-talks-to-the-news-about-volt-bailout-critics-more/ |title=Whitacre Talks to The News about Volt, Bailout Critics, More |work=The Detroit News |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the federal government being the major GM shareholder due to the 2009 government-led [[bankruptcy]] of the automaker, during a press briefing at the [[White House]] a [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] official clarified that the federal government did not have any input on the pricing of the 2011 Chevrolet Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/volt/2011/white-house-chevy-volt-pricing-decision-didnt-come-from-us.html|title=White House: Chevy Volt Pricing Decision Didn't Come From Us|work=Edmunds.com Inside Line|date=2010-07-30|accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been complaints regarding price markups due to the initial limited availability in 2010 of between {{USD|5,000}} to {{USD|12,000}} above the recommended price,&lt;ref name=NYT080510&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/let-the-chevrolet-volt-buyer-beware-as-some-dealers-mark-up-price/?ref=automobiles|title=Let the Chevrolet Volt Buyer Beware, as Some Dealers Mark Up Price |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Jonathan Schultz|date=2010-08-05|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least in one case a {{USD|20,000}} mark up in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoobserver.com/2010/07/chevrolet-dealer-want-a-volt-thatll-be-an-extra-20k.html|title=Chevrolet Dealer: Want a Volt?

In May 2011 the [[National Legal and Policy Center]] announced that some Chevrolet dealers were selling Volts to other dealers and claiming the {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit for themselves. Then the dealers who bought the Volts sell them as used cars with low mileage to private buyers, who no longer qualify for the credit. General Motors acknowledged that 10 dealer-to-dealer Volt sales had taken place among Chevrolet dealers, but the carmaker said they do not encourage such practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/over-g-m-s-objections-dealers-sell-used-chevy-volts-without-7500-tax-credit/?ref=automobiles|title=Over G.M.’s Objections, Dealers Sell "Used" Chevy Volts Without $7,500 Tax Credit |author=Mary M.

In September 2012, [[Reuters]] published an opinion/editorial article where it claimed that General Motors, nearly two years after the introduction of the car, was losing {{USD|49,000}} on each Volt it built. The article concluded that the Volt is "over-engineered and over-priced" and that its technological complexity has put off many prospective buyers, due to fears the car may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GM's Volt: The ugly math of low sales, high costs|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-generalmotors-autos-volt-idUSBRE88904J20120910|work=[[Reuters]] |author1=Bernie Woodall |author2=Paul Lienert |author3=Ben Klayman |date=2012-09-10|accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM executives replied that Reuters' estimates were significantly flawed as they also allocated the vehicle's [[research and development]] program costs only against the number of Volts sold in the United States ({{as of|2012|08|lc=y}}), instead of spreading the total costs over the entire lifetime of the model, as well as including those units sold in Europe and other countries.

[[File:Volt NHTSA fire 01 before &amp; after.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Volt that caught fire after the pole test in June 2011. Top: before the NHTSA's pole test. Below: After the fire.]]

In June 2011 a Volt that had been subjected by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) to a {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}} side pole impact crash test followed by a post-impact rollover, caught fire three weeks later in the test center parking lot, burning nearby vehicles. The battery was found to be the source of the fire. After the fire, both Chevrolet and the NHTSA independently replicated the crash test and a subsequent vehicle rotation procedure to test for any fluid leakage, but in their first attempt they could not reproduce the conditions under which the battery pack ignited. The NHTSA said it had "concluded that the crash test damaged the Volt’s lithium-ion battery and that the damage led to a vehicle fire that took several weeks to develop."&lt;ref name=Fire5&gt;{{cite web |title=Defect Investigations Results - NHTSA Action Number : PE11037 |url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/defects/results.cfm?action_number=PE11037&amp;SearchType=QuickSearch&amp;summary=true |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Safercar.gov |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/chevy-volt-fire-prompts-federal-investigation-into-lithium-ion-batteries/?ref=automobiles |title=Chevy Volt Fire Prompts Federal Investigation Into Lithium-Ion Batteries |last=Jensen |first=Christopher |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire2&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Jeff |last2=Welch |first2=David |last3=Greiling Keane |first3=Angela |date=2011-11-11 |title=GM Volt Fire Prompts Probe of Lithium Batteries |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-11/gm-volt-battery-fire-is-said-to-prompt-u-s-probe-into-electric-car-safety.html |work=Bloomberg |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further testing of the Volt's batteries carried out by NHTSA in November 2011, two of the three tests resulted in thermal events.

The NHTSA then took an uncommon step on November 25, 2011 and opened a formal safety defect investigation "without any data from real-world incidents" to examine the potential risks involved from intrusion damage to the battery pack in the Chevrolet Volt.&lt;ref name=Fire5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/regulators-investigate-chevrolet-volt-battery.html?_r=2&amp;ref=automobiles |title=Formal Defect Inquiry of Volt Battery Begins |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=2011-11-25|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us-gm-volt-idUSTRE7AO1SH20111126?type=GCA-GreenBusiness&amp;feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=GCA-GreenBusiness&amp;rpc=43|title=U.S. opening formal probe into GM Volt fire risk |author=Tim Dobbyn|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2011-11-25|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial Volt fire, the NHTSA examined the [[Nissan Leaf]] and other plug-in electric vehicles and said its testing "has not raised safety concerns about vehicles other than the Chevy Volt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/tsunami-reveals-durability-of-nissans-leaf.html?_r=1&amp;ref=automobiles|title=Tsunami Reveals Durability of Nissan’s Leaf |last=Bunkley |first=Nick|work=The New York Times|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHTSA also said it was working with all automakers to develop postcrash procedures to keep occupants of electric vehicles and emergency personnel who respond to crash scenes safe. Additionally, NHTSA advised to be aware that fires may occur a considerable amount of time after a crash. General Motors said the first fire would have been avoided if GM's protocols for deactivating the battery after the crash had been followed.&lt;ref name=Fire4/&gt; These protocols had been used by GM since July 2011 but were not shared with the NHTSA until November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/buick/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Nov/1128_volt|title= GM Builds on Battery Safety to Ensure Confidence in Chevrolet Volt|work=GM Media News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2011-11-28|accessdate=2011-12-01}} ''See the details in the attached file:[http://media.gm.com/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Nov/1128_volt/_jcr_content/rightpar/sectioncontainer_1/par/download/file.res/112811%20Reuss%20Barra%20Volt%20Transcripts.doc112811 Reuss Barra Volt Transcripts.doc Mark Reuss and Mary Barra Volt Conference Call Transcripts]''&lt;/ref&gt; In another statement the carmaker stated that they "are working with other vehicle manufacturers, first responders, tow truck operators, and salvage associations with the goal of implementing industrywide protocols."&lt;ref name=Fire4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/business/energy-environment/regulators-examine-electric-car-batteries-after-fire.html?_r=1&amp;ref=electricvehicles|title=Batteries in Electric Cars Examined After Chevy Volt Fire|last=Bunkley |first=Nick|work=The New York Times|date=2011-11-11|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer deliveries of the Opel Ampera in Europe were delayed until the NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt's battery fire risk to make sure the vehicle is safe.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt; However, deliveries of the first Chevrolet Volts in Europe began in France in November 2011.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name=FRAVolt/&gt; Deliveries of the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK continued as scheduled for May 2012.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt; Opel Ampera deliveries began in February 2012.&lt;ref name=AmperaDeliver/&gt;

;Battery enhancements
On January 5, 2012, General Motors announced that it would offer a customer-satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. The carmaker described the modifications as voluntary enhancements and stated that neither the car nor the battery was being recalled. General Motors determined the June fire was the result of a minor intrusion from a portion of the vehicle into a side section of the battery pack. This intrusion resulted in a small coolant leak inside the battery of approximately {{cvt|50|mL}}. When the vehicle was put through a slow roll, where it was rotated at 90-degree increments, holding in each position for about five minutes, an additional {{convert|1|liter}} of coolant leaked. With the vehicle in the 180 degrees position (upside down), the coolant came in contact with the printed circuit board electronics at the top of the battery pack and later crystallized. Three weeks later this condition, in combination with a charged battery, led to a short circuit that resulted in the post-crash fire.&lt;ref name=NYT010512&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/business/gm-to-reinforce-battery-in-hybrid-car.html?ref=automobiles |title= G.M. to Reinforce Battery in Hybrid Car |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |work= The New York Times |date= 2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/volt-20120105.html |title= GM makes modifications to Chevrolet Volt vehicle structure and battery coolant system to further protect from delayed electrical fire after severe crash |work= Green Car Congress |date= 2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket to the top of the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill.&lt;ref name=NYT010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512/&gt; The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of {{cvt|2|to|3|lb|kg}}, and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.&lt;ref name=GCR010512/&gt;

During December 2011, GM conducted four crash tests of Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt to the same test that led to the original fire, with no signs of the damage that is believed to have been the cause. The NHTSA said "the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion" though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost.&lt;ref name=NYT010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512/&gt;

All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts produced until December 2011, including all Amperas in stock at European dealerships, were scheduled to receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors sent a letter to Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012.&lt;ref name=ABG010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCR010512&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1071348_chevrolet-to-offer-volt-modifications-against-battery-fire-risk |title= Chevrolet To Offer Volt Modifications Against Battery Fire Risk |last=Voelcker |first=John |work=Green Car Reports |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DTN0322&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120322/AUTO0103/203220490/1148/rss25 |title=GM to replace Volt power cords |last=Shepardson |first=David |work=The Detroit News |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.&lt;ref name=DTN0322/&gt;

;NHTSA findings
On January 20, 2012, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed the Volt's safety defect investigation related to post-crash fire risk. The agency concluded that "no discernible defect trend exists" and also found that the modifications recently developed by General Motors are sufficient to reduce the potential for battery intrusion resulting from side impacts. The NHTSA also said that "based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles." The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community, law enforcement officers, tow truck operators, storage facilities and consumers.&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/business/us-finds-no-defect-in-volt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=automobiles |title=In Fire Investigation, Regulators Say They Found No Defect in Volt |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |last2=Vlasic |first2=Bill |work=The New York Times|date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/nhtsa-concludes-safety-defect-investigation-into-post-crash-fire-risk-of-the-volt.html |title=NHTSA concludes safety defect investigation into post-crash fire risk of the Volt |work=Green Car Congress |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;House of Representatives hearing

The chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jim Jordan (Ohio politician)|Jim Jordan]] held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only five months after the first postcrash battery fire occurred in June.

The remaining volume is pure, [[de-ionized water]].

Because it is difficult to weigh out some of the trace minerals, it is advisable to create a mixture of all components at a large concentration, such as a thousand times these measures, and then mix with the appropriate amount of (pure, de-ionized) water. Correct [[pH]] to 7.5, and then autoclave.

Cocrystals can encompass many types of compounds, including [[hydrates]], solvates and [[clathrates]], which represent the basic principle of [[host-guest chemistry]]. Hundreds of examples of cocrystallization are the reported annually.

==History==
The first reported cocrystal, [[quinhydrone]], was studied by Friedrich Wöhler in 1844. Quinhydrone is a cocrystal of [[quinone]] and [[hydroquinone]] (known archaically as quinol). He found that this material was made up of a 1:1 molar combination of the components. Quinhydrone was analyzed by numerous groups over the next decade and several related cocrystals were made from halogenated quinones.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

Many cocrystals discovered in the late 1800s and early 1900s were reported in ''Organische Molekulverbindungen'', published by [[Paul Pfeiffer (chemist)|Paul Pfeiffer]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt; This book separated the cocrystals into two categories; those made of inorganic:organic components, and those made only of organic components. The inorganic:organic cocrystals include organic molecules cocrystallized with alkali and alkaline earth salts, mineral acids, and halogens as in the case of the halogenated quinones. A majority of the organic:organic cocrystals contained aromatic compounds, with a significant fraction containing di- or trinitro aromatic compounds. The existence of several cocrystals containing [[eucalyptol]], a compound which has no aromatic groups, was an important finding which taught scientists that [[pi stacking]] is not necessary for the formation of cocrystals.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

Cocrystals continued to be discovered throughout the 1900s. Some were discovered by chance and others by [[wikt:screening|screening]] techniques. Knowledge of the intermolecular interactions and their effects on crystal packing allowed for the engineering of cocrystals with desired physical and chemical properties. In the last decade there has been an enhanced interest in cocrystal research, primarily due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Scott L. Childs | editor1-last = Childs | editor1-first = Scott L | editor2-first = Michael J | doi = 10.1021/cg901002y | title = The Reemergence of Cocrystals: The Crystal Clear Writing is on the Wall Introduction to Virtual Special Issue on Pharmaceutical Cocrystals | journal = Crystal Growth &amp; Design | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 4208 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Zaworotko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocrystals represent about 0.5% of the crystal structures archived in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; However, the study of cocrystals has a long history spanning more than 160 years. They have found use in a number of industries, including pharmaceutical, textile, paper, chemical processing, photographic, propellant, and electronic.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stahly | first1 = G.

==Definition==
The meaning of the term ''cocrystal'' is subject of disagreement. One definition states that a cocrystal is a crystalline structure composed of at least two components, where the components may be atoms, ions or molecules.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt; This definition is sometimes extended to specify that the components be solid in their pure forms at ambient conditions.&lt;ref name=third&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ter Horst | first1 = J.

The difference between a crystalline [[salt]] and a cocrystal lies merely in the transfer of a proton. The transfer of protons from one component to another in a crystal is dependent on the environment. For this reason, crystalline salts and cocrystals may be thought of as two ends of a proton transfer spectrum, where the salt has completed the proton transfer at one end and an absence of proton transfer exists for cocrystals at the other end.&lt;ref name="fifth"/&gt;

==Properties==
[[Image:Meltingptgraph.png|thumbnail|300px|right| A schematic for the determination of melting point binary phase diagrams from thermal microscopy.]]
The components interact via non-covalent interactions such as [[hydrogen bonding]], [[ionic bond|ionic]] interactions, [[van der Waals interactions]] and [[Π-interactions]]. The intermolecular interactions and resulting crystal structures can generate physical and chemical properties that differ from the properties of the individual components.&lt;ref name=sixth&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Braga | first1 = D. | last2 = Grepioni | first2 = F. | last3 = Maini | first3 = L. | last4 = Polito | first4 = M. | chapter = Crystal Polymorphism and Multiple Crystal Forms | doi = 10.1007/430_2008_7 | title = Molecular Networks | series = Structure and Bonding | volume = 132 | pages = 25 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-3-642-01366-9 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2009MNSB..132...25B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such properties include melting point, solubility, chemical stability, and mechanical properties. Some cocrystals have been observed to exist as [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], which may display different physical properties depending on the form of the crystal.&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt;

[[Phase diagrams]] determined from the "contact method" of thermal [[microscopy]] is valuable in the detection of cocrystals.&lt;ref name=second /&gt; The construction of these phase diagrams is made possible due to the change in melting point upon cocrystallization. Two crystalline substances are deposited on either side of a microscope slide and are sequentially melted and resolidified. This process creates thin films of each substance with a contact zone in the middle. A melting point phase diagram may be constructed by slow heating of the slide under a microscope and observation of the melting points of the various portions of the slide. For a simple binary phase diagram, if one [[eutectic point]] is observed then the substances do not form a cocrystal. If two eutectic points are observed, then the composition between these two points corresponds to the cocrystal.

==Production and characterization==

===Production===
There are many synthetic strategies that are available to prepare cocrystals.  However, it may be difficult to prepare single cocrystals for X-ray diffraction, as it has been known to take up to 6 months to prepare these materials.&lt;ref name="fifth"/&gt;

Cocrystals are typically generated through slow evaporation of solutions of the two components.  This approach has been successful with molecules of complimentary hydrogen bonding properties, in which case cocrystallization is likely to be thermodynamically favored.&lt;ref name=seventh&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vishweshwar | first1 = P. | last2 = McMahon | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Bis | first3 = J. A. | last4 = Zaworotko | first4 = M. J. | title = Pharmaceutical co-crystals | doi = 10.1002/jps.20578 | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 499–516 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16444755| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other methods exist in order to produce cocrystals.  Crystallizing with a molar excess of one cocrystal former may produce a cocrystal by a decrease in solubility of that one component.  Another method to synthesize cocrystals is to conduct the crystallization in a [[slurry]].  As with any crystallization, solvent considerations are important.  Changing the solvent will change the intermolecular interactions and possibly lead to cocrystal formation.  Also, by changing the solvent, phase considerations may be utilized.  The role of a solvent in nucleation of cocrystals remains poorly understood but critical in order to obtain a cocrystal from solution.&lt;ref name="seventh"/&gt;

Cooling molten mixture of cocrystal formers often affords cocrystals. [[Seed crystal|Seeding]] can be useful.&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt;  Another approach that exploits phase change is [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] which often forms [[hydrates]].&lt;ref name=eigth&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blagden | first1 = N. | last2 = Berry | first2 = D. J. | last3 = Parkin | first3 = A. | last4 = Javed | first4 = H. | last5 = Ibrahim | first5 = A. | last6 = Gavan | first6 = P. T. | last7 = De Matos | first7 = L. L. | last8 = Seaton | first8 = C. C. | doi = 10.1039/b803866j | title = Current directions in co-crystal growth | journal = New Journal of Chemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 1659 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grinding, both neat and liquid-assisted, is employed to produce cocrystal, e.g., using a [[mortar and pestle]], using a [[ball mill]], or using a vibratory mill.  In liquid-assisted grinding, or kneading, a small or substoichiometric amount of liquid (solvent) is added to the grinding mixture.  This method was developed in order to increase the rate of cocrystal formation, but has advantages over neat grinding such as increased yield, ability to control polymorph production, better product crystallinity, and applies to a significantly larger scope of cocrystal formers.&lt;ref name=ninth&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Friščić  | first1 = T. | last2 = Jones | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1021/cg800764n | title = Recent Advances in Understanding the Mechanism of Cocrystal Formation via Grinding | journal = Crystal Growth &amp; Design | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 1621 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and nucleation through seeding.&lt;ref name=eigth /&gt;

[[Supercritical fluid]]s (SCFs) serve as a medium for growing cocrystals. Crystal growth is achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different supercritical fluid properties: supercritical CO2 solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement.&lt;ref name=padrela&gt;L. Padrela, M.A. Rodrigues, S.P. Velaga, H.A. Matos and E.G. Azevedo (2009). "Formation of indomethacin–saccharin cocrystals using supercritical fluid technology". ''European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences''. '''38''', pp. 9–17. {{doi|10.1016/j.ejps.2009.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Padrela, M.A. Rodrigues, S.P. Velaga, H.A. Matos and E.G. Azevedo (2010). "Screening for pharmaceutical cocrystals using the supercritical fluid enhanced atomization process". ''Journal of Supercritical Fluids'' {{doi|10.1016/j.supflu.2010.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using intermediate phases to synthesize solid-state compounds is also employed. The use of a hydrate or an amorphous phase as an intermediate during synthesis in a solid-state route has proven successful in forming a cocrystal.  Also, the use of a metastable polymorphic form of one cocrystal former can be employed.  In this method, the metastable form acts as an unstable intermediate on the nucleation pathway to a cocrystal.  As always, a clear connection between pairwise components of the cocrystal is needed in addition to the thermodynamic requirements in order to form these compounds.&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt;

Importantly, the phase that is obtained is independent of the synthetic methodology used. It may seem facile to synthesize these materials, but on the contrary the synthesis is far from routine.&lt;ref name="seventh"/&gt;

===Characterization===
Cocrystals may be characterized in a wide variety of ways.  Powder [[X-Ray diffraction]] proves to be the most commonly used method in order to characterize cocrystals.  It is easily seen that a unique compound is formed and if it could possibly be a cocrystal or not owing to each compound having its own distinct powder diffractogram.&lt;ref name=third /&gt;  Single-crystal X-ray diffraction may prove difficult on some cocrystals, especially those formed through grinding, as this method more often than not provides powders.  However, these forms may be formed often through other methodologies in order to afford single crystals.&lt;ref name="ninth"/&gt;

Aside from common spectroscopic methods such as [[FT-IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]], solid state NMR spectroscopy allows differentiation of [[Chiral (chemistry)|chiral]] and [[racemic]] cocrystals of similar structure.&lt;ref name="ninth"/&gt;

Other physical methods of characterization may be employed.  [[Thermogravimetric analysis]] (TGA) and [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC) are two commonly used methods in order to determine melting points, phase transitions, and enthalpic factors which can be compared to each individual cocrystal former.

==Applications==
Cocrystal engineering is relevant to production of energetic materials, pharmaceuticals, and other compounds. Of these, the most widely studied and used application is in drug development and more specifically, the formation, design, and implementation of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API’s. Changing the structure and composition of the API can greatly influence the [[bioavailability]] of a drug.&lt;ref name=seventh /&gt; The engineering of cocrystals takes advantage of the specific properties of each component to make the most favorable conditions for solubility that could ultimately enhance the bioavailability of the drug. The principal idea is to develop superior physico-chemical properties of the API while holding the properties of the drug molecule itself constant.&lt;ref name=eigth/&gt; Cocrystal structures have also become a staple for drug discovery. Structure-based [[virtual screening]] methods, such as docking, makes use of cocrystal structures of known proteins or receptors to elucidate new ligand-receptor binding conformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Paul C. D.|last2=Skillman|first2=A. Geoffrey|last3=Nicholls|first3=Anthony|date=22 March 2006|title=Comparison of Shape-Matching and Docking as Virtual Screening Tools|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm0603365|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=74–82|doi=10.1021/jm0603365|issn=0022-2623|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
Cocrystal engineering has become of such great importance in the field of pharmaceuticals that a particular subdivision of multicomponent cocrystals has been given the term pharmaceutical cocrystals to refer to a solid cocrystal former component and a molecular or ionic API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). However, other classifications also exist when one or more of the components are not in solid form under ambient conditions. For example, if one component is a liquid under ambient conditions, the cocrystal might actually be deemed a cocrystal solvate as discussed previously. The physical states of the individual components under ambient conditions is the only source of division among these classifications. The classification naming scheme of the cocrystals might seem to be of little importance to the cocrystal itself, but in the categorization lies significant information regarding the physical properties, such as solubility and melting point, and the stability of API’s.&lt;ref name = seventh /&gt;

The objective for pharmaceutical cocrystals is to have properties that differ from that expected of the pure API’s without making and/or breaking covalent bonds.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Understanding the Mechanisms, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Cocrystallization to Control Phase Transformations | type =  dissertation|publisher=University of Michigan| year = 2008 | url =http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/61651/1/ajayasan_1.pdf| author1 = Adivaraha, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the earliest pharmaceutical cocrystals reported are of sulfonamides.&lt;ref name = eigth /&gt; The area of pharmaceutical cocrystals has thus increased on the basis of interactions between API’s and cocrystal formers. Most commonly, API’s have hydrogen-bonding capability at their exterior which makes them more susceptible to [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]], especially in the case of cocrystal solvates which can be known to have different polymorphic forms. Such a case is in the drug [[sulfathiazole]], a common oral and topical [[antimicrobial]],which has over a hundred different solvates. It is thus important in the field of pharmaceuticals to screen for every polymorphic form of a cocrystal before it is considered as a realistic improvement to the existing API. Pharmaceutical cocrystal formation can also be driven by multiple functional groups on the API, which introduces the possibility of binary, ternary, and higher ordered cocrystal forms.&lt;ref name=fifteen&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cheney | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Weyna | first2 = D. R. | last3 = Shan | first3 = N. | last4 = Hanna | first4 = M. | last5 = Wojtas | first5 = L. | last6 = Zaworotko | first6 = M. J. | doi = 10.1021/cg100514g | title = Supramolecular Architectures of Meloxicam Carboxylic Acid Cocrystals, a Crystal Engineering Case Study | journal = Crystal Growth &amp; Design | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 4401 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the cocrystal former is used to optimize the properties of the API but can also be used solely in the isolation and/or purification of the API, such as a separating [[enantiomers]] from each other, as well and removed preceding the production of the drug.&lt;ref name = seventh /&gt;

It is with reasoning that the physical properties of pharmaceutical cocrystals could then ultimately change with varying amounts and concentrations of the individual components. One of the most important properties to change with varying the concentrations of the components is [[solubility]].&lt;ref name = two /&gt; It has been shown that if the stability of the components is less than the cocrystal formed between them, then the solubility of the cocrystal will be lower than the pure combination of the individual constituents. If the solubility of the cocrystal is lower, this means that there exists a driving force for the cocrystallization to occur.&lt;ref name= third /&gt; Even more important for pharmaceutical applications is the ability to alter the stability to hydration and bioavailability of the API with cocrystal formation, which has huge implications on drug development. The cocrystal can increase or decrease such properties as melting point and stability to relative humidity compared to the pure API and therefore, must be studied on a case to case basis for their utilization in improving a pharmaceutical on the market.&lt;ref name = eigth /&gt;

A screening procedure has been developed to help determine the formation of cocrystals from two components and the ability to improve the properties of the pure API. First, the solubilities of the individual compounds are determined. Secondly, the cocrystallization of the two components is evaluated. Finally, phase diagram screening and powder [[X-ray diffraction]] (PXRD) are further investigated to optimize conditions for cocrystallization of the components.&lt;ref name = third /&gt;  This procedure is still done to discover cocrystals of pharmaceutical interest including simple APIs, such as [[carbamazepine]] (CBZ), a common treatment for [[epilepsy]], [[trigeminal neuralgia]], and [[bipolar disorder]]. CBZ has only one primary functional group involved in hydrogen bonding, which simplifies the possibilities of cocrystal formation that can greatly improve its low dissolution bioavailability.&lt;ref name = seventh /&gt;

Another example of an API being studied would be that of [[Piracetam]], or (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide, which is used to stimulate the [[central nervous system]] and thus, enhance learning and memory. Four polymorphs of Piracetam exist that involve hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl and primary amide. It is these same hydrogen bonding functional groups that interact with and enhance the cocrystallization of Piracetam with gentisic acid, a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID), and with p-hydroxybenzoic acid, an isomer of the aspirin precursor salicylic acid.&lt;ref name = seventh /&gt; No matter what the API is that is being researched, it is quite evident of the wide applicability and possibility for constant improvement in the realm of drug development, thus making it clear that the driving force of cocrystallization continues to consist of attempting to improve on the physical properties in which the existing cocrystals are lacking.&lt;ref name = third /&gt;&lt;ref name = seventh /&gt;

===Regulation===
On August 16, 2016, the US food and drug administration ([http://www.fda.gov/ FDA]) published a draft guidance [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm516813.pdf Regulatory Classification of Pharmaceutical Co-Crystals]. In this guide, the FDA suggests treating co-crystals as polymorphs, as long as proof is presented to rule out the existence of ionic bonds.

===Energetic materials===
Two explosives [[HMX]] and [[CL-20]] cocrystallized in a ratio 1:2 to form a hybrid explosive. This explosive had the same low sensitivity of HMX and nearly the same explosive power of CL-20. Physically mixing explosives creates a mixture that has the same sensitivity as the most sensitive component, which cocrystallisation overcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562898|title= Explosives: A bigger bang|journal= The Economist|date=Sep 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''die shrink''' (sometimes '''optical shrink''' or '''process shrink''') refers to a simple semiconductor scaling of [[semiconductor device]]s, mainly [[transistor]]s. The act of shrinking a [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] is to create a somewhat identical circuit using a more advanced [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication]] process, usually involving an advance of [[lithography|lithographic]] [[semiconductor node|node]]. This reduces overall costs for a chip company, as the absence of major architectural changes to the processor lowers research and development costs, while at the same time allowing more processor dies to be manufactured on the same piece of [[silicon wafer]], resulting in less cost per product sold.

==Details==
Die shrinks are the key to improving price/performance at semiconductor companies such as [[Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] (including the former [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]), [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]], and [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]. Examples in the 2000s include the codenamed [[Pentium 4#Cedar Mill|Cedar Mill]] [[Pentium 4]] processors (from [[90&amp;nbsp;nm]] [[CMOS]] to [[65&amp;nbsp;nm]] [[CMOS]]) and [[Penryn (microarchitecture)|Penryn Core 2]] processors (from [[65&amp;nbsp;nm]] CMOS to [[45&amp;nbsp;nm]] CMOS), the codenamed [[Athlon 64 X2#Brisbane (65 nm SOI)|Brisbane]] [[Athlon 64 X2]] processors (from [[90&amp;nbsp;nm]] [[Silicon on insulator|SOI]] to [[65&amp;nbsp;nm]] [[Silicon on insulator|SOI]]), and various generations of [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]s from both ATI and NVIDIA. In January 2010, Intel released [[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]] [[List of Intel Core i5 microprocessors|Core i5]] and [[Intel Core#Core i7|Core i7]] processors fabricated with a [[32&amp;nbsp;nm]] process, down from a previous [[45&amp;nbsp;nm]] process used in older iterations of the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] [[Central processing unit|processor]] [[microarchitecture]]. Intel, in particular, formerly focused on leveraging die shrinks to improve product performance at a regular cadence through its [[Tick-Tock model]]. In this [[business model]], every new [[microarchitecture]] (tick) is followed by a die shrink (tock) to improve performance with the same microarchitecture.&lt;ref name="anandtech-pao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel’s ‘Tick-Tock’ Seemingly Dead, Becomes ‘Process-Architecture-Optimization’|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/10183/intels-tick-tock-seemingly-dead-becomes-process-architecture-optimization|website=Anandtech|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Die shrinks are beneficial to end-users as shrinking a die reduces the current used by each transistor switching on or off in semiconductor devices while maintaining the same clock frequency of a chip, making a product with less power consumption (and thus less heat production), increased [[clock rate]] headroom, and lower prices.&lt;ref name="anandtech-pao" /&gt; Since the cost to fabricate a 200-mm or 300-mm silicon wafer is proportional to the number of fabrication steps, and not proportional to the number of chips on the wafer, die shrinks cram more chips onto each wafer, resulting in lowered manufacturing costs per chip.

==Half-shrink==
{{Semiconductor manufacturing processes}}

In CPU fabrications, a die shrink always involves an advance to a [[lithography|lithographic]] node as defined by [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS]] (see list at right). For GPU and [[System on a chip|SoC]] manufacturing, the die shrink often involves shrinking the die on a node not defined by the ITRS, for instance the 150&amp;nbsp;nm, 110&amp;nbsp;nm, 80&amp;nbsp;nm, 55&amp;nbsp;nm, 40&amp;nbsp;nm and more currently 14&amp;nbsp;nm nodes, sometimes referred to as "half-nodes". This is a stopgap between two ITRS-defined [[lithography|lithographic]] nodes (thus called a "half-node shrink") before further shrink to the lower ITRS-defined nodes occurs, which helps save further R&amp;D cost. The choice to perform die shrinks to either full-nodes or half-nodes rests with the foundry and not the integrated circuit designer.

The '''Dresselhaus effect''' is a phenomenon in [[solid-state physics]] in which [[spin–orbit interaction]] causes [[energy band]]s to split. It is usually present in [[crystal]] systems lacking [[inversion symmetry]]. The effect is named after Gene Dresselhaus, husband of [[Mildred Dresselhaus]], who discovered this splitting in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dresselhaus|first=G.|date=1955-10-15|title=Spin-Orbit Coupling Effects in Zinc Blende Structures|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.100.580|journal=Physical Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=580–586|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.100.580|bibcode=1955PhRv..100..580D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin-orbit interaction is a [[Special relativity|relativistic]] coupling between the [[electric field]] produced by an [[ion]]-core and the resulting dipole moment arising from the relative motion of the [[electron]], and its intrinsic [[magnetic dipole]] proportional to the electron [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. In an atom, the coupling weakly splits an orbital energy state into two states: one state with the spin aligned to the orbital field and one anti-aligned. In a solid [[crystal]]line material, the motion of the conduction electrons in the lattice can be altered by a complementary effect due to the coupling between the [[Potential well|potential]] of the lattice and the electron spin. If the crystalline material is not [[Centrosymmetry|centro-symmetric]], the asymmetry in the potential can favour one spin orientation over the opposite and split the [[Valence and conduction bands|energy bands]] into spin aligned and anti-aligned subbands.

The [[Rashba effect|Rashba spin–orbit coupling]]   has a similar energy band splitting, but the asymmetry comes either from the bulk asymmetry of [[Uniaxial crystal|uniaxial crystals]] (e.g. of [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] type&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba and V. I. Sheka, Symmetry of Energy Bands in Crystals of Wurtzite Type II. Symmetry of Bands with Spin-Orbit Interaction Included, Fiz. Tverd. Tela: Collected Papers, v. 2, 162, 1959. English translation: http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/17/5/050202/media/njp050202_suppdata.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) or the spatial inhomogeneity of an interface or surface. Dresselhaus and Rashba effects are often of similar strength in the band splitting of [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] [[Nanostructure|nanostructures]].&lt;ref name="Manchon2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manchon|first1=A.|last2=Koo|first2=H. C.|last3=Nitta|first3=J.|last4=Frolov|first4=S. M.|last5=Duine|first5=R. A.|title=New perspectives for Rashba spin–orbit coupling|journal=Nature Materials|date=20 August 2015|volume=14|issue=9|pages=871–882|doi=10.1038/nmat4360|arxiv=1507.02408|bibcode=2015NatMa..14..871M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zincblende Hamiltonian ==
Materials with [[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|zincblende structure]] are non-centrosymmetric (i.e., they lack inversion symmetry). This bulk induced asymmetry (BIA) forces the [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] to contain only odd powers of the [[Crystal momentum|linear momentum]]. The bulk Dresselhaus Hamiltonian or BIA term is usually written in this form:
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\rm D}\propto p_x(p_y^2-p_z^2)\sigma_x + p_y(p_z^2-p_x^2)\sigma_y+p_z(p_x^2-p_y^2)\sigma_z,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Pauli matrices]] related to the spin &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; of the electrons as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{S}=\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (here &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]), and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the momentum in the [[Miller index|crystallographic directions]] [100], [010] and [001], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56325471|title=Spin-orbit coupling effects in two-dimensional electron and hole systems|last=Roland|first=Winkler|date=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540366164|location=Berlin|oclc=56325471}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When treating 2D [[nanostructure]]s where the width direction &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; or [001] is finite, the Dresselhaus Hamiltonian can be separated into a linear and a cubic term. The linear Dresselhaus Hamiltonian &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_{\rm D}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is usually written as
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\rm D}^{(1)}=\frac{\beta}{\hbar}(\sigma_xp_x-\sigma_yp_y),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a coupling constant.

The cubic Dresselhaus term &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_{\rm D}^{(3)}&lt;/math&gt; is written as
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\rm D}^{(3)}=-\frac{\beta}{\hbar^3}\left(\frac{d}{\pi}\right)^2 p_xp_y(p_y\sigma_x-p_x\sigma_y),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the width of the material.

The Hamiltonian is generally derived using a combination of the [[K·p perturbation theory|'''k·p''' perturbation theory]] alongside the [[Kane model]].

'''Environmental Centre ARCTUROS''' ({{lang-el|Περιβαλλοντικό Κέντρο του ΑΡΚΤΟΥΡΟΥ}}) commonly known as Arcturos, is a [[Greek organizations|Greek]] [[ecology|ecological]] organization which focuses its efforts on saving the [[brown bear]] and its habitats.

==Activities==
Brown bears once ranged all across [[Europe]], but human encroachment on their forest habitats have made them an endangered species. Through the efforts of Arcturos, the size of the Greek brown bear population appears to have doubled in recent years.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}{{when|date=December 2017}} The organization also undertakes the rescue of bears kept captive in inhumane conditions&amp;mdash;such as the "dancing bears", which are taken as cubs to be trained following the killing of their mother, as well as orphan bears and those improperly kept in zoos. It comprises a veterinary centre located in the village of [[Aetos, Florina|Aetos]], where animals are nursed back to health and a mountain sanctuary in the nearby [[Verno]] mountains close to the village of [[Nymfaio]], an enclosed section of forest where the bears are transferred to be cared for and studied until they are able to be released back into the wild. The sanctuary also serves as an educational and study field for scientists and the public.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

A '''fibrin scaffold''' is a network of protein that holds together and supports a variety of living tissues. It is produced naturally by the body after injury, but also can be engineered as a tissue substitute to speed healing. The scaffold consists of naturally occurring [[biomaterial]]s composed of a cross-linked [[fibrin]] network and has a broad use in [[biomedical]] applications.

Fibrin consists of the blood proteins fibrinogen and [[thrombin]] which participate in [[blood clotting]]. [[Fibrin glue]] or [[fibrin sealant]] is also referred to as a [[fibrin]] based scaffold and used to control surgical bleeding, speed [[wound healing]], seal off hollow body organs or cover holes made by standard [[Surgical suture|sutures]], and provide slow-release delivery of medications like [[antibiotics]] to tissues exposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Fibrin-Sealants.html Fibrin Sealants - test, blood, complications, time, infection, risk, rate, Definition, Purpose, Description, Preparation, Normal results]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atrah"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Atrah HI |title=Fibrin glue |journal=BMJ |volume=308 |issue=6934 |pages=933–4 |date=April 1994 |pmid=8173397 |pmc=2539755 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8173397 |doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6934.933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of biological systems requires customized care to sustain their function. When they are no longer able to perform their purpose, interference of new cells and biological cues is provided by a scaffold material. Fibrin scaffold has many aspects like being [[biocompatible]], [[biodegradable]] and easily processable. Furthermore, it has an [[autologous]] nature and it can be manipulated in various size and shape. Inherent role in wound healing is helpful in surgical applications. Many factors can be bound to fibrin scaffold and those can be released in a cell-controlled manner. Its stiffness can be managed by changing the concentration according to needs of surrounding or encapsulated cells. Additional mechanical properties can be obtained by combining fibrin with other suitable scaffolds. Each biomedical application has its own characteristic requirement for different kinds of tissues and recent studies with fibrin scaffold are promising towards faster recovery, less complications and long-lasting solutions.

== Advantages of fibrin scaffold ==
Fibrin scaffold is an important element in [[tissue engineering]] approaches as a scaffold material. It is advantageous opposed to [[synthetic polymers]] and [[collagen]] gels when cost, [[inflammation]], [[immune response]], [[toxicity]] and [[cell adhesion]] are concerned.&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed TA, Dare EV, Hincke M |title=Fibrin: a versatile scaffold for tissue engineering applications |journal=Tissue Engineering.

== Fibrin gel formation and enrichment ==

[[Polymerization]] time of [[fibrinogen]] and [[thrombin]] is affected primarily by concentration of thrombin and temperature, while fibrinogen concentration has a minor effect. Fibrin gel characterization by [[scanning electron microscopy]] reveals that thick fibers make up a dense structure at lower fibrinogen concentrations (5&amp;nbsp;mg/ml) and thinner fibers and looser gel can be obtained as fibrinogen concentration (20&amp;nbsp;mg/ml) increases whereas increase in thrombin concentration (from 0.5 U/ml to 5 U/ml) has no such significant result although the fibers steadily get thinner.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao H, Ma L, Zhou J, Mao Z, Gao C, Shen J |title=Fabrication and physical and biological properties of fibrin gel derived from human plasma |journal=Biomedical Materials |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=015001 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18458488 |doi=10.1088/1748-6041/3/1/015001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibrin gels can be enriched by addition of other [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) components such as [[fibronectin]], [[vitronectin]], [[laminin]] and [[collagen]]. These can be linked covalently to fibrin scaffold by reactions catalyzed by [[transglutaminase]].&lt;ref name="Schense1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schense JC, Hubbell JA |title=Cross-linking exogenous bifunctional peptides into fibrin gels with factor XIIIa |journal=Bioconjugate Chemistry |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |year=1999 |pmid=9893967 |doi=10.1021/bc9800769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laminin originated substrate [[amino acid]] sequences for transglutaminase can be IKVAV, YIGSR or RNIAEIIKDI.

For some tissues like [[cartilage]], highly dense polymeric scaffolds such as [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) are essential due to [[mechanical stress]] and that can be achieved by combining them with natural biodegradable cell-adhesive scaffolds since cells can not attach to synthetic polymers and take proper signals for normal cell function. Various scaffold combinations with PEG-based hydrogels are studied to assess the chondrogenic response to dynamic strain stimulation in a recent study. PEG-[[Proteoglycan]], PEG-[[Fibrinogen]], PEG-[[Albumin]] conjugates and only PEG including [[hydrogels]] are used to evaluate the mechanical effect on bovine chondrocytes by using a pneumatic reactor system. The most substantial increase in stiffness is observed in PEG-Fibrinogen conjugated hydrogel after 28 days of mechanical stimulation.&lt;ref name="Appelman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Appelman TP, Mizrahi J, Elisseeff JH, Seliktar D |title=The differential effect of scaffold composition and architecture on chondrocyte response to mechanical stimulation |journal=Biomaterials |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=518–25 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19000634 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in tissue engineering ==

=== Bone tissue ===
In [[orthopedics]], methods with minimum invasion are desired and improving injectable systems is a leading aim. Bone cavities can be filled by polymerizing materials when injected and adaptation to the shape of the cavity can be provided. Shorter surgical operation time, minimum large muscle retaraction harm, smaller scar size, less pain after operation and consequently faster recovery can be obtained by using such systems.&lt;ref name="Bensaid"/&gt; In a study to evaluate if injectable fibrin scaffold is helpful for [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]] of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) when [[central nervous system]] (CNS) tissue is damaged, Yasuda et al. found that BMSC has extended survival, migration and differentiation after transplantation to rat cortical lesion although there is complete degradation of fibrin matrix after four weeks.&lt;ref name="Yasuda"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasuda H, Kuroda S, Shichinohe H, Kamei S, Kawamura R, Iwasaki Y |title=Effect of biodegradable fibrin scaffold on survival, migration, and differentiation of transplanted bone marrow stromal cells after cortical injury in rats |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=336–44 |date=February 2010 |pmid=19267524 |doi=10.3171/2009.2.JNS08495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study to assess if [[fibrin glue]] enriched with [[platelet]] is better than just platelet rich plasma (PRP) on bone formation was conducted.

=== Cardiac tissue ===
[[Valvular heart disease]] is a major cause of death globally. Both mechanical valves and fixed biological [[xenograft]] or homografts used clinically have many drawbacks.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt D, Hoerstrup SP |title=Tissue engineered heart valves based on human cells |journal=Swiss Medical Weekly |volume=136 |issue=39–40 |pages=618–23 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17086507 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study focused on fibrin-based heart valves to assess structure and mechanical durability on sheep revealed promising potential for patient originated valve replacements.

=== Vascular graft ===
In [[atherosclerosis]], a severe disease in modern society, coronary blood vessels occlude. These vessels have to be freed and held open i.e. by stents. Unfortunately after certain time these vessels close again and have to be bypassed to allow for upkeep of circulation. Usually autologous vessels from the patient or synthetic polymer grafts are used for this purpose. Both options have disadvantages. Firstly there are only few autologous vessels available in a human body that might be of low quality, considering the health status of the patient. The synthetic polymer based grafts on the other hand often have insufficient haemocompatibility and thus rapidly occlude - a problem that is especially prone in small calibre grafts. In this context the fibrin-gel-based tissue engineering of autologous vessel substitutes is a very promising approach to overcome the current problems. Cells and fibrin are isolated by a low invasive procedure from the patient and shaped in individual moulds to meet the required dimensions. Additional pre-cultivation in a specialized bioreactor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ame.hia.rwth-aachen.de/index.php?id=64&amp;L=1 AME: Bioreactor Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; is inevitable to ensure appropriate properties of the graft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tschoeke B, Flanagan TC, Koch S |title=Tissue-engineered small-caliber vascular graft based on a novel biodegradable composite fibrin-polylactide scaffold |journal=Tissue Engineering.

=== Ocular tissue ===
Bullous keratopathy that is characterized by corneal stromal edema related to cell loss and endothelial decompensation as well as subepithelial fibrosis and corneal vascularization in further cases, results vision problems due to loss of [[corneal]] transparency.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gonçalves ED, Campos M, Paris F, Gomes JA, Farias CC |title=Ceratopatia bolhosa: etiopatogênese e tratamento |trans-title=Bullous keratopathy: etiopathogenesis and treatment |language=Portuguese |journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Oftalmologia |volume=71 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=61–4 |year=2008 |pmid=19274413 |doi=10.1590/S0004-27492008000700012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibrin glue is used as a sutureless method onto the corneal surface to fix amniotic membrane that is [[cryopreserved]].

=== Nervous tissue ===
Because fibrin fulfills the mechanical aspects of neuronal growth without initiation of [[glial]] proliferation, it can be potentially used in neuronal wound healing even with no need of growth factors or such constituents.&lt;ref name="Uibo"/&gt; [[Neurons]] and [[astrocytes]], two major cell type of [[central nervous system]], can show various responses to differences in matrix stiffness.&lt;ref name="Georges"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Georges PC, Miller WJ, Meaney DF, Sawyer ES, Janmey PA |title=Matrices with compliance comparable to that of brain tissue select neuronal over glial growth in mixed cortical cultures |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=90 |issue=8 |pages=3012–8 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16461391 |pmc=1414567 |doi=10.1529/biophysj.105.073114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuronal development of precursor cells is maintained by gels with low [[elastic modulus]].&lt;ref name="Saha"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saha K, Keung AJ, Irwin EF |title=Substrate modulus directs neural stem cell behavior |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=95 |issue=9 |pages=4426–38 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18658232 |pmc=2567955 |doi=10.1529/biophysj.108.132217|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; When stiffness of the matrix is more than that of a normal brain, extension of [[spinal cord]] and cortical brain neurons is inhibited since neurite extension and branch forming take place on soft materials (&lt;1000Pa). In a study, fibrins from different species are used to compare the effects on neurite growth of mouse spinal cord neurons. Among salmon, bovine and human fibrin in addition to [[Matrigel]]&lt;sup&gt;(R)&lt;/sup&gt;, salmon fibrin promotes the [[neurite]] growth best and it is more [[proteolysis]] resistant than mammalian fibrins. Because down to 0&amp;nbsp;°C, [[salmon]] fibrinogen can clot whereas polymerization of human fibrinogen occurs slowly below 37&amp;nbsp;°C, this can be taken as an advantage in surgical settings that are cooler. Therefore, for treatment of central nervous system damages, salmon fibrin can be a useful biomaterial.&lt;ref name="Uibo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ju"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ju YE, Janmey PA, McCormick ME, Sawyer ES, Flanagan LA |title=Enhanced neurite growth from mammalian neurons in three-dimensional salmon fibrin gels |journal=Biomaterials |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=2097–108 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17258313 |pmc=1991290 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[sciatic nerve]] regeneration, fibrin scaffold is used with glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in a recent study. Survival of both sensory and motor neurons is promoted by glial-derived neurotrophic factor and its delivery to peripheral nervous system improves regeneration after an injury. GDNF and [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) is sequestered in the gel via a bi-domain peptide. This peptide is composed of heparin binding domain and transglutaminase substrate domain which can be cross-linked into the fibrin matrix by polymerization via transglutaminase activity of [[factor XIIIa]]. Many neurotrophic factors can bind to heparin through its sulfated domains. This is the affinity-based delivery system in which growth factors are released by cell-based degradation control. After a 13&amp;nbsp;mm rat sciatic nerve defect is made, the fibrin matrix delivery system is applied to the gap as a nerve guiding channel. Results show that such a delivery system is efficient to enhance maturity and promote organized architecture of nerve regenerating in presence of GDNF, in addition to expressing the promising treatment variations for peripheral nerve injuries.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wood MD, Moore AM, Hunter DA |title=Affinity-based release of glial-derived neurotrophic factor from fibrin matrices enhances sciatic nerve regeneration |journal=Acta Biomaterialia |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=959–68 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19103514 |pmc=2678870 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2008.11.008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in gene delivery ==
The use of fibrin hydrogel in [[gene delivery]] ([[transfection]]) is studied to address essential factors controlling the delivery process such as fibrinogen and [[pDNA]] concentration in addition to significance of cell-mediated fibrin degradation for pursuing the potential of cell-transfection [[microarray]] engineering or in vivo gene transfer. Gene transfer is more successful in-gel than on-gel probably because of proximity of lipoplexes and target cells. Less cytotoxicity is observed due to less use of transfection agents like [[lipofectamine]] and steady degradation of fibrin. Consequently, each cell type requires optimization of fibrinogen and pDNA concentrations for higher transfection yields and studies towards high-throughput transfection microarray experiments are promising.&lt;ref name="Lei"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lei P, Padmashali RM, Andreadis ST |title=Cell-controlled and spatially arrayed gene delivery from fibrin hydrogels |journal=Biomaterials |volume=30 |issue=22 |pages=3790–9 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19395019 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.03.049 |pmc=2692826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teardrop shape.svg|thumb|300px|Typical [[aerodynamic]] teardrop shape, assuming a [[Viscosity|viscous]] medium passing from left to right, the diagram shows the pressure distribution as the thickness of the black line and shows the velocity in the [[boundary layer]] as the violet triangles. The green [[vortex generator]]s prompt the transition to [[turbulent flow]] and prevent back-flow also called [[flow separation]] from the high-pressure region in the back. The surface in front is as smooth as possible or even employs [[Dermal denticle|shark-like skin]], as any turbulence here increases the energy of the airflow. The truncation on the right, known as a [[Kammback]], also prevents backflow from the high-pressure region in the back across the [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s to the convergent part.]]

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''fluid dynamics'''  is a subdiscipline of [[fluid mechanics]] that describes the flow of [[fluid]]s—[[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es.  It has several subdisciplines, including [[aerodynamics]] (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moment]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[weather forecasting|predicting weather pattern]]s, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and [[Nuclear weapon design|modelling fission weapon detonation]],

Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as functions of space and time.

Before the twentieth century, ''hydrodynamics'' was synonymous with fluid dynamics.  This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamic stability]], both of which can also be applied to gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics: A Discipline Between Science and Technology | first=Michael | last=Eckert | publisher=Wiley | year=2006 | isbn=3-527-40513-5 | page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations of fluid dynamics==
The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, specifically, [[conservation of mass]],  [[conservation of momentum|conservation of linear momentum]] (also known as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]), and [[conservation of energy]] (also known as [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]). These are based on [[classical mechanics]] and are modified in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]].  They are expressed using the [[Reynolds transport theorem]].

In addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the '''{{vanchor|continuum assumption}}'''. Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at [[infinitesimal]]ly small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.

For fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for [[Newtonian fluid]]s are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]—which is a [[non-linear]] set of [[differential equations]] that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general [[Solution in closed form|closed-form solution]], so they are primarily of use in [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]].  The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve.  Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

In addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the [[Ideal gas law|perfect gas equation of state]]:

:&lt;math&gt;p= \frac{\rho R_u T}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is pressure, ρ is density, ''T'' the absolute temperature, while ''R&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''M'' is [[molar mass]] for a particular gas.

===Conservation laws===
Three conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in [[integral]] or [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a ''control volume''.  A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow.  The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume.  Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply [[Stokes' theorem]] to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow.

*[[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Mass continuity]] (conservation of mass): The rate of change of fluid mass inside a control volume must be equal to the net rate of fluid flow into the volume.  Physically, this statement requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume,&lt;ref name="J.D. Anderson 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=J. D. |title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics |location=London |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw–Hill |year=2007 |isbn=0-07-125408-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be translated into the integral form of the continuity equation:
::&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial t} \iiint_V \rho \, dV = - \, {} &lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt =&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt;|integrand = &lt;math&gt;{}\,\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;}}

:Above, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, '''u''' is the [[flow velocity]] vector, and ''t'' is time.  The left-hand side of the above expression is the rate of increase of mass within the volume and contains a triple integral over the control volume, whereas the right-hand side contains an integration over the surface of the control volume of mass convected into the system.  Mass flow into the system is accounted as positive, and since the normal vector to the surface is opposite the sense of flow into the system the term is negated. The differential form of the continuity equation is, by the [[divergence theorem]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\ {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*[[Momentum|Conservation of momentum]]: [[Newton's second law of motion]] applied to a control volume, is a statement that any change in momentum of the fluid within that control volume will be due to the net flow of momentum into the volume and the action of external forces acting on the fluid within the volume.

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \iiint_{\scriptstyle V} \rho\mathbf{u} \, dV = -\, {} &lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;_{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt; |integrand}} &lt;math&gt; (\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot d\mathbf{S}) \mathbf{u} -{}&lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt;|integrand = &lt;math&gt; {}\, p \, d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;}} &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{}+ \iiint_{\scriptstyle V} \rho \mathbf{f}_\text{body} \, dV + \mathbf{F}_\text{surf}&lt;/math&gt;

:In the above integral formulation of this equation, the term on the left is the net change of momentum within the volume. The first term on the right is the net rate at which momentum is convected into the volume. The second term on the right is the force due to pressure on the volume's surfaces. The first two terms on the right are negated since momentum entering the system is accounted as positive, and the normal is opposite the direction of the velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and pressure forces. The third term on the right is the net acceleration of the mass within the volume due to any [[body force]]s (here represented by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;body&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Surface force]]s, such as viscous forces, are represented by '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{surf}&lt;/math&gt;''', the net force due to [[Stress (mechanics)|shear forces]] acting on the  volume surface. The momentum balance can also be written for a ''moving'' control volume.&lt;ref&gt;

:The following is the differential form of the momentum conservation equation.  Here, the volume is reduced to an infinitesimally small point, and both surface and body forces are accounted for in one total force, ''F''.  For example, ''F'' may be expanded into an expression for the frictional and gravitational forces acting at a point in a flow.

:In aerodynamics, air is assumed to be a [[Newtonian fluid]], which posits a linear relationship between the shear stress (due to internal friction forces) and the rate of strain of the fluid. The equation above is a vector equation in a three-dimensional flow, but it can be expressed as three scalar equations in three coordinate directions. The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case are called the Navier–Stokes equations.&lt;ref name="J.D. Anderson 2007"/&gt;

M. |title=Viscous Fluid Flow |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |year=1974 |isbn=0-07-069710-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression on the left side is a [[material derivative]].

===Compressible vs incompressible flow===
All fluids are [[compressibility|compressible]] to some extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an [[incompressible flow]]. Otherwise the more general [[compressible flow]] equations must be used.

Mathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density ρ of a [[fluid parcel]] does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{D} \rho}{\mathrm{D}t} = 0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D''/''Dt'' is the [[material derivative]], which is the sum of [[time derivative|local]] and [[convective derivative]]s. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.

For flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the [[Mach number]] of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3.  For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes).  [[acoustics|Acoustic]] problems always require allowing compressibility, since [[sound waves]] are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.

===Newtonian vs non-Newtonian fluids===
[[File:Flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Flow around an [[airfoil]]]]

All fluids are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a [[strain (materials science)|strain rate]]; it has dimensions &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Isaac Newton]] showed that for many familiar fluids such as [[water]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], the [[stress (physics)|stress]] due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluids]]. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.

[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of [[rheology]] describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include [[emulsion]]s and [[slurries]], some [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] materials such as [[blood]] and some [[polymer]]s, and ''sticky liquids'' such as [[latex]], [[honey]] and [[lubricants]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Inviscid vs viscous vs Stokes flow===

The dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of [[Newton's second law]]. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.

The [[Reynolds number]] is a [[dimensionless quantity]] which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (''Re''&lt;&lt;1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called [[Stokes flow|Stokes or creeping flow]].

In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (''Re''&gt;&gt;1) indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an [[inviscid flow]], an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to be simplified into the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields [[Bernoulli's equation]]. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is [[Lamellar field|irrotational]] everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called [[potential flow]]s, because the velocity field may be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a potential energy expression.

This idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the [[no-slip condition]] generates a thin region of large strain rate, the [[boundary layer]], in which [[viscosity]] effects dominate and which thus generates [[vorticity]]. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict [[Drag (physics)|drag forces]], a limitation known as the [[d'Alembert's paradox]].

A commonly used{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} model, especially in [[computational fluid dynamics]], is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and [[boundary layer]] equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]].

==={{Anchor|Steady vs unsteady flow}} Steady vs unsteady flow===&lt;!-- [[Steady flow]] redirects here --&gt;

[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|thumb|320px|Hydrodynamics simulation of the [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]] &lt;ref&gt;Shengtai Li, Hui Li "Parallel AMR Code for Compressible MHD or HD Equations" (Los Alamos National Laboratory) [http://math.lanl.gov/Research/Highlights/amrmhd.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
A flow that is not a function of time is called '''steady flow'''. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/main/118306-transient-state-unsteady-state.html Transient state or unsteady state?]&lt;/ref&gt;). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a [[sphere]] is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.

[[Turbulence|Turbulent]] flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be [[stationary process|statistically stationary]].  According to Pope:&lt;ref&gt;See Pope (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The random field ''U''(''x'',''t'') is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time.
}}
This roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean [[Field (physics)|field]] is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.

Steady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.

===Laminar vs turbulent flow===
Turbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], and apparent [[random]]ness.  Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called [[laminar flow|laminar]]. The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow—these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well.  Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a [[Reynolds decomposition]], in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an [[average]] component and a perturbation component.

It is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. [[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), based on the Navier–Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Schlatter et al, Phys. Fluids 21, 051702 (2009); {{doi|10.1063/1.3139294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option,&lt;ref&gt;See Pope (2000), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; given the state of computational power for the next few decades.  Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human (L &gt; 3 m), moving faster than  20&amp;nbsp;m/s (72&amp;nbsp;km/h) is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation (Re = 4 million).  Transport aircraft wings (such as on an [[Airbus A300]] or [[Boeing 747]]) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord dimension).  Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] (RANS) combined with [[turbulence modelling]] provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the [[Reynolds stresses]], although the turbulence also enhances the [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]]. Another promising methodology is [[large eddy simulation]] (LES), especially in the guise of [[detached eddy simulation]] (DES)—which is a combination of RANS turbulence modelling and large eddy simulation.

===Subsonic vs transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows===
While many flows (e.g. flow of water through a pipe) occur at low [[Mach number]]s, many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in [[Turbomachinery|turbomachines]] occur at high fractions of M=1 ([[Transonic|transonic flows]]) or in excess of it ([[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or even [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic flows]]). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.

===Reactive vs non-reactive flows===
Reactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas such as [[combustion]]([[Internal Combustion Engine|IC engine]]), [[propulsion]] devices ([[Rockets]], [[jet engines]] etc.), [[detonations]], fire and safety hazards, astrophysics etc. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of [[methane]] in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of [[chemical kinetics]].

===Magnetohydrodynamics===
{{main|Magnetohydrodynamics}}
[[Magnetohydrodynamics]] is the multi-disciplinary study of the flow of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] fluids in [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields. Examples of such fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, liquid metals, and [[Saline water|salt water]]. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism.

===Relativistic fluid dynamics===
Relativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the [[velocity of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landau |first=Lev Davidovich |first2=Evgenii Mikhailovich |last2=Lifshitz |title=Fluid Mechanics |location=London |publisher=Pergamon |year=1987 |isbn=0-08-033933-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of fluid dynamics accounts the relativistic effects both from the [[special theory of relativity]] and the [[general theory of relativity]]. The governing equations are derived in [[Riemannian geometry]] for [[Minkowski spacetime]].

===Other approximations===
There are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.
* The ''[[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]'' neglects variations in density except to calculate [[buoyancy]] forces. It is often used in free [[convection]] problems where density changes are small.
* ''[[Lubrication theory]]'' and ''[[Hele–Shaw flow]]'' exploits the large [[aspect ratio]] of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.
* ''[[Slender-body theory]]'' is a methodology used in [[Stokes flow]] problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.
* The ''[[shallow-water equations]]'' can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a [[free surface]], in which surface [[slope|gradients]] are small.
* ''[[Darcy's law]]'' is used for flow in [[porous medium|porous media]], and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.
* In rotating systems, the ''[[quasi-geostrophic equations]]'' assume an almost [[Balanced flow#Geostrophic flow|perfect balance]] between [[pressure gradient]]s and the [[Coriolis force]]. It is useful in the study of [[atmospheric dynamics]].

== Terminology in fluid dynamics ==
The concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics.  A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not.  Pressure can be [[Pressure measurement|measured]] using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.

Some of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study.  In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in [[fluid statics]].

=== Terminology in incompressible fluid dynamics ===
The concepts of total pressure and [[dynamic pressure]] arise from [[Bernoulli's equation]] and are significant in the study of all fluid flows.  (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense—they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.)  To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term [[static pressure]] to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure.  [[Static pressure]] is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.

A point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (i.e. speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance.  It is of such importance that it is given a special name—a [[stagnation point]].  The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name—[[stagnation pressure]].  In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.

=== Terminology in compressible fluid dynamics ===
In a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (e.g. total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound).  These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.

To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix "static" is commonly used (e.g. static temperature, static enthalpy).  Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (i.e. "density" and "static density" mean the same thing).  The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.

Because the total flow conditions are defined by [[isentropic]]ally bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition.  As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply "entropy".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">The '''Ford Seattle-ite XXI''' was a 3/8 scale [[concept car]] designed by [[Alex Tremulis]] and displayed on 20 April 1962 on the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] stand at the [[Century 21 Exposition|Seattle World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A century of automotive style: 100 years of American car design |first1=Michael |last1=Lamm |first2=Dave |last2=Holls |publisher=Lamm-Morada Publishing Co |year=1996 |isbn=0-932128-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Motor |volume=121 |publisher=Temple Press |year=1962 |page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==

The car contained novel ideas that have since become reality: interchangeable fuel cell power units; interchangeable bodies; interactive computer navigation, mapping, and auto information systems; and four driving and steering wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 |title=Six wheels - count 'em - six |magazine=Popular Mechanics |issue=May |year=1968 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The concept of some form of compact nuclear propulsion device was included as a possible power source on the assumption that radiation issues could be overcome without the need for massive shielding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ford Seattle-ite XXI |first1=Edward |last1=Janicki |first2=Gregory |last2=Janicki |title=Cars Detroit never built: fifty years of American experimental cars |publisher=Sterling Publications Company |year=1995 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=X Cars of the Future |author=Henry Bolles Lent |title=The X cars: Detroit's one-of-a-kind autos |publisher=Putnam |year=1971 |page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car had six wheels, with four steerable ones at the front and two fixed ones at the rear – similar to the fictional six-wheel 1965 [[FAB1]] and the real [[Tyrrell P34]] racing car of the mid-1970s. The designers considered the six-wheel concept would enhance tracking, traction, and braking. It had an interchangeable front-powered section that enabled the car to be turned into either an economical city runabout or, when needed, a powerful transcontinental cruiser. All control mechanisms were through flexible couplings. Steering was by way of a fingertip-controlled dial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naTGrGZ-MTsC&amp;pg=PA6 |title=Automobiles |first=Joe |last=Callahan |journal=Boys' Life |publisher=Boy Scouts Association of America |issue=March |year=1966 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friends of Baxter Creek''' is a community organization in [[El Cerrito, California]].&lt;ref name="ec"&gt;[http://www.el-cerrito.org/public_works/creeks.html Creeks]. City of El Cerrito.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was created by those passionate about restoring [[Baxter Creek]] in El Cerrito and [[Richmond, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://baynature.org/organizations/friends-of-baxter-creek FOBC]. Bay Nature.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has led to the restoration of various stretches of the creek. The FoGC has also made it that creek restoration is a part of any development effort along the path of this small river. The friends created along with the city of El Cerrito "Baxter Creek Gateway Park" along the [[Ohlone Greenway]] and the [[Richmond Greenway]].&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">[[The]] '''Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor''' ('''GT-MHR''') is a [[nuclear fission]] power [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] design that was under development by a group of Russian enterprises ([[OKBM Afrikantov]], [[Kurchatov Institute]], VNIINM and others), an American group headed by [[General Atomics]], French [[Framatome]] and Japanese [[Fuji Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/33/033/33033031.pdf |title=GT-MHR PROJECT |publisher=IAEA |date= |accessdate=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[helium]] cooled, [[graphite]] [[Neutron moderator|moderated]] reactor and uses [[TRISO]] fuel compacts in a [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] design.

==Construction==
The core consists of a graphite cylinder with a radius of 4&amp;nbsp;m and a height of 10 m which includes 1 m axial reflectors at top and bottom. The cylinder allocates three or four concentric rings, each of 36 hexagonal blocks with an interstitial gap of 0.2&amp;nbsp;cm. Each hexagonal block contains 108 helium coolant channels and 216 fuel pins. Each fuel pin contains a random lattice of TRISO particles dispersed into a graphite matrix. The reactor exhibits a [[Thermal neutron|thermal]] spectrum with a peak located at about 0.2 eV. The [[TRISO]] fuel concept allows the reactor to be inherently safe. The reactor and containment structure are located below grade and in contact with the ground, which serves as a passive safety measure to conduct heat away from the reactor in the event of a coolant failure.&lt;ref&gt;Labar, Malcomb P. "The Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor: A promising option for near term deployment" San Diego, CA; General Atomics Presentation; 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor utilizes the [[Brayton cycle]] turbine arrangement, which gives it an efficiency of up to 48% – higher than any other reactor, as of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/ne161/alwong/ne161.html The Fifty Percent Efficiency Nuclear Power Plant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408111808/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/ne161/alwong/ne161.html |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commercial [[light water reactors]] (LWRs) generally use the [[Rankine cycle]], which is what coal-fired power plants use.  Commercial LWRs average 32% efficiency, again as of 1995.

==Energy Multiplier Module (EM2)==

In 2010 General Atomics conceptualized a new reactor that utilizes the power conversion features of the GT-MHR, the [[Energy multiplier module|Energy Multiplier Module]] (EM2). The EM2 uses [[fast neutron reactor|fast neutrons]] and is a [[gas-cooled fast reactor]], enabling it to reduce [[nuclear waste]] considerably by [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.com/advanced-reactors |title=Energy Multiplier Module (EM²) |publisher=Ga.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Gimmick''' refers to a [[foreign tax credit]] deal enacted in November 1950 by the US Government under president [[Harry Truman]] between [[Ibn Saud|King Ibn Saud]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the Arabian-American Oil Company ([[ARAMCO]]), a consortium comprising Standard Oil of California (Chevron), Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon), Standard Oil of New York (Mobil) and Texaco. King Ibn Saud was being influenced by [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]] of Venezuela who cut a similar 50/50 deal with New Jersey [[Standard Oil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. This 50/50 deal accorded the American oil companies a [[tax break]] equivalent to 50% of their profits on oil sales, with the other 50% to be diverted to King Ibn Saud via the US Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHfVWjHAjCoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=from+open+citino&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vulMT4iNKISs0QXLjoWfBQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=profit%20sharing&amp;f=false|title=From Arab Nationalism to OPEC: Eisenhower, King Saʻūd, and the making of U.S-Saudi relations
|work=Nathan J. Citino|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2002|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The King agreed to this 50/50 splitting of Aramco's oil profits instead of nationalizing Aramco's oil facilities on Saudi soil. [[Venezuela]] eventually led the effort in forming [[OPEC]] and Saudi Arabia gained full control of Aramco by 1980.

The '''HVDC Troll''' is a [[High-voltage direct current#Bipolar|bipolar]] [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) [[electric power transmission]] line for the supply of the gas compressor station on the offshore construction work [[Troll_A_platform|Troll A]] platform. It consists of dual set of a {{convert|68|km|adj=on}} long bipolar submarine cable designed for ±60&amp;nbsp;kV between the inverter at the Troll A platform and the static rectifier station at [[Kollsnes]] in Norway. The HVDC Troll has a maximum transmission rate of {{nowrap|84 megawatt.}} 

In 2013 work started on a new rectifier station at Kollsnes for supplying the two new compressors being installed on Troll A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13977">[[File:Horse artillery rear.jpg|thumb|A lifesize model of a Swedish 1850s horse artillery team towing a light artillery piece, in the [[Swedish Army Museum]], [[Stockholm]].]]
'''Horse artillery''' was a type of light, fast-moving, and fast-firing [[artillery]] which provided highly mobile [[fire support]], especially to [[cavalry]] units. Horse artillery units existed in armies in [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], and some Asian countries, from the 17th to the early 20th century. A precursor of modern [[self-propelled artillery]], it consisted of light [[cannon]]s or [[howitzer]]s attached to light but sturdy two-wheeled carriages called [[Caisson (military)|caissons]] or limbers, with the individual crewmen riding on horses. This was in contrast to the rest of the [[field artillery]], in which the pieces were heavier and the crew marched on foot, or in some cases rode on the guns or caissons.

== Tactics ==
[[File:QF13pounderBouncingNYTribune20October1918.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Ordnance QF 13-pounder|QF 13-pounder]] of the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] moving into position on the [[Western Front of World War I|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]]]
Once in position, horse artillery crews were trained to quickly dismount, deploy or unlimber their guns (detach them from their caissons), then rapidly fire [[grapeshot]], [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s or [[round shot]] at the enemy. They could then just as rapidly limber-up (reattach the guns to the caissons), remount, and be ready to move to a new position, similar to the [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics of their modern counterparts.

Horse artillery was highly versatile and often supported friendly cavalry units by disrupting enemy [[infantry]] formations such as [[infantry square]]s with rapid concentrated fire. This would leave the enemy infantry vulnerable to cavalry charges. Their mobility also enabled them to outmaneuver enemy foot artillery units, and to act as a [[rearguard]] (in concert with friendly cavalry) to cover the retreat of slower units. A full battery could have a combined front of riders over 50&amp;nbsp;men strong. If the horse artillery was mistaken for cavalry, the enemy might receive an unpleasant surprise when the towed batteries wheeled around, unlimbered, loaded, sighted and opened fire. Highly proficient batteries could do so in less than a minute.

==History==

===Origins===
Essentially a hybrid of [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]], irregular horse artillery units were first used by Sweden in the 17th century during the [[Thirty Years' War]] by [[Lennart Torstenson]]. Torstenson was the artillery expert of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], and used them to provide cavalry with the fire support it needed to deal with massed [[infantry]] formations without sacrificing their speed and mobility. Gustavus Adolphus had previously tried intermixing infantry units with cavalry, and this was somewhat successful since the cavalry at that time did not charge the enemy at full gallop.

Others tried to combine firepower with mobility by using novel [[cavalry tactics]] such as the [[caracole]], but these slowed the cavalry down and proved largely ineffective. The best solutions involved creating hybrid units of mounted infantry, most notably [[dragoons]]. Although they proved highly useful and versatile troops, whether they fired mounted or dismounted, they still had to slow down or stop at least temporarily, thereby losing their main advantages as cavalry.

In the early 18th century the Russian army began equipping cavalry formations with small units of light horse artillery equipped with 2-pound cannons, and portable 3-pound mortars which were transported on horseback (the weights refer to the size of the projectiles, not the artillery pieces.) Though not decisive by themselves, these units inflicted losses on Prussian troops and influenced [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] to form the first regular horse artillery unit in 1759.

===18th century modernization===
Frederick understood that the greatest threat to massed infantry was concentrated artillery fire. He realized that even small and relatively light guns could severely disrupt or destroy infantry units if they could be brought in close enough and fire often enough.  But since even light foot artillery travelled at the speed of a marching soldier, the solution was to make every artilleryman a part-time horseman. Through relentless drill and discipline Frederick emphasized mobility and speed in all phases of their operations. The unit consisted of a battery of six 6-pound cannons with 48 men, including 3 officers. The battery was wiped out and reformed twice in that same year at the [[Battle of Kunersdorf]] and the [[Battle of Maxen]]. Despite the setbacks, the new arm had proved so successful that it was quickly reorganized and by the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1792 consisted of three companies of 605&amp;nbsp;men, with batteries consisting of eight 6-pound guns and one 7-pound mortar each.

French artilleryman, engineer and general [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval]] had served with the military mission to [[Prussia]],&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield (2011), p20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fighting against Frederick in the [[Seven Years' War]]. After that war he made numerous technical improvements to French cannons which made them lighter, faster and much easier to aim. These improvements proved a great advantage to horse artillery as well. Later, the British army officer [[Henry Shrapnel]] invented a deadly new type of ammunition that was put to effective use by horse artillery units.

The popularity of the new type of unit caught on quickly with other armies. Austria organized a limited amount of "cavalry artillery" in 1778 where most of the gun crew rode specially designed, padded gun carriages called ''Wursts'' ("sausages"), rather than on separate horses, into battle. Hanover formed its first cavalry batteries in 1786 and the Hanoverian general Victor von Trew performed several trials in 1791 which proved the great speed and efficiency by which an all-mounted crew could operate. At this time the Denmark had also formed mounted artillery units and by 1792 Sweden had formed its first regular riding batteries,&lt;ref&gt;Hedberg, 1987, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Great Britain in 1793, Russia in 1794 and Portugal in 1796.

===19th century zenith===
[[File:Detaille - Artillerie à cheval de la Garde Imperiale.jpg|thumb|left|French horse artilleryman of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]]]]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], horse artillery would be used extensively and effectively in every major battle and campaign.
The largest and probably most efficient horse artillery of any nation was that of the French revolutionary army which was first formed in 1792. The French units were especially well-trained and disciplined since the newly formed arm had proved very popular and could draw on a considerable number of recruits. By 1795 it had grown to eight regiments of six six-gun batteries each, making it the largest horse artillery force ever assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Hedberg (1987), pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse artillery units generally used lighter pieces (6-pounders), pulled by six horses. 9-pounders were pulled by eight horses, and heavier artillery pieces (12-pounders) needed a team of twelve horses. With the individual riding horses required for officers, surgeons and other support staff, as well as those pulling the artillery guns and supply wagons, an artillery battery of six guns could require 160 to 200 horses.&lt;ref name="Nofi130"&gt;Nofi (1993), pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Horse artillery usually came under the command of cavalry divisions, but in some battles, such as [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], horse artillery was used as a rapid response force, repulsing attacks and assisting the infantry.&lt;ref name="MH415"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Military History'', p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Agility was important; the ideal artillery horse was around 15-16 [[hand (measurement)|hands]] high (150–160&amp;nbsp;cm, 60 to 64 inches), strongly built, but able to move quickly.&lt;ref name="Cotner1"&gt;Cotner (1996); "In his textbook, Gibbon described what was desired in an artillery horse: 'The horse for artillery service should be from fifteen to sixteen hands high ... should stand erect on his legs, be strongly built, but free in his movements."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benson's Battery M at Fair Oaks 1862.jpg|thumb|Battery M, 2nd U.S. Horse Artillery, 1862. Photo by James F. Gibson. Library of Congress]]
In the [[Mexican–American War]], the U.S. Army horse artillery, or "flying artillery" played a decisive role in several key battles. In the [[American Civil War]], various elements of the horse artillery of the [[Army of the Potomac]] were at times grouped together in the [[U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade]]. In the U.S., units of horse artillery were generally referred to officially as "light artillery".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th and early 20th century, European-style horse artillery was used in South American countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], quite prominently during the [[War of the Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;Markham, 1892, pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4g9AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern decline===
As technology advanced and the firepower of infantry and foot artillery increased, the role of cavalry, and thus the horse artillery, began to decline. It continued to be used and improved into the early 20th century, seeing action during and in between both world wars. In World War I, Russia and some other countries equipped the artillery batteries of their cavalry divisions with the same field gun used by other units. France and the United Kingdom, however, used specialist horse guns (the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1912 Schneider]] and the [[Ordnance QF 13 pounder]], respectively.)&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery riding during a gun salute ceremony.jpg|thumb|King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery at a gun salute ceremony in 2012]]
Subsequently, the cavalry and horse artillery units rearmed with [[tank]]s and [[self-propelled artillery]]. As with the cavalry, though, certain artillery units, for instance the [[Royal Horse Artillery]], retain their old designations. Horse artillery was last used in a few units in [[World War II]], including the Wehrmacht's cavalry divisions on the Eastern Front,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian "fast divisions"(i.e. in the [[Charge of the Savoia Cavalleria at Isbuscenskij|Isbuscenskij charge]]), and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, 2002, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; A form of riding artillery using heavy machine guns called [[tachanka]]s were used by the Poles and Russians in [[World War I]], the [[Russian Civil War]], and the German [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] retains six traditional teams of six horses each and [[Ordnance QF 13 pounder|13-pounder guns]] for ceremonial duties to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/kings_troop/default.aspx|title=King's Troop RHA|publisher=British Army|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514011520/http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/kings_troop/default.aspx|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle''' (HICEV) is a type of [[hydrogen vehicle]] using an [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://avt.inel.gov/hydrogen.html INL-Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles are different from hydrogen [[fuel cell vehicle]]s (which use [[electrochemical]] conversion of hydrogen rather than combustion); the hydrogen internal combustion engine is simply a modified version of the traditional gasoline-powered internal combustion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen Use in Internal Combustion Engines|url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf|publisher=US Department of Engergy|accessdate=25 July 2017|date=December 2001}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Francois Isaac de Rivaz]] designed in 1806 the [[De Rivaz engine]], the first internal combustion engine, which ran on a [[Oxyhydrogen|hydrogen/oxygen]] mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eckermann|first=Erik|title=World History of the Automobile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22François+Isaac+de+Rivaz%22&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|location=Warrendale, PA|year=2001|isbn=0-7680-0800-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Étienne Lenoir]] produced the [[Hippomobile (car)|Hippomobile]] in 1863. Paul Dieges patented in 1970 a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3844262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tokyo City University]] have been developing hydrogen internal combustion engine from 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furuhama|first=Shouichi|title=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Volume 3, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 61–81|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360319978900575|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|location=|year=1978|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently developed hydrogen fueled Bus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hess.jp/Search/data/34-02-041.pdf Hydrogen Fuel ICE Bus developed by TCU]&lt;/ref&gt; and Truck.

Mazda has developed [[Wankel engine]]s that burn hydrogen. The advantage of using ICE (internal combustion engine) such as wankel and piston engines is that the cost of retooling for production is much lower. Existing-technology ICE can still be used to solve those problems where fuel cells are not a viable solution as yet, for example in cold-weather applications.

Between 2005 - 2007, [[BMW]] tested a luxury car named the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]], powered by a hydrogen ICE, which achieved 301&amp;nbsp;km/h (187&amp;nbsp;mph) in tests.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} At least two of these concepts have been manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[HICE forklift truck]]s have been demonstrated &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linde-mh.com/news/detail/news080526_29.php Linde X39]
&lt;/ref&gt; based on converted diesel internal combustion engines with [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hfpeurope.org/uploads/700/836/2005_HFP_Brussels_HyICE.pdf HyICE]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alset GmbH]] developed a hybrid hydrogen systems that allows vehicle to use petrol and hydrogen fuels individually or at the same time with an [[internal combustion engine]]. This technology was used with [[Aston Martin]] [[Aston Martin Rapide S|Rapide S]] during the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] race. The Rapide S was the first vehicle to finish the race with hydrogen technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Paula|first=Matthew|title=Aston Martin Favors Hydrogen Over Hybrids, At Least For Now|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2013/04/30/aston-martin-favors-hydrogen-power-over-hybrids-at-least-for-now/|work=Forbes|publisher=Forbes Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low emissions==
The combustion of hydrogen with oxygen produces water as its only product:
:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
In contrast, combustion of high temperature combustion fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline, or natural gas, with air can produce oxides of nitrogen, known as [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Tuning a hydrogen engine in 1976 to produce the greatest amount of emissions possible resulted in emissions comparable with consumer operated gasoline engines from 1976. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Performance and emissions of hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines

|volume=1|issue=2|pages=153–172|year=1976|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(76)90068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

==Adaptation of existing engines==
The differences between a hydrogen ICE and a traditional gasoline engine include hardened [[valve]]s and [[valve seat]]s, stronger [[connecting rod]]s, non-platinum tipped [[spark plug]]s, a higher voltage [[ignition coil]], [[fuel injection|fuel injector]]s designed for a gas instead of a liquid, larger [[harmonic damper|crankshaft damper]], stronger [[head gasket]] material, modified (for [[supercharger]]) [[inlet manifold|intake manifold]], positive pressure supercharger, and a high temperature [[motor oil|engine oil]]. All modifications would amount to about one point five times (1.5) the current cost of a gasoline engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwcog.org/uploads/committee-documents/v1ldW1s20060524145809.ppt Converting of gasoline ICE to hydrogen ICE]&lt;/ref&gt; These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do.

The theoretical maximum power output from a hydrogen engine depends on the [[air–fuel ratio|air/fuel ratio]] and fuel injection method used. The [[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometric ratio|stoichiometric air/fuel ratio]] for hydrogen is 34:1. At this air/fuel ratio, hydrogen will displace 29% of the combustion chamber leaving only 71% for the air. As a result, the energy content of this mixture will be less than it would be if the fuel were gasoline. Since both the [[carburetor|carbureted]] and [[indirect injection|port injection]] methods mix the fuel and air prior to it entering the combustion chamber, these systems limit the maximum theoretical power obtainable to approximately 85% of that of gasoline engines. For [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] systems, which mix the fuel with the air after the intake valve has closed (and thus the combustion chamber has 100% air), the maximum output of the engine can be approximately 15% higher than that for gasoline engines.

Therefore, depending on how the fuel is metered, the maximum output for a hydrogen engine can be either 15% higher or 15% less than that of gasoline if a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio is used. However, at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, the combustion temperature is very high and as a result it will form a large amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is a [[Criteria air pollutants|criteria pollutant]]. Since one of the reasons for using hydrogen is low exhaust emissions, hydrogen engines are not normally designed to run at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio.

Typically hydrogen engines are designed to use about twice
as much air as theoretically required for complete combustion.
At this air/fuel ratio, the formation of NOx is reduced
to near zero. Unfortunately, this also reduces the power output
to about half that of a similarly sized gasoline engine. To
make up for the power loss, hydrogen engines are usually
larger than gasoline engines, and/or are equipped with turbochargers
or superchargers.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905043908/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant''''', a 1998 book by Joan Aron,&lt;ref&gt;Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant. By Joan Aron. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; presents the first detailed case study of how an activist public and elected officials of [[New York state]] opposed the [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant]] on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Licensed to Kill?: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v041/41.1pope.html|journal = Technology and Culture|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 1097-3729|pages = 156-158|volume = 41|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/tech.2000.0029|first = Daniel|last = Pope}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains that [[nuclear power]] faltered when "public concerns about health, safety, and the environment superseded other interests about national security or energy supplies".&lt;ref name=art&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3854/is_199904/ai_n8829288/print?tag=artBody;col1 Nuclear Politics in America: A History and Theory of Government Regulation / Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958-1978 / Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron argues that the Shoreham closure resulted from the collapse of public trust for the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and the entire nuclear industry. For Aron, the unwillingness of the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) management to consider true public interest in the debate resulted in "the loss of the goodwill of its customers". Also, the willingness of LILCO to press on with plans for Shoreham despite changes in the economics of nuclear power and market demand "reflected a basic failure of foresight".&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

A '''linear transformer driver''' (LTD) is an annular [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] connection of switches and [[capacitor]]s designed to deliver rapid high [[Power (physics)|power]] pulses. The LTD was designed at the Institute of High Current Electronics (IHCE) in [[Tomsk]], Russia. The LTD is capable of producing high current pulses, up to 1 mega amps (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[ampere]]), with a [[risetime]] of less than 100 ns. This is an improvement over [[Marx generator]] based [[pulsed power]] devices which require pulse compression to achieve such fast risetimes. It is being considered as a driver for [[z-pinch]] based [[inertial confinement fusion]].

==LTDs at Sandia National Laboratories==

[[Sandia National Laboratory]] is currently investigating a z-pinch as a possible ignition source for inertial confinement fusion. On its "[[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]]", Sandia can achieve dense, high temperature plasmas by firing fast, 100-nanosecond current pulses exceeding 20 million amps through hundreds of tungsten wires with diameters on the order of tens of micrometres. The LTD is currently being investigated as a driver for the next generation of high power accelerators.

Sandia's roadmap includes another future Z machine version called ZN (Z Neutron) to test higher yields in fusion power and automation systems. ZN is planned to give between 20 and 30 MJ of hydrogen fusion power with a shot per hour thanks to Russian Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) replacing the current Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html Rapid-fire pulse brings Sandia’s Z method closer to goal of developing high-yield fusion reactor], Sandia's press release (April 27 , 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; After 8 to 10 years of operation, ZN would become a transmutation pilot plant capable of a fusion shot every 100 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/067148.pdf Z-Inertial Fusion Energy: Power Plant Final Report FY 2006], Sandia Report SAND2006-7148 (October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step planned would be the Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven prototype fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes.&lt;ref&gt;W.A.

[[File:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent paint used in contemporary art]]


'''Luminous paint''' or '''luminescent paint''' is [[paint]] that exhibits [[luminescence]]. In other words, it gives off [[Visible spectrum|visible]] [[light]] through [[fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence]], or [[radioluminescence]]. There are three types of luminous paints..

== Fluorescent paint ==
{{further|Blacklight paint}}
[[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] paints offer a wide range of [[pigment]]s and [[colorfulness|chroma]] which also 'glow' when exposed to the long-wave "[[ultraviolet]]" frequencies (UV). These UV frequencies are found in sunlight and some artificial lights, but they—and their glowing-paint applications—are popularly known as [[black light]] and 'black-light effects', respectively.

In fluorescence the [[visible light]] component—sometimes known as "[[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]]"—tends to be reflected and perceived normally, as colour; while the UV component of light is modified, 'stepped down' energetically into longer wavelengths, producing additional visible light frequencies, which are then emitted alongside the reflected white light. Human eyes perceive these changes as the unusual 'glow' of ''fluorescence''.

The fluorescent type of luminescence is significantly different from the natural [[bioluminescence]] of bacteria, insects and fish such as the case of the firefly, etc. Bio-luminescence involves no reflection at all, but living generation of light (via the chemistry of [[Luciferin]]).

There are both visible and invisible fluorescent paints. The visible appear under [[white]] light to be any bright color, turning peculiarly brilliant under black lights. Invisible fluorescent paints appear transparent or pale under daytime lighting, but will glow under UV light in a limited range of colors. Since these can seem to 'disappear', they can be used to create a variety of clever effects.

Both types of fluorescent painting benefit when used within a contrasting ambiance of clean, matte-black backgrounds and borders. Such a "black out" effect will minimize other awareness, so cultivating the peculiar luminescence of UV fluorescence. Both types of paints have extensive application where artistic lighting effects are desired, particularly in "black box" entertainments and environments such as theaters, bars, shrines, etc. Out-of-doors, however, UV wavelengths are rapidly scattered in space{{clarify|reason = The air is exactly the same inside as outside. Why would UV be "scattered" any differently?|date=November 2015}} (waves are known to bounce off surfaces, outdoors the bounce is imperceptible) or absorbed by complex natural surfaces, dulling the effect.{{clarify|reason= Why would the absorption of UV by surrounding surfaces dull the effect seen on treated surfaces? Earlier it was said that a matte-black background, which presumably also absorbs UV, *enhances* the effect.|date=November 2015}} (Humans only see reflected waves of photons, which are light; black matte is ultimate absorption at infinite angles thus enhancing any escaped wave of light. Thus, dim becomes bright.) Furthermore, the complex pigments will degrade quickly in sunlight.

== Phosphorescent paint ==

[[Phosphorescence|Phosphorescent]] paint is commonly called "glow-in-the-dark" paint. It is made from [[phosphors]] such as silver-activated [[zinc sulfide]] or [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[strontium aluminate]], and typically glows a pale green to greenish-blue color. The mechanism for producing light is similar to that of fluorescent paint, but the emission of visible light persists long after it has been exposed to light. Phosphorescent paints have a sustained glow which lasts for up to 12 hours after exposure to light, fading over time.

This type of paint has been used to mark escape paths in aircraft and for decorative use such as "stars" applied to walls and ceilings. It is an alternative to radioluminescent paint. [[Kenner]]'s ''Lightning Bug Glo-Juice'' was a popular non-toxic paint product in 1968, marketed at children, alongside other glow-in-the-dark toys and novelties. Phosphorescent paint is typically used as body paint, on children's walls and outdoors.

When applied as a paint or a more sophisticated coating (e.g. a [[thermal barrier coating]]), phosphorescence can be used for temperature detection or degradation measurements known as [[phosphor thermometry]].

== Radioluminescent paint ==
{{main|Radioluminescence}}

Radioluminescent paint is a self-luminous paint that consists of a small amount of a [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] [[isotope]] ([[radionuclide]]) mixed with a [[radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] [[phosphor]] chemical. The radioisotope continually decays, emitting radiation particles which strike molecules of the phosphor, exciting them to emit visible light. The isotopes selected are typically strong emitters of [[Beta decay|beta radiation]], preferred since this radiation will not penetrate an enclosure. Radioluminescent paints will glow without exposure to light until the radioactive isotope has decayed (or the phosphor degrades), which may be many years.

Because of safety concerns and tighter regulation, consumer products such as clocks and watches now increasingly use phosphorescent rather than radioluminescent substances. Radioluminescent paint may still be preferred in specialist applications, such as [[diving watch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/rpnews/rpa21.htm#a11 Hazards from luminised timepieces in watch/clock repair], UK Health and Safety Executive&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radium===
[[File:Radium Dial.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A 1950s radium clock, exposed to [[black light|ultraviolet light]] to increase luminescence]]
{{main|Radium dials}}
Radioluminescent paint was invented in 1908 by [[Sabin Arnold von Sochocky]]&lt;ref name="Sochocky"&gt;{{cite news|title=Radium paint takes its inventor's life; Dr. Sabin A. von Sochocky Ill a Long Time, Poisoned by Watch Dial Luminant. 13 Blood Transfusions. Death Due to Aplastic Anemia-- Women Workers Who Were Stricken Sued Company| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=15 November 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and originally incorporated [[radium]]-226. Radium paint was widely used for 40 years on the faces of watches, compasses, and aircraft instruments, so they could be read in the dark. Radium is a [[Ionizing radiation#Health effects|radiological hazard]], emitting [[gamma ray]]s that can penetrate a glass watch dial and into human tissue. During the 1920s and 1930s, the harmful effects of this paint became increasingly clear. A notorious case involved the "[[Radium Girls]]", a group of women who painted watchfaces and later suffered adverse health effects from ingestion. In 1928, Dr von Sochocky himself died of aplastic anemia as a result of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Sochocky"/&gt; Radium was banned from this use decades ago by international law, but the thousands of legacy radium dials still owned by the public can be a dangerous source of radioactive contamination.

Radium paint used [[zinc sulfide]] phosphor, usually trace metal [[dopant|doped]] with an [[activator (phosphor)|activator]], such as copper (for green light), silver (blue-green), and more rarely copper-magnesium (for yellow-orange light). The phosphor degrades relatively fast and the dials lose luminosity in several years to a few decades; clocks and other devices available from antique shops and other sources therefore are not luminous any more. However, due to the long 1600 year half-life of the Ra-226 isotope they are still radioactive and can be identified with a [[Geiger counter]].

The dials can be renovated by application of a very thin layer of fresh phosphor, without the radium content (with the original material still acting as the energy source); the phosphor layer has to be thin due to the light self-absorption in the material.

===Promethium===
In the second half of the 20th century, radium was progressively replaced with [[promethium]]-147. Promethium is only a relatively low-energy beta-emitter, which, unlike alpha emitters, does not degrade the phosphor lattice and the luminosity of the material does not degrade so fast. Promethium-based paints are significantly safer than radium; the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm however, is only 2.62 years, it is therefore not too suitable for long-life applications.

Promethium-based paint was used to illuminate [[Apollo Lunar Module]] electrical switch tips and painted on control panels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Experience Report – Protection Against Radiation|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tritium===
[[File:Gaseous tritium light source.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Radioluminescent]] {{convert|1.8|Ci|GBq|lk=on|adj=on}} {{convert|6|×|0.2|in|mm|adj=on}} tritium vials are simply tritium gas-filled, thin glass vials with inner surfaces coated with a [[phosphor]]. The "gaseous tritium light source" vial shown here is brand new.]]
{{main|Tritium illumination}}
The latest generation of the radioluminescent materials is based on [[tritium]], a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]] with half-life of 12.32 years that emits very low-energy beta radiation. The devices are similar to a [[fluorescent tube]] in construction, as they consist of a hermetically sealed (usually borosilicate-glass) tube, coated inside with a phosphor, and filled with tritium. They are known under many names – e.g. gaseous tritium light source (GTLS), traser, betalight.

Tritium light sources are most often seen as "permanent" illumination for the hands of [[wristwatches]] intended for diving, nighttime, or tactical use. They are additionally used in glowing [[Novelties|novelty]] [[keychain]]s, in self-illuminated [[exit sign]]s, and formerly in fishing lures. They are favored by the military for applications where a power source may not be available, such as for instrument [[dial (measurement)|dial]]s in aircraft, [[compass]]es, lights for map reading, and sights for weapons.

Tritium lights are also found in some old [[rotary dial]] telephones, though due to their age they no longer produce a useful amount of light.

The '''MV ''Treasure'' oil spill''' occurred on 23 June 2000, when the ship sank six miles off the coast of [[South Africa]] while transporting [[iron ore]] from [[China]] to [[Brazil]]. The ship was carrying an estimated 1,300 tons &lt;!-- metric tons, short tons, or long tons? --&gt; of [[fuel oil]], some of which spilled into the ocean, threatening the [[African penguin]] populations living on nearby islands. Cleanup efforts began promptly after the incident with particular attention being paid to salvaging the African penguin communities.

'''MV ''Treasure''''' was a [[Panama|Panamanian]]-registered cargo ship. The 17-year-old ship was transporting a load of {{convert|140,000|tonnes}} of iron ore from China to Brazil at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name=cedre /&gt;&lt;ref name=ironoretonscleanup&gt;{{cite news|title=Cape Town mops up after oil spill|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/cape-town-mops-up-after-oil-spill-1.41276#.Ut4OTPQo6ok|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=IOL News|date=2000-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Weekend Argus'' newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying the ship was owned by Universal Pearls, which it claimed to be the same Chinese shipping company that owned {{ship||Apollo Sea}} (which sank off [[Cape Town]]'s coast in 1994 and caused extensive environmental damage).&lt;ref name="cow"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil Slick Off South Africa Coast Shore|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/26/news/mn-44997|accessdate=2014-01-20|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2000-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of the oil spill==
''Treasure'' sank on 23 June 2000. She went down {{convert|6|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of South Africa, between [[Robben Island]] and [[Dassen Island]] after developing a hole in her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. However, the hole was not the immediate cause of the sinking. Authorities wanted to tow the ship into the South African harbor for repair, but she was too large for the maneuver and was ordered farther off-shore in an attempt to reduce environmental damage from oil pollution. The ship sank while under tow in rough seas when the tow ropes ripped loose. The ship then drifted eastward and subsequently sank.&lt;ref name="cow" /&gt; The ship's crew were airlifted to safety.

==Amount and type of oil spilled==
''Treasure'' was estimated to have been carrying 1,300 tons of [[bunker oil]] of which 400 tons, approximately 2,680 barrels, spilled into the sea off the coast.&lt;ref name="cow" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cow2&gt;{{cite news |title=Oil Spill Damage Expected to Grow |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/28/news/mn-45667 |accessdate=21 January 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles |date=2000-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BP&gt;{{cite web|title=Approximate conversion factors |url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/using-the-review/Conversionfactors.html |publisher=BP |accessdate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621141947/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/using-the-review/Conversionfactors.html |archivedate=21 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pear-shaped slick, about {{convert|3|×|4|nmi}} in area, was spotted around noon by Kuswag VII, the Department of Environmental Affairs' oil pollution patrol aircraft.&lt;ref name=IOL1&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenfeld |first=Bill |title=Officials move to contain Cape oil spill |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/officials-move-to-contain-cape-oil-spill-1.41173#.Ut4N-PQo6ok |accessdate=21 January 2014 |newspaper=IOL News |date=2000-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The oil spilled was the ship's own fuel oil, which was of the heaviest and most viscous commercial fuel that can be obtained from [[petroleum]]. Bunker oil, also known as fuel oil, is what remains after the lighter fractions (gasoline, kerosene, diesel, etc.) are removed by distillation. The heaviest materials in crude petroleum are not distilled, as their boiling points are too high to be conveniently recovered.&lt;ref name=BunkerFuels&gt;{{cite web |title=Bunker Fuels |url=http://www.liquidminerals.com/fuels.htm |publisher=Liquid Minerals Group Inc. |accessdate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125232313/http://www.liquidminerals.com/fuels.htm |archivedate=25 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, bunker oil is usually very dark in color, more dense, and a significantly more serious contaminant than less-dense oils.

==Effects of the spill==
Aside from causing the temporary closing of South Africa's ports and threats to species of [[gannet]]s, [[cormorant]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]],&lt;ref name="cow" /&gt; ''Treasure'' bunker oil spill was dubbed South Africa's worst environmental disaster, as it seriously threatened its population of African penguins.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Mike |title=Penguins swim for home as South Africa watches online |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000714&amp;slug=4031709 |accessdate=21 January 2014 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=2000-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spill mainly affected African penguin colonies inhabiting South Africa's [[Robben Island|Robben]] and Dassen Islands, which support the largest and third largest colonies of African penguins in the world. The worldwide population of African penguins is numbered at less than 180,000, and is declining.&lt;ref name=penguinslong&gt;{{cite web |title=Helping Save 20,000 Oiled Penguins in Cape Town, South Africa |url=http://www.bird-rescue.org/success-stories/saving-20,000-penguins.aspx |work=International Bird Rescue |publisher=International Bird Rescue |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 150,000 African penguins live off South Africa's coast, 19,000 of which live on Robben Island.&lt;ref name="cow" /&gt; The Robben Island nature reserve, home to about 14,000 endangered adult African penguins and 6,000 chicks, was hit badly during their breeding season by the [[oil spill]].&lt;ref name="cow2" /&gt; Over 20,000 penguins were oiled and approximately 2,000 died.&lt;ref name=peat&gt;{{cite web |title=Mopping up oil with nature's help |url=http://www.nickeypetroleum.com/pdf/bio_matrix_brochure.pdf |work=Natural Environmental Solutions |publisher=Bio Matrix Gold |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
[[South African Maritime Safety Authority]] (SAMSA) spokesman Pim Zandee reported that divers confirmed the ship had suffered structural damage when sinking and that oil globules were rising from cracks in the hull. It was also reported that engine room vents, which leaked a steady stream of oil, were closed off, drastically reducing the amount of oil polluting the surface. The dive team continued to seal oil leakages from the wreck. Three days after the sinking, the dive team reported that very little oil was leaking out of the ship.&lt;ref name="ironoretonscleanup" /&gt;

Different types of methods were used in the cleanup of the oil spill, two of which included workers loading [[kelp]] covered in oil into trucks and vacuuming up pools of oil with specially designed vacuums. In addition, [[Boom (containment)|booms]] were used to keep the oil from entering Cape Town Harbor.&lt;ref name="cow" /&gt;

South African company Bio-Matrix was contracted to help clean up the oil slick that was polluting the penguins' habitats. The company used a Canadian product, also called Bio-Matrix, made of [[sphagnum]] moss properties, which are notable for their natural ability to soak up oil. Bio-matrix works by encapsulating oil without absorbing water. Bio-Matrix is also effective in helping break down and digest oil.&lt;ref name="peat" /&gt;

The African penguin rescue effort was one of the largest bird rescue missions undertaken thanks to its many volunteers and teams of professionals. The rescue effort consisted of washing and rehabilitating already-oiled birds and capturing non-oiled birds as a preemptive measure. Within ten days of the ''Treasure'' spill, 20,251 oiled African penguins were admitted into the rehabilitation center in Cape Town, and 90% of the oiled birds were rehabilitated and released. Another 19,500 non-oiled penguins were relocated successfully.&lt;ref name="penguinslong" /&gt;

The rehabilitation effort was greatly funded by the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], which worked together with the local rehabilitation center, the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds ([[SANCCOB]]), and the [[International Bird Rescue]] Center (IBRRC), whose oiled wildlife team took action the same day the cargo ship sank. The 12-week rehabilitation process, which cared for over 20,000 birds, required over 130 international team members supervising over 45,000 volunteers, 400 tons of fish to feed the penguins, 7,000 tons of beach sand used in bird pens, and 302 {{convert|25|l|adj=on}} containers of [[detergent]] to wash the oil off the penguins' feathers.&lt;ref name="penguinslong" /&gt;

==Dive spot==
''Treasure'' is now a dive spot. The ship's large size and the facts that its hull is only {{convert|50|m}} down, and its main deck is within {{convert|30|m}} of the surface, coupled with its location in the [[Bloubergstrand]] area near Cape Town, South Africa, have contributed to its popularity. The approximate position of the wreck is {{coords|33|40.30|S|18|19.90|e|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref name=divesite&gt;[[Voy:Diving the Cape Peninsula and False Bay/MV Treasure]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Middelgrunden''' is an offshore [[wind farm]] in the [[Øresund]] 3.5&amp;nbsp;km
outside [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. When it was built in 2000, it was the world's largest offshore farm, with 20&amp;nbsp;turbines (2 MW [[Siemens Wind Power|Bonus]] each) and a capacity of 40&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]]. The farm delivers about 4% of the power for Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cece.dk/EE0911AA-D9A1-49E8-9CA2-332E37BBA568|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706184255/http://www.cece.dk/EE0911AA-D9A1-49E8-9CA2-332E37BBA568|archivedate=2007-07-06|title=Environmental Capital of Europe|publisher=Copenhagen, Environmental Capital of Europe|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the project was initiated by the ''Copenhagen Environment and Energy Office (CEEO)'' after Middelgrunden had been listed as a potential site in the Danish Action Plan for Offshore Wind. Together with the CEEO a group of local people formed the ''Middelgrunden Wind Turbine Cooperative'' and established a cooperation with Copenhagen Energy, the local electric [[public utility|utility]]. The proposed location was initially opposed by the [[Danish Society for Nature Conservation]], but this decision was later changed.

The '''Parshall flume''' is an open channel flow metering device that was developed to measure the flow of surface waters and irrigation flows.  The Parshall flume is a fixed [[hydraulic structure]]. It is used to measure [[volumetric flow rate]] in industrial discharges, municipal sewer lines, and influent/effluent flows in wastewater treatment plants.  The Parshall flume accelerates flow through a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and a drop in the floor at the flume throat.  Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow.  Some states specify the use of Parshall flumes, by law, for certain situations (commonly water rights).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/chap08_10.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030614084914/http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/chap08_10.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-06-14 |title=USBR Water Measurement Manual - Chapter 8 - FLUMES, Section 10. Parshall Flumes |publisher=Usbr.gov |accessdate=2013-04-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Parshall flume is standardized under ASTM D1941, ISO 9826:1992, and JIS B7553-1993.  The flumes are not patented and the discharge tables are not copyright protected.

A total of 22 standard sizes of Parshall flumes have been developed, covering flow ranges from 0.005 cfs [0.1416 l/s] to 3,280 cfs [92,890 l/s].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/parshall-flumes |title=Parshall Flumes for Flow Measurement |publisher=Openchannelflow |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Submergence transitions for Parshall flumes range from 50% (1”-3” sizes) to 80% (10’-50’ sizes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/parshall-flumes/flow-characteristics |title=Flow Characteristics of Parshall Flumes |publisher=Openchannelflow |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; beyond which point level measurements must be taken at both the primary and secondary points of measurement and a submergence correction must be applied to the flow equations.  It is important to note that the secondary point of measurement (Hb) for a Parshall flume is located in the throat, measuring Hb can be difficult as flow in the throat of the flume is turbulent and prone to fluctuations in the water level.  90% is viewed as the upper limit for which corrections for submerged flow are practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/parshall-flumes/submergence |title=Parshall Flume Submergence |publisher=Openchannelflow |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under laboratory conditions Parshall flumes can be expected to exhibit accuracies to within +/-2%, although field conditions make accuracies better than 5% doubtful.

== Development ==

Beginning in 1915, Dr. Ralph Parshall of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service altered the subcritical [[Venturi flume]] to include a drop in elevation through the throat of the flume. This created a transition from subcritical flow conditions to supercritical flow conditions through the throat of the flume.

Modifications to the Venturi flume that Parshall made include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parshall|first=Ralph|title=The Improved Venturi Flume|year=1928|publisher=Colorado Agricultural College|location=Fort Collins, CO|url=http://digitool.library.colostate.edu///exlibris/dtl/d3_1/apache_media/L2V4bGlicmlzL2R0bC9kM18xL2FwYWNoZV9tZWRpYS8xODU0MA==.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Decreasing the angle of convergence of the inlet walls
*Lengthening the throat
*Decreasing the angle of divergence of the outlet wall
*Introducing a drop through the throat of the flume

in 1930, the improved flume was named the Parshall Measuring Flume by the Irrigation Committee of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) in recognition of Parshall's accomplishments. Parshall was additionally honored as a Life Member of the ASCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Ralph L. Parshall Collection|url=http://lib.colostate.edu/archives/findingaids/water/wrlp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function==

[[Image:Parshall Flume.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a Parshall flume showing free flow and submerged flow operation (with optional inlet / outlet wing walls and stilling wells)]]

The Parshall Flume acts essentially as a constriction, a downward step, and then an expansion: the upstream section is uniformly converging and flat, the throat is a short parallel section that slopes downward, and the downstream section is uniformly diverging and slopes upward to an ending elevation that is less than the upstream starting elevation. The width of the throat determines the flume size; 22 standardized sizes have been developed, ranging from 1 in. to 50&amp;nbsp;ft. (0.005 ft3/s to 3,280 ft3/s).

There are two conditions of flow that can occur in a Parshall Flume: free flow and submerged flow. When free flow conditions exist, the user only needs to collect one head measurement (Ha, the primary point of measurement) to determine the discharge. For submerged flow a secondary head measurement (Hb) is required to determine the flume is submerged and the degree of submergence.

The primary point of measurement (Ha) is located in the inlet of the flume, two-thirds of the length of the converging section from the flume crest. The secondary point of measurement (Hb) is located in the throat of the flume.

A hydraulic jump occurs downstream of the flume for free flow conditions.  As the flume becomes submerged, the hydraulic jump diminishes and ultimately disappears as the downstream conditions increasingly restrict the flow out of the flume.

[[File:Parshallflume.webm|thumb|298x298px]]
The free-flow discharge can be summarized as

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H_a^n&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* ''C'' is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
* ''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' varies with flume size (e.g. 1.55 for a 1-inch flume)

== Derivation==
A Parshall Flume relies on the conservation of energy principle. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy at a given point must be equal to the energy at any other point along the stream. The total energy or “head” must be equal. 
Using the equations, we will solve for Q.

&lt;math&gt; E=y + \frac{q^2}{2gy^2}  &lt;/math&gt;	

                    
&lt;math&gt; q = \frac {Q}{b}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E_1 + \Delta z = E_2 + \Delta z = E_3 &lt;/math&gt;	

    	

Where E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy at H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;,  E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the flume crest, and E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.
Since E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is located at the flume crest where there is a steep drop, critical flow conditions occur.

&lt;math&gt; E_c = \frac{3}{2}( \frac {q^2}{g})^{1/3} = \frac{3}{2} y_c     &lt;/math&gt;	
		

Rearranging and substituting in the above equations, we get

&lt;math&gt; y_1+ \frac { \left(  \frac {Q}{b_1} \right)^2}{\left(2gy_1^2 \right)}=  \frac {3}{2} y_c &lt;/math&gt;

Or

&lt;math&gt;   \frac {2}{3} (y_1 + \frac {(\frac{Q}{b_1})^2}{2gy_1^2 })= y_c &lt;/math&gt;

Since we know that Q = v⋅y⋅b and  v = {{radic|gy&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} at critical depth, we can use these relationships to solve for the discharge.

&lt;math&gt; Q= b_2 \sqrt{g} ( \frac{2}{3} (y_1 + \frac {( \frac {Q}{b_1} )^2}{2gy_1^2 }))^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt;

Broken further down, we realize that

&lt;math&gt; \frac {(\frac {Q}{b_1})^2}{2gy_1^2}= \frac { v^2}{2g} &lt;/math&gt;	

And

&lt;math&gt; E_1= y_1+ \frac { v^2}{2g}   &lt;/math&gt;

Since this is measured upstream, where flow is sub-critical, it can be stated that y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2g

Therefore, for a rough approximation we can say

&lt;math&gt; Q \approx b_2 \sqrt{g} ( \frac{2}{3} y_1 )^ \frac{3}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation simplifies to:

*In ft3/s:       	 &lt;math&gt;	 	Q \approx 3.088(b_2)y^{1.5}		&lt;/math&gt;		
*In m3/s:        	&lt;math&gt;		Q \approx 1.704(b_2)y^{1.5}		&lt;/math&gt;		

These final two equations are very similar to the Q = CH&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; equations that are used for Parshall Flumes. In fact when looking at the flume tables, n has a value equal to or slightly greater than 1.5, while the value of C is larger than (3.088 b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but still in a rough estimation. It should be noted that the derived equations above will always underestimate actual flow since both the derived C and n values are lower than their respective chart values.

For the Parshall Flume equation used to calculate the flow rate, both empirical values C and n are known constants (with various values for each Parshall Flume size) leaving Ha (depth upstream) as the only variable needing to be measured. Likewise, in the energy conservation equation, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (or the depth of flow) is needed.

== Free Flow vs. Submerged Flow==

Free Flow – when there is no “back water” to restrict flow through a flume. Only the upstream depth needs to be measured to calculate the flow rate. A free flow also induces a hydraulic jump downstream of the flume.

Submerged Flow – when the water surface downstream of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, submerged flume conditions exist. A backwater buildup effect occurs in a submerged flume. For a flow calculation a depth measurement both upstream and downstream is needed.

Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions.  In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.

== Free flow E-Y diagram depiction ==

Illustrated above is a unitless E – Y diagram and how Energy and depth of flow changes throughout a Parshall Flume. The two blue lines represent the q values, q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the flow before the constriction, and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; representing the value at the constriction (q = Q/b= ft2/s, or flow over width in a rectangular channel). When a constriction (decrease in width) happens Between E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the q value changed (and becomes the new critical depth), while the energy remains the same. Then the flume experiences a downward step which results in a gain in energy. This gain in energy is equal to the size of the step (or Δz). From this the principles of conservation of energy are used to develop a set of calculations to predict the flow rate.

== Parshall flume discharge values ==
For free flow, the equation to determine the flow rate is simply Q = CH&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; 
where:

*	Q	is flow rate (ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
*	C 	is the free-flow coefficient for the flume (See Table 1 below)
*	H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; 	is the head at the primary point of measurement (ft)
(See Figure 1 above)
*	n 	varies with flume size (See Table 1 below)

For submerged flow, a depth of flow needs to be taken upstream (H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and downstream (H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). See locations of H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; in Figure 1.&lt;ref name=Source /&gt;

If H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is greater or equal to S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; then it is a submerged flow. If there is submerged flow, adjustments need to be made in order for the Parshall Flume to work properly.

	The discharge (Q) can be found using the following equations and table:

== Example==
Parshall Flume Free Flow Example Problem:

Using the Parshall Flume free flow equation, determine the discharge of a 72-inch flume with a depth, Ha of 3 feet.

From Table 1: Throat Width = 72 in = 6&amp;nbsp;ft, C = 24, and n = 1.59.

* Q = 24 Ha&lt;sup&gt;1.59&lt;/sup&gt;  for  a 72-inch Parshall flume 
So if there is a depth of 3 feet, the flow rate is ≈ 140&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s

Approximate the discharge using the derived discharge equation shown above (Equation 5). This equation was derived using the principles of specific energy and is only to serve as an estimate for the actual discharge of the Parshall Flume. Again, it should be noted that equations 5 and 6 will always underestimate the actual flow since both the derived C and n values are lower than their respective empirically derived chart values.

* Q = (6&amp;nbsp;ft)*(3.088)(3&amp;nbsp;ft)1.5 =  96&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s

Parshall flume submerged flow example problem:

Using the Parshall Flume flow equations and Tables 1-3, determine the flow type (free flow or submerged flow) and discharge for a 36-inch flume with an upstream depth, Ha of 1.5&amp;nbsp;ft and a downstream depth, H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.4&amp;nbsp;ft. For reference of locations H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, refer to Figure 1.

From Table 2, the Parshall Flume submergence transition (St) for a 36-inch = 3 feet flume is 0.7. Since H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than or equal to 0.7, it is a submerged flow.

Q&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; = Q&lt;sub&gt;free flow&lt;/sub&gt; – Q&lt;sub&gt;correction&lt;/sub&gt;

Q = CH&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;

From Table 1: Throat Width = 36 in = 3&amp;nbsp;ft, C = 12, and n = 1.57.

Q&lt;sub&gt;free flow&lt;/sub&gt; = 12(1.5&amp;nbsp;ft)1.57 = 22.68 ft3/s

Q&lt;sub&gt;correction&lt;/sub&gt; = M (0.000132 Ha2.123 e9.284 S)
Where S = H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4&amp;nbsp;ft/1.5&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.93

== Construction ==

A wide variety of materials are used to make Parshall flumes, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0848E/t0848e-09.htm |title=Field measurement of soil erosion and runoff - Chapter 4 Streamflow |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fiberglass (wastewater applications due to its corrosion resistance)
* Stainless steel (applications involving high temperatures / corrosive flow streams)
* Galvanized steel (water rights / irrigation)
* Concrete (large Parshall throat widths 144" [3.66 m] and above) 
* Aluminum (portable applications)
* Wood (temporary flow measurement)
* Plastic (PVC or polycarbonate / Lexan) (teaching/laboratory investigation)

Smaller Parshall flumes tend to be fabricated from fiberglass and galvanized steel (depending upon the application), while larger Parshall flumes tend to fabricated from fiberglass (sizes up to 144") or concrete (160"-600").

By the 1960s several different companies began to commercially offer Parshall flumes.  These manufacturers have typically produce flumes from one type of material only (typically fiberglass/grp or steel), although currently a few, such as Openchannelflow, offer Parshall flumes in a variety of materials.

== Installation ==

Dr. Parshall's initial focus was for the use of his namesake flume to measure flows in irrigation channels and other surface waters.

Over time, however, the Parshall flume has proven to be applicable to a wide variety of open channel flows including:

*Irrigation channels and ditches
*Furrows
*Surface waters (swales, creeks, streams, and rivers)
*Elevated, above grade piped flows
*Below grade piped flows (concrete vaults / manholes incorporated into [[Packaged Metering Manhole]]s)

== Drawbacks ==

* Parshall flumes require a drop in elevation through the flume. To accommodate the drop in an existing channel either the flume must be raised above the channel floor (raising the upstream water level) or the downstream channel must be modified.
* As with [[weir]]s, [[flume]]s can also have an effect on local fauna. Some species or certain life stages of the same species may be blocked by flumes due to relatively slow swim speeds or behavioral characteristics.
* In earthen channels, upstream bypass and downstream scour may occur.  Armoring of the upstream and downstream channels is recommended.
* Parshall flumes below 3 inches in size should not be used on unscreened sanitary flows, due to the likelihood of clogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Get Stuck:  Sanitary Flows in Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/dont-get-stuck-sanitary-flows-in-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Parshall flume is an empirical device. Interpolation between sizes is not an accurate method of developing intermediate size Parshall flumes as the flumes are not scale models of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Measurement Manual, Chapter 8, Section 10|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/chap08_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parshall Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/parshall-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recommended Practice for the Use of Parshall Flumes and Palmer-Bowlus Flumes in Wastewater Treatment Plants|date=November 1984|volume=EPA600/2-84-186|page=5|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/5000141O.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981%20Thru%201985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C81THRU85%5CTXT%5C00000014%5C5000141O.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30-inch [76.2&amp;nbsp;cm] and 42-inch [106.7&amp;nbsp;cm] sizes are examples of intermediate sizes of Parshall flumes that have crept into the marketplace without the backing of published research into their sizing and flow rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Standard Parshall Flume Sizes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/non-standard-parshall-flume-sizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

Two variations of the Parshall flume have been developed over time:  the [[Montana flume]] and the Short Section (USGS / Portable) Parshall flume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS Portable Parshall Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/usgs-portable-parshall-flume}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montana flume===

The [[Montana flume]] omits the throat and discharge sections of the Parshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montana Flume Dimensions|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/montana-flumes/dimensions}}&lt;/ref&gt; By omitting these sections, the flume is shortened by more than half, while retaining the free-flow characteristics of the same-size Parshall. With the deletion of the throat and discharge section, the Montana flume has little resistance to submersion and, like the H flume, should be used where free-spilling discharge is present under all flow conditions. The Montana flume is described in US Bureau of Reclamation's Water Measurement Manual&lt;ref name="Water Measurement Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Measurement Manual|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two technical standards MT199127AG&lt;ref name=MT199127AG&gt;{{cite web|title=MT199127AG|url=http://store.msuextension.org/Products/Water-Measurement-Montana-(Short-Parshall)-Flume-(Part-1)__MT199127AG.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MT199128AG&lt;ref name=MT199128AG&gt;{{cite web|title=MT199128AG|url=http://store.msuextension.org/Products/Water-Measurement-Montana-(Short-Parshall)-Flume-(Part-2)__MT199128AG.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Montana State University]] (note that Montana State University has currently withdrawn both standards for updating/review).

===Short Section (USGS Portable) Parshall flume===

The short-section Parshall (sometimes referred to as a USGS or Portable Parshall) omits the discharge section of the flume. Originally designed by Troxell and Taylor in 1931 and published under "Venturi Flume" as a memorandum from the office of the Ground Water Branch, USGS, the design was again brought to the attention of potential users in Taylors' paper "Portable Venturi Flume for Measuring Small Flows in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1963/0063/report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This modification - supplied by the USGS Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility - is available in two sizes:  the original 3" and the recently added 6".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/hif/programs/projects/portable_parshallflume_6in/ |title=USGS Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility Instrument Project: Six inch modified Parshall Flume (Portable) |publisher=Water.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kilpatrick notes that the discharge for this modification of the Parshall flume is slightly greater than for a standard Parshall flume of the same size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kilpatrick|author2=Schneider|title=Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations|issue=3, Chapter A14|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri3-a14/html/pdf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to potential manufacturing tolerance variations rather than the actual operation of the flume itself and users are cautioned to verify the flume's dimensions before proceeding with data collection.  As with any Parshall flume, flumes varying from the standard dimensions flumes should be individual rated.

When used for stream gauging, aluminum is the typical material of construction - primarily due to its light weight.

The '''efficiency of a plant''' is the percentage of the total [[energy]] content of a [[power plant]]'s fuel that is converted into [[electricity]]. The remaining energy is usually lost to the environment as [[heat]] unless it is used for [[district heating]].

This is complicated by the fact that there are two different ways to measure the fuel energy input—LCV = Lower Calorific Value, which is the same as NCV = Net Calorific Value, or, HCV = Higher Calorific Value which is the same as GCV, Gross Calorific Value.

Depending on which convention is used, a differences of 10% in the apparent efficiency of a gas fired plant can arise, so it is very important to know which convention, HCV or LCV (NCV or GCV) is being used.
== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ==

Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.

A '''pneumatic motor''' ('''air motor''') or '''compressed air engine''' is a type of [[Engine|motor]] which does [[mechanical work]] by expanding [[compressed air]]. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion.  Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor, piston air motor, air turbine or gear type motor.

Pneumatic motors have existed in many forms over the past two centuries, ranging in size from hand-held motors to engines of up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders; others on slotted rotors with vanes (vane motors) and others use turbines. Many compressed air engines improve their performance by heating the incoming air or the engine itself. Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directindustry.com/cat/motors-geared-motors-motion-control/pneumatic-motors-D-77.html|title=Motors and Motor Control,Pneumatic motors - All industrial manufacturers in this category - Videos|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129004608/http://www.directindustry.com/cat/motors-geared-motors-motion-control/pneumatic-motors-D-77.html|archivedate=2011-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications.  Continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry.  However, pneumatic motors must overcome inefficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry.

They have existed in many forms over the past two centuries, ranging in size from hand-held turbines up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders, others use turbines.

Some have taken this a stage further by burning fuel in the cylinder or turbine, forming a type of [[internal combustion engine]]. --&gt;

==Classification==

===Linear===
In order to achieve linear motion from compressed air, a system of pistons is most commonly used.  The compressed air is fed into an air-tight chamber that houses the shaft of the piston.  Also inside this chamber a spring is coiled around the shaft of the piston in order to hold the chamber completely open when air is not being pumped into the chamber.  As air is fed into the chamber the force on the piston shaft begins to overcome the force being exerted on the spring.&lt;ref name="engineersedge"&gt;Engineers Edge. Pneumatic actuator design and operation. Retrieved from http://www.engineersedge.com/hydraulic/pneumatic_actuator.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As more air is fed into the chamber, the pressure increases and the piston begins to move down the chamber. When it reaches its maximum length the air pressure is released from the chamber and the spring completes the cycle by closing off the chamber to return to its original position. 
	
[[Reciprocating engine#Common features in all types|Piston motors]] are the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. Essentially, piston motors are the same as [[hydraulic motor]]s except they are used to convert hydraulic energy into mechanical&lt;ref&gt;Technology zone-air motor.

Piston motors are often used in series of two, three, four, five, or six cylinders that are enclosed in a housing.  This allows for more power to be delivered by the pistons because several motors are in sync with each other at certain times of their cycle.

===Rotary vane motors===
A type of pneumatic motor, known as a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft.  The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane.&lt;ref name="vane"/&gt; The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft.  Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and the diameter of the housing.&lt;ref name="engineersedge"/&gt;
	
One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines.  Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor.  This causes the rotor to turn at high speed.  Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used.  Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input.  These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.

==Application==
A widespread application of pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, impact wrenches, pulse tools, screwdrivers, nut runners, drills, grinders, sanders and so on. Pneumatic motors are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools.  They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power &lt;ref&gt;Air motors.

==History in transportation==
The pneumatic motor was first applied to the field of transportation in the mid-19th century.  Though little is known about the first recorded compressed-air vehicle, it is said that the Frenchmen Andraud and Tessie of Motay ran a car powered by a pneumatic motor on a test track in Chaillot, France, on July 9, 1840.  Although the car test was reported to have been successful, the pair didn’t explore further expansion of the design.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;The History of compressed air vehicles. (n.d.). Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.aircarfactories.com/air-cars/compressed-air-history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103064123/http://www.aircarfactories.com/air-cars/compressed-air-history.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The first successful application of the pneumatic motor in transportation was the [[Mekarski system]] air engine used in locomotives.  Mekarski’s innovative engine overcame cooling that accompanies air expansion by heating air in a small boiler prior to use.  The [[Tramway de Nantes]], located in Nantes, France, was noted for being the first to use Mekarski engines to power their fleet of locomotives.  The tramway began operation on December 13, 1879, and continues to operate today, although the pneumatic trams were replaced in 1917 by more efficient and modern electrical trams.
	
American Charles Hodges also found success with pneumatic motors in the locomotive industry.  In 1911 he designed a pneumatic locomotive and sold the patent to the [[H.K. Porter, Inc.|H.K. Porter Company]] in Pittsburgh for use in coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, C.B (1912). U.S. Patent No. 1024778. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Because pneumatic motors do not use combustion they were a much safer option in the coal industry.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Many companies claim to be developing [[Compressed air car]]s, but none are actually available for purchase or even independent testing.

==Tools==

[[Impact wrench]]es, pulse tools, nutrunners, [[screwdriver]]s, [[drill]]s, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinders]], [[die grinder]]s, [[sander]]s, [[dental drill]]s and other [[pneumatic tool]]s use a variety of [[air motor]]s. These include vane type motors, [[turbine]]s and piston motors.

==Torpedoes==
Most successful early forms of self-propelled [[torpedo]]es used [[Torpedo#Compressed air|high pressure compressed air]], although this was superseded by internal or external combustion engines, steam engines, or electric motors.

==Railways==
Compressed air engines were used in trams and shunters, and eventually found a successful niche in mining locomotives, although in the end they were replaced by electric trains, underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm|title=Compressed-Air Propulsion|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027073257/http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm|archivedate=2014-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years designs increased in complexity, resulting in a triple expansion engine with air-to-air reheaters between each stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aircaraccess.com/images/3stage%201.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031053915/http://www.aircaraccess.com/images/3stage%201.jpg |archivedate=2015-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[Fireless locomotive]] and [[Mekarski system]].

==Flight==

Transport category airplanes, such as commercial airliners, use compressed air starters to start the main engines. The air is supplied by the load compressor of the aircraft's [[auxiliary power unit]], or by ground equipment.

[[Water rocket]]s use compressed air to power their water jet and generate thrust, they are used as toys.

[[Air Hogs]], a toy brand, also uses compressed air to power piston engines in toy airplanes (and some other toy vehicles).

==Automotive==
{{Main|Compressed-air vehicle}}

There is currently some interest in developing [[air car]]s. Several engines have been proposed for these, although none have demonstrated the performance and long life needed for personal transport.

===Energine===
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085338/http://www.energine.com/ Energine Corporation] was a [[South Korea]]n company that claimed to deliver fully assembled cars running on a hybrid compressed air and electric engine. The compressed-air engine is used to activate an [[alternator]], which extends the autonomous operating capacity of the car. The CEO was arrested for fraudulently promoting air motors with false claims.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Compressed air car#Energine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===EngineAir===
[http://www.engineair.com.au EngineAir], an Australian company, is making a [[Pistonless rotary engine|rotary engine]] powered by compressed air, called The [[Angelo Di Pietro (inventor)|Di Pietro]] motor.
The Di Pietro motor concept is based on a rotary piston. Different from existing rotary engines, the Di Pietro motor uses a simple cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver) which rolls, with little friction, inside the cylindrical stator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/airmotor.htm|title=Engineair|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005161858/http://www.engineair.com.au/airmotor.htm|archivedate=2010-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used in boat, cars, burden carriers and other vehicles. Only 1 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (≈ 6,8 [[kPa]]) of pressure is needed to overcome the friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/applications.htm|title=Engineair|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414225522/http://www.engineair.com.au/applications.htm|archivedate=2008-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/|title=Engine Air|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625150355/http://www.engineair.com.au/|archivedate=2007-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was also featured on the ABC's New Inventors programme in Australia on 24 March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s1072065.htm|title=New Inventors: Rotary Piston Engine|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909030016/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s1072065.htm|archivedate=2011-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K'Airmobiles===
K'Airmobiles vehicles were intended to be commercialized from a project developed in France in 2006-2007 by a small group of researchers. However, the project has not been able to gather the necessary funds.
 
People should note that, meantime, the team has recognized the physical impossibility to use on-board stored compressed air due to its poor energy capacity and the thermal losses resulting from the expansion of the gas. 
  
These days, using the patent pending 'K'Air Generator', converted to work as a compressed-gas motor, the project should be launched in 2010, thanks to a North American group of investors, but for the purpose of developing first a green energy power system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kair-energy.com/index.php|title=K°Air Energy Inc|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215231323/http://kair-energy.com/index.php|archivedate=2015-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MDI===
{{Main|Motor Development International}}

In the original [[Guy Nègre|Nègre]] air engine, one piston compresses air from the atmosphere to mix with the stored compressed air (which will cool drastically as it expands). This mixture drives the second piston, providing the actual engine power. MDI's engine works with constant torque, and the only way to change the torque to the wheels is to use a pulley transmission of constant variation, losing some efficiency.  When vehicle is stopped, MDI's engine had to be on and working, losing energy. In 2001-2004 MDI switched to a design similar to that described in Regusci's patents (see below), which date back to 1990.

It has been reported in 2008 that Indian car manufacturer Tata was looking at an MDI compressed air engine as an option on its low priced Nano automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/398180/tata-nano-to-offer-compressed-air-engine-optional-make-electric-cars-look-silly|title=Tata Nano To Offer Compressed Air Engine Optional, Make Electric Cars Look Silly|first=Ben|last=Wojdyla|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016153410/http://jalopnik.com/398180/tata-nano-to-offer-compressed-air-engine-optional-make-electric-cars-look-silly|archivedate=2011-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tata announced in 2009 that the compressed air car was proving difficult to develop due to its low range and problems with low engine temperatures.

===Quasiturbine===
{{Main|Quasiturbine}}
The '''Pneumatic Quasiturbine''' engine is a [[compressed air]] [[pistonless rotary engine]] using a rhomboidal-shaped [[Rotor (engine)|rotor]] whose sides are hinged at the vertices.

The Quasiturbine has demonstrated as a [[pneumatic]] engine using stored compressed air &lt;ref&gt;Quasiturbine Low RPM High Torque Pressure Driven Turbine for Top Efficiency Power Modulation. Peers reviewed paper - Published in The Proceeding of Turbo Expo 2007 of the IGTI (International Gas Turbine Institute) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).[http://www.quasiturbine.com/QTPapiers/ASME2007QTMontreal.pdf Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144212/http://www.quasiturbine.com/QTPapiers/ASME2007QTMontreal.pdf |date=2006-11-13 }} [http://www.quasiturbine.com/Presse/QTASME2007.htm info]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also take advantage of the energy amplification possible from using available external heat, such as [[solar energy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/ETypePneumatic.htm|title=Quasiturbine&gt; Type&gt; Pneumatic|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920045657/http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/ETypePneumatic.htm|archivedate=2011-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quasiturbine rotates from pressure as low as 0.1 atm (1.47psi).

Since the Quasiturbine is a pure expansion engine, while the [[Wankel]] and most other rotary engines are not, it is well-suited as a compressed fluid engine, air engine or air motor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Regusci===
Armando Regusci's version of the air engine couples the transmission system directly to the wheel, and has variable torque from zero to the maximum, enhancing efficiency. Regusci's patents date from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regusciair.com/index.html|title=REGUSCIAIR - Home|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307085856/http://regusciair.com/index.html|archivedate=2010-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team Psycho-Active ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9021">[[File:Two-pan balance 2.webm|thumb|A Roberval balance shown responding to two masses of equal weight]]

The '''Roberval balance''' is a [[weighing scale]] presented to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] by the French [[mathematician]] [[Gilles de Roberval|Gilles Personne de Roberval]] in 1669.

In this scale, two identical horizontal beams are attached, one directly above the other, to a vertical column, which is attached to a stable base. On each side, both horizontal beams are attached to a vertical beam. The six attachment points are pivots. Two horizontal plates, suitable for placing objects to be weighed, are fixed to the top of the two vertical beams. An arrow on the lower horizontal beam (and perpendicular to it) and a mark on the vertical column may be added to aid in leveling the scale.

[[File:Balance Roberval white.jpg|thumb|left|Roberval balance made by [[W &amp; T Avery Ltd.]] in England]]
The object to be weighed is placed on one plate, and calibrated masses are added to and subtracted from the other plate until level is reached. The mass of the object is equal to the mass of the calibrated masses regardless of where on the plates items are placed. Since the vertical beams are always vertical, and the weighing platforms always horizontal, the potential energy lost by a weight as its platform goes down a certain distance will always be the same, so it makes no difference where the weight is placed.  For maximum accuracy, Roberval balances require that their top [[:wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] be placed on the line between the left and right pivot so that tipping will not result in the net transfer of weight to either the left or right side of the scale: a fulcrum placed ''below'' the idea pivot point will tend to cause a net shift in the direction of any downward-moving vertical column (in a kind of [[positive feedback loop]]); likewise, a fulcrum placed ''above'' this point will tend to level out the arms of the balance rather than respond to small changes in weight (in a [[negative feedback loop]]).

[[File:Balance Roberval detail.jpg|thumb|Detail: note that the bottom horizontal beam is hidden under the protective cover]]The vertical column supporting a plate with an offset weight must be in axial compression and flexure.{{what|date=July 2016}} Here the axial compression is carried by the bearing at the top beam in most balance scales, the lower beam just being supported horizontally at midpoint by the body of the scales by a simple peg-in-slot arrangement, so it effectively hangs beneath the top beam and stops the platforms from rotating. The flexural force in the column (a.k.a. bending moment) is taken by a pair of equal and opposite forces in the horizontal beams. So if the offset weight is towards the outside of the platform, further from the centre of the scales, the top beam will be in axial tension and the bottom beam will be in axial compression. These tensions and compressions are carried by horizontal reactions from the central supports, the other side of the scales is not affected at all, nor is the balance of the scales. 

==Principles of operation==

Certain presumptions are made in a theoretical Roberval balance.  In order for such a balance to appear level in its natural state and be able to balance theoretical masses, the following must be true:

*All six pivot points must move without producing friction (since Roberval balances often actually require twice this number, a total of 12 pivot points would need to be friction free)
*The lengths of the arms (left and right of the fulcrum) must be exactly equal unless
:*The weights of the arms themselves are ''un''equal, or
:*The weights of the vertical columns and/ or pans is unequal
*The vertical distance between each vertical set of pivot points must be exactly the same
*In order to be balanced front-to-back the balance must either have two sets of two arms located around a central fulcrum or must have two fulcra supporting a single set of arms
*The weight of the arms on each side of the fulcrum must be equal (unless see above)
*The arms must be rigid and inflexible
*Gravitational force or rotational [[G force]] must be acting uniformly on the balance
*If the weight of the pan above either vertical column is itself greater than zero and any weight placed on that pan is off-center then that pan's tendency to ''tilt'' will cause the balance to exist in a state of ''tension'' at the pivot points below that pan.  This tension will manifest as an increase in static friction.
*The longer the arms generally, the more sensitive the balance, though longer arms usually entail greater arm weight, which tends to decrease sensitivity
*Heavier pans and vertical columns also tend to decrease sensitivity
*Sensitivity lost by increases in either arm weight or pan/ column weight can be counteracted only through decreased static friction in the pivot points
*The upper pivot point of the central supporting column is prevented from moving left/ right and front/ back by the fulcrum itself; it is prevented from moving up/ down by gravitational pull.  The lower pivot point of this column must be held in place so that it cannot sway left/ right and, to a lesser extent, front/ back as the arms move, but it experiences no up/ down movement forces— in this arrangement, the entire pivot process takes place on the upper central pivot point, which acts as the single fulcrum for the entire balance; it is possible to reverse this, so that the lower pivot point acts as the fulcrum and the upper is only held in place so that it cannot sway left/ right or front/back.
*Roberval balances are frequently depicted with the "pan" as a plate or peg protruding from the center of each vertical column— this is so that the balance can have a [[center of gravity]] that is in the actual center of the parallelogram and so that adding weights to these plates does not change that center of gravity.  This produces the somewhat odd result that a correctly balanced Roberval balance, unlike a beam balance, can be "balanced" in any arm position: so long as the masses of the objects on both sides are equal or the pans are empty, it will balance with the right arm up and the left arm down, as well as the left up and the right down, as well as any position in between, and all of these positions will be "correctly balanced."
:*As a corollary, because no actual two masses can have exactly the same weight, a highly precise Roberval balance measuring two such imprecise masses should ''always'' tip either ''completely'' to the left or ''completely'' to the right— it does not measure ''degree'' of difference, it indicates the ''existence'' of difference.  These effects must be distinguished from the feedback loops and the friction of the pivot points mentioned above, as those are undesirable effects caused by design weaknesses/ flaws.
*The correct method of using a precise but real Roberval balance, then, is to place one of masses (either the known or the unknown) on one plate/ pan and then add only enough of the other mass to the other pan until the balance just barely tips ''completely'' in the direction of the second added mass.  If the arms finalize in a horizontal position, this only indicates friction in the pivot points somewhere.  A well-made and precise Roberval balance with a centralized center of gravity ''never'' actually "balances".

==Accuracy==
The Roberval balance is arguably less accurate and more difficult to manufacture than a [[beam balance]] with suspended plates. The beam  balance, however, has the significant disadvantage of requiring suspensory strings, chains, or rods. For over three hundred years the Roberval balance has instead been popular for applications requiring convenience and only moderate accuracy, notably in retail trade.

==Manufacturers==
Well known manufacturers of Roberval balances include [[W &amp; T Avery Ltd.]] and [[George Salter &amp; Co. Ltd.]] in the United Kingdom and [[:fr:Trayvou|Trayvou]] in France. [[Henry Troemner]], who designed scales for the [[United States Department of Treasury]], was the first American to use the design.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Ernest. ''The Tools of the Chemist''.

A '''Rollin film''', named after Bernard V. Rollin, is a 30 [[nanometre|nm]]-thick liquid film of [[helium]] in the [[helium II]] state.  It exhibits a "creeping" effect in response to surfaces extending past the film's level ([[wave propagation]]).  Helium II can escape from any non-closed container via creeping toward and eventually evaporating from capillaries of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt; meters or greater.

Rollin films are involved in the ''fountain effect'' where [[superfluid]] helium leaks out of a container in a fountain-like manner.  They have high thermal conductivity.  

The ability of superfluid liquids to cross obstacles that lie at a higher level is often referred to as the '''Onnes effect''', named after [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]]. The Onnes effect is enabled by the [[capillary force]]s dominating gravity and viscous forces.

Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the [[van der Waals force]]. The film suffers a change in chemical potential when the thickness varies. These waves are known as '''third sound'''.

==Thickness of the film==
The thickness of the film can be calculated by the energy balance. Consider a small fluid volume element &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; which is located at a height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; from the free surface. The potential energy due to the gravitational force acting on the fluid element is &lt;math&gt;\rho g h\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the total density and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration. The quantum kinetic energy per particle is &lt;math&gt;\hbar^2/(2ml^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the film and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the particle. Therefore, the net kinetic energy is given by &lt;math&gt;\hbar^2 f\rho \Delta V/(2m^2l^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of atoms which are [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Minimizing the total energy with respect to the thickness provides us the value of the thickness&lt;ref&gt;Huang, K. (2017). A superfluid universe. World Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;l=\frac{l_o}{\sqrt{h}},\quad l_o = \frac{\hbar}{m}\sqrt{\frac{f}{2g}}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9965">The '''safety fuse''' is a type of [[fuse (explosive)|fuse]] invented and [[patent]]ed by English inventor [[William Bickford (1774–1834)|William Bickford]] in 1831. Originally it consisted of a "tube" of gunpowder surrounded by a waterproofed varnished jute "rope". It replaced earlier and less reliable methods of igniting gunpowder blasting charges which had caused many injuries and deaths in the [[mining]] industry. The safety fuse burns at a rate of typically about 30 seconds per foot (1 second per cm).

==History==
{{Main|Gunpowder}}

Documented evidence suggests that the earliest [[fuse (explosive)|fuses]] were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crocker|2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunpowder did not reach Europe until the early 13th century, carried over from China by Middle Eastern traders and merchants along the old [[Silk Road]].

For three centuries gunpowder was primarily used for military warfare. It was not until 1574 that gunpowder was first introduced to the mining industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2002|page=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it took until 1617 before it was first used in a large-scale mining operation—at [[Thillot]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2002|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensitivity of gunpowder==
{{further|Sensitivity (explosives)}}
One of the problems miners faced when introducing gunpowder into their operations was that it was relatively easy to ignite when exposed to sparks, intense heat, or flames. The method used by miners to blast away rock involved drilling several holes across a rock face which would be filled with charges of gunpowder. In order to confine the gases produced on ignition, the gunpowder was confined within each shot hole by inserting a pointed rod known as a "needle" in the gunpowder-charged hole and then packing in soft clay and tamping it down to form a plug.&lt;ref name=ihlseng-wilson&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. C. |last=Ihlseng |first2=Eugene B. |last2=Wilson |title=A Manual of Mining: based on the course of lectures on mining delivered at the school of mines of the state of Colorado |edition=Fourth |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1907 |pages=674–676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "needle" was then removed and replaced by a fuse.&lt;ref name=ihlseng-wilson/&gt; To prevent sparking, a copper needle and a non-metallic ramming rod, typically made from [[hickory]], were used.&lt;ref name=ihlseng-wilson/&gt;

If a spark was created the results could be disastrous to the work force, and this was a common occurrence.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Miners and mine owners were aware of the dangers of the use of gunpowder in  mining, as is evident in their instructions for handling the material.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen R. |last=Brown |title=A Most Damnable Invention: Dynamite, Nitrates, and the Making of the Modern World |location=New York |publisher=St. Martins |year=2005 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mill in England preparing the material wrote in its instructions, "Whosoever is at Labour within or without the [[Gunpowder magazine|powder magazines]] should execute his commission in such a respectful and revered silence as is seemly in such a place where (unless the Almighty in his Grace keeps a protective hand over the Labour) the least lack of care may not alone cause the loss of life of all present, but may even in a moment transform this place as well as its surroundings into a heap of stone."&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

The other major problem concerned the intentional ignition of the gunpowder charges. To provide some protection from the blast and the fumes, a nominated miner ignited the far end of the fuse which was intended to burn at a known rate. The miners, therefore, knowing the length of the fuse, could estimate the delay between ignition of the fuse and the ignition of the main charges. However, early fuses, known as filled "quills", had a tendency to either burn irregularly, "flash off", or break—either by separation or by "pinching" in the shot hole due to the tamping process. They could also be damaged allowing moisture in, which could cause them to [[Smouldering|smoulder]] instead of burn and introduce a long delay.&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"&gt;{{harvnb|Earl|1978|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the main charge failed to ignite, this was known as a misfire or "[[hang fire]]", and the miners would need to wait before returning to the work face to set new fuses. Increasingly, miners in Cornwall in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were becoming badly injured as a result of suspecting that there had been a misfire and returning to the work face just as a smouldering damp quill ignited the gunpowder charges.&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"/&gt;

==William Bickford==
In 1831 English merchant [[William Bickford (1774–1834)|William Bickford]] moved to the heart of the [[mining in Cornwall|Cornish mining district]] near [[Camborne]]; where at [[Tuckingmill, Camborne, Cornwall|Tuckingmill]] he developed the first practical and reliable means for igniting gunpowder when mining, the "Safety Fuze". After earlier attempts at developing a safer way had failed, Bickford had an insight while visiting his friend who was a [[ropemaker]]. While observing his friend winding cord together to generate a rope, Bickford believed he could adapt the same method towards developing a fuse. This was done with the help of his son-in-law George Smith and a working miner named Thomas Davey.&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"/&gt;

Bickford invented a machine which would thread and weave two layers of [[jute]] yarn (a shiny vegetable fibre), spun in opposite directions, over a small "tube" of gunpowder, the whole of which would then be "[[varnish]]ed" with tar to waterproof the product. The outcome was the development of a fuse which when lit "the fire only travels along it slowly, rate of burning ... being about 30 seconds per foot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Courtenay De |last=Kalb |title=Manual of Explosives: a Brief Guide for the Use of Miners and Quarrymen |location=Toronto |publisher=the Ontario Bureau of Mines |year=1900 |page= 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bickford had developed a fuse which would burn for a known length of time, depending on the length of the fuse.

Bickford obtained a British [[Patent]] for his device (No. 6159 "Safety Fuze for Igniting Gunpowder used in Blasting Rocks, Etc") on 6 September 1831. It was originally called "The Patent Safety Rod" but its name was later changed to the "Safety Fuse".&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"/&gt; It was supplied as a "rope" of about {{convert|0.375|to|0.5|inch}} diameter; and was sold at the time for about same price as its predecessor, quills, at three [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] per [[fathom]] (6&amp;nbsp;ft, 1.8 m).&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"/&gt; Bickford also set up a [[partnership]] with Thomas Davey, who gained twenty five percent of the profits for the first fourteen years.&lt;ref name="earl-67-68"/&gt;

==Impact of the safety fuse==
[[File:Fuse burning.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A burning waterproof '''fuse''']]
Given the unreliability of fuses and means of detonation prior to Bickford’s fuse, this new technology changed the safety and conditions of mining. Due to poor record keeping or lack thereof, it is relatively difficult to determine the exact number of mining accidents and related statistics prior to the invention of the safety fuse. However "this fuse soon replaced the less reliable fuses which were made of straws or quills filled with black powder, thus greatly reducing the hazard of accidental explosions in mining or construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=The Department of the Army |title=Technical Manual: Military Explosives |year=1984 |page=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Word of the reliability of Bickford's safety fuse spread, and was soon in large demand across world markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crocker|2002|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickford’s fuse not only dramatically improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but also contributed to the development of [[dynamite]]. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding [[nitroglycerine]] and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called [[kieselguhr]] into individual cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nobel Prizes: Guide to Nobel Prizes |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C06/C06Links/207.138.35.143/nobel/alfrednobel.html |accessdate= 10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a blast cap which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the blast cap and igniting the fuse, it will set the blast cap off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a blast cap into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the blast cap and producing a current which will travel from the source to the blast cap will also set off the dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F.A. |last=Abel |title=Contributions to the History of Explosive Agents |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=159 |year=1869 |page=10 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1869.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semiconductor devices''' are [[electronic component]]s that exploit the [[electronics|electronic]] properties of [[semiconductor]] materials, principally [[silicon]], [[germanium]], and [[gallium arsenide]], as well as [[organic semiconductor]]s. Semiconductor devices have replaced [[vacuum tube|thermionic devices]] (vacuum tubes) in most applications. They use [[electron]]ic [[Electrical conduction|conduction]] in the [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] as opposed to the [[gaseous state]] or [[thermionic emission]] in a high vacuum.

Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as ''[[integrated circuit]]s'' (ICs), which consist of a number&amp;nbsp;– from a few (as low as two) to billions&amp;nbsp;– of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor [[Substrate (electronics)|substrate]], or [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].

Semiconductor materials are useful because their behavior can be easily manipulated by the addition of impurities, known as [[Doping (Semiconductors)|doping]]. Semiconductor [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] can be controlled by the introduction of an electric or magnetic field, by exposure to [[light]] or heat, or by the mechanical deformation of a [[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] [[Monocrystalline silicon|monocrystalline]] grid; thus, semiconductors can make excellent sensors. Current conduction in a [[semiconductor]] occurs via mobile or "free" ''[[electrons]]'' and ''[[Electron hole|holes]]'', collectively known as ''[[charge carrier]]s''. Doping a semiconductor such as [[silicon]] with a small proportion of an atomic impurity, such as [[phosphorus]] or [[boron]], greatly increases the number of free electrons or holes within the semiconductor. When a doped semiconductor contains excess holes it is called "[[P-type semiconductor|p-type]]", and when it contains excess free electrons it is known as "[[N-type semiconductor|n-type]]", where ''p'' (positive for [[electron hole|holes]]) or ''n'' (negative for [[electron]]s) is the sign of the charge of the majority mobile charge carriers. The semiconductor material used in devices is doped under highly controlled conditions in a fabrication facility, or ''[[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]]'', to control precisely the location and concentration of p- and n-type dopants. The junctions which form where n-type and p-type semiconductors join together are called [[p–n junction]]s.

Semiconductor devices made per year have been growing by 9.1% on average since 1978, and shipments in 2018 are predicted for the first time to exceed 1 trillion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Semiconductor-Shipments-Forecast-To-Exceed-1-Trillion-Devices-In-2018/|title=Semiconductor Shipments Forecast to Exceed 1 Trillion Devices in 2018|quote=Annual semiconductor unit shipments (integrated circuits and opto-sensor-discretes, or O-S-D, devices) are expected to grow 9% [..] For 2018, semiconductor unit shipments are forecast to climb to 1,075.1 billion, which equates to 9% growth for the year. Starting in 1978 with 32.6 billion units and going through 2018, the compound annual growth rate for semiconductor units is forecast to be 9.1%, a solid growth figure over the 40 year span.&lt;!--

Over the span of just four years (2004-2007), semiconductor shipments broke through the 400-, 500-, and 600-billion unit levels before the global financial meltdown caused a big decline in semiconductor unit shipments in 2008 and 2009--&gt; [..] In 2018, O-S-D devices are forecast to account for 70% of total semiconductor units compared to 30% for ICs.|website=www.icinsights.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that well over 7 &lt;!--7.3+ in decade prior just adding from the graph--&gt; trillion has been made to date, in just in the decade prior.

==Diode==
A semiconductor diode is a device typically made from a single p–n junction. At the junction of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor there forms a [[depletion region]] where current conduction is inhibited by the lack of mobile charge carriers. When the device is ''forward biased'' (connected with the p-side at higher [[electric potential]] than the n-side), this depletion region is diminished, allowing for significant conduction, while only very small current can be achieved when the diode is ''reverse biased'' and thus the depletion region expanded.

Exposing a semiconductor to [[light]] can generate [[electron–hole pair]]s, which increases the number of free carriers and thereby the conductivity. Diodes optimized to take advantage of this phenomenon are known as ''[[photodiode]]s''.
[[Compound semiconductor]] diodes can also be used to generate light, as in [[light-emitting diode]]s and [[laser diode]]s.

==Transistor==
{{Main|Transistor}}

[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|400px|Operation of a [[MOSFET]] and its Id-Vg curve. At first, when no gate voltage is applied. There is no inversion electron in the channel, the device is OFF. As gate voltage increase, inversion electron density in the channel increase, current increase, the device turns on.]]
=== Bipolar junction transistor ===
[[Bipolar junction transistor]]s are formed from two p–n junctions, in either n–p–n or p–n–p configuration. The middle, or ''base'', region between the junctions is typically very narrow. The other regions, and their associated terminals, are known as the ''emitter'' and the ''collector''. A small current injected through the junction between the base and the emitter changes the properties of the base-collector junction so that it can conduct current even though it is reverse biased. This creates a much larger current between the collector and emitter, controlled by the base-emitter current.

===Field-effect transistor===
Another type of transistor, the [[field-effect transistor]], operates on the principle that semiconductor conductivity can be increased or decreased by the presence of an [[electric field]]. An electric field can increase the number of free electrons and holes in a semiconductor, thereby changing its conductivity. The field may be applied by a reverse-biased p–n junction, forming a ''junction field-effect transistor'' ([[JFET]]) or by an electrode insulated from the bulk material by an oxide layer, forming a ''metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor'' ([[MOSFET]]).

The MOSFET, a [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] device, is the most used semiconductor device today. The ''gate'' electrode is charged to produce an electric field that controls the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of a "channel" between two terminals, called the ''source'' and ''drain''. Depending on the type of carrier in the channel, the device may be an ''n-channel'' (for electrons) or a ''p-channel'' (for holes) MOSFET. Although the MOSFET is named in part for its "metal" gate, in modern devices [[polysilicon]] is typically used instead.

==Semiconductor device materials==
{{Main|Semiconductor materials}}
By far, [[silicon]] (Si) is the most widely used material in semiconductor devices. Its combination of low raw material cost, relatively simple processing, and a useful temperature range makes it currently the best compromise among the various competing materials. Silicon used in semiconductor device manufacturing is currently fabricated into [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] that are large enough in diameter to allow the production of 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12 in.) [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]].

[[Germanium]] (Ge) was a widely used early semiconductor material but its thermal sensitivity makes it less useful than silicon. Today, germanium is often alloyed with silicon for use in very-high-speed SiGe devices; [[IBM]] is a major producer of such devices.

[[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is also widely used in high-speed devices but so far, it has been difficult to form large-diameter boules of this material, limiting the wafer diameter to sizes significantly smaller than silicon wafers thus making mass production of GaAs devices significantly more expensive than silicon.

Other less common materials are also in use or under investigation.

[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) has found some application as the raw material for blue [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and is being investigated for use in semiconductor devices that could withstand very high [[operating temperature]]s and environments with the presence of significant levels of [[ionizing radiation]]. [[IMPATT diode]]s have also been fabricated from SiC.

Various [[indium]] compounds (indium arsenide, indium [[Antimony|antimonide]], and indium [[Phosphorus|phosphide]]) are also being used in LEDs and solid state [[laser diode]]s. [[Selenium]] [[sulfide]] is being studied in the manufacture of [[photovoltaic]] [[solar cell]]s.

The most common use for [[organic semiconductor]]s is [[organic light-emitting diode]]s.

==Semiconductor device applications==
All transistor types can be used as the building blocks of [[logic gate]]s, which are fundamental in the design of [[digital circuit]]s. In digital circuits like [[microprocessor]]s, transistors act as on-off switches; in the [[MOSFET]], for instance, the [[voltage]] applied to the gate determines whether the [[switch]] is on or off.

Transistors used for [[analog circuit]]s do not act as on-off switches; rather, they respond to a continuous range of inputs with a continuous range of outputs. Common analog circuits include [[amplifier]]s and [[oscillator]]s.

Circuits that interface or translate between digital circuits and analog circuits are known as [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal circuits]].

[[Power semiconductor device]]s are discrete devices or integrated circuits intended for high current or high voltage applications. Power integrated circuits combine IC technology with power semiconductor technology, these are sometimes referred to as "smart" power devices. Several companies specialize in manufacturing power semiconductors.

===Component identifiers===
The [[type designator]]s of semiconductor devices are often manufacturer specific. Nevertheless, there have been attempts at creating standards for type codes, and a subset of devices follow those. For [[discrete device]]s, for example, there are three standards: [[JEDEC]] JESD370B in United States, [[Pro Electron]] in Europe and [[Japanese Industrial Standards]] (JIS) in Japan.

===Cat's-whisker detector===
{{Main|Cat's-whisker detector}}
Semiconductors had been used in the electronics field for some time before the invention of the transistor. Around the turn of the 20th century they were quite common as detectors in [[radio]]s, used in a device called a "cat's whisker" developed by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and others. These detectors were somewhat troublesome, however, requiring the operator to move a small tungsten filament (the whisker) around the surface of a [[galena]] (lead sulfide) or [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (silicon carbide) crystal until it suddenly started working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Braun |author2=Stuart MacDonald|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Revolution in Miniature: The History and Impact of Semiconductor Electronics|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521289030|pages=11–13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=03c4wldf-k4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, over a period of a few hours or days, the cat's whisker would slowly stop working and the process would have to be repeated. At the time their operation was completely mysterious. After the introduction of the more reliable and amplified [[vacuum tube]] based radios, the cat's whisker systems quickly disappeared. The "cat's whisker" is a primitive example of a special type of diode still popular today, called a [[Schottky diode]].

===Metal rectifier===
{{Main|Metal rectifier}}
Another early type of semiconductor device is the metal rectifier in which the semiconductor is [[Copper(I) oxide|copper oxide]] or [[selenium]]. [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)]] was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers.

During World War II, [[radar]] research quickly pushed radar receivers to operate at ever higher [[Frequency|frequencies]] and the traditional tube based radio receivers no longer worked well. The introduction of the [[cavity magnetron]] from Britain to the United States in 1940 during the [[Tizard Mission]] resulted in a pressing need for a practical high-frequency amplifier.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- or was it a HF rectifier that they needed ? --&gt;

On a whim, [[Russell Ohl]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] decided to try a [[Cat's-whisker detector|cat's whisker]]. By this point they had not been in use for a number of years, and no one at the labs had one. After hunting one down at a used radio store in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]], he found that it worked much better than tube-based systems.

Ohl investigated why the cat's whisker functioned so well. He spent most of 1939 trying to grow more pure versions of the crystals. He soon found that with higher quality crystals their finicky behaviour went away, but so did their ability to operate as a radio detector. One day he found one of his purest crystals nevertheless worked well, and it had a clearly visible crack near the middle. However as he moved about the room trying to test it, the detector would mysteriously work, and then stop again. After some study he found that the behaviour was controlled by the light in the room – more light caused more conductance in the crystal. He invited several other people to see this crystal, and [[Walter Brattain]] immediately realized there was some sort of junction at the crack.

Further research cleared up the remaining mystery. The crystal had cracked because either side contained very slightly different amounts of the impurities Ohl could not remove – about 0.2%. One side of the crystal had impurities that added extra electrons (the carriers of electric current) and made it a "conductor". The other had impurities that wanted to bind to these electrons, making it (what he called) an "insulator". Because the two parts of the crystal were in contact with each other, the electrons could be pushed out of the conductive side which had extra electrons (soon to be known as the ''emitter'') and replaced by new ones being provided (from a battery, for instance) where they would flow into the insulating portion and be collected by the whisker filament (named the ''collector''). However, when the voltage was reversed the electrons being pushed into the collector would quickly fill up the "holes" (the electron-needy impurities), and conduction would stop almost instantly. This junction of the two crystals (or parts of one crystal) created a solid-state diode, and the concept soon became known as semiconduction. The mechanism of action when the diode is off has to do with the separation of [[charge carrier]]s around the junction. This is called a "[[depletion region]]".

===Development of the diode===
Armed with the knowledge of how these new diodes worked, a vigorous effort began to learn how to build them on demand. Teams at [[Purdue University]], [[Bell Labs]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and the [[University of Chicago]] all joined forces to build better crystals. Within a year germanium production had been perfected to the point where military-grade diodes were being used in most radar sets.

===Development of the transistor===
{{Main|History of the transistor}}
After the war, [[William Shockley]] decided to attempt the building of a [[triode]]-like semiconductor device. He secured funding and lab space, and went to work on the problem with Brattain and [[John Bardeen]].

The key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of the process of the [[electron mobility]] in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there were some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector of this newly discovered diode, an amplifier could be built. For instance, if contacts are placed on both sides of a single type of crystal, current will not flow between them through the crystal. However if a third contact could then "inject" electrons or holes into the material, current would flow.

Actually doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any reasonable size, the number of electrons (or holes) required to be injected would have to be very large, making it less than useful as an [[amplifier]] because it would require a large injection current to start with. That said, the whole idea of the crystal diode was that the crystal itself could provide the electrons over a very small distance, the depletion region. The key appeared to be to place the input and output contacts very close together on the surface of the crystal on either side of this region.

Brattain started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of amplification continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. Sometimes the system would work but then stop working unexpectedly. In one instance a non-working system started working when placed in water. Ohl and Brattain eventually developed a new branch of [[quantum mechanics]], which became known as [[surface physics]], to account for the behaviour. The electrons in any one piece of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby charges. Electrons in the emitters, or the "holes" in the collectors, would cluster at the surface of the crystal where they could find their opposite charge "floating around" in the air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface with the application of a small amount of charge from any other location on the crystal. Instead of needing a large supply of injected electrons, a very small number in the right place on the crystal would accomplish the same thing.

Their understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to some degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a common, but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The electron-emitting and collecting leads would both be placed very close together on the top, with the control lead placed on the base of the crystal. When current flowed through this "base" lead, the electrons or holes would be pushed out, across the block of semiconductor, and collect on the far surface. As long as the emitter and collector were very close together, this should allow enough electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to start.

===The first transistor===
[[Image:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A stylized replica of the first transistor]]
The Bell team made many attempts to build such a system with various tools, but generally failed. Setups where the contacts were close enough were invariably as fragile as the original cat's whisker detectors had been, and would work briefly, if at all. Eventually they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of gold foil was glued to the edge of a plastic wedge, and then the foil was sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle. The result was two very closely spaced contacts of gold. When the wedge was pushed down onto the surface of a crystal and voltage applied to the other side (on the base of the crystal), current started to flow from one contact to the other as the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side near the contacts. The point-contact transistor had been invented.

While the device was constructed a week earlier, Brattain's notes describe the first demonstration to higher-ups at Bell Labs on the afternoon of 23 December 1947, often given as the birthdate of the transistor. What is now known as the "[[point-contact transistor|p–n–p point-contact germanium transistor]]" operated as a speech amplifier with a power gain of 18 in that trial. [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] were awarded the 1956 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics for their work.

===Origin of the term "transistor"===
Bell Telephone Laboratories needed a generic name for their new invention: "Semiconductor Triode", "Solid Triode", "Surface States Triode"{{sic}}, "Crystal Triode" and "Iotatron" were all considered, but "transistor", coined by [[John R. Pierce]], won an internal ballot. The rationale for the name is described in the following extract from the company's Technical Memoranda (May 28, 1948) [26] calling for votes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transistor. This is an abbreviated combination of the words "transconductance" or "transfer", and "varistor". The device logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so that this combination is descriptive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Improvements in transistor design===
Shockley was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, who he felt had built it "behind his back" to take the glory. Matters became worse when Bell Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley's own writings on the transistor were close enough to those of an earlier 1925 patent by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] that they thought it best that his name be left off the patent application.

Shockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of the operation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the [[bipolar junction transistor]].

With the fragility problems solved, a remaining problem was purity. Making [[germanium]] of the required purity was proving to be a serious problem, and limited the yield of transistors that actually worked from a given batch of material. Germanium's sensitivity to temperature also limited its usefulness. Scientists theorized that silicon would be easier to fabricate, but few investigated this possibility. [[Gordon K. Teal]] was the first to develop a working silicon transistor, and his company, the nascent [[Texas Instruments]], profited from its technological edge. From the late 1960s most transistors were silicon-based. Within a few years transistor-based products, most notably easily portable radios, were appearing on the market.

The [[static induction transistor]], the first high frequency transistor, was invented by Japanese engineers [[Jun-ichi Nishizawa]] and Y. Watanabe in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3qz0gSVbaesC&amp;pg=PA82 | title=High Temperature Electronics| isbn=978-0849396236| last1=Patrick Mccluskey| first1=F.| last2=Podlesak| first2=Thomas| last3=Grzybowski| first3=Richard| date=1996-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fastest transistor through to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HHUe3pChrPQC&amp;pg=PA19 | title=New Scientist| last1=Information| first1=Reed Business| date=1986-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/mannerisms/yarns/yamaha-got-semiconductor-business-2017-02/ | title=How Yamaha Got into the Semiconductor Business| date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major improvement in manufacturing yield came when a chemist advised the companies fabricating semiconductors to use [[distilled water|distilled]] rather than tap water: [[calcium]] [[ion]]s present in tap water were the cause of the poor yields. "[[Zone melting]]", a technique using a band of molten material moving through the crystal, further increased crystal purity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3742">The '''Solar Cup''' is an eco-boating competition in [[Temecula, California]]. Paid for by the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] and taking place on [[Lake Skinner]], the competition revolves around high school teams constructing [[solar power]]ed [[electric boat]]s. Boats are built from identical kits of marine-caliber wood provided by the water district, and are generally 16 feet long, and weigh about 250 pounds. This competition is inspired by the [[Solar Splash]] competition at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mwdh2o.com/mwdh2o/pages/education/solar_cup/solar_cup_01.html |title=Solar Cup |publisher=Mwdh2o.com |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308214823/http://www.mwdh2o.com/mwdh2o/pages/education/solar_cup/solar_cup_01.html |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar Cup begins with sign up in December, and includes a boat-building event and several workshops focusing on technical aspects such as drive trains, electrical systems, solar power collection and steering systems. Teams are also required to meet deadlines for submitting illustrated reports on these systems. In 2007 the competition was split between "veteran" (returning) and "rookie" (new) teams. The competition is a scored event, divided up into several categories: Technical Reports, Workshops, Visual Displays, Qualifying Times, Endurance Distance, and Sprint Times. Combined, all of these categories add up for a 1000 maximum possible points. Overall, 41 teams competed in 2007, and 36 teams competed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarcup.ning.com/ |title=Offline - Solar Cup |publisher=Solarcup.ning.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214014407/http://solarcup.ning.com/ |archivedate=2011-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solar.calfinder.com/blog/news/36-solar-powered-boats-compete-sunday-for-the-solar-cup/ |title=Solar Powered Boats Compete for the Solar Cup |publisher=Solar.calfinder.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Stockbridge patent closeup.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stockbridge's original concrete block design]]
The Stockbridge damper was invented in the 1920s by George H. Stockbridge, who was an engineer for [[Southern California Edison]]. Stockbridge obtained US patent 1675391 on 3 July 1928 for a "vibration damper".&lt;ref name=patent_1675391&gt;{{US patent|1675391}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent described three means of damping vibrations on lines: a sack of metal punchings tied to the line; a short length of cable clamped parallel to the main cable; and a short (30&amp;nbsp;in, 75&amp;nbsp;cm) cable with a concrete mass fixed at each end.&lt;ref name=patent_1675391/&gt; This last device developed into the widely used Stockbridge damper.

Vibrations in the main cable were passed down through the clamp and into the shorter damper, or "messenger", cable. This would flex and cause the symmetrically-placed concrete blocks at its ends to oscillate. Careful choice of the mass of the blocks, and the stiffness and length of the damper cable would match the [[mechanical impedance]] of the damper to that of the line, and greatly attenuate oscillation of the main cable. Since Stockbridge dampers were economical, effective and easy to install, they became used routinely on overhead lines.&lt;ref name="McCombe"/&gt; [[Live-line working]] using [[hot stick]] tools meant it was possible to retrofit dampers to lines while energised.&lt;ref name="Wadhwa"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wadhwa|first=C.L.|title=Electrical Power Systems|publisher=New Age Publishers|year=2006|pages=169&amp;ndash;170|isbn=978-81-224-1773-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqS9nKmWzssC&amp;pg=PA169|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern designs==
[[File:Stockbridge damper POV.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern design with metal weights]]
Modern designs use metal bell-shaped weights rather than Stockbridge's concrete blocks. The bell is hollow and the damper cable is fixed internally to the distal end, which permits relative motion between the cable and damping weights.&lt;ref name="Wadhwa" /&gt; To provide for greater freedom of motion, the weights may be partially slotted in the vertical plane, allowing the cable to travel outside the confines of the bell. In some installations, the weights are unequal, allowing damping over a greater frequency range.&lt;ref name="Kiessling"/&gt; More complex designs use weights with asymmetric mass distribution, which enables the damper to oscillate in several different frequency modes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most vulnerable section of the cable is where it is clamped to the end of an [[insulator string]], so dampers are typically installed at the nearest [[anti-node]]s (points of maximum displacement) either side of the clamp.&lt;ref name="Kiessling"&gt;

Overhead transmission lines form a [[catenary]] for which vibration is predominately in the vertical plane. When more than one plane of vibration is anticipated, Stockbridge dampers may be mounted at right angles to each other. This is common when the cable runs in a vertical or off-horizontal plane, for example in [[cable-stayed bridge]]s or radio mast [[guy-wire]]s.

'''Synthetic geometry''' (sometimes referred to as '''axiomatic''' or even '''pure geometry''') is the study of [[geometry]] [[Coordinate-free|without the use of coordinates]] or [[formula]]s. It relies on the [[axiomatic method]] and the tools directly related to them, that is, [[compass and straightedge]], to draw conclusions and solve problems. 

Only after the introduction of [[coordinate system|coordinate methods]] was there a reason to introduce the term "synthetic geometry" to distinguish this approach to geometry from other approaches.
Other approaches to geometry are embodied in [[analytic geometry|analytic]] and [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] geometries, where one would use [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[algebra|algebraic techniques]] to obtain geometric results.

According to [[Felix Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1948|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Synthetic geometry is that which studies [[shape|figures]] as such, without recourse to formulas, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulas as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Geometry]], as presented by [[Euclid]] in [[Euclid's  Elements |the ''Elements'']], is the quintessential example of the use of the synthetic method. It was the favoured method of [[Isaac Newton]] for the solution of geometric problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Synthetic methods were most prominent during the 19th century when geometers rejected coordinate methods in establishing the [[foundations of geometry|foundations]] of [[projective geometry]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. For example the [[geometer]] [[Jakob Steiner]] (1796 – 1863) hated analytic geometry, and always gave preference to synthetic methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/Steiner.html |title=Steiner (print-only) |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical synthesis==
The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives:
* '''[[Primitive notion|Primitives]]''' are the most basic ideas. Typically they include both objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things such as ''points'', ''lines'' and ''planes'', while a fundamental relationship is that of ''incidence'' – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; the point being that the primitive terms are just empty [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholders]] and have no intrinsic properties.
* '''[[Axiom]]s''' are statements about these primitives; for example, ''any two points are together incident with just one line'' (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are  the ''building blocks'' of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.

From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a '''[[theorem]]'''.

===Properties of axiom sets===
There is no fixed axiom set for geometry, as more than one [[consistency |consistent set]] can be chosen. Each such set may lead to a different geometry, while there are also examples of different sets giving the same geometry. With this plethora of possibilities, it is no longer appropriate to speak of "geometry" in the singular.

Historically, Euclid's [[parallel postulate]] has turned out to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the other axioms. Simply discarding it gives [[absolute geometry]], while negating it yields [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;!-- note in absolute geometry non intersecting lines and infinite long lines exists--&gt; Other [[consistency |consistent axiom sets]] can yield other geometries, such as [[projective geometry|projective]], [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], [[spherical geometry|spherical]] or [[affine geometry|affine]] geometry.

Axioms of continuity and "betweeness" are also optional, for example, [[discrete geometry|discrete geometries]] may be created by discarding or modifying them.

Following the [[Erlangen program]] of [[Felix Klein|Klein]], the nature of any given geometry can be seen as the connection between [[symmetry]] and the content of the propositions, rather than the style of development.

==History==
Euclid's original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean geometries by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] in the 19th century led mathematicians to question Euclid's underlying assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mlodinow 2001, Part III The Story of Gauss&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also [[Bernhard Riemann#Riemannian geometry]] --&gt;

One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way:
:''The Elements'' of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the ''axioms'', and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the ''simple to compound'', which is the essential character of synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. F. Lacroix]] (1816) ''Essais sur L'Enseignement en Général, et sur celui des Mathématiques en Particulier'', page 207, Libraire pur les Mathématiques.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[calculus]] were ignored by some [[list of geometers|geometers]] such as [[Jakob Steiner]], in favor of a purely synthetic development of  [[projective geometry]]. For example, the treatment of the [[projective plane]] starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more [[model theory#Definition|model]]s) than is found by starting with a [[vector space]] of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.

In his [[Erlangen program]], [[Felix Klein]] played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods:
::On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry:
:The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein (1872) Ralf Stephan translator (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3161 "A comparative review of researches in geometry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The close axiomatic study of [[Euclidean geometry]] led to the construction of the [[Lambert quadrilateral]] and the [[Saccheri quadrilateral]]. These structures introduced the field of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] where Euclid's parallel axiom is denied. [[Gauss]], [[Bolyai]] and [[Lobachevski]] independently constructed [[hyperbolic geometry]], where parallel lines have an [[angle of parallelism]] that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the [[Poincaré disc]] model where [[motion (geometry)|motion]]s are given by [[Möbius transformation]]s. Similarly, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], a student of Gauss's, constructed [[Riemannian geometry]], of which [[elliptic geometry]] is a particular case.

Another example concerns [[inversive geometry]] as advanced by [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]], which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocation]] expresses analysis of the plane.

[[Karl von Staudt]] showed that algebraic axioms, such as [[commutativity]] and [[associativity]] of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of lines in [[geometric configuration]]s. [[David Hilbert]] showed&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hilbert]], 1980 (1899). ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17384/17384-pdf.pdf The Foundations of Geometry]'', 2nd edition, §22 Desargues Theorem, Chicago: Open Court&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Desargues configuration]] played a special role. Further work was done by [[Ruth Moufang]] and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of [[incidence geometry]].

When [[parallel lines]] are taken as primary, synthesis produces [[affine geometry]]. Though Euclidean geometry is both an affine and [[metric geometry]], in general [[affine space]]s may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of [[spacetime]], as discussed in the [[affine geometry#History|history of affine geometry]].

In 1955 Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry:
:Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal — so fundamental to many mathematically interested people — is now made by many other fields.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Busemann]] and Paul J. Kelly (1953) ''Projective Geometry and Projective Metrics'', Preface, page v, [[Academic Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, college studies now include [[linear algebra]], [[topology]], and [[graph theory]] where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by [[elementary proof]]s.

Today's student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid's available: see [[Hilbert's axioms]] and [[Tarski's axioms]].

[[Ernst Kötter]] published a (German) report in 1901 on ''"The development of synthetic geometry from [[Monge]] to Staudt (1847)"'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ernst Kötter| title=Die Entwickelung der Synthetischen Geometrie von Monge bis auf Staudt (1847)| year=1901 |url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?&amp;action=pdf&amp;metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005&amp;divID=LOG_0035&amp;pagesize=original&amp;pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005%7C&amp;targetFileName=PPN37721857X_0005_LOG_0035.pdf&amp;}} (2012 Reprint as {{ISBN|1275932649}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs using synthetic geometry==

Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of auxiliary constructs (such as [[Auxiliary line|helping lines]]) and concepts such as equality of sides or angles and [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] and [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles [[Butterfly theorem]], [[Angle bisector theorem]], [[Apollonius' theorem]], [[British flag theorem]], [[Ceva's theorem]], [[Equal incircles theorem]], [[Geometric mean theorem]], [[Heron's formula]], [[Isosceles triangle theorem]], [[Law of cosines]], and others that are linked to [[:Category:Theorems in plane geometry|here]].

==Computational synthetic geometry==
In conjunction with [[computational geometry]], a '''computational synthetic geometry''' has been founded, having close connection, for example, with [[matroid]] theory. [[Synthetic differential geometry]] is an application of [[topos]] theory to the foundations of [[differentiable manifold]] theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5926">'''Tire-derived fuel''' (TDF) is composed of shredded [[scrap tire]]s. Tires may be mixed with [[coal]] or other fuels, such as wood or chemical wastes, to be burned in [[Cement kiln|concrete kilns]], [[power plant]]s, or [[paper mill]]s. An [[EPA]] test program concluded that, with the exception of [[zinc]] [[pollutant|emissions]], potential emissions from TDF are not expected to be very much different from other conventional fossil fuels, as long as [[combustion]] occurs in a well-designed, well-operated
and well-maintained combustion device.&lt;ref name="EPA Air Emissions from Scrap Tire Combustion"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/tire_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Historically, there has not been any volume use for scrap tires other than burning that has been able to keep up with the volume of waste generated yearly. Tires produce the same [[Energy density|energy]] as [[petroleum]] and approximately 25% more energy than coal. Burning tires is lower on the hierarchy of reducing waste than [[recycling]], but it is better than placing the tire waste in a [[landfill]] or dump, where there is a possibility for uncontrolled tire fires or the harboring of disease vectors such as mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=tires&gt;http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/tires/tdf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tire Derived Fuel is an interim solution to the scrap tire waste problem. Advances in [[tire recycling]] technology&lt;ref&gt;http://news.discovery.com/tech/tech-to-end-tire-burning.html&lt;/ref&gt; might one day provide a solution other than burning by reusing tire derived material in high volume applications.

==Characteristics==
Tire derived fuel is usually consumed in the form of shredded or chipped material with most of the metal wire from the tire's steel belts removed. The analytical properties of this refined material are published in TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed&lt;ref name="TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed"&gt;http://www.p2pays.org/ref/11/10504/html/usa/tdfdata.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tires are typically composed of about 1 to 1.5% [[Zinc oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/pdffiles/rubber.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a well known component used in the manufacture of tires and is also toxic to aquatic and plant life. The chlorine content in tires is due primarily to the chlorinated butyl rubber liner that slows the leak rate of air. The [[Rubber Manufacturers Association]] (RMA) is a very good source for compositional data and other information on tires.
The use of TDF for heat production is controversial due to the possibility for toxin production. Reportedly, [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] and [[furan]]s are produced during the combustion process and there is supportive evidence to suggest that this is true under some incineration conditions. Other toxins such as NOx, SOx and heavy metals are also produced, though whether these levels of toxins are higher or lower than conventional coal and oil fired incinerators is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyjustice.net/tires/&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand, some argue that it is better to use the energy stored in a tire than to put it in a landfill, in line with the waste hierarchy. On the other, it is difficult to justify introducing toxins into the atmosphere, and much energy can be saved by recycling the tires so that new ones do not need to be remanufactured from raw materials.

==Controversy==

While environmental controversy surrounding use of this fuel is wide and varied, the greatest supported evidence of toxicity comes from the presence of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and furans in the flue gases.  Zinc has also been found to dissolve into storm water, from shredded rubber, at acutely [[Aquatic toxicology|toxic levels for aquatic life]] and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Field Study: www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/artificialturf/dep_artificial_turf_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of dioxin and furan content&lt;ref name="study of dioxin and furan content"&gt;http://www.energyjustice.net/tires/#16&lt;/ref&gt; of stack gasses at a variety of [[cement mill]]s, [[paper mill]]s, boilers, and power plants conducted in the 1990s shows a wide and inconsistent variation in dioxin and furan output when fueled partially by TDF as compared to the same facilities powered by only coal. Some facilities added as little as 4% TDF and experienced as much as a 4,140% increase in dioxin and furan emsissions. Other facilities added as much as 30% TDF and experienced dioxin and furan emissions increases of only as much as 58%. Still other facilities used as much as 8% TDF and experienced a decrease of as much as 83% of dioxin and furan emissions. One facility conducted four tests with two tests resulting in decreased emissions and two resulting in increased emissions. Another facility also conducted four tests and had widely varying increases in emissions.&lt;ref name="EPA Air Emissions from Scrap Tire Combustion"/&gt;

A 2004 study of Tire rubber use in energy generation,&lt;ref name="Soil, Water, and Air Environmental Impact from Tire Rubber/Coal Fluidized-Bed Cocombustion"&gt;http://viewer.zoho.com/docs/sa7Pp {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeply studies the environmental impact on soil, water, and air from combustion of waste rubber (TDF).

Alvarez research shows that huge [[polyaromatic]] emissions are generated from combustion of tire rubber, at a minimum, 2 orders of magnitude higher than coal alone.

The study concludes with, "atmospheric contamination dramatically increases when tire rubber is used as the fuel. Other different combustion variables compared to the ones used for coal combustion should be used to avoid atmospheric contamination by toxic, [[mutagenic]], and [[carcinogenic]] pollutants, as well as hot- [[gas cleaning]] systems and [[Carbon capture and storage|COx capture systems]]."

'''Vandellòs I Nuclear Accident''' was a fire that caused an interruption of the refrigeration system in the nuclear reactor of [[Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plant|Vandellòs]], [[Catalonia]] (Spain) on 19 October 1989.&lt;ref name="CCMA"&gt;{{cite news |editor= Redacció |date= 19 October 2014|title= Fa 25 anys del greu accident a la central nuclear Vandellòs 1 |trans-title= 25 years since the serious accident at Vandellòs I Nuclear Power Plant |url= http://www.ccma.cat/324/Fa-25-anys-del-greu-accident-a-la-central-nuclear-Vandellos-1/noticia/2506894/ |language= Catalan |work= [[Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals]] |location= Vandellòs |access-date= 20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Franco regime]], France sold Spain a [[UNGG reactor]]. This already obsolete energy technology was installed because as a [[by-product]] it provided [[plutonium]] that could be used to manufacture [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="Ara"&gt;{{cite news |last= Solé |first= Albert |date= 18 October 2014 |title= «25 anys de l'incendi de Vandellòs I: la central construïda per fer bombes nuclears franceses |trans-title= 25 years since Vandellòs I fire: the power plant built to make French nuclear bombs |url= http://www.ara.cat/societat/vandellos_I-central_nuclear-accident-incendi-25_anys_0_1231676995.html |language= Catalan |work= [[Ara (newspaper)|Diari Ara]] |location= |access-date= 20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vandellòs I Nuclear Power Plant was inaugurated in 1972 when there were only two operational nuclear power plants in Spain: [[Santa María de Garoña Nuclear Power Plant|Garoña]] and [[José Cabrera Nuclear Power Station|Zorita]]. Seventeen years after opening, the rudimentary technology produced a mechanical failure in the [[gas turbine]] which caused a fire. The cabling of the plant was not [[fireproof]] and the control computer and the refrigeration system would also receive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sans |first= Sara |date= 20 October 2009 |title= Los residuos de la central nuclear Vandellòs I aún no tienen destino |trans-title= The waste of Vandellòs I nuclear power plant has not yet reached its destination |url= http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/motociclismo/20091019/53806113299/los-residuos-de-la-central-nuclear-vandellos-i-aun-no-tienen-destino.html |language= Spanish |work= [[La Vanguardia]] |access-date= 20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear meltdown|core meltdown]] was avoided due to the intervention of the [[Corps of Firefighters of Catalonia]] and the plant technicians, which were able to extinguish the fire and turn off the nuclear reactor manually. It continues to be one of the biggest nuclear accidents in [[Western Europe]], classified as a serious incident according to the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]]. As a consequence, the plant would be [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]], due to the damage in the systems, and new safety protocols were introduced, because the old ones proved to be inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pérez Pons |first= Mercè |date= 18 October 2010 |title= La nit més llarga de Vandellòs |trans-title= The longest night in Vandellòs |url= https://cat.elpais.com/cat/2014/10/18/catalunya/1413655337_690826.html |language= Catalan |work= [[El País]] |access-date= 20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vibranium''' ({{IPAc-en|v|aɪ|ˈ|b|r|eɪ|n|i|ə|m}}) is a fictional metal appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. This fictional metal is noted for its uncanny ability to leverage [[First law of thermodynamics|thermodynamics]] in absorbing, storing, and releasing [[kinetic energy]] in a controlled manner. Vibranium is associated with [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], as his suit is made from vibranium and is found in his native homeland of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. '''Antarctic Vibranium''' or '''Anti-Metal''' is created by artificial means, in contrast to natural, or Wakandan, vibranium. Vibranium is also commonly known as one of the materials used to construct [[Captain America's shield]].

==Publication history==
Vibranium first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #13 (February 1966), which was written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]]. Here, vibranium was seen to be an unusual metallic element with decidedly strange properties. Since that point in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] continuity, it has been established that there are a few variations of this element which can be found in isolated regions all around the world. The variation first introduced in ''Daredevil'' #13 eventually became known as Anti-Metal. This variation's unique attribute is that it can cut through any known metal. In the [[Marvel Universe]], Anti-Metal can traditionally be found only in Antarctica. Later in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #53 (August 1966), by Stan Lee and [[Jack Kirby]], a new variation of vibranium was introduced in the isolated nation of Wakanda. This variation had the unique attribute of being able to absorb sound. This is the variation which is most often identified in continuity as simply "vibranium".

==Fictional history==
In the Marvel Universe, vibranium was first deposited on Earth by a meteorite 10,000 years ago. In the comics, the first documented discovery of vibranium was during a human expedition to Antarctica. This particular isotope of vibranium was called "Anti-Metal" due to its property of dissolving other metals.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' vol. 1, #13 (Feb 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comics, a different variety of vibranium found in Wakanda absorbs sound waves and other vibrations, including kinetic energy. Absorbing sound waves, vibrations, and kinetic energy makes this metal stronger. It was discovered by the Wakandan ancestors. To protect this resource, they concealed their country from the outside world. T'Chaka funded his country's education by occasionally selling off minuscule quantities of the metal. As a result, Wakanda is one of the world's most technologically advanced nations.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels |last=Booker |first=M.

In the comics, during the early 1940s, a small amount of Wakandan vibranium came into the possession of the scientist [[Myron MacLain]]. He tried to combine vibranium with iron to form a new tank armor, but was unable to fuse the elements. One morning, he found that the two materials had bonded on their own in an unknown manner. The ultra-resilient alloy was used to create Captain America's shield. MacLain worked for decades (without success) to duplicate the accident. However, during an experiment in the 1960s, he developed the virtually indestructible metal [[adamantium]].{{Issue|date=October 2011}}
 
In the comics, when T'Challa became king of Wakanda, he strove to end his country's isolation from the rest of the world. Making the existence of vibranium known to the outside world around the mid-1980s, he sold small quantities of it to foreigners who, he believed, would not use it to harmful ends. T'Challa used the profits to enrich and modernize his nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altcasey.com/works/alt_bp.pdf |author=Casey Alt |title=Imaging Black Superpower! - Marvel Comics' Black Panther |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811093147/http://altcasey.com/works/alt_bp.pdf |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the comics, over the years, many have tried to obtain or affect the mound of vibranium at Wakanda, but for the most part Wakanda has kept it safe, and become quite powerful in the process.

In the comics, during their [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth, the [[Skrull]]s assumed the identity of  [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and enslaved natives of the [[Savage Land]] to mine Anti-Metal.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #41&lt;/ref&gt; They also invaded Wakanda.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #38&lt;/ref&gt; The Wakandans successfully repelled the attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #41&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the comics, when Wakanda was politically taken over by the xenophobic Desturi, they granted [[Doctor Doom]] access to the country's vibranium vaults. Fearing Doom would use it to amplify his mystical energies, T'Challa activated a failsafe he had developed that rendered all processed vibranium inert.&lt;ref name="Doomwar #1-6"&gt;''Doomwar'' #1
–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comics, the rumors about its alien origin had later been proven true, as while most of earth's vibranium had been all but liquidated, certain planetary systems carry an ample supply of the element deep within certain extraterrestrial biospheres, as was the case with a refugee planet that the Spartax Empire tried reclaiming during [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]]'s space travels.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel vol. 8, #4–6&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the continuity-wide spanning reboot of the Marvel multiverse called ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars: Battleworld]]'', vibranium's abundance in Wakanda and beyond has re-flourished to sizable quantities, mutant criminal [[Vanisher]] was making off with and selling Wakandan vibranium in the black market in New York City.&lt;ref name="BP:WOW"&gt;''Black Panther: World of Wakanda'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and known abilities==
In the Marvel Comics Universe, vibranium is a rare metallic substance of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;ref name="Captain Marvel vol. 8 #5"&gt;''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #5&lt;/ref&gt; It exists in three forms:

===Wakandan variety===
Wakandan Vibranium is the most common variety, and is often referred to simply as "vibranium". It is a rare substance native only to the fictional small African nation of Wakanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marvel brings back first black superhero |author= |url= |newspaper=Star - Gazette - Elmira, N.Y. |date=February 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wakandan isotope possesses the ability to absorb all vibrations in the vicinity as well as kinetic energy directed at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/7-Things-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Marvel-Universe-Before-Seeing-Iron-Man-2-18446.html|title=7 Things You Need To Know About The Marvel Universe Before Seeing Iron Man 2|author=Eric Eisenberg|editor=CinemaBlend|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy absorbed is stored within the bonds between the molecules that make up the substance. As a result, kinetic energy is dissipated within the bonds instead. There are limits to the capacity of the energy that can be stored, and although the exact limitations are not yet known, there have been a few examples. One such instance was when the oil conglomerate Roxxon discovered that a small island in the South Atlantic had a foundation composed of vibranium. Due to this, Roxxon found it necessary to destroy the island and so blew it up with bombs. Unable to absorb the force of the explosions, the vibranium was destroyed, but it did succeed in entirely absorbing the sound made by the explosion, preventing damage to the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #121&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of vibranium is a powerful [[mutagen]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels"/&gt; Vibranium exposure led to the mutation of many Wakandan natives.{{Issue|date=October 2011}} Its radiation has also permeated much of Wakanda's flora and fauna, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Tribe and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Tribe. Both give superhuman abilities to whoever eats them.{{Issue|date=October 2011}}

It is also believed to dramatically enhance mystical energies.&lt;ref name="Doomwar #1-6"/&gt;

===Antarctic variety===
Better known as Anti-Metal, this isotope is native to the Savage Land. The variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that break down the molecular bonds in other metals, causing them to [[Liquefaction|liquefy]]. It was first discovered by the famous explorer named Robert Plunder; the father of [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Kevin]] and [[Plunderer (comics)|Parnival Plunder]] during his initial jaunt in the primordial environment untouched to time.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol. 1, #13&lt;/ref&gt; 

His more villainous son, who went on to become The Plunderer, would seek to find his father who dubbed the Plunder Stone and all recorded knowledge of the family relic only accessible through his inherited medallion fashioned from the stone, to pillage and terrorize the world by liquidating all armaments used against him.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #14''&lt;/ref&gt;  Wakandan vibranium is able to become an artificial and unstable form of the Anti-Metal variety of vibranium through certain particle bombardments on it. If huge quantities of Anti-Metal are gathered together, the vibrations increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' Vol. 1, #53&lt;/ref&gt; One such case occurred with the most stable reactionary transformation through a Cyclotron using gigawatt baryon beam bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man Annual'' Vol. 1, #5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much like natural Wakandan vibranium, Antarctic vibranium also has the mutating effect of over exposure to its unique energy signature. Causing one such individual who adorned an Anti-Metal full body suit for protection against Moon Knight and his arsenal to emit the same metal melting radiation he had intended to weaponize for his own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' Vol. 1, #51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial variety===
There are at least two forms of man made Vibranium created outside of Wakanda through various means. The first variant is called NuForm which featured in the Vibranium Vendetta event of Marvel Comics imprint, created by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]] for unknown reasons,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual Vol 1 #25&lt;/ref&gt; It was an alchemic blend made through the combination of organic and mineral elements, the properties of this Vibranium brand mimicked natural Vibranium but had the tendency to degrade into Antarctic Vibranium unless tempered through use of Microwave bombardment, and even then that was only a temporary solution. 

The second is a particularly dangerous artificial brand created at Horizon Labs by Professor Sajani Jaffrey called Reverbium.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike standard Vibranium this faux material rapidly amplifies and projects sound and vibratory energy in pulse waves which would only strengthen over time before violently detonating. Max Modell, head scientist of Horizon at the time, ordered its immediate dissolution given how dangerous it was but Sajani held on to some of it without her team's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #650&lt;/ref&gt; Reverbium would turn up again in the hands of A.I.M Scientists under the influence of [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who'd used it in a new scheme against Black Panther and the nation of Wakanda; the faux vibranium also had the effect of enhancing his sonic powers to unknown degrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' Vol 1 #166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vibranium cancer==
When a small sub-molecular imperfection was introduced into Captain America's shield, each impact over the years spread to neighboring molecules. It grew until the molecular bonds of the shield were completely broken down, shattering the shield. The shattering effect continued to spread to other vibranium, unconnected to the shield. This created a vibranium "cancer", a shock wave propagating throughout the world. It violently detonated any vibranium it found, from mineral deposits to components of ships or equipment. The shock wave was traveling to the "Great Vibranium Mound" in Wakanda, where the resulting explosion could destroy the world. With the unwitting aid of the villain Klaw, Captain America was able to stop the cancer and restore his shield.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

==Notable uses==
Vibranium appears frequently in the Marvel Universe.

* It is most known for being used in the construction of [[Captain America's shield|Captain America's Shield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wham! bang!

* After Steve Rogers resigned as Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 1 #332&lt;/ref&gt; the Black Panther sent him a new, pure vibranium shield.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 1 #342&lt;/ref&gt; When Rogers resumed his role as Captain America, the vibranium shield was given to [[U.S. Agent (character)|U.S. Agent]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol,. 1 #354&lt;/ref&gt;
* As U.S. Agent, John Walker has also used two other vibranium shields: the "eagle shield" he used as a member of the Jury,&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; and the "star shield" he used as a member of the New Invaders.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Invaders'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Black Panther uses vibranium in a micro weave mesh in his uniform that robs incoming objects of their momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfodder.com/comics/archives/2007/09/tpulls_weekly_marvel_comics_re_11.shtml|title=Tpull's Weekly Marvel Comics Review - Fantastic Four 549|editor=Filmfodder|date=September 1, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cannot be stabbed, although the costume and the Black Panther can be cut if the attacker slashes along the uniform's grain. Beyond that he uses vibranium in the soles of his boots that allows him to survive a fall of several stories and, if given enough momentum, the Panther can also scale walls or skim across water. The field can be also used offensively to shatter or weaken objects, such as kicking something with the boots. He also used the other variety Anti-Metal, in retractable claws.

==Incidents involving vibranium==
* By 1915, human expeditions discovered Anti-Metal in Antarctica.
* The story "Flags of Our Fathers", which happens during World War II, tells how Black Panther, Captain America, [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]] fight the Nazis who want to steal vibranium from the Wakandans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=11776|title=CCI: Hudlin and Cowan on "Captain America/Black Panther"|author=Dave Richards|editor=Comic Book Resources|date=July 24, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2011|editor-link=Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise and Reason of Comics and Graphic Literature: Critical Essays on the Form |last1=Goggin |first1=Joyce|last2=Hassler-Forest|first2=Dan |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0-7864-4294-2 |page=215 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yXWG0efa_8C |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Skrulls enslaved Savage Land natives to mine Anti-Metal.
* Dr. Myron MacLain created "true" [[adamantium]] in an attempt to reproduce the vibranium alloy he had made for Captain America's shield.
* [[Plunderer (character)|Parnival Plunder]], the villainous brother of [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], planned to use vibranium to make weapons with which to take over the world.
* [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]] became the ruler of Tierra del Maiz, a South American country known for its large deposits of vibranium. While the United Nations had decided not to get involved in the internal affairs of the country, Canada thought differently and sent Alpha Flight to intervene.
* When Dr. Doom gained access to Wakanda's stores of vibranium, T'Challa activated a fail-safe that rendered all processed vibranium inert.&lt;ref name="Doomwar #1-6"/&gt;
* Both Vibranium compounds were processed by [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O Lantern]] and [[Crime Master]] then given to Nrosvekistanian weapons manufacturer in Eastern Europe for arsenalization purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' Vol 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Captain Marvel discovered Vibranium is in fact alien in origin during a Spartax lethally poisoning Mining &amp; smuggling Op.&lt;ref name="Captain Marvel vol. 8 #5"/&gt;
* Vibranium in Wakanda and worldwide has been restored after events of Battleworld.&lt;ref name="BP:WOW"/&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* In an episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' entitled "The X-Men Adventure" the villain Cyberiad captures the [[X-Men]] in their own [[Danger Room]] with traps designed to utilize their greatest weaknesses. When Cyberiad traps the newest X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]], he locks her in a room made of vibranium, leaving her helpless. Pryde's mutant power is the ability to "phase" or walk through solid matter, but the properties of the "vibranium room" seemed to prevent her from using her powers to escape. She was eventually rescued and she later helped defeat Cyberiad.
* The episode of ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', "Panther's Prey" is centered on [[Iron Man]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] working to stop [[Moses Magnum]] from selling [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] a piece of stolen vibranium to give [[MODOK]] "life" as stated by the Scientist Supreme. It is depicted as a dark grey metal constantly buzzing with light green lightning. It is later used to complete [[Justin Hammer]]'s [[Titanium Man|Project: TITANIUM]], as described by [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]] as the only way to make it whole.
* Vibranium plays a central role in many episodes of ''[[Black Panther: The Animated Series]]'' produced by [[Marvel Animation]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Entertainment]].
* In the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode "The Well", the Bus's interrogation room is stated to have walls lined with a vibranium alloy. In the episodes "Love in the Time of HYDRA", "One Door Closes" and "Afterlife", [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] made a cabin for S.H.I.E.L.D. called ''Retreat'' which is made out of vibranium for order to temporarily house gifted individuals. It was also revealed in "One Door Closes" that Fury's Toolbox which was given to [[Phil Coulson]] is also made out of vibranium.
* In the [[Marvel Anime]] series "Blade", it is mentioned that [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s katana is composed of a silver-vibranium alloy.
* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Iron Vulture", Harry takes Peter Parker and Miles Morales to a safe room away from Iron Vulture and he says the room is made of Vibranium.
* In ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'',  one of Horizon High's machines is made up of vibranium which was sabotaged by [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]] Smythe 
* In ''[[Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', vibranium is depicted as a purple metal that vibrates when sound is applied to it as well as glow brighter and brighter as it absorbs sounds. It does have a limit on what it can absorb before it explodes. It does have a mutagenic property as it turned Klaw into a being of pure sound energy. It is mined from a large cave in a mountain near the Wakandan capital.

===Film===
* In [[Ultimate Avengers|''Ultimate Avengers: The Movie'']], vibranium is shown as a metal used by the Chitauri (the Ultimate Universe's versions of the [[Skrull]]s). It is used primarily in their spacecraft hulls and [[personal armor]]. Later, one of their ships is salvaged by S.H.I.E.L.D. and used to construct Captain America's shield (which also was constructed with adamantium though in the comics in the Ultimate Universe, his shield is only composed of adamantium) and other items such as vibranium-tipped bullets and knives. In the movie, S.H.I.E.L.D. developed a satellite dubbed ''Shield 1'' that was capable of locating vibranium on Earth. This was done in an effort to find the Chitauri and though it worked, the Chitauri soon destroyed it after its introduction in the movie. It should also be noted that according to the movie the only thing S.H.I.E.L.D. knew capable of penetrating vibranium was a nuclear blast or vibranium itself.
* In [[Ultimate Avengers 2|''Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther'']], vibranium serves as a bigger plot device than the previous movie as the reason for the Chitauri invasion on Wakanda is Wakanda's massive underground supply of vibranium. In the movie, vibranium is shown as a substantial power source, as condensed vibranium cubes serve as the power source for the Chitauri spaceships. Vibranium also is seen as the principal component of many weapons used in Wakanda, which made them quite powerful though not powerful enough to withstand the Chitauri's attack. Vibranium is also shown to be weakened when exposed to gamma radiation in the movie, thus making it destructible by the Hulk because he releases a blast of it whenever he attacks.
* Vibranium appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and is first named on-screen in the feature film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. [[Howard Stark]] states that vibranium is stronger than [[steel]], weighs only one third as much, and is completely vibration-absorbent. All the vibranium available to Stark was used to make [[Captain America's shield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|tXDGtRvhJIk|Captain America: The First Avenger Clip 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In'' [[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Captain America's shield proves strong enough to absorb and repel an attack from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjölnir]], and in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', the shield is also shown to be able to cushion falls from great heights. In the film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', [[Ultron]] uses vibranium obtained from [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] for multiple purposes, including the creation of the android [[Vision (Marvel comics)|Vision]]. In the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', Black Panther's entire suit is composed of a vibranium weave with retractable claws. In the film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', it is revealed that Black Panther's home nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] was built atop the crash site of a vibranium meteor centuries ago, with the metal being used to create and power the nation's advanced technology. Vibranium also has an effect on organic life, as it is used to stabilize [[Everett Ross]]' gunshot wound and is what gives the Heart Shaped Herb its potency. In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', T'Challa gives Bucky a new prosthetic arm which is made from vibranium.

===Video games===
In the computer game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' the nanite artificial intelligence known as "the Fold" attempts to harvest vibranium in Wakanda in order to construct communication towers around the world, spreading its control signal globally. While the heroes of the game manage to thwart the invasion, they are too late to prevent the construction of enough towers to make the Fold a worldwide threat.

==Real-world material==
{{Importance section|date=March 2018 | reason=This has nothing to do with the article topic. Though it's likely Hyperloop chose the name as an homage, it is nevertheless a different topic.}}

In 2016, [[Hyperloop Transportation Technologies]] developed a real-world smart composite material named Vibranium. The lightweight carbon fiber material for the Hyperloop pods is reported to provide the passengers double protection against damage to the exterior. The company says that its Vibranium is eight times lighter than aluminum and 10 times stronger than steel alternatives. The smart material can transmit critical information regarding temperature, stability, integrity and more, wirelessly and virtually instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawkins|first1=Andrew J.|title=Hyperloop startup selects Vibranium for pods because it’s good enough for Captain America|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/24/11750666/hyperloop-transportation-vibranium-carbon-fiber-marvel-comics|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wentworth Wooden Jigsaw Company''' (also known as '''Wentworth Wooden Puzzles''') manufactures [[jigsaw puzzle]]s with 'whimsical' shaped pieces reflecting the theme of the image portrayed on the puzzle. It was founded in 1994 by Kevin Wentworth Preston and is based in the village of Pinkney near [[Malmesbury]], [[Wiltshire]], an area of England known as the [[Cotswolds]].

== Company history ==
The venture was established on an existing dairy farm which was forced to diversify into other sources of income when milk production became uneconomical to sustain. Some of the old buildings were converted into industrial use, and the farm became an industrial estate housing many other traders, as well as the new puzzle enterprise.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;

===Technology===
Traditionally jigsaws are manufactured using a thin flexible cutting blade driven by a motor known as a [[bandsaw]]. This method of cutting thin wood requires a degree of manual dexterity and patience to avoid spoiling the work. An alternative solution to this labour-intensive method of cutting intricate shapes in wood was required using modern technology solutions. The advent of the commercial medium-power [[Laser]] device has enabled many industries to use this tool to cut many different types of material speedily. The puzzle-manufacturing process uses a laser-cutting method invented and perfected by the founder, Kevin Wentworth Presto, in 1994.

Wentworth production can now focus on the quality of manufacture and design innovation that this new tooling provides. The high-speed production technique allows the small company to supply in excess of 150,000 puzzles a year to destinations in over 35 countries throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3007845.stm|title=Our firms are crying out for broadband|publisher=BBC news 2003|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=7 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design team produces each cutout style individually, most of the designs are unique "whimsy" jigsaw shapes. [[Whimsies]] are specially shaped pieces cut into puzzles "on a whim" by [[Victorian-era]] hand cutters, an era when jigsaw puzzles became a popular pastime. Wentworth retained this older style of manufacture, and is one of the remaining companies still producing puzzles using these Victorian techniques.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-final-piece-of-the-jigsaw-1168860.html|title=The final piece of the Jigsaw|publisher=The Independent 1 August 1998|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=London|first=Duff|last=Hart-Davis|date=1 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Whimsy pieces' ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Whimsy pieces.jpg|right|thumb|Example of 'whimsical' pieces within the puzzles]] --&gt;
The ‘Whimsy’ laser-cut wooden puzzles feature unique, individual, “whimsical” cut-out shapes that reflect the theme of the image used on the face of the puzzle. All puzzles are supplied in a cotton draw-string bag within a lidded box. These wooden puzzles are cut from 3mm thick wooden boards (as opposed to softer cardboard) to ensure they will survive the rigours of use for a very long time. Puzzles are supplied to the customer with the option of an image of the puzzle's subject matter printed on the box. With no reference image there is the added difficulty of assembling the pieces into the correct pattern, and the element of surprise concerning the subject matter when the puzzle's image is reassembled.

* Manufacture: 3mm wooden board derived from sustainable managed forests.
* Features: rarely include corner pieces or two pieces of the same shape.
* 'whimsical' shapes: which reflect the theme of the image in all standard puzzles.
* Packaging: a cloth bag inside a sturdy box made from recycled material.

==Styles==

=== Traditional puzzles ===

All traditional puzzles include the unique whimsy pieces. Common sizes included are 100, 250, 500, 1,000 and 1,500 pieces.

=== Personalised puzzles ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Personalised jigsaw puzzle example.JPG|right|thumb|An example of a Personalised Puzzle]] --&gt;

The ability to use a photograph or image design is a feature that Wentworth's puzzles make available in all the various sizes. Text may be added at the image creation process to include such messages as 'Happy Birthday' and 'Happy Anniversary' etc.

=== Difficult puzzles ===

The [[Tessellation]] puzzles range use jigsaw pieces in which all the pieces are almost all identical in pattern. Some utilise pieces shaped like animals, such as deer. Other subjects include repetitive plant shapes such as ivy and holly cuts.

=== Children's puzzles ===

Puzzles shapes and styles are designed to suit all ages and ability, including images specially suited for children, which are traditionally constructed with larger, more manageable pieces with simpler pattern and shape design. The company was awarded recognition for its production in this section of the market in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/3767241.Puzzle_prize/|title=Puzzle prize|publisher=Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard 19 October 2008|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Witkar''' (Dutch, literally "white car" or "white cart") was one of the first technology-based [[carsharing]] projects in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It is the invention of Dutch social inventor and politician [[Luud Schimmelpennink]], an industrial designer and at the time [[Amsterdam]] city councillor. The project was opened by minister [[Irene Vorrink]] on 21 March 1974.

The first actual Witkar project took place in Amsterdam between 1974 and 1986. While it provided daily service for more than 4,000 registered users over those years, the project never got beyond the limited demonstration phase due to a lack of support by government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Verkeersminister Irene Vorrink en Luud Schimmelpennink (geestelijk vader van de Witkar) bij de opening van het eerste Wi - SFA001007848.jpg|thumb|Minister Vorrink and Luud Schimmelpennink at the opening of the first Witkar station on the Amstelveld in Amsterdam on 21 March 1974.]]
The system was initially conceived in 1969 by Schimmelpennink in order to reduce traffic in central Amsterdam, but it failed to win the support of the City Council and was spun off to be developed by a specially formed co-operative society. The co-operative managed to raise loans of US$ 250,000 for the first phase though 1974. This included the design and construction of the vehicles, the purchase of a [[PDP-11]] [[mini-computer]] for the central control system, development of the control software, and construction of the first 35 cars and five stations. A further 10 stations were scheduled for operation by the end of 1976, by which time the fleet was to have been extended to 100 vehicles. The ultimate target was 150 stations and 1,000 vehicles, but as a result of lack of government support{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} this never happened.

The core of the Witkar concept is that of people sharing small environmentally-acceptable vehicles specially designed for urban use. It was seen by Schimmelpennink and his team as a way to wean people away from conventional car ownership and use, on the grounds that such vehicles have no place in densely settled cities.

These were specially designed electric vehicles. They had two seats, and offered little luxury. They were very easy to recognize. The vehicles were located around the city in pods. In Amsterdam 35 of these cars were available to hire from five stations in the city centre. The original system was designed for fully automatic control, including direct debit of hirers' accounts at the Amsterdam Savings Bank.

The idea was that any person could take a Witkar, and leave it at the Witkar station closest to their destination. The initiators thought that the flow of traffic to and from these stations would allow for an even spread of Witkarren (the Dutch plural of Witkar). The system actually operated. The problems were several: the vehicles needed long recharging times, so many were needed to have some on the road all the time. The biggest problem was that the flow of traffic was generally in one direction. As a result of this, some stations were always full, and others always empty. To correct this by moving Witkarren would have caused a lot of extra traffic.

As of this date (January 2007), Schimmelpennink and his associates are planning a new Witkar program for Amsterdam, where he has recently (March 2006) been re-elected to the Municipal Council.
