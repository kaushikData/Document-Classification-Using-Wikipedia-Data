'''''Andes to Amazon''''' is a [[nature documentary]] TV series co-produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] in [[Bristol]], England and [[Animal Planet]], first transmitted in the UK on [[BBC2]] in November 2000. In other territories it was broadcast under the title '''''Wild South America'''''

Each of the six 50-minute episodes portrays a different aspect of the South American continent. The series features extensive aerial photography of major landforms shot by Bob Fulton, and footage of rarely glimpsed animals in the wild. ''Andes to Amazon'' was narrated by [[Fergal Keane]] and produced by Karen Bass.

The series forms part of the Natural History Unit's ''Continents'' strand, and was preceded by ''[[Land of the Tiger]]'' in 1997 and followed one year later by ''[[Congo (BBC TV series)|Congo]]''.

==Production==
The filmmakers journeyed the length and breath of [[South America]] in search of locations and unusual species. Memorable sequences include an aerial journey over a glacier in Argentine [[Patagonia]], jungle animals visiting an [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] waterhole at night and luminous termite mounds in the grasslands of central [[Brazil]]. Other locations featured are the [[Galápagos Islands]] and the [[Salar de Uyuni]], the world's biggest salt lake in the Bolivian [[altiplano]].

Filming and post-production took three years in all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=5559647&amp;linkID=5572505 Autodesk Fire - BBC Andes to Amazon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823015058/http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=5559647&amp;linkID=5572505 |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = The opening episode traces the events that have created the unique landforms and ecology of South America. Originally part of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], it broke away around 100 million years ago and became an island. At that time, it was dominated by [[reptile]]s and strange [[plant]]s similar to the ''[[Araucaria araucana|araucaria]]s'' and [[tree fern]]s of [[Chile]]’s [[Valdivian forest]]s. These forests also harbour descendants of the first [[mammal]]s, small [[marsupial]]s like the [[shrew opossum]] and [[monito del monte]]. Volcanic activity thrust up the [[Andes]], where animals have had to adapt to the extreme environments of the [[altiplano]] and Patagonia. The Andes formed a natural barrier which altered the climate and the course of major rivers. [[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] was once a great [[swamp]], but now harbours the world’s greatest expanse of [[rainforest]] and its mightiest river. There are more [[species]] here than anywhere else, and many, including [[pygmy marmoset]]s, have specialised diets. There are extreme dry environments here too. [[Guanaco]]s survive in the [[Atacama Desert]] by eating [[lichen]]s, whilst in windswept Patagonia, [[mara (mammal)|mara]]s and [[burrowing owl]]s squabble over the best nest holes. By contrast, the seas are rich in life: a pod of [[dusky dolphin]]s is filmed attacking a shoal of [[anchovy|anchovies]]. A land bridge with [[North America]] formed 3 million years ago, creating a pathway for [[invasive species]]. Those that survived were the opportunists like [[coati]]s, or specialists that exploited niches, like the [[maned wolf]]. Man, the most recent invader, has shaped the land and domesticated its animals to meet his own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Lost Worlds | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and produced by Karen Bass | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = The second programme shows how life along the [[Amazon River]] is dominated by the annual cycle of floods. In the dry season, female [[arrau|giant river turtle]]s gather on exposed sand banks to lay their eggs. As broad reaches of river are cut off by sandbars, [[caiman]]s and [[egret]]s take advantage of the bounty of fish trapped in shallow lagoons. Underwater [[infrared]] cameras film scavenging [[candiru]] and an [[electric eel]] hunting. As the first rains arrive, a [[cormorant]] flock feeds quickly to take advantage before the fish begin to disperse. [[American black vulture|Black vulture]]s get an easy meal as fish killed by oxygen-starved water wash up on the river banks. In the rainy season, water levels along the Amazon can rise up to 10 m. [[Invertebrate]]s emerge from cover in the undergrowth and migrate into the trees to escape drowning, but [[lizard]]s and [[praying mantis]]es await their arrival. [[Fire ant]]s mass into a floating raft to move from their flooded nests, while [[sloth]]s and [[tarantula]]s have adapted to swimming between trees. Predators are at a disadvantage now, but [[giant otter]]s are expert hunters and use teamwork to corral fish. The [[boto]], a rare river dolphin, navigates the submerged forests using sonar. Rainforest trees, which can survive inundation for six months, time their fruiting to coincide with the floods, using fish as seed dispersers. Villages and communities line the river's banks, but their overall environmental impact is low and they have adapted to the annual cycle of flooding. The sheer scale of the Amazon may yet ensure its survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Mighty Amazon | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and produced by Huw Cordey | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third instalment features [[Brazil]]’s [[Cerrado]] [[grassland]]s and the [[Pantanal]], the largest seasonal swamp on Earth. The plains have pronounced wet and dry seasons, and the creatures of these ancient habitats have evolved survival strategies to withstand the extremes of drought, fire and flood. The main grazers here are [[termite]]s, making the Cerrado seem empty in comparison to Africa’s [[savannah]]. Specialist termite eaters include the [[giant anteater|giant]] and [[collared anteater]]s and [[armadillo]]s. By the end of the dry season, even the Pantanal begins to dry out. Fish and caimans are trapped in muddy pools and [[capybara]]s must move in search of water. A female [[jaguar]] with two cubs is shown chasing vultures off a cattle carcass. The first storms ignite the Cerrado as [[lightning]] strikes the tinder-dry grass. These annual fires help return nutrients to the soil, and trigger plants to release their seeds. The Pantanal is home to over 700 species of bird, including the rare [[hyacinth macaw]] and vast flocks of [[wood stork]]s, which time their breeding to coincide with the floods. Young capybaras are vulnerable to attacks from [[anaconda]]s. As the Cerrado flowers bloom with the arrival of the rains, [[rhea (bird)|rhea]]s and [[pampas deer]] feed alongside one another. A playful greeting between maned wolves is filmed using [[night-vision]] cameras. On humid nights, winged termites leave their mounds in their millions to start new colonies. The final scenes show the mounds illuminated with the lights of [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] [[beetle]] grubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Great Plains | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and produced by Ian Gray | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = In the fourth programme, the viewer is taken on a journey along the Andes, the spine of the continent. In the northern tropics, [[spectacled bear]]s feed on [[bromeliad]]s in the [[cloud forest]]s and on the [[Puya (genus)|puya]] flower spikes in the alpine grasslands of the [[Páramo]]. At these altitudes [[hummingbird]]s find it difficult to hover, so those such as the [[Andean hillstar]] perch on flowers as they drink the nectar. The Andes are a young range in geological terms, and volcanic activity is still present. The mountain-building forces have thrust up the [[altiplano]], a high, dry desert with [[geyser]] fields, caustic lakes and little vegetation. [[Vicuña]]s and [[vizcacha]]s have adapted to the thin air and large daily temperature variation. Despite the treeless environment, even [[woodpecker]]s are found here; the [[Andean flicker]] nests underground. The geysers and [[hot spring]]s never freeze so [[flamingo]]s here can stay year-round, but those on the [[salt lake]]s must migrate to lower altitudes to escape the winter. Late-hatching chicks can be trapped by the ice before they can fly. The final part of the programme features Patagonia, where the mountains are lower but closer to [[Antarctica]]. The [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field|ice field]]s are so vast they generate their own [[glacier]]s and weather systems, blasting the remnants of ancient [[volcano]]es with cold winds. Guanacos, [[South American gray fox|gray fox]]es and [[Cougar|puma]]s are filmed in both winter and summer. Birds featured include spring migrants [[buff-necked ibis]]es and [[great grebe]]s, while the resident [[Andean condor]]s are big enough to see foxes off a carcass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Andes | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Jones and produced by Tim Scoones | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode five covers the Amazon rainforest, home to more varieties of plants and animals than anywhere else on Earth. Despite the profusion of life, finding food can be a challenge for both people and animals. Many plants have poisonous leaves, seeds and fruit to protect themselves against attack. The [[Huaorani people|Huaorani]], a native tribe, practise low-impact hunting using blowpipes. They make darts using downy fibres from [[Kapok tree|kapok]] seeds for the flights, and dip the tips in natural toxins. Some animals eat only the youngest shoots, which contain less poison. Others such as [[white-faced saki]]s have developed special digestive systems to cope with their toxic diet. At a [[clay lick]], [[spider monkey]]s risk descending to the forest floor to eat clay, which helps to neutralise the toxins. They are not alone – other visitors include a [[brocket deer]], [[White-lipped peccary|white-lipped peccaries]] and [[parrot]]s. At night, the flooded lick is visited by the shy [[Brazilian tapir]]. [[Green-winged macaw|Red-and-green macaw]]s take clay at special places along the rivers, a great social occasion for the birds. [[Army ant]]s are shown overwhelming their prey, but some creatures have developed clever ways to avoid detection. [[Antbird]]s are reliant on the ants to flush out fleeing insects. In the canopy, bromeliads are a vital water source for all tree dwellers, including [[woolly monkey]]s and the dazzling [[paradise tanager]]. Each plant can store up to ten litres and is a microcosm of life. [[Golden-mantled tamarin]]s are successful because they are supreme opportunists, eating fruits and insects and living in tightly knit groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Amazon Jungle | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and produced by Huw Cordey | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = The final programme begins in the [[Falkland Islands]], where thousands of [[rockhopper penguin]]s negotiate the treacherous wave-swept coast and sea cliffs as they come ashore to breed. Huge shoals of [[krill]] live in the cold, oxygen-rich waters of the surrounding ocean. [[Black-browed albatross]], [[gentoo penguin]]s and [[Imperial shag|king cormorants]] are among the millions of seabirds drawn here to take advantage of the nutrient-rich sea. In summer, pods of [[killer whale]]s arrive to hunt penguins, using techniques learned from previous generations. Animals of the [[Southern Ocean]] visit the deep-water [[fjord]]s around the southern tip of the continent. [[Magellanic penguin]]s nest in the undergrowth, but must evade the predatory [[sea lion]]s which patrol the [[kelp forest]]s offshore. [[Peale's dolphin|Peale’s dolphins]] are filmed in the [[Straits of Magellan]]. The cold [[Humboldt Current]] carries nutrients far up the west coast of South America, but on land the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests|temperate forests]] give way to the driest desert on Earth. Off the coast at [[Paracas National Reservation|Paracas]], huge shoals of anchovies gather. These attract seabirds, [[Humboldt penguin]]s and larger predators such as sea lions. At the [[Galápagos Islands]], warm and cold ocean currents meet, attracting new species. [[Hammerhead shark]]s gather in shoals hundreds strong to feed, breed and socialise. [[Sperm whale]]s also arrive to breed, with the bulls establishing dominance over rivals by head-butting and tooth rasping. The volcanic islands have their own unique flora and fauna due to their isolation, including [[flightless cormorant]]s, [[marine iguana]]s and [[Galápagos finch]]es. The cold Humboldt Current has even put a penguin on the [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Penguin Shores | series = Andes to Amazon | credits = Written by Pelham Aldrich-Blake and produced by Tim Scoones | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2000-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Cosmographie de Claude Ptolemée.djvu|page=9|thumb|right|''Geography'' by Ptolemy, Latin manuscript of the early 15th century, with maps by Claudius Clavus]]
'''Claudius Clavus''' (Suartho) also known as ''Nicholas Niger'', ({{lang-da|Claudius Claussøn Swart}}), (September 14, 1388-?), was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[geographer]] sometimes considered to be the first [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] [[cartographer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/3/0642.html Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04009b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that he was born in the village of [[Salling (Funen)|Salling]] on the Danish island of [[Funen]]. He is commemorated by a plaque in the local ''Aagaarden''.

In 1412-13 at the age of 25 he started to travel around Europe and appeared eleven years later (1423–24) in [[Rome]]. It is believed he travelled as far north as the 70°10' N. [[latitude|lat.]] In Rome he became friends with the cardinal [[Giordano Orsini (died 1438)|Giordano Orsini]] and the pope's secretary [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini]], who were among those working to update the old Roman cartography. Claudius contributed to a more realistic description of Nordic countries, in particular [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], and was probably the first cartographer to put [[Greenland]] on a map. He is also known for having named Greenlandic places by using lyrics from old folk songs.

Unfortunately, most of his work (including two maps) is [[lost work| lost]], but a copy has been preserved through the German cartographers [[Donnus Nicholas Germanus]] and [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]], and in the nineteenth century more texts were rediscovered in the imperial library at [[Vienna]]. He drew 27 maps for a copy of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] (see image).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">The '''daily urban system (DUS)''' refers to the area around a city, in which daily commuting occurs. It is a means for defining an [[urban area|urban]] region by including the areas from which individuals commute. Daily Urban System is a concept first introduced by American geographer, Berry, and British geographer, Hall. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halás, Marián|first=and Zuskáčová, Veronika|date=April 23, 2017|title="Travelling to Services in the Daily Urban System of Olomouc."|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/BGSS/article/viewFile/bog-2013-0009/818|journal=Bulletin of Geography. Socio–economic Series.|volume=20|pages=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}

Daily urban system (DUS) mainly focusses on urban cities, where majority of the commuting flow take place. However, some case studies do look at the outskirts and suburban areas around specific urban cities that are being studied. The daily commuting includes both work and leisure, contributing to high density in the daily urban system. That results in slower the speed of transportation. The speed of transportation is about 16km/h at the central parts of urban cities, but speed may vary from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denise Pumain|Pumain, Denise]]. "Scaling Laws and Urban Systems" (PDF). Santa Fe Institute. Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Urban sprawl]] is the possible outcome of an expansion of the daily urban system. Therefore, it includes multiple local governments, economies, and demographics. The researchers that study daily urban system (DUS) are basically focusing on the [[transportation planning]]. Some are interested in micro analysis of an urban area per se, some carry out macro analysis of a region that is made up of several urban cities. 

The difference between an agglomeration of an urban area and the daily urban system is that an agglomeration is a multivariate means of combining townships, counties, and other defined areas. It looks at shared economic relationships and other factors. Daily urban system, on the other hand, only attempts to show how far away people who commute into a city are living. It shows how much sprawl has occurred. That is, it shows how people are living unnecessarily far away from where they commute to everyday due to differences in conditions between the regions. 

== Literature Review ==

=== Olomouc ===
A study in Olomouc research on the traveling distance among locations such as schools, hospitals, retail stores, and culture and sports centers of the region, and the towns in the hinterland of Olomouc too. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The findings were different for the region and towns. The towns had shown improvement in traveling distance for commercial services, such as pharmacies and banking services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were groceries and retail shops moving to large commercial centers too, cutting down traveling distance, which people were able to shop at the malls without having to travel much.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the study found little changes region wise, especially in health care and education sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commute for schools and health care institutions had remained stable.  

===Randstad===
In this article, the researchers were looking at the daily urban systems within Randstad to determine if the megalopolis is considered a network city. Commute within Randstad remained loose despite the rising proportions of population commuting to work over a decade (1992 to 2002).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsema Van Eck, Snellen|first=Jan, Daniëlle|date=2006|title=Is the Randstad a City Network? Evidence From Commuting Patterns|url=https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/11/11.951/oldstuff/albacete/Other_Documents/Europe%20Transport%20Conference/planning_for_sustainab/is_the_randstad_a_1428.pdf|journal=Association for European Transport|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many residents from the suburban areas were still commuting to work at the urban areas - large daily urban system - every day after ten years due to low job growth. Randstad was not considered as a network city because of its negative commuting balance, where large proportion of residents had to commute to large daily urban system for work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Paris ===
Paris's central urban population is 2,125,246.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It's agglomerated population is 9,644,507.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's a big difference. Roughly 7 million people live outside of Paris proper, but are easily within the greater Parisian area. Paris's daily urban system has a population of 11,174,743.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's 1.5 million people living outside of what can (at the most generous) be called Paris, and yet are commuting there every day. 10% of the city lives far enough away that they cannot really say they 'live outside of Paris,' but commute there daily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pumain|first=Denise|title=Scaling Laws and Urban Systems|url=http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/04-02-002.pdf|publisher=[[Santa Fe Institute]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">The '''District Gazetteer''' is a comprehensive geographical, economic, social and cultural catalogue of the [[India]]n subcontinent catalogued by the [[British Viceroy]] during the conquest of India. Most of the catalogues were compiled initially in the late 19th century although many have since been reissued or edited in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gazfzpr1.htm|title=Aurangzeb, Punjab District Gazetteer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the publication of the Gazetteers, an attempt to systematically catalogue Indian geography and culture was not available, with the closest approximation being [[Abu'l Fazl]]'s [[Ain-I-Akbari]], compiled during the reign of [[Akbar the Great]].&lt;ref name="boloji"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boloji.com/environment/21.htm|title=What A Gazetteer Is Not|author=Biswas, Kumud|date=July 6, 2003|publisher=Boloji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the Gazetteers are available to the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/gazetteer.php?level=2&amp;showFile=1&amp;gazetteerSqlId=20020422124737&amp;gazetteerMainId=&amp;gazetteerFile2Id=&amp;distId=19&amp;gazId=20020422121541&amp;pubYear=&amp;fileExists=&amp;headingSqlName=Preface&amp;chapter=|title=Aurangabad, Maharashtra, District Gazetteer}}&lt;/ref&gt; their accuracy is a subject of much dispute among academicians and scholars. They are still not to be neglected in that they are one of the more comprehensive attempts by a third party source to catalogue the immense cultural history of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="boloji"/&gt;

'''Dolpo''' ({{lang-bo|དོལ་པོ}} ) is a high-altitude [[Tibetan culture|culturally Tibetan]] region in the upper part of the [[Dolpa District]] of western [[Nepal]], bordered in the north by [[China]].&lt;ref name=bauer&gt;{{harvnb|Bauer|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Part of the region lies in [[Shey Phoksundo National Park]]. The sparse, [[nomad|agro-pastoral]] population, known as '''Dolpo''' in standard [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and ''Dhol-wa'' in the local dialect, is connected to the rest of Nepal via [[Jufal]] airport, which can be reached in three days by horse.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|1, 11, 27}} There are no precise population numbers for the region, with estimates including less than 5,000&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|1}} and 18,000&lt;ref name=geoportal/&gt;

The Dolpo are generally adherents of [[Bon]], a religion whose origins predate [[Buddhism]] but whose modern form is officially accepted as a fifth school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The remote region has preserved its Tibetan culture in relatively pure form, making it attractive to Westerners. Dolpa was the location for the 1999 [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominated]] film ''[[Himalaya (film)|Himalaya]]'' and more recently for the German documentary [[Dolpo Tulku]].

In spite of the near inaccessibility of the region and tourism restrictions for the more remote parts, Dolpa is a popular destination for [[trekking]] tourism.

==Geography==
Dolpo is geologically part of the sedimentary [[Geology of Nepal#Tibetan-Tethys|Tibetan-Tethys]] zone. It is surrounded by Himalayan mountain chains including the [[Dhaulagiri]] ({{convert|8172|m|ft}}). These cloud barriers cause a semi-arid climate, with reported annual precipitations of less than {{convert|500|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|20}}

[[File:Chorten and barley fields.jpg|thumb|[[Stupa|Chorten]] with barley fields; Tarap Valley in the southern part of Dolpa.]]
The region is historically divided into four valleys: Tsharka ("good growing-place"), Tarap ("auspicious excellent"), Panzang ("abode of monks"), and Nangkhong ("innermost place").&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|1}} They constitute four of the seven [[Village development committee (Nepal)|village development committee]]s (VDCs) that were created in 1975.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|114}} The valleys south of the watershed drain into the [[Bheri River]]. The VDCs in this area are (roughly from east to west):
* [[Chharka]] (Tsharka Valley)
* [[Mukot]]
* [[Dho]] (Tarap Valley)
* [[Phoksundo]].
The northern valleys between the watershed and Tibet drain westward by the ''Langu River'', a tributary of the [[Karnali River]] via the ''Mugu Karnali''. The VDCs in this area are:
* [[Tinje]] (Panzang Valley)
* [[Saldang]] (Nangkhong Valley)
* [[Bhijer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncthakur.itgo.com/districtmaps/dolpa_district.htm Map of Nepal – Dolpa District].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolpo can be roughly divided into four valleys, each of which is represented since 1975 by a village development committee (VDC): [[Dho]] (Tarap Valley), [[Saldang]] (Nankhong Valley, the most populous&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|114}}), [[Tinje]] (Panzang Valley), and [[Chharka]] (Tsharka Valley).&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|105}} There are also smaller VDCs at [[Bhijer]], [[Mukot]] and [[Phoksundo]].&lt;ref name=geoportal&gt;[http://www.dss-hkkh.icimod.org/SpatialVisualisation/GeneralContent.aspx?gcid=7&amp;gscid=15&amp;gid=96 Discover Dolpa Region - Great Himalayan Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726165534/http://www.dss-hkkh.icimod.org/SpatialVisualisation/GeneralContent.aspx?gcid=7&amp;gscid=15&amp;gid=96 |date=26 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture is possible at heights of {{convert|3800|to|4180|m|ft}} (villages of Shimen Panzang Valley and Chharka, respectively) but often requires irrigation.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|22}} Apart from [[barley]], crops include [[buckwheat]], [[millet]], [[Mustard seed|mustard]], [[wheat]], [[potatoes]], [[radish]]es,&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|22}} and [[spinach]]. Similar to [[transhumance in the Alps]], the population migrates between villages and high-lying ({{convert|4000|to|5000|m|ft|disp=or}}) summer pastures, in a lifestyle referred to as ''samadrok'' (roughly "farming nomads").&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|44, 50}}

Dolpo makes up the greatest part of the area of the Dolpa District, but the district's population is concentrated in the lower southern parts, where also most of the VDCs are located.

==Trade==
Local products are not sufficient to guarantee survival. The Dolpo traditionally trade salt from Tibet to the lower parts of Nepal, where they maintain ''netsang'' (literally "nesting place") relationships, first described by Kenneth M. Bauer.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;&lt;ref name=yakconference&gt;{{harvnb|Bauer|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bauer, each family in Dolpo has netsang partners in most villages of Dolpo District, a network that facilitates travel as well as trade.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|41}} In return for salt, the netsang provide grain and shelter. The netsang partners trade with each other on preferential terms, based on fictitious family relations that may last for several generations. Recent changes such as the easy availability of salt from other regions and the closed border with Tibet have put the netsang system under pressure.&lt;ref name=yakconference/&gt;

==History==
Dolpo appears in historical records since c.&amp;nbsp;8th century. In the time from the 6th century to the 8th century the Tibetan [[List of emperors of Tibet|Yarlung]] dynasty conquered most Tibetan-speaking territories. This seems to have caused a southward migration towards Dolpo and the peripheral areas along the upper [[Kali Gandaki River]] (Lo and Serib). In 842, Tibet fell apart, and Dolpa fell under the kingdom of [[Burang Town|Purang]]. Purang and Dolpa became temporarily part of the kingdom of [[Guge]] in the 10th century, but soon became separate again when King sKyid lde Nyi ma mgon divided Guge among his three sons.
&lt;!--
An early 14th century medical text by Brang ti dPal ldan ‘tsho byed lists delegations of physicians from neighbor countries invited by the Tibetan king Khri srong lde btsan (reigned 756–797 AD). The fact that a physician from Dolpo was listed indicates that Dolpo was a province separate from Tibet at the time of the [[Yarlung]] dynasty. A reference in PT&amp;nbsp;1287,&lt;ref&gt;[http://otdo.aa.tufs.ac.jp/archives.cgi?p=Pt_1287 PT 1287], transliterated online version.&lt;/ref&gt; an old Tibetan chronicle preserved as one of the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], also indicates that in the 8th century Dolpa was independent from Tibet and Nepal.

Dolpo was also said to be controlled by Serib. Furthermore, since the Dolpo and Serib had strong ties not only with its geography, but also with matters such as religious and political. In Old Tibetan Annals preserved in Dunhuang, we can find a reference which suggest that Serib was taken under control of Tibet with the help of the minister (Tib. blon chen po) dBa Khri gzigs, but later again separated from their control. 
--&gt;

During the reign of the Ya-rtse king A-sog-lde around 1253 both Dolpo and Serib were lost to the ruler of Gungthang, mGon po lde. The latter then reunited both the Dolpo and Serib and classified them among one of three provinces of mNga' ris. It is also known from historical documents that Mongolian troops reached Dolpo to conquer this province when they conquered many parts of Tibet and finally handed over the power to the ruler of the [[Sakya]] period.

In the 14th century Dolpo fell under its eastern neighbor the [[Kingdom of Lo]], which controlled the trans-Himalayan trade route through the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]]. The Dolpo had to pay tax and travel to [[Lo Monthang]] to provide manual labor.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|60–62}}

For some time between the 15th century (1440?) and the 16th century, Dolpo was temporarily independent and ruled by a king from the Ra nag dynasty.

In 1769, the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]]s conquered [[Kathmandu]] and established the [[Kingdom of Nepal]], which would soon reach more or less the country's modern extent. In 1789, Nepal swallowed the Lo kingdom and with it Dolpo. The kingdom's attempt to wrest nominal suzerainty over Tibet from China ended in a massive Chinese intervention that left Nepal paying tribute to China.

==The region in film==
The 1999 French-Nepalese movie [[Himalaya (film)|Himalaya]], which gives insight into the local customs, was the first Nepalese film to be nominated for an Oscar award and also a huge success in Nepal itself, drawing the country's attention to the region. Kenneth M. Bauer notes that the film's authenticity was in large part artificial, as dialogues mixed the standard Tibetan of the professional actors with the villagers' local dialects and all external influences in the region (such as clothes, Maoists and tourists) were hidden. He also describes the impact which the film had on the region as an employer.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;{{rp|169–186}}

The 2009 documentary [[Dolpo Tulku]] accompanies Sherap Sangpo (born 1981 in the Tarap Valley) on his journey from India back to his home region and his first steps as a Buddhist spiritual leader of the Dolpa. At the age of ten, he had pilgrimaged to India and after meeting the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] had decided to become a monk. In [[Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling|Ka-Nying Monastery]] in [[Kathmandu]] he was soon recognized as the reincarnation of Lama Nyinchung and sent to [[Namdroling Monastery]] in [[Karnataka]]. After 16 years in southern India his education was finished, and in 2008 he returned to his home region to take over the responsibilities of his predecessor as a Buddhist spiritual leader of the Dolpa and in particular the monasteries in Dho-Tarap, Namgung and Saldang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dolpotulku.org/ dolpa tulku] – film website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CVO|OBE|FRGS}} ({{IPAc-en|'|ʃ|æ|k|ə|l|t|ə|n}}; 15 February 1874&amp;nbsp;– 5&amp;nbsp;January 1922) was a [[British people|British]]&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Peder. "The politics of early exploration." Handbook on the Politics of Antarctica. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antarctic explorer|polar explorer]] who led three British expeditions to the [[Antarctic]]. He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]].{{sfn|Barczewski|p=146}}

Born in [[Kilkea]], [[County Kildare]], Ireland (then part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland| United Kingdom]]), Shackleton and his [[Anglo-Irish people| Anglo-Irish]] family{{sfn|BBC, ''Shackleton''}} moved to [[Sydenham]] in suburban south London when he was ten. His first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Discovery Expedition]] 1901–1904, from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S. During the [[Nimrod Expedition|second expedition]] 1907–1909 he and three companions established a new record [[Farthest South]] latitude at 88°S, only 97 [[geographical mile]]s (112 [[statute mile]]s, 180&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[South Pole]], the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed [[Mount Erebus]], the most active Antarctic volcano. For these achievements, Shackleton was knighted by [[King Edward VII]] on his return home.

After the race to the [[South Pole]] ended in December 1911 with [[Roald Amundsen]]'s conquest, Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end he made preparations for what became the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914–17. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship, ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', became trapped in [[pack ice]] and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach [[Elephant Island]] and ultimately the inhabited island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles and Shackleton's most famous exploit. In 1921, he returned to the [[Antarctic]] with the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]], but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request he was buried there.

Away from his expeditions, Shackleton's life was generally restless and unfulfilled. In his search for rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was "rediscovered",{{sfn|Jones|p=289}} and rapidly became a role model for leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as "incredible".{{sfn|Barczewski|p=295}} In his 1956 address to the [[British Science Association|British Association]], [[Raymond Priestley|Sir Raymond Priestley]], one of his contemporaries, said "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton", paraphrasing what [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] had written in a preface to [[The Worst Journey in the World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--no by-line.--&gt; |title=Profile Sir James Wordie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apy5k2u_oIMC&amp;pg=PA25 |magazine=New Scientist |location= |publisher= |date=5 Dec 1957 |access-date=25 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Croome |first=Angela |date=2 Jan 1958 |title=Antarctic Paraphrase (letter to magazine) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOZORiOT_lUC&amp;pg=PA35 |magazine=New Scientist |location= |publisher= |access-date=25 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Shackleton was voted eleventh in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].

== Early years ==

=== Childhood ===

[[File:Ernest Shackleton Plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque marking the home of Ernest Shackleton at 12 Westwood Hill, [[Sydenham]], [[London Borough of Lewisham]]]]

Ernest Shackleton was born on 15 February 1874 in [[Kilkea]] near [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]], Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom), about {{convert|46|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from [[Dublin]]. Ernest's father was Henry Shackleton, and his mother was Henrietta Letitia Sophia Gavan. His father's family was [[English people| English]], originally from [[Yorkshire]]. His mother's family were [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] and were descended from the Fitzmaurices, who had settled in counties [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]] after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland| Anglo-Norman invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ernestshackleton.net/#hisearlylife&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest was the second of their ten children and the first of two sons; the second, Frank, achieved notoriety as a suspect, later exonerated, in the 1907 theft of the [[Irish Crown Jewels]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=227–28}}

In 1880, when Ernest was six, Henry Shackleton gave up his life as a landowner to study medicine at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], moving his family into the city.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=6–9}} Four years later, the family moved again, from Ireland to [[Sydenham]] in suburban London. Partly this was in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about their Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the [[assassination]] by Irish nationalists of [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], the British Secretary for Ireland, in 1882.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=6–9}}

=== Education ===
[[File:Dulwich College, College Road, Dulwich. - geograph.org.uk - 58443.jpg|thumb|[[Dulwich College]], south London (a modern photograph)]]
From early childhood, Shackleton was a voracious reader, a pursuit which sparked a passion for adventure.{{sfn|Kimmel | pp=4–5}} He was schooled by a governess until the age of eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, [[Dulwich]], in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered [[Dulwich College]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=6–9}} The young Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be "bored" by his studies.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=6–9}} He was quoted later as saying: "I never learned much geography at school&amp;nbsp;... Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers&amp;nbsp;... teachers should be very careful not to spoil [their pupils'] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition."{{sfn|Huntford|pp=6–9}} In his final term at the school he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.{{sfn|Mill | pp=24, 72–80, 104–115, 150}}

=== Merchant Navy officer ===
[[File:HRM EHS p56.jpg|thumb|upright|Shackleton in 1901, aged 27]]
Shackleton's restlessness at school was such that he was allowed to leave at 16 and go to sea.{{sfn|Huntford|p=11}} The options available were a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] cadetship at [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']], which Dr Shackleton could not afford; the mercantile marine cadet ships [[Thames Nautical Training College|''Worcester'']] and [[HMS Conway (school ship)|''Conway'']]; or an apprenticeship "before the mast" on a sailing vessel. The third option was chosen.{{sfn|Huntford|p=11}} His father was able to secure him a berth with the North Western Shipping Company, aboard the [[square-rigged]] sailing ship ''Hoghton Tower''.{{sfn|Huntford|p=11}}

During the following four years at sea, Shackleton learned his trade, visiting the far corners of the earth and forming acquaintances with a variety of people from many walks of life, learning to be at home with all kinds of men.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=13–18}} In August 1894, he passed his examination for [[Second Mate]] and accepted a post as [[Third Mate|third officer]] on a [[tramp steamer]] of the Welsh Shire Line.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=13–18}} Two years later, he had obtained his [[First Mate]]'s ticket, and in 1898, he was certified as a [[Master Mariner]], qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=13–18}}

In 1898, Shackleton joined [[Union-Castle Line]], the regular mail and passenger carrier between [[Southampton]] and [[Cape Town]]. He was, as a shipmate recorded, "a departure from our usual type of young officer", content with his own company though not aloof, "spouting lines from Keats [and] Browning", a mixture of sensitivity and aggression but, withal, sympathetic.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=20–23}} Following the outbreak of the [[Boer War]] in 1899, Shackleton transferred to the troopship ''Tintagel Castle'' where, in March 1900, he met an army lieutenant, Cedric Longstaff, whose father [[Llewellyn W. Longstaff]] was the main financial backer of the [[National Antarctic Expedition]] then being organised in London.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=25–30}} Shackleton used his acquaintance with the son to obtain an interview with Longstaff senior, with a view to obtaining a place on the expedition. Longstaff, impressed by Shackleton's keenness, recommended him to [[Sir Clements Markham]], the expedition's overlord, making it clear that he wanted Shackleton accepted.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=25–30}} On 17 February 1901, his appointment as third officer to the expedition's ship ''Discovery'' was confirmed; on 4 June he was commissioned into the Royal Navy, with the rank of [[sub-lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Reserves]].{{sfn|Huntford|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27322|page=3926|date=11 June 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although officially on leave from Union-Castle, this was in fact the end of Shackleton's Merchant Navy service.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=25–30}}

== ''Discovery'' Expedition, 1901–03 ==
{{Main|Discovery Expedition}}
[[File:Discoveryboat.jpg|thumb|left|The expedition ship ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'' in [[Antarctic]] waters]]

The National Antarctic Expedition, known as the Discovery Expedition after the ship [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']], was the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and had been many years in preparation. It was led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted Commander,{{sfn|Savours|p=9}} and had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=19–20}}

Although ''Discovery'' was not a Royal Navy unit, Scott required the crew, officers and scientific staff to submit to the conditions of the Naval Discipline Act, and the ship and expedition were run on Royal Navy lines.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=35}} Shackleton accepted this, even though his own background and instincts favoured a different, more informal style of leadership.{{sfn|Crane||pp=171–72}} Shackleton's particular duties were listed as: "In charge of seawater analysis. Ward-room caterer. In charge of holds, stores and provisions […] He also arranges the entertainments."{{sfn|Fisher|p=23}}

''Discovery'' departed London on 31 July 1901, arriving at the Antarctic coast, via [[Cape Town]] and [[New Zealand]], on 8 January 1902. After landing, Shackleton took part in an experimental balloon flight on 4 February.{{sfn|Wilson|p=111}} He also participated, with the scientists [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] and [[Hartley Ferrar]], in the first sledging trip from the expedition's winter quarters in [[McMurdo Sound]], a journey which established a safe route on to the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]].{{sfn|Wilson|pp=115–118}} During the Antarctic winter of 1902, in the confines of the iced-in ''Discovery'', Shackleton edited the expedition's magazine ''The South Polar Times''.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=78}}

According to steward [[Clarence Hare]], he was "the most popular of the officers among the crew, being a good mixer",{{sfn|Huntford|p=76}} though claims that this represented an unofficial rival leadership to Scott's are unsupported.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=83}} Scott chose Shackleton to accompany Wilson and himself on the expedition's southern journey, a march southwards to achieve the highest possible latitude in the direction of the South Pole. This march was not a serious attempt on the Pole, although the attainment of a high latitude was of great importance to Scott, and the inclusion of Shackleton indicated a high degree of personal trust.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=83}}{{sfn|Fisher|p=58}}

[[File:Scott of the Antarctic (bw cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Falcon Scott|Captain Scott]]]]

The party set out on 2 November 1902. The march was, Scott wrote later, "a combination of success and failure".{{sfn|Fiennes|p=104}} A record [[Farthest South]] latitude of 82°&amp;nbsp;17' was reached, beating the previous record established in 1900 by [[Carsten Borchgrevink]].{{efn|name=Farthest South}}{{sfn|Crane|pp=214–15}} The journey was marred by the poor performance of the dogs, whose food had become tainted, and who rapidly fell sick.{{sfn|Crane|p=205}} All 22 dogs died during the march. The three men all suffered at times from snow blindness, frostbite and, ultimately, [[scurvy]]. On the return journey, Shackleton had by his own admission "broken down" and could no longer carry out his share of the work.{{sfn|Fiennes|pp=101–02}}

He later denied Scott's claim in ''The Voyage of the Discovery'', that he had been carried on the [[sledge]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=143–44}} He was in a seriously weakened condition; Wilson's diary entry for 14 January reads: "Shackleton has been anything but up to the mark, and today he is decidedly worse, very short winded and coughing constantly, with more serious symptoms that need not be detailed here but which are of no small consequence one hundred and sixty miles from the ship".

On 4 February 1903, the party finally reached the ship. After a medical examination (which proved inconclusive),{{sfn|Preston|p=68}} Scott decided to send Shackleton home on the relief ship ''[[SY Morning|Morning]]'', which had arrived in McMurdo Sound in January 1903. Scott wrote: "He ought not to risk further hardship in his present state of health."{{sfn|Preston|p=68}} There is conjecture that Scott's motives for removing him was resentment of Shackleton's popularity, and that ill-health was used as an excuse to get rid of him.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=114–18}}

Years after the death of Scott, Wilson and Shackleton, [[Albert Armitage]], the expedition's second-in-command, claimed that there had been a falling-out on the southern journey, and that Scott had told the ship's doctor that "if he does not go back sick he will go back in disgrace."{{sfn|Preston|p=68}} There is no corroboration of Armitage's story. Shackleton and Scott stayed on friendly terms, at least until the publication of Scott's account of the southern journey in ''The Voyage of the Discovery''.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=143–44}} Although in public they remained mutually respectful and cordial,{{sfn|Crane|p=310}} according to biographer Roland Huntford, Shackleton's attitude to Scott turned to "smouldering scorn and dislike"; salvage of wounded pride required "a return to the Antarctic and an attempt to outdo Scott".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=143–44}}

After a period of convalescence in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=78–80}} As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he found that he was in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of ''Discovery''.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=119–20}} With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the ''Terra Nova'' for the second ''Discovery'' relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the [[ARA Uruguay|Argentinean corvette ''Uruguay'']], which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded [[Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] under [[Otto Nordenskjold|Nordenskiöld]].{{sfn|Fisher|pp=78–80}} In search of more permanent employment, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the back-door route of the Supplementary List,{{sfn|Huntford|p=123}} but despite the sponsorship of Markham and of the president of the [[Royal Society]], he was not successful.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=78–80}} Instead, he became a journalist, working for the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'', but he found this unsatisfactory.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=124–28}} He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=124–28}} On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman (1868 - 1936)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp123760/emily-mary-nee-dorman-lady-shackleton Emily Mary (née Dorman), Lady Shackleton, by Unknown photographer.] Bromide snapshot print, 1910s. National Portrait Gallery x36032.&lt;/ref&gt;, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Edward]] (15 July 1911 - 22 September 1994), himself an explorer and later a politician&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-shackleton-1450860.html Obituary: Lord Shackleton] The Independent, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1905, Shackleton became a shareholder in a speculative company that aimed to make a fortune transporting Russian troops home from the Far East. Despite his assurances to Emily that "we are practically sure of the contract", nothing came of this scheme.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=97–98}} He also ventured into politics, unsuccessfully standing in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 General Election]] as the [[Liberal Unionist Party]]'s candidate for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]] in opposition to Irish Home Rule.{{efn|name=candidate}}{{sfn|Morrell &amp; Capparell | p=32}} In the meantime he had taken a job with wealthy Clydeside industrialist [[William Beardmore]] (later Lord Invernairn), with a [[roving commission]] which involved interviewing prospective clients and entertaining Beardmore's business friends.{{sfn|Fisher|p=99}} Shackleton by this time was making no secret of his ambition to return to Antarctica at the head of his own expedition.

Beardmore was sufficiently impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support,{{efn|name=Beardmore's support}}{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=106}} but other donations proved hard to come by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09|British Antarctic Expedition]], were published in the Royal Society's newsletter, ''Geographical Journal''.{{sfn|Mill | pp=24, 72–80, 104–115, 150}} The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir [[Philip Lee Brocklehurst]], who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition;{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=108}} author Campbell Mackellar; and [[Guinness]] baron [[Lord Iveagh]], whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship ''Nimrod''.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=130}} On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the [[Royal Victorian Order]], 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28049|page=5447|date=9 August 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Nimrod'' Expedition (1907–09) ==
{{Main|Nimrod Expedition}}
[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nimrod Expedition]] South Pole Party (left to right): [[Frank Wild|Wild]], Shackleton, [[Eric Marshall|Marshall]] and [[Jameson Adams|Adams]]]]

On 1 January 1908, ''[[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod]]'' sailed for the Antarctic from [[Lyttelton Harbour]], New Zealand. Shackleton's original plans had envisaged using the old ''Discovery'' base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=108}} Before leaving England, he had been pressured to give an undertaking to Scott that he would not base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work. Shackleton reluctantly agreed to look for winter quarters at either the [[Bay of Whales|Barrier Inlet]] (which ''Discovery'' had briefly visited in 1902) or [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=110–16}}

To conserve coal, the ship was towed {{convert|1650|mi|km|0}} by the steamer ''Koonya'' to the Antarctic ice, after Shackleton had persuaded the New Zealand government and the Union Steamship Company to share the cost.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=143–44}} In accordance with Shackleton's promise to Scott, the ship headed for the eastern sector of the Great Ice Barrier, arriving there on 21 January 1908. They found that the Barrier Inlet had expanded to form a large bay, in which were hundreds of whales, which led to the immediate christening of the area as the [[Bay of Whales]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=151–53}} It was noted that ice conditions were unstable, precluding the establishment of a safe base there. An extended search for an anchorage at King Edward VII Land proved equally fruitless, so Shackleton was forced to break his undertaking to Scott and set sail for McMurdo Sound, a decision which, according to second officer Arthur Harbord, was "dictated by common sense" in view of the difficulties of ice pressure, coal shortage and the lack of any nearer known base.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=151–53}}

''Nimrod'' arrived at McMurdo Sound on 29 January, but was stopped by ice {{convert|16|mi|km}} north of ''Discovery'''s old base at [[Hut Point]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=157–67}} After considerable weather delays, Shackleton's base was eventually established at [[Cape Royds]], about {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} north of Hut Point. The party was in high spirits, despite the difficult conditions; Shackleton's ability to communicate with each man kept the party happy and focused.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|pp=185–86}}

The "Great Southern Journey",{{sfn|Mills|p=72}} as [[Frank Wild]] called it, began on 29 October 1908. On 9 January 1909, Shackleton and three companions (Wild, [[Eric Marshall]] and [[Jameson Adams]]) reached a new [[Farthest South]] latitude of 88°&amp;nbsp;23'&amp;nbsp;S, a point only {{convert|112|mi|km|0}} from the Pole.{{efn|name=distance from pole}} En route the South Pole party discovered the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (named after Shackleton's patron) {{sfn|Mills|pp=82–86}} and became the first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau.{{sfn|Mills|p=90}} Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: "All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me".{{sfn|Mills|p=108}} They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.

The expedition's other main accomplishments included the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]], and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by [[Edgeworth David]], [[Douglas Mawson]], and [[Alistair Mackay]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=244}} Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, [[#{{sfnRef|Shackleton, ''Heart of the Antarctic''}}|''Heart of the Antarctic'']]. Emily Shackleton later recorded: "The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, as far as I am concerned'".{{sfn|Huntford|p=300}}

In 1910, Shackleton made a series of three recordings describing the expedition using an Edison [[Phonograph]].{{sfn|''My South Polar Expedition''}}

Several mostly intact cases of whisky and brandy left behind in 1909 were recovered in 2010, for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage (and since lost) formula for the particular brands found has been offered for sale with a portion of the proceeds to benefit the [[Antarctic Heritage Trust (New Zealand)|New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust]] which discovered the lost spirits.{{sfn|USA Today, ''century-old whisky''}}{{sfn|AP, ''century-old scotch''}}{{sfn|BBC News, ''Whisky recreated''}}

[[File:Ernest Shackleton Vanity Fair 1909-10-06.jpg|upright|thumb|Shackleton caricatured by KITE for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], 1909]]
On Shackleton's return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming. King Edward VII received him on 10 July and raised him to a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO);{{sfn|Fisher|p=263}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28271|page=5461|date=16 July 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, he was made a [[Knight Bachelor|knight]], becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton.{{sfn|Fisher|p=272}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28321|page=9763|date=24 December 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was honoured by the Royal Geographical Society, who awarded him a Gold Medal; a proposal that the medal be smaller than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on.{{sfn|Fisher|p=251}} All the members of the Nimrod Expedition shore party received silver [[Polar Medal]]s on 23 November, with Shackleton receiving a clasp to his earlier medal.{{sfn|Fisher|p=272}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28311|page=8665|date=23 November 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton was also appointed a Younger Brother of [[Trinity House]], a significant honour for British mariners.{{sfn|Fisher|p=263}}

Besides the official honours, Shackleton's Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing a toast to the explorer at a lunch given in Shackleton's honour by the Royal Societies Club, [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]], a former [[Lord Chancellor]], said: "When one remembers what he had gone through, one does not believe in the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that we have lost all sense of admiration for courage [and] endurance".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=298–99}} The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin ''Evening Telegraph's'' headline read "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman",{{sfn|Huntford|pp=298–99}} while the ''Dublin Express'' spoke of the "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=298–99}} Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; [[Roald Amundsen]] wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary [[John Scott Keltie]], that "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory that can never be surpassed".{{sfn|Fisher|pp=242–43}} [[Fridtjof Nansen]] sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the "unique expedition which has been such a complete success in every respect".{{sfn|Fisher|pp=242–43}} The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, in the form of a grant of £20,000 (2008: £1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations. It is likely that many debts were not pressed and were written off.

=== Biding time ===
In the period immediately after his return, Shackleton engaged in a strenuous schedule of public appearances, lectures and social engagements. He then sought to cash in on his celebrity by making a fortune in the business world.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=284–85}} Among the ventures which he hoped to promote were a tobacco company,{{sfn|Huntford|pp=351–52}} a scheme for selling to collectors postage stamps overprinted "King Edward VII Land" (based on Shackleton's appointment as Antarctic postmaster by the New Zealand authorities),{{sfn|Huntford|p=312}} and the development of a Hungarian mining concession he had acquired near the city of [[Nagybanya]], now part of [[Romania]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=323–26}} None of these enterprises prospered, and his main source of income was his earnings from lecture tours. He still harboured thoughts of returning south, even though in September 1910, having recently moved with his family to [[Sheringham]] in Norfolk, he wrote to Emily: "I am never again going South and I have thought it all out and my place is at home now".{{sfn|Fisher|pp=284–85}} He had been in discussions with Douglas Mawson about a scientific expedition to the Antarctic coast between [[Cape Adare]] and [[Gaussberg]], and had written to the RGS about this in February 1910.{{efn|name=Mawson's expedition}}{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2005|p=298}}

Any future resumption by Shackleton of the quest for the South Pole depended on the results of Scott's [[Terra Nova Expedition]], which left from Cardiff in July 1910. By early 1912, the world was aware that the pole had been conquered, by the Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]]. The fate of Scott's expedition was not then known. Shackleton's mind turned to a project that had been announced, and then abandoned, by the Scottish explorer [[William Speirs Bruce]], for a continental crossing, from a landing in the [[Weddell Sea]], via the South Pole to McMurdo Sound. Bruce, who had failed to acquire financial backing, was happy that Shackleton should adopt his plans,{{sfn|Huntford|p=367}} which were similar to those being followed by the German explorer [[Wilhelm Filchner]]. Filchner had left [[Bremerhaven]] in May 1911; in December 1912, the news arrived from South Georgia that his expedition had failed.{{efn|name=Filchner's expedition}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=367}} The transcontinental journey, in Shackleton's words, was the "one great object of Antarctic journeyings" remaining, now open to him.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South'' | loc=preface, pp. xii–xv}}

=== Preparations ===
Shackleton published details of his new expedition, grandly titled the "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", early in 1914. Two ships would be employed; ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' would carry the main party into the Weddell Sea, aiming for Vahsel Bay from where a team of six, led by Shackleton, would begin the crossing of the continent. Meanwhile, a second ship, the [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']], would take a supporting party under Captain [[Aeneas Mackintosh]] to McMurdo Sound on the opposite side of the continent. This party would then lay supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier as far as the Beardmore Glacier, these depots holding the food and fuel that would enable Shackleton's party to complete their journey of {{convert|1800|mi|km}} across the continent.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South'' | loc=preface, pp. xii–xv}}

Shackleton used his considerable fund-raising skills, and the expedition was financed largely by private donations, although the British government gave £10,000 (about £680,000 in 2008 terms). Scottish [[jute]] magnate [[Sir James Key Caird|Sir James Caird]] gave £24,000, Midlands industrialist [[Frank Dudley Docker]] gave £10,000 and tobacco heiress [[Janet Stancomb-Wills]] gave an undisclosed but reportedly "generous" sum.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=375–77}} Public interest in the expedition was considerable; Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications to join it.{{sfn|Fisher|p=308}} His interviewing and selection methods sometimes seemed eccentric; believing that character and temperament were as important as technical ability,{{sfn|Huntford|p=386}} he asked unconventional questions. Thus physicist Reginald James was asked if he could sing;{{sfn|Fisher|p=312}} others were accepted on sight because Shackleton liked the look of them, or after the briefest of interrogations.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=311–315}} Shackleton also loosened some traditional hierarchies, expecting all men, including the scientists, to take their share of ship's chores. He ultimately selected a [[Personnel of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|crew of 56]], twenty-eight on each ship.{{sfn|Alexander|p=16}}

Despite the outbreak of the First World War on 3 August 1914, ''Endurance'' was directed by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]], to "proceed",{{efn|name=Churchill, Proceed}} and left British waters on 8 August. Shackleton delayed his own departure until 27 September, meeting the ship in [[Buenos Aires]].{{sfn|Fisher|pp=324–25}}

=== Crew ===
While Shackleton led the expedition, Captain F. Worsley commanded the ''Endurance'' and Lieutenant J. Stenhouse the ''Aurora''.

On the Endurance, the second in command was the experienced explorer Frank Wild. The meteorologist was Captain L. Hussey (also an able banjo player). Dr. McIlroy was head of the scientific staff, which included Wordie. [[Alexander Macklin]] was one of two surgeons and also in charge of keeping the 70 dogs healthy. [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included James, Hussey, Greenstreet, a carpenter Henry McNeish, and Clark (the biologist). Of later independent fame was the photographer [[Frank Hurley]].
There was a (male) cat named [[Mrs Chippy]] that belonged to the carpenter Henry McNeish.  Mrs Chippy was shot when the Endurance sank, due to the belief it would not have survived the ordeal that followed.&lt;ref&gt;''Favourite Cat Stories ''by Stella Whitelaw, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''South ''by Sir Ernest Shackleton,  1919&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss of ''Endurance'' ===
''Endurance'' departed from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward [[Ice navigation|navigating in ice]], [[Sea ice#First-year sea ice|first year ice]] was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, ''Endurance'' became frozen fast in an [[drift ice|ice floe]].{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|pp=29–30}} On 24 February, realising that she would be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|p=36}} She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|pp=63–66}}

[[File:Shackletonold.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shackleton after the loss of ''Endurance'']]

Until this point, Shackleton had hoped that the ship, when released from the ice, could work her way back towards Vahsel Bay. On 24 October water began pouring in. After a few days, with the position at 69°&amp;nbsp;5'&amp;nbsp;S, 51°&amp;nbsp;30'&amp;nbsp;W, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship, saying, "She's going down!"; and men, provisions and equipment were transferred to camps on the ice.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|pp=75–76}} On 21 November 1915, the wreck finally slipped beneath the surface.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|p=98}}

For almost two months, Shackleton and his party camped on a large, flat floe, hoping that it would drift towards [[Paulet Island]], approximately {{convert|250|mi|km|0}} away, where it was known that stores were cached.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|p=100}} After failed attempts to march across the ice to this island, Shackleton decided to set up another more permanent camp (Patience Camp) on another floe, and trust to the drift of the ice to take them towards a safe landing.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|p=106}} By 17 March, their ice camp was within {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} of Paulet Island{{sfn|Fisher|p=366}} but, separated by impassable ice, they were unable to reach it. On 9 April, their ice floe broke into two, and Shackleton ordered the crew into the lifeboats, to head for the nearest land.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|pp=121–22}} After five harrowing days at sea, the exhausted men landed their three lifeboats at [[Elephant Island]], {{convert|346|mi}} from where the Endurance sank.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South'' (film)}} This was the first time they had stood on solid ground for 497 days.{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South''|p=143}} Shackleton's concern for his men was such that he gave his mittens to photographer [[Frank Hurley]], who had lost his during the boat journey. Shackleton suffered frostbitten fingers as a result.{{sfn|Perkins|p=36}}

=== Open-boat journey ===
{{Main|Voyage of the James Caird}}
[[File:LaunchingTheJamesCaird2.jpg|thumb|Launching the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' from the shore of [[Elephant Island]], 24 April 1916]]

[[Elephant Island]] was an inhospitable place, far from any shipping routes; rescue by means of chance discovery was very unlikely. Consequently, Shackleton decided to risk an open-boat journey to the 720-nautical-mile-distant [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] whaling stations, where he knew help was available.{{sfn|Worsley|pp=95–99}} The strongest of the tiny {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} lifeboats, christened ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' after the expedition's chief sponsor, was chosen for the trip.{{sfn|Worsley|pp=95–99}} Ship's carpenter [[Harry McNish]] made various improvements, including raising the sides, strengthening the keel, building a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, and sealing the work with oil paint and seal blood.{{sfn|Worsley|pp=95–99}} Shackleton chose five companions for the journey: [[Frank Worsley]], ''Endurance'''s captain, who would be responsible for navigation; [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]], who had "begged to go"; two strong sailors in [[John Vincent (sailor)|John Vincent]] and [[Timothy McCarthy (sailor)|Timothy McCarthy]], and finally the carpenter McNish.{{sfn|Worsley|pp=95–99}} Shackleton had clashed with McNish during the time when the party was stranded on the ice, but, while he did not forgive the carpenter's earlier insubordination, Shackleton recognised his value for this particular job.{{efn|name=McNish's 'mutiny'}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=475}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=656}}

Shackleton refused to pack supplies for more than four weeks, knowing that if they did not reach South Georgia within that time, the boat and its crew would be lost.{{sfn|Alexander|p=137}} The ''James Caird'' was launched on 24 April 1916; during the next fifteen days, it sailed through the waters of the southern ocean, at the mercy of the stormy seas, in constant peril of capsizing. On 8 May, thanks to Worsley's navigational skills, the cliffs of South Georgia came into sight, but hurricane-force winds prevented the possibility of landing. The party was forced to ride out the storm offshore, in constant danger of being dashed against the rocks. They later learned that the same hurricane had sunk a 500-ton steamer bound for South Georgia from Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Worsley|p=162}} On the following day, they were able, finally, to land on the unoccupied southern shore. After a period of rest and recuperation, rather than risk putting to sea again to reach the whaling stations on the northern coast, Shackleton decided to attempt a land crossing of the island. Although it is likely that Norwegian whalers had previously crossed at other points on ski, no one had attempted this particular route before.{{sfn|Huntford|p=574}} For their journey, the survivors were only equipped with boots they had pushed screws into to act as climbing boots, a carpenter's [[adze]], and 50 feet of rope. Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled {{convert|32|mi|km}}{{sfn|Shackleton, ''South'' (film)}} with Worsley and Crean over extremely dangerous mountainous terrain for 36 hours to reach the whaling station at [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] on 20 May.{{sfn|Worsley|pp=211–12}}

The next successful crossing of South Georgia was in October 1955, by the British explorer [[Duncan Carse]], who travelled much of the same route as Shackleton's party. In tribute to their achievement, he wrote: "I do not know how they did it, except that they had to — three men of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration with 50&amp;nbsp;feet of rope between them — and a carpenter's [[adze]]".{{sfn|Fisher|p=386}}

=== Rescue ===
[[File:AllSafeAllWell.jpg|thumb|"All Safe, All Well", allegedly depicting Shackleton's return to Elephant Island, August 1916. A photograph of the departure of the ''James Caird'' in April was doctored by photographer [[Frank Hurley]] to create this image.{{sfn|Alexander|pp=202–03}}]]

Shackleton immediately sent a boat to pick up the three men from the other side of South Georgia while he set to work to organise the rescue of the Elephant Island men. His first three attempts were foiled by sea ice, which blocked the approaches to the island. He appealed to the [[Chile]]an government, which offered the use of [[Luis Pardo#Rescue of the Shackleton expedition|''Yelcho'']], a small seagoing [[tugboat|tug]] from its navy. ''Yelcho'', commanded by Captain [[Luis Pardo]], and the British whaler ''[[List of shipwrecks in 1929#12 April|SS Southern Sky]]'' reached [[Elephant Island]] on 30 August 1916, at which point the men had been isolated there for four and a half months, and Shackleton quickly evacuated all 22 men.{{sfn|Alexander|pp=166–69, 182–85}} The ''Yelcho'' took the crew first to [[Punta Arenas]] and after some days to [[Valparaiso]] in Chile where crowds warmly welcomed them back to civilisation.

There remained the men of the [[Ross Sea Party]], who were stranded at [[Cape Evans]] in McMurdo Sound, after ''Aurora'' had been blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. The ship, after a drift of many months, had returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join ''Aurora'', and sailed with her to the rescue of the Ross Sea party. This group, despite many hardships, had carried out its depot-laying mission to the full, but three lives had been lost, including that of its commander, [[Aeneas Mackintosh]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=634–41}}

== First World War ==
When Shackleton returned to England in May 1917, Europe was in the midst of the [[First World War]]. Suffering from a heart condition, made worse by the fatigue of his arduous journeys, and too old to be conscripted, he nevertheless volunteered for the army.  Repeatedly requesting posting to the front in France,{{sfn|Huntford|p=649}} he was by now drinking heavily.{{sfn|Alexander|p=192}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=653}} In October 1917, he was sent to [[Buenos Aires]] to boost British propaganda in South America. Unqualified as a diplomat, he was unsuccessful in persuading Argentina and Chile to enter the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=658–59}} He returned home in April 1918.

Shackleton was then briefly involved in a mission to [[Spitzbergen]] to establish a British presence there under guise of a mining operation.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=661–63}} On the way he was taken ill in [[Tromsø]], possibly with a heart attack.

Shackleton returned to the [[lecture circuit]] and published his own account of the ''Endurance'' expedition, ''South'', in December 1919.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=439–40}} In 1920, tired of the lecture circuit, Shackleton began to consider the possibility of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the [[Beaufort Sea]] area of the [[Arctic]], a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=441–46}} With funds supplied by former schoolfriend [[John Quiller Rowett]], he acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named ''Foca I'' which he renamed ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=441–46}}{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2006|p=892}} The plan changed; the destination became the Antarctic, and the project was defined by Shackleton as an "oceanographic and sub-antarctic expedition".{{sfn|Fisher|pp=441–46}} The goals of the venture were imprecise, but a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and investigation of some "lost" sub-Antarctic islands, such as [[Tuanaki]], were mentioned as objectives.{{sfn|Huntford|p=684}}{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review'', February 1922}}

Rowett agreed to finance the entire expedition, which became known as the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]].{{sfn|Huntford|p=684}} On 16 September 1921, Shackleton recorded a farewell address on a [[sound-on-film]] system created by [[Harry Grindell Matthews]], who claimed it was the first "talking picture" ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.harrygrindellmatthews.com/earlywireless.asp|title=Experiments with early wireless|work=The Secret Life of Harry Grindell Matthews|accessdate=9 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122053357/http://harrygrindellmatthews.com/earlywireless.asp|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition left England on 24 September 1921.

Although some of his former crew members had not received all their pay from the ''Endurance'' expedition, many of them signed on with their former "Boss".{{sfn|Huntford|p=684}} When the party arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Shackleton suffered a suspected heart attack.{{sfn|Huntford|p=687}} He refused a proper medical examination, so ''Quest'' continued south, and on 4 January 1922, arrived at [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]].

[[File:Shackleton Grave SouthGeorgia.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Ernest Shackleton's grave in [[Grytviken]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]]]

In the early hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, [[Alexander Macklin]],{{sfn|Fisher|pp=476–78}} to his cabin, complaining of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to "lead a more regular life", to which Shackleton answered: "You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?" "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=476–78}}

Macklin, who conducted the postmortem, concluded that the cause of death was [[atheroma]] of the coronary arteries exacerbated by "overstrain during a period of debility".{{sfn|Alexander|p=193}} [[Leonard Hussey]], a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition, offered to accompany the body back to Britain; while he was in [[Montevideo]] en route to England, a message was received from Emily Shackleton asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia. Hussey returned to South Georgia with the body on the steamer [[SS Woodville|''Woodville'']], and on 5 March 1922, Shackleton was buried in the [[Grytviken]] cemetery, South Georgia, after a short service in the [[Norwegian Lutheran Church (Grytviken, South Georgia)|Lutheran church]],{{sfn|Fisher|pp=481–83}} with [[Edward Binnie]] officiating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45572568 Sir Ernest Shackleton: Funeral Ceremony In South Georgia: Many Wreaths On Coffin], in ''[[the Barrier Miner]]'' (archived in the [[NLA Trove]]); published 5 May 1922; retrieved 25 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shackletonslastv00wilduoft/shackletonslastv00wilduoft_djvu.txt Shackleton's Last Voyage: the Story of the Quest], by [[Frank Wild]], published 1923 by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] (via [[archive.org]])&lt;/ref&gt; Macklin wrote in his diary: "I think this is as 'the Boss' would have had it himself, standing lonely in an island far from civilisation, surrounded by stormy tempestuous seas, &amp; in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits."

On 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's grave site in Grytviken. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads "Frank Wild 1873–1939, Shackleton's right-hand man."{{sfn|Telegraph, ''Forgotten hero''}}

Study of diaries kept by [[Eric Marshall]], medical officer to the 1907{{ndash}}09 expedition, suggests that Shackleton suffered from an [[atrial septal defect]] ("hole in the heart"), a [[congenital heart defect]], which may have been a cause of his health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polar-explorer-ernest-shackleton-may-have-had-hole-in-heart-doctors-say |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton may have had hole in his heart, doctors say |first=Hannah |last=Ellis-Petersen |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=13 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Early ===
Before the return of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, there was a memorial service held for him with full military honours at Holy Trinity Church, [[Montevideo]], and on 2 March a service was held at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, at which the King and other members of the royal family were represented.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=481–83}} Within a year the first biography, [[#{{sfnRef|Mill}}|''The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton'']], by [[Hugh Robert Mill]], was published. This book, as well as being a tribute to the explorer, was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton died some £40,000 in debt (2011: £1.6 million).{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=692}} A further initiative was the establishment of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist the education of his children and the support of his mother.{{sfn|Fisher|p=485}}

[[File:Shackleton.jpg|thumb|upright|1932 statue of Sir Ernest Shackleton outside the London headquarters of the [[Royal Geographical Society]]]]

During the ensuing decades Shackleton's status as a polar hero was generally outshone by that of Captain Scott, whose polar party had by 1925 been commemorated on more than 30 monuments in Britain alone, including stained glass windows, statues, busts and memorial tablets.{{sfn|Jones|pp=295–96}} A statue of Shackleton designed by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] was unveiled at the Royal Geographical Society's [[Kensington]] headquarters in 1932,{{sfn|Fisher|pp=486–87}} but public memorials to Shackleton were relatively few. Likewise, the printed word saw much more attention given to Scott–a forty-page booklet on Shackleton, published in 1943 by OUP as part of a "Great Exploits" series, is described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as "a lone example of a popular literary treatment of Shackleton in a sea of similar treatments of Scott". This disparity continued into the 1950s.{{sfn|Barczewski|p=209}}

=== Later ===

In 1959 Alfred Lansing's [[#{{sfnRef|Lansing}}|''Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage'']] was published. This was the first of a number of books about Shackleton that began to appear, showing him in a highly positive light. At the same time, attitudes towards Scott were gradually changing as a more critical note was sounded in the literature, culminating in [[Roland Huntford]]'s 1979 treatment of him in his dual biography ''Scott and Amundsen'', described by Barczewski as a "devastating attack".{{sfn|Barczewski|p=282}} This negative picture of Scott became accepted as the popular truth{{sfn|Fiennes|p=432}} as the kind of heroism that Scott represented fell victim to the cultural shifts of the late twentieth century.{{sfn|Barczewski|p=282}} Within a few years he was thoroughly overtaken in public esteem by Shackleton, whose popularity surged while that of his erstwhile rival declined. In 2002, in a BBC poll conducted to determine the "100 Greatest Britons", Shackleton was ranked 11th while Scott was down in 54th place.{{sfn|Barczewski|p=283}}

In 2001 Margaret Morrell and Stephanie Capparell presented Shackleton as a model for corporate leadership in their book [[#{{sfnRef|Morrell &amp; Capparell}}|''Shackleton's Way: Leadership Lessons from the Great Antarctic Explorer'']]. They wrote: "Shackleton resonates with executives in today's business world. His people-centred approach to leadership can be a guide to anyone in a position of authority".{{sfn|Barczewski|p=292}} Other management writers were soon following this lead, using Shackleton as an exemplar for bringing order from chaos. The Centre for Leadership Studies at the [[University of Exeter]] (United Kingdom) offers a course on Shackleton, who also features in the management education programmes of several American universities.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=294–95}} In [[Boston]] a "Shackleton School" was set up on "[[Outward Bound]]" principles, with the motto "The Journey is Everything".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=294–95}} Shackleton has also been cited as a model leader by the [[US Navy]], and in a textbook on Congressional leadership, Peter L Steinke calls Shackleton the archetype of the "nonanxious leader" whose "calm, reflective demeanor becomes the antibiotic warning of the toxicity of reactive behaviour".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=294–95}} In 2001, the Athy Heritage Centre-Museum, Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, established the Ernest Shackleton Autumn School, which is held annually, to honour the memory of Ernest Shackleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Ernest Shackleton|url=http://www.athyheritagecentre-museum.ie/shackleton/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411182101/http://www.athyheritagecentre-museum.ie/shackleton/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 April 2009|publisher=Athy Heritage Centre-Museum|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Three Polar Stars, 1913 (8889621500).jpg|thumb|[[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], Shackleton and [[Robert Peary|Peary]] in 1913]]
Shackleton's death marked the end of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], a period of discovery characterised by journeys of geographical and scientific exploration in a largely unknown continent without any of the benefits of modern travel methods or radio communication. In the preface to his 1922 book ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'', [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], one of Scott's team on the Terra Nova Expedition, wrote: "For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time".{{sfn|Wheeler|p=187}}

In January 2013, a joint British-Australian team set out to duplicate Shackleton's 1916 trip across the Southern Ocean.

[[File:Gerard de Jode 1593 Map Southern hemisphere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Southern hemisphere. The maps were published in an atlas by Cornelis de Jode ''[[Speculum Orbis Terrae]]'']]

'''Gerard de Jode''' (1509–1591) was a [[Netherlandish]] [[cartographer]], [[engraver]] and [[publisher]] who lived and worked in [[Antwerp]] during the 16th century. He was born in [[Nijmegen]] and died in [[Antwerp]]. In 1547 he was admitted to the [[Guild of St. Luke]], and began his work as a publisher/printseller. He often printed the works of other cartographers including [[Giacomo Gastaldi|Gastaldi's]] map of the world in 1555, [[Jacob van Deventer (cartographer)|Jacob van Deventer's]] map of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] in 1558, [[Ortelius]]' eight sheet map of the world in 1564, and maps by [[Bartholomeus Musinus]] and [[Fernando Alvares Seco]].

His most outstanding work is a two volume atlas ''[[Speculum Orbis Terrarum]]'' published in 1578.  It was aimed at competing with another atlas, [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]] by Ortelius, published eight years earlier in 1570.  The competing atlas had become so popular by the time he finally published his own atlas however, that his version never sold well, despite his outstanding reputation.  Only about a dozen examples have survived.&lt;ref name=sanders&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sanderusmaps.com/antique-maps/world-and-polar-regions/world-_20635.cfm|title= Antique map of World by de Jode|accessdate=2009-03-09 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerard de Jode made plans for another enlarged edition, which was uncompleted at his death in 1591.  His son [[Cornelis de Jode]] took over and published the [[Speculum Orbis Terrae]] in 1593.  This never sold well either.  Scholars consider many of de Jode's maps to be superior to those of Ortelius, both in detail and style.&lt;ref name=sanders/&gt;

In constructing his world map, &lt;small&gt;''HEMISPHERIUM AB ÆQUINOCTIALI LINEA, AD CIRCULUM POLI ANTARCTICI''&lt;/small&gt;, published in 1593, Gerard de Jode was strongly influenced by [[Guillaume Postel]]’s 1581 polar planisphère, ''Polo aptata Nova Charta Universi''.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney W. Shirley, ''The Mapping of the World: Early Printed World Maps 1472-1700,'' Early Riverside, Conn., World Press, 2001, pp166-7, pl.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerard de Jode was probably the maker of a globe made in Antwerp that also owes much to the cosmographic ideas of Guillaume Postel.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris, Département des Cartes et Plans, Rés. Ge AA 1255. Described in Marcel Destombes, “An Antwerp unicum: an unpublished terrestrial globe of the 16th century in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris”, in Gunter Schilder, Peter van der Krogt, Steven de Clercq (eds.), ''Marcel Destombes, 1905-1983: Selected Contributions to the History of Cartography and Scientific Instruments,'' Utrecht and Paris, HES Publishers and A.G. Nizet, 1987, ''HES Studies in the History of Cartography and Scientific Instruments,'' Vol.3, pp.337-343, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Speculum Orbis Terrarum'' was once the object of an attempted theft from the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]], by rare map thief E. Forbes Smiley III.  Smiley was caught and arrested after a library staff member found his [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] on the floor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">[[Image:ClipperRoute.png|thumb|right|The [[clipper route]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], by way of the great capes]]
In [[sailing]], the '''great capes''' are three major [[cape (geography)|capes]] of the [[continent]]s in the [[Southern Ocean]] — [[Africa]]'s [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[Australia]]'s [[Cape Leeuwin]], and [[South America]]'s [[Cape Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/circumna/ci_42cap.htm ''The Circumnavigators''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510155033/http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/circumna/ci_42cap.htm |date=2006-05-10 }}, by Don Holm; '' Around the Three Capes''.  Prentice-Hall, NY, 1974.  {{ISBN|0-13-134452-8}}  Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sailing ==
The traditional [[clipper route]] followed the winds of the [[roaring forties]] south of the great capes.  Due to the significant hazards they presented to shipping, the great capes became significant landmarks in ocean voyaging.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way'', Francis Chichester; page 78.  Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1966.  {{ISBN|0-340-00191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The great capes became common points of reference, though other nearby capes ([[#Five southernmost capes|next section]]) may have been more southern or shared in notability.

Today, the great capes feature prominently in ocean [[yacht racing]], with many races and individual sailors following the clipper route.  A [[circumnavigation]] via the great capes is considered to be a noteworthy achievement.&lt;ref name=SlocumSociety&gt;[http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org/awards.htm ''Slocum Awards: Golden Circle Award''], from the Joshua Slocum Society International.  Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sailor [[Joshua Slocum]] completed the first solo circumnavigation of the world in 1895–98, and the Joshua Slocum Society International presented its Level 3 Golden Circle Award to sailors who solo circumnavigated passing the great capes.&lt;ref name=SlocumSociety/&gt;

In his book ''The Long Way'', [[Bernard Moitessier]] tries to express the significance to a sailor of the great capes:

:''A sailor's geography is not always that of the cartographer, for whom a cape is a cape, with a latitude and longitude.  For the sailor, a great cape is both a very simple and an extremely complicated whole of rocks, currents, breaking seas and huge waves, fair winds and gales, joys and fears, fatigue, dreams, painful hands, empty stomachs, wonderful moments, and suffering at times.''

:''A great cape, for us, can't be expressed in longitude and latitude alone.  A great cape has a soul, with very soft, very violent shadows and colours.  A soul as smooth as a child's, as hard as a criminal's.  And that is why we go.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Way'', by Bernard Moitessier; page 141.  Sheridan House, 1995.  {{ISBN|0-924486-84-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five southernmost capes ==
Other southern capes mark significant points of passage through the southern oceans. The '''five southernmost capes''' refer to the five geographically southern [[mainland]] (or large [[island]]) points on the [[earth]].&lt;ref name=SlocumSociety/&gt;

Sailors [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the world have used these five southernmost capes as goals on their route.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5979">'''Hugh Murray''' [[FRSE]] FRGS (1779–1846) was a Scottish geographer and author. He is often referred to as '''Hew Murray'''.

==Life==
He was the younger son of [[Matthew Murray (minister)|Rev Matthew Murray]] [[FRSE]] (1735–1791), minister of [[North Berwick]], and his wife, Anne Hill (d.1803) daughter of Ref John Hill, of [[St. Andrews]], and sister of Henry David Hill, professor at St. Andrews,&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Murray, Hugh|volume=39|first=Gerald le Grys |last=Norgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[George Hill (minister)|Rev George Hill]]. 

Murray entered the Edinburgh excise office as a clerk. 

On 22 January 1816 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Thomas Brown (minister)|Rev Thomas Brown]], [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] and [[John Playfair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he was living at 24 [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1816&lt;/ref&gt;


He was for a time editor of the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'', and was a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of London. His connection with [[Archibald Constable]]'s ''Edinburgh Gazetteer'' caused him to figure in the Tory squib, written by [[James Hogg]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hogg|author2=John Gibson Lockhart|author3=John Wilson|title=Translation from an Ancient Chaldee Manuscript, Supposed to Have Been Written by Daniel. (Proof-sheets of the Satire by James Hogg, John G. Lockhart and John Wilson, which Appeared in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine for Oct. 1817).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCoTMwEACAAJ|accessdate=27 September 2013|year=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt; called ''Translation from an Ancient Chaldee MS.'', which appeared in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' for October 1817.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Murray died after a short illness, while on a visit to London, in Wardrobe Place, [[Doctors' Commons]], on 4 March 1846.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==

His grandfather Rev George Murray (d. 1757), was minister of North Berwick, as was his elder brother, George (1772–1822), from 1795 till his death.

==Works==
Murray published ''The Swiss Emigrants'', a tale (anon.), in 1804; two philosophical treatises (''The Morality of Fiction'', 1805, and ''Enquiries respecting the Character of Nations'', 1808); and another romance, ''Corasmin, or the Minister'', in 1814.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

===''Encyclopædia of Geography''===
[[File:Hanno voyage.jpg|thumb|Voyage of [[Hanno the Navigator]], from the ''Encyclopedia of Geography'']]
Murray's major work was the ''Encyclopædia of Geography, a Description of the Earth, physical, statistical, civil, and political'' (London, 1834). He wrote the geographical part; the other sections were astronomy ([[William Wallace (mathematician)|William Wallace]]), botany ([[William Jackson Hooker]]), geology ([[Robert Jameson]]) and zoology ([[William John Swainson|William Swainson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Murray|author2=William Wallace|author3=Robert Jameson|author4=Sir William Jackson Hooker|author5=William Swainson|author6=Thomas Gamaliel Bradford|title=The Encyclopædia of Geography: Comprising a Complete Description of the Earth, Physical, Statistical, Civil, and Political ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXE9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 September 2013|year=1840|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supplement was published in 1843. The work contained 82 maps and over a thousand woodcuts. It was well received, and an American edition (1843) in three volumes was edited by [[Thomas Gamaliel Bradford]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

===Books===
Murray's other main publications included:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''A Catechism of Geography'', 4th ed. enlarged, Edinb. 1833, 7th ed. 1842. 
* ''Travels of Marco Polo'', amended and enlarged, with notes, 1844, 1845.&lt;ref name="Murray1845"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Murray|title=The Travels of Marco Polo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SypYS7GO6UEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1845|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death were published:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''The African Continent: a Narrative of Discovery and Invention … with an Account of recent exploring expeditions by J. M. Wilson'', 1853.
* ''Pictorial History of the United States of America to the close of Pres. Taylor's Admin. … with Additions and Corrections by H. C. Watson'', illustrated, Boston, Massachusetts, 1861.

===Other works===
To the ''Transactions'' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Murray contributed, among other papers, one, in 1818, ''On the Ancient Geography of Central and Eastern Asia, with Illustrations derived from Recent Discoveries in the North of India''. In 1817 he enlarged and completed [[John Leyden]]'s ''Historical Account of Discoveries and Travels in Africa''.’ Similar works by him on Asia (3 vols. Edinburgh, 1820) and North America (London, 1829) followed.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Murray also contributed to the press, and in the ''[[Edinburgh Cabinet Library]]'' there appeared compilations by him on the history or geography of: the ''Polar Seas'' (1830), ''British India'' (1832), ''China'' (1836), ''British America'' (1839), ''Africa'' (1830), and ''The United States'' (1844). Some of these volumes had contributions on natural history, by Robert Jameson, Thomas Stewart Traill, [[James Nicol]], and others.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:LR''' is the entry for [[Liberia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Liberia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[counties of Liberia|15 counties]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

This page lists the known [[war correspondent]]s, [[war photographer]]s, [[war artists]], and war cinematographers who were active during the [[First Balkan War|First]] and [[Second Balkan War]]s.

The [[First Balkan War]] lasted from October 1912 to May 1913, and comprised actions of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]) against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Montenegro declared war on 8 October and Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece followed suit on 17 October. The war concluded with signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] broke out when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on 29 June 1913. The war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] by the three powers on 10 August 1913.

An estimated 200–300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans in November 1912.&lt;ref&gt;"Correspondants de guerre", ''Le Petit Journal Illustré'' (Paris), 3 novembre 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting on the war from Greece ==

The official censorship bureau was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/greekstriumphan00trap Captain Albert Henry William Trappman ''The Greeks Triumpant'' (London: Forster Groom, 1915), p. 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; Each journalist had to make an application to proceed to the front, and enclose a photograph, together with a certificate from their country’s Ministry in Athens. The Greek Government then issued the journalist an identity card which identified the paper he or she represented, their photograph, and a copy of their signature.  The journalist was given a spade-shaped blue-and-white badge the size of a small plate to pin on their chest, on which the letters "ΕΦ" were worked, being the initial letters of the Greek word for "Newspaper" (Εφημερίδα).&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/greekstriumphan00trap Captain Albert Henry William Trappman ''The Greeks Triumpant'' (London: Forster Groom, 1915), p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the [[Battle of Sarantaporo]], journalists were allowed to proceed to the Epirus front.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

== Reporting on the war from Bulgaria ==

Following the outbreak of hostilities in 1912, almost 150 foreign correspondents rushed to Bulgaria, which was soon identified as the center of all major military developments.&lt;ref name="Eugene Michail 2011 p. 16"&gt;Eugene Michail. ''The British and the Balkans: Forming Images of Foreign Lands, 1900-1950'' (London: A&amp;C Black, 2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian government was successful in identifying and controlling the journalists. The authorities required each journalist to carry a red identification card that included his or her photograph and signature, to wear a red [[brassard]] that had the letters "BK" and a number, and to carry a document informing the various persons who the journalist was and what the Army Headquarters would allow them to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/innerhistoryofba00rankuoft Reginald Rankin. ''The Inner History of the Balkan War'' (London: Constable &amp; Co., 1914), p. 52.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting on the war from Serbia ==

Forty-five journalists from all around the world assembled in Belgrade to cover the First Balkan War. Foreign journalists, unless cleared by the General Staff, were not permitted in forward positions for the duration of hostilities.&lt;ref name="Mark Cornwall 2016 p. 103"&gt;Mark Cornwall, John Paul Newman (Eds.). Sacrifice and Rebirth: The Legacy of the Last Habsburg War (New York: Berghahn Books, 2016), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motion pictures and the Balkan Wars ==

The First Balkan War provided the most extensive testing ground before the First World War for the new technology of large-scale filming, with more than 20 camera operators travelling to the region.&lt;ref name="Eugene Michail 2011 p. 16"/&gt;

| '''Bogdanović''', Dyordye Dyoka
| Serbian
| B.W.II
| War cinematographer
| Shot footage on the Serbian front in July 1913. 
| Born 1860, Serbia. He set up Belgrade’s first movie theatres in 1905. The experience of the First First Balkan War led him to the idea of re-enacting Serbian victories for the camera. With the outbreak of the Second Balkan War, he was able to take real footage at the front, with which he made a number of short documentaries and newsreels. Bogdanović's newsreels from that conflict rank among the earliest cinematic recordings showing soldiers in action in real war situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/08/a-pioneer-of-cinematic-war-reporting-dyordye-dyoka-bogdanovic/ Guest blog by Felix Schürmann, Deutsches Filminstitut and Aleksandar Saša Erdeljanovic, Jugoslovenska Kinoteka.

''[[Mock the Week]]'' is a satirical panel show that airs on [[BBC Two]]. The first episode was broadcast on 5 June 2005. As of 5 October 2018, 158 regular episodes and 28 clip shows (eleven of which were Christmas/New Year specials) have been aired across seventeen series; 186 episodes in total (not including the 2011 [[Comic Relief]] special or "''Mock the Week Looks Back At...''").

All episodes are approximately 30 minutes long. The original lineup was [[Dara Ó Briain]] as host, with [[Hugh Dennis]], [[Frankie Boyle]] and one guest panellist on one side, and [[Rory Bremner]] and two guest panellists on the other. Bremner left after series 2 and was replaced by [[Andy Parsons]], and [[Russell Howard]] became a regular panellist the following series. Boyle left after series 7 and was replaced by a series of guests until [[Chris Addison]] took his seat permanently in the second half of series 10. Howard was absent for the last episodes of series 9 and first half of series 10 due to other filming commitments, and was confirmed to have left the panel in August 2011. Addison was not present for the second half of series 12 due to other commitments, and subsequently did not return for series 13, with his seat once again becoming a guest slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mock_the_week/special/series_13/|title=Series 13 - Coming Soon - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Parsons announced he was quitting after ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2015/10/19/23424/andy_parsons_quits_mock_the_week |title=Andy Parsons quits Mock The Week|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |publisher=chortle.co.uk|date=19 October 2015 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scores==
&lt;!-- Up to date as of 5 October 2018 --&gt;
Despite not being a serious competition, points are awarded at the end of each round and a winner is announced at the conclusion of each episode. Below is the number of series and episode wins by each of the regular panellists. As [[Andy Parsons]] took over from [[Rory Bremner]], both of their scores are combined and shown individually. Despite [[Chris Addison]], [[Frankie Boyle]] and [[Russell Howard]] all being regulars at certain times they are not listed in the headers, instead their wins are combined with the panellist who was seen as their captain during their tenures.
{{Panel game scores |no1 = 1 |no2 = 3 | bg1 = fdd | bg2 = dfd

| Team 1 Header 1 = Hugh
| Team 2 Header 1 = Rory
| Team 2 Header 2 = Andy
| Team 2 Header 3 = Guests

&lt;!-- Series Wins --&gt;
| sDraw  = 1
| sTeam1 = 6
| sTeam2 = 10

| sTeam2.1 = 0
| sTeam2.2 = 7

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1917">{{Politics of Martinique}}
[[Martinique]] is not a separate territory but a region of [[France]]. France has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.

For further details see the article: ''[[Politics of France]]''.

==The parties==
&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''.--&gt;

Most of the [[List of political parties in France|French political parties]] are active in Martinique.

In addition there are a number of regional parties:

* [[Martinican Independence Movement]] (''Mouvement Indépendantiste Martiniquais'', MIM)
* [[Martinican Progressive Party]] (''Parti Progressiste Martiniquais'', PPM)
* [[Build the Martinique Country]] (''Batir le Pays Martinique'')
* [[Martinican Communist Party]] (''Parti Communiste Martiniquais'', PCM) close to [[French Communist Party|PCF]]

===Local factions of French parties===

* Socialist Federation of Martinique (''Fédération socialiste de Martinique'', FSM) close to [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]
* Worker's Combat (''Combat Ouvrier'', CO) close to [[Workers' Struggle]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8445">The '''Maya Golden Landscape''' is an area in [[Belize]] of approximately 275,000 hectares consisting of protected areas, agriculture, private lands and many small communities that is under the management of the Ya'axché Conservation Trust in Toledo District.[http://www.yaaxche.org/ Ya'axché Conservation Trust]The Landscape area encompasses the [[Bladen Nature Reserve]],Colombia River Forest Reserve, [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]],Deep River Forest River Reserve,[[Port Honduras Marine Reserve]], along with commercial and subsistence farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Golden Landscape|url=http://whitleyaward.org/winners/conservation-maya-golden-landscape-belize/|website=whitleyaward.org|publisher=Whitley Fund for Nature|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of the area is dominated with various types of broadleaf forests which varies with topography, soil type and the disturbance history (which are disturbances caused by hurricanes or agriculture). One disturbance that affect the area, as well, is fires caused by agricultural farming due to the slash and burn practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Golden Landscape|url=http://www.yaaxche.org/index.php?page=where|website=Ya'axché Conservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Initiated by a group of local Mayan leaders in 1997, the Maya Golden Landscape was then strengthened by the support of [[Fauna and Flora International]]. The Ya’axché Conservation Trust has been directing this corridor along with the assistance of the management of the individual protected arreas within the Maya Golden Landscape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fuhs|first1=Ginny|title=Conserving the Maya Golden Landscape|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/closerlook/conserving-the-maya-golden-landscape/|website=fauna-flora.org|publisher=Fauna and Flora International}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Topography ==
Encompassing four terrestrial protected areas, the Maya Golden Landscape most evident topographical feature is th Maya Mountains that recurr along the Columbia Forest Reserve, [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]],Deep River Forest River Reserve and Bladen Nature Reserves. Other topographical features includes karst limestone hills, caves, sinkholes and draining basins at the base of the Maya Mountains which feed surrounding water bodies and watersheds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Paul|last2=Walker|first2=Zoe|title=Bladen Nature Reserve Management Plan|journal=Bladen Nature Reserve Management Plan|volume=Volume 1|page=10|url=http://library.bfreebz.org/Protected%20Areas/Bladen%20Nature%20Reserve/Bladen%20Nature%20Reserve%20Management%20Plan%202007-2012%20Volume%20I%20Final%20Draft%2C%202006.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Habitats ==
The terrestrial component of the Maya Golden Landscape comprises habitats of spectacular diversity and variety.The [[karst]] limestone hills of the Maya Mountains down to the Caribbean Sea are evidence of possible stream action wwithn the hills. Habitats to be encountered in the terrestrial component of the landscape includes
tropical rainforests, pine savannas, coastal wetlands and mangrove forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Adam|title=River to Reef – exploring the Maya Golden Landscape in Belize|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/river-to-reef-exploring-the-maya-golden-landscape-in-belize/|website=fauna-flora.org|publisher=Fauna and Flora International|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Marine component of this landscape is most recognizable for its protected barrier reefs. Recognised under the Meso-American Barrier Reef System, the Barrier Reef is a keystone agent in maintaining and protecting the marine environment for endangered marine species. 

== Disturbance History ==
=== Fires and Hurricanes ===
The first fires documented are from the period from the years 1998 to 2001. The fires are usually ignited during the dry season, which is generally from March to May, as means of preparation for crops and may often escape into surrounding farms and nearby forests, especially if the season and conditions adequate. The areas damaged by this fires appears insignificant in the story map; however, they do matter. According to the statistics 550.521 hectares were affected by the fires in 1998, 453.43 hectares in 1999, 388.26 hectares in 2000 and 6.39 hectares in 2001  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya Golden Landscape|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=4ecf892faeae475087d1d4f12%0925a8a7c|website=www.arcgis.com|publisher=ArcGIS|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During the period of 2002-2007, approximately 11,907 hectares of forest as damaged by fire. A major contributor to the spike in fire damage was [[Hurricane Iris]] which passed directly through the area in October 2001 leaving dead vegetation in its path. This dead vegetation dried out during the dry season and covered the forest floor. This dried dead vegetation served as fuel for the fires in 2002, which occurred next to a large savanna area, and 2003, in the hills behind Golden Stream. Other fires areas that burnt in 2003 burnt again in 2005, but the burnt area extended beyond the boundary of 2003 fire scar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya Golden Landscape|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=4ecf892faeae475087d1d4f12%0925a8a7c|website=www.arcgis.com|publisher=ArcGIS|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The fires from the period of the years 2008-2015 damaged an estimated 5078 hectares of forest. In 2008 significant large fire scars were detected. This fire scars were in the same area which was affected by fires in 2003 and 2005, but this time the fire extended further beyond these previous fire scar boundaries and further into the forest. There were also fires that burnt the karstic ridges west of Golden Stream and Medina Bank which had already been burnt by fires in 2003; however, this fires didn’t extend beyond the 2003 fire scars areas. In 2013, numerous fire scars were detected in the severe dry season of that year. Many large fires were detected to had escaped form agricultural areas. Some areas that had been previously burnt were re-burnt. A large fire scar was present on the map and it seemed that it probably escaped from an isolated farm in the forest waste of Indian Creek. Another fire escaped from the South-East of Tambram. The fires that occurred in 2013 show that much more of the forest/agricultural area is susceptible to burning in very severe dry seasons, compared with an average or mild dry season  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya Golden Landscape|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=4ecf892faeae475087d1d4f12%0925a8a7c|website=www.arcgis.com|publisher=ArcGIS|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
	
== Importance ==
The Maya Golden Landscape in southern Belize is one of the country’s largest areas of intact tropical broadleaf forest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Adam|title=River to Reef – exploring the Maya Golden Landscape in Belize|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/river-to-reef-exploring-the-maya-golden-landscape-in-belize/|website=fauna-flora.org|publisher=Fauna and Flora International|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Landscape itself is produced by a mosaic of protected areas placed together in order to establish a wildlife corridor that eases the movement of wildlife within included areas. With over 250 species of birds, 93 species of mammals,
and 92 species of reptiles and amphibians in one of the major protected areas located within it, the landscape serves as a biodiversity conservation hotspot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Paul|last2=Walker|first2=Zoe|title=Bladen Nature Reserve Management Plan|journal=Bladen Nature Reserve Management Plan|volume=Volume 1|page=10|url=http://library.bfreebz.org/Protected%20Areas/Bladen%20Nature%20Reserve/Bladen%20Nature%20Reserve%20Management%20Plan%202007-2012%20Volume%20I%20Final%20Draft%2C%202006.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''National parks of [[Taiwan]]''' are protected spaces for their nature, wildlife, and history in its current jurisdiction. Currently there are nine national parks in Taiwan, all are under the administration of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)|Ministry of the Interior]]. These national parks covers {{convert|7489.49|km2}}.&lt;ref name="MOI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://np.cpami.gov.tw/chinese/filesys/statistics/103/253_b9fa691587eff16841128a4cea0c8276.pdf |script-title=zh:各國家公園基本資料表 |publisher=Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan |format=PDF |language=Chinese |date=6 June 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2014 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|3103.76|km2|sing=on}} total land area constitutes around 8.6% of the entire land area of the country.

The first national parks were established in 1937, when Taiwan was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]]. After [[World War II]], the voice for protecting the natural environment was suspended due to the autocratic rule and the [[Martial law in Taiwan]]. The National Park Law was passed in 1972 and finally the first new national parks were reestablished in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmnp.gov.tw/english/establishment.htm Reference on Act Title from Kinmen Park website]&lt;/ref&gt;

National parks should not be confused with [[National scenic areas in Taiwan|national scenic areas]]. The national scenic areas are administrated by the [[Tourism Bureau]] of the [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Taiwan)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications]].&lt;ref name=sinica&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sinica.edu.tw/tit/scenery/1295_scn1.html | title = Taiwan's National Scenic Areas: Balancing Preservation and Recreation | publisher = Academia Sinica | date = 1995-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also different philosophies that govern the development of the two types of areas. For a national park, the emphasis is on the preservation of natural and cultural resources, and development for human utilization is definitely a secondary priority.&lt;ref name=sinica/&gt;

==History==
The first {{nihongo|national parks|國立公園|Kokuritsu Kōen}} in Taiwan were appointed in December 27, 1937 by [[Governor-General of Taiwan|Governor-General]] {{nihongo|[[Seizō Kobayashi]]|小林躋造}}. This was when  Taiwan was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], thus these three national parks are designated to be the [[List of national parks of Japan|national parks]] of the [[Empire of Japan]].

The administration of these national parks was no longer in force when Japan withdrew from Taiwan in 1945 after [[World War II]]. There were no national parks in [[Taiwan]] since then until the new national parks law in the 1980s. The first new established national parks at that time were on similar places to the Japanese establishments.

==Current national parks of Taiwan==
Currently there are nine(9) national parks in [[Taiwan]]. There is also one(1) national natural park, which is designed for areas with fewer resources compare to a full national park.

[[Image:Jan Bruegel d. Ä. 003.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Paradise'' by [[Jan Bruegel]]]]

In religion, '''paradise''' is a place of exceptional happiness and delight.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/paradise-religion&lt;/ref&gt; Paradisiacal notions are often laden with [[pastoral]] imagery, and may be [[cosmogonical]] or [[eschatological]] or both, often compared to the miseries of human [[civilization]]: in paradise there is only [[peace]], [[prosperity]], and [[happiness]]. Paradise is a place of contentment, a land of luxury and fulfillment. Paradise is often described as a "higher place", the holiest place, in contrast to this [[World (theology)|world]], or [[underworld]]s such as [[Hell]].

In eschatological contexts, paradise is imagined as an [[Entering heaven alive|abode of the virtuous dead]]. In Christian and Islamic understanding, [[Heaven]] is a paradisiacal relief. In old Egyptian beliefs, the [[otherworld]] is [[Aaru]], the reed-fields of ideal hunting and fishing grounds where the dead lived after judgment. For the Celts, it was the [[Fortunate Isles|Fortunate Isle]] of [[Mag Mell]]. For the classical Greeks, the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]] was a paradisiacal land of plenty where the heroic and righteous dead hoped to spend eternity. The [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Indians]] held that the physical body was destroyed by fire but recreated and reunited in the [[Third Heaven]] in a state of bliss. In the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], the "Best Existence"&lt;!-- vahišta.ahu- --&gt; and the "House of Song"&lt;!-- garō.dəmāma- --&gt; are places of the righteous dead. On the other hand, in [[cosmological]] contexts 'paradise' describes the world before it was tainted by [[evil]].

The concept is a theme in art and literature, particularly of the pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], a well-known representative of which is [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Nicolas Poussin - Le Printemps.jpg|left|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin]], ''Four seasons of paradise'', 1660–64]]

The word "paradise" entered English from the [[French language|French]] ''paradis'', inherited from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''paradisus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''parádeisos'' (παράδεισος), from an [[Old Iranian]] ''*paridayda-'' "walled enclosure". By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been adopted as [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''pardesu''  "domain". It subsequently came to indicate the expansive [[Paradise garden|walled gardens]] of the [[First Persian Empire]]. The term eventually appeared in Greek as ''parádeisos'' "park for animals" in the ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' of the early 4th century BCE Athenian [[Xenophon]]. [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''pardaysa'' similarly reflects "royal park".

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פַּרְדֵּס ''pardes'', "orchard", appears thrice in the [[Tanakh]]; in the [[Song of Solomon]] ({{Bibleref2|Song of Songs 4:13}}), [[Ecclesiastes]] ({{Bibleref2|Ecclesiastes 2:5}}) and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] ({{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 2:8}}). In those contexts it could be interpreted as an "orchard" or a "fruit garden".
In the [[Septuagint]] (3rd–1st centuries BCE), Greek παράδεισος ''parádeisos'' was used to translate both Hebrew פרדס ''pardes'' and Hebrew גן ''{{lang|he-Latn|gan}}'', "garden" (e.g. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 2:8}}, {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel 28:13}}): it is from this usage that the use of "paradise" to refer to the [[Garden of Eden]] derives. The same usage also appears in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and in the [[Quran]] as ''[[firdaws]]'' فردوس.

The word's etymology is ultimately derived from a [[PIE root]] ''*dheigʷ'' "to stick and set up".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
It is reflected in [[Avestan language|Avestan]] as  [[wiktionary:𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬭𐬌⸱𐬛𐬀𐬉𐬰𐬀|𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬭𐬌⸱𐬛𐬀𐬉𐬰𐬀]] ''pairi-daêza-''.&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1151.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The literal meaning of this Eastern Old Iranian language word is "walled (enclosure)",&lt;ref name="New Oxford"/&gt; from ''pairi-'' 'around' (cognate with Greek [[wiktionary:περί|περί]], English peri- of identical meaning) and ''-diz'' "to make, form (a wall), build" (cognate with Greek [[wiktionary:τεῖχος|τεῖχος]] 'wall').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term= paradise |title= Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=2 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065930/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=paradise |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.obspm.fr/index.php?showAll=1&amp;&amp;search=&amp;&amp;formSearchTextfield=form&amp;&amp;page=1 |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Astronomy and Astrophysics |publisher= |accessdate=15 January  2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150115095513/http://dictionary.obspm.fr/index.php?showAll=1&amp;&amp;search=&amp;&amp;formSearchTextfield=form&amp;&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2015-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is not  attested in other Old Iranian languages, though hypothetical roots in these languages may be reconstructed, for example as in [[Old Persian]] ''*paridayda-''.

The idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most Iranian usage, and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area, not necessarily walled. For example, the Old Iranian word survives as ''Pardis'' in New Persian as well as its derivative ''pālīz'' (or "jālīz"), which denotes a vegetable patch.

==Biblical==

===Hebrew Bible===
The word ''pardes'' does not appear before the post-Exilic period (post-538 BCE); it occurs in the [[Song of Songs]] 4:13, [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5, and [[Ezra-Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 2:8, in each case meaning "park" or "garden", the original Persian meaning of the word, where it describes to the royal parks of [[Cyrus the Great]] by [[Xenophon]] in [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].

Later in [[Second Temple]] era Judaism "paradise" came to be associated with the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[World to Come|prophesies of restoration of Eden]], and transferred to [[heaven]]. The [[Septuagint]] uses the word around 30 times, both of Eden, (Gen.2:7 etc.) and of Eden restored (Ezek. 28:13, 36:35 etc.). In the [[Apocalypse of Moses]], [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise (instead of Eden) after having been tricked by the serpent. Later after the death of Adam, the [[Archangel Michael]] carries the body of Adam to be buried in Paradise, which is in the [[Third Heaven]].

===New Testament===
The New Testament use and understanding of paradise parallels that of contemporary Judaism. The word is used three times in the New Testament writings:
* Luke 23:43 – by Jesus on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]], in response to the thief's request that Jesus remember him when he came in his kingdom.
* 2 Cor.12:4 – in Paul's description of a man's description of a [[Third Heaven#The New Testament|third heaven]] paradise, which may in fact be a vision Paul himself saw.
* Rev.2:7 – in a reference to the Gen.2:8 paradise and the [[Tree of life#Hebraic monotheism|tree of life]]

==Judaism==
{{see also|Heaven in Judaism}}
In [[Rabbinical Judaism]], the word 'Pardes' recurs, but less often in the Second Temple context of Eden or restored Eden. A well-known reference is in the [[Pardes (legend)|Pardes story]], where the word may allude to mystic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P#ixzz0ZWg2S0OP|title=JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013054031/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P#ixzz0ZWg2S0OP|archivedate=13 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zohar]] gives the word a mystical interpretation, and associates it with the four kinds of Biblical exegesis: ''peshat'' (literal meaning), ''remez'' (allusion), ''derash'' (anagogical), and ''sod'' (mystic). The initial letters of those four words then form {{lang|he|פַּרְדֵּס}} – ''[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|p(a)rd(e)s]]'', which was in turn felt to represent the fourfold interpretation of the [[Torah]] (in which ''sod'' – the mystical interpretation – ranks highest).

==Christianity==
{{see also|World to Come|Kingship and kingdom of God}}

[[File:Mead Bradock, Paradise According to Three Different Hypotheses, 1747 Cornell CUL PJM 1023.01.jpg|thumbnail|Mead Bradock, Paradise According to Three Different Hypotheses, 1747]]
In the 2nd century AD, [[Irenaeus]] distinguished paradise from [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. In ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', he wrote that only those deemed worthy would inherit a home in heaven, while others would enjoy paradise, and the rest live in the [[New Jerusalem|restored Jerusalem]] (which was mostly a ruin after the [[Jewish–Roman wars]] but was rebuilt beginning with [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine the Great]] in the 4th century). [[Origen]] likewise distinguished paradise from heaven, describing paradise as the earthly "school" for souls of the righteous dead, preparing them for their ascent through the celestial spheres to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04122.htm Church fathers: De Principiis (Book II) Origen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720032710/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04122.htm |date=2008-07-20 }}, newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Christians identified [[Abraham's bosom]] with paradise, where the souls of the righteous go until the resurrection; others were inconsistent in their identification of paradise, such as St. Augustine, whose views varied.&lt;ref name="Delumeau1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Delumeau|title=History of paradise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubJDLvEV0vEC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06880-5|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luke 23:43, Jesus has a conversation with one of those crucified with him, who asks, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom". Jesus answers him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23&amp;version=NIV|title=Luke 23|work=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719035039/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23&amp;version=NIV|archivedate=19 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has often been interpreted to mean that on that same day the thief and Jesus would enter the intermediate resting place of the dead who were waiting for the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="Zwiep1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. W. Zwiep|title=The Ascension of the Messiah in Lukan Christology /|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIW7JywiBhIC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10897-4|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divergent views on paradise, and when one enters it, may have been responsible for a punctuation difference in Luke; for example, the two early [[Syriac language|Syriac]] versions translate Luke 23:43 differently. The [[Curetonian Gospels]] read "Today I tell you that you will be with me in paradise", whereas the [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]] reads "I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise". Likewise the two earliest Greek codices with punctuation disagree: [[Codex Vaticanus]] has a pause mark (a single dot on the baseline) in the original ink equidistant between 'today' and the following word (with no later corrections and no dot before "today"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/2013/06/the-significance-of-a-comma:-an-analysis-of-luke-23:43|title=The Significance of a Comma: An Analysis of Luke 23:43 - Ministry Magazine|author=|date=|website=Ministry Magazine|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417154457/https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/2013/06/the-significance-of-a-comma:-an-analysis-of-luke-23:43|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whereas [[Codex Alexandrinus]] has the "today in paradise" reading. In addition, an adverb of time is never used in the nearly 100 other places in the Gospels where Jesus uses the phrase, "Truly I say to you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forananswer.org/Luke/Luke23_43.htm|title=For an Answer: Christian Apologetics - Luke 23:43|author=|date=|website=www.forananswer.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418182314/http://www.forananswer.org/Luke/Luke23_43.htm|archivedate=18 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian art, [[Fra Angelico]]'s ''[[Last Judgement]]'' painting shows Paradise on its left side. There is a [[tree of life]] (and another tree) and a [[circle dance]] of liberated [[Soul (spirit)|souls]]. In the middle is a hole. In Muslim art it similarly indicates the presence of the Prophet or divine beings. It visually says, "Those here cannot be depicted".

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe, from their interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]], that God's original purpose was, and is, to have the earth filled with the offspring of [[Adam and Eve]] as caretakers of a global paradise. However, Adam and Eve rebelled against God's sovereignty and were banished from the Garden of Eden, driven out of paradise into toil and misery.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that disobedient and wicked people will be destroyed by Christ at [[Armageddon]] and those obedient to Christ will live eternally in a restored earthly paradise. Joining the survivors will be the resurrected righteous and unrighteous people who died prior to Armageddon. The latter are brought back because they paid for their sins by their death and/or because they lacked opportunity to learn of Jehovah's requirements before dying. These will be judged on the basis of their post-resurrection obedience to instructions revealed in new "scrolls".  They believe that resurrection of the dead to paradise earth is made possible by [[Blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] and the [[ransom sacrifice]]. This provision does not apply to those whom Christ as Judge deems to have sinned against God's holy spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''What Does the Bible Really Teach?''

===Mormonism===
In [[Latter Day Saint]] theology, paradise usually refers to the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]], the place where spirits dwell following death and awaiting the resurrection. In that context, "paradise" is the state of the righteous after death.&lt;ref&gt;Duane S. Crowther - [https://books.google.com/books?id=ku4t9ONW7L4C&amp;pg=PT71&amp;lpg=PT71&amp;dq=In+Latter+Day+Saint+theology,+paradise+usually+refers+to+the+spirit+world,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=olxGuIOKQB&amp;sig=B3-rHFgh5aA6QgMYMIr3nUU5ogU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IVi7U7z6O7KhsQTOiYGgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20Latter%20Day%20Saint%20theology%2C%20paradise%20usually%20refers%20to%20the%20spirit%20world%2C&amp;f=false Life Everlasting] Chapter 5 - Paradise of the Wicked - Retrieved 8 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the wicked and those who have not yet learned the gospel of Jesus Christ await the resurrection in [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]]. After the universal resurrection, all persons will be assigned to a particular [[degrees of glory|kingdom or degree of glory]]. This may also be termed "paradise".

==Islam==
{{Main|Jannah}}
In the [[Quran]], Heaven is denoted as ''Jannah'' (garden), with the highest level being called ''Firdaus'', i.e. Paradise. It is used instead of Heaven to describe the ultimate pleasurable place after death, accessible by those who pray, donate to charity, read the Quran, believe in: God, the angels, his revealed books, his prophets and messengers, the Day of Judgement and the afterlife, and follow God's will in their life. Heaven in Islam is used to describe skies in the literal sense and metaphorically to refer to the [[universe]]. In Islam, the bounties and beauty of Heaven are immense, so much so that they are beyond the abilities of mankind’s worldly mind to comprehend.
There are eight doors of Jannah. These are eight grades of Jannah: 
* 1. Jannatul Mava
* 2. Darul Maqaam
* 3. Darul Salaam
* 4. Darul Khuld
* 5. Jannat-ul-Adan
* 6. Jannat-ul-Naeem
* 7. Jannat-ul-Kasif
* 8. Jannat-ul-Firdous
Jannatul Mava is in the lowest, Jannat-ul-Adan is the middle and Jannat-ul-Firdous is the highest.

Imam Bukhari has also recorded the tradition in which the Prophet said, 'When you ask from Allah, ask Him for Al Firdaus, for it is the middle of Paradise and it is the highest place and from it the rivers of Paradise flow.' (Bukhari, Ahmad, Baihaqi) In this tradition, it is evident that Al Firdaus is the highest place in Paradise, yet, it is stated that it is in the middle. While giving an explanation of this description of Al Firdaus, the great scholar, Ibn Hibban states, 'Al Firdaus being in the middle of Paradise means that with respect to the width and breadth of Paradise, Al Firdaus is in the middle. And with respect to being 'the highest place in Paradise', it refers to it being on a height.' This explanation is in agreement to the explanation which has been given by Abu Hurairah (r.a.) who said that 'Al Firdaus is a mountain in Paradise from which the rivers flow.' (Tafseer Al Qurtubi Vol. 12 pg. 100)

The Quran also gave a warning that not all Muslims or even the believers will assuredly be permitted to enter Jannah except those who had struggled in the name of God and tested from God's trials as faced by the messengers of God or ancient prophets:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Or do you think that you will enter Jannah while such (trial) has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until (even their) messenger and those who believed with him said, "When is the help of Allah?" Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near. &lt;br/&gt;— [https://en.quranacademy.org/quran/2:214 Qur'an, chapter 2 (Al-Baqarah), ayah 214 (''Saheeh International'')]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''peninsula''' ({{lang-la|paeninsula}} from ''{{lang|la|paene}}'' "almost” and ''{{lang|la|insula}}'' "island") is a piece of land surrounded by water on the majority of its border while being connected to a [[mainland]] from which it extends.&lt;ref name = "Word_Histories"&gt;{{cite book |title=Word Histories and Mysteries: From Abracadabra to Zeus |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2004 |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZ88p_bSt1EC&amp;pg=PA216 |isbn=978-0547350271 |oclc=55746553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=peninsula&amp;submit.x=53&amp;submit.y=23 |title=pen·in·su·la |date=2016 |work=[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  |access-date=1 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambr_Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of peninsula |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/peninsula |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam_Webster"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of peninsula |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peninsula |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as a single body of water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3645">'''Ritual landscapes''' are extensive archaeological tracts that were seemingly dedicated to ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]s (c. 3500-1800 BC). The term emerged in the early 1980s in [[British archaeology]] and was contrasted with more conventional studies of monument sites concerned with [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]], classification, and political divisions. These landscapes are often associated with origin myths, ancestors, homes of spiritual essences, or locales where mythical or historical events occurred while the landscape features include [[Collective memory|social memory]] and the preservation of the myths, histories, trusts, and the belongings of a people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maya Pilgrimage to Ritual Landscapes: Insights from Archaeology, History, and Ethnography|last=Palka|first=Joel|publisher=University of New Mexico|year=2014|isbn=9780826354747|location=Albuquerque, NM|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from a place of origin and mythology, ritual landscapes were also considered places of protection and renewal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconsidering Olmec Visual Culture: The Unborn, Women, and Creation|last=Tate|first=Carolyn|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2012|isbn=9780292728523|location=Austin, TX|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Many ritual landscapes were gradually built around the two earliest classes of Neolithic communal monuments, known as [[long barrow]]s and [[causewayed enclosure]]s.&lt;ref name="FrancisPryor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelondonmagazine.org/ritual-landscapes/|last=Pryor|first=Francis|title=Ritual Landscapes by Francis Pryor|website=The London Magazine|date=1 December 2015|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, for instance, the [[Avebury]] ritual site featured a giant, flat-topped barrow called [[Silbury Hill]], which is considered the largest artificial mound in prehistoric Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology, 2nd edition|last=Silberman|first=Neil Asher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199735785|location=New York|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of contemporary settlement within these landscapes is often sparse or absent altogether; conversely, non-utilitarian [[Architectural structure|structures]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are typically abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Robba|first=John G.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01426399808706533#preview|title=The ‘ritual landscape’ concept in archaeology: a heritage construction|date=24 Feb 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, the ritual landscape is strongly influenced by the environment. This is demonstrated in the case of [[Tibet]], the verticality of the environment dominated the constructions of the ritual landscape and features therein such as structures and tombs, which were built to resemble the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=he Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion|last=Insoll|first=Timothy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199232444|location=Oxford|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ritual landscapes went out of use relatively abruptly around 1500 BC and were replaced by smaller-scale shrines, which were often located near rivers, marshes, and springs. These smaller shrines usually feature offerings of food and metalwork and continued to be created and used into Roman and even Saxon times. Today they are often described as Celtic.&lt;ref name="FrancisPryor" /&gt;

[[File:Wa-map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Namibia showing the Caprivi Strip in the country's northeast.]]
A '''salient''' is an elongated protrusion of a geopolitical entity, such as a [[subnational entity]] or a [[sovereign state]].

While similar to a [[peninsula]] in shape, a salient is not surrounded by water on three sides. Instead, it has a land [[border]] on at least two sides and extends out from the larger geographical body of the administrative unit.

In [[American English]] the term '''panhandle''' is often used to describe a relatively long and narrow salient, such as the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|westernmost extension of Oklahoma]]. Less common descriptors include '''chimney''' (if protruding northward, as a chimney does from a roof, as with the [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|northernmost extremity]] of [[West Virginia]]) and '''bootheel''' (if protruding southward, as the heel underneath a boot, such as the [[Missouri Bootheel]]).

==Origin==
The term ''salient'' is derived from [[salient (military)|military salients]]. The term "panhandle" derives from the analogous part of a [[cooking pan]], and its use is generally confined to the United States.

The salient shape is the result of arbitrarily drawn international or subnational boundaries, although the location of some administrative borders takes into account other considerations such as [[economic geography|economic ties]] or [[topography]].

Many people in the Pacific Northwest refer to the extreme northern section of Idaho's panhandle as "The Chimney", due to its resemblance to a chimney when viewed on maps.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Although [[Utah]], like Nebraska, has a [[Ogden–Clearfield metropolitan area|protrusion from its otherwise straight border]], it is not usually considered a panhandle, as half of the [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area]], the most populous region in the state and the home of the state's capital, is located in the region. Likewise, though [[New York (State)|New York]] has [[Downstate New York|a southern protrusion]] that is more conspicuous than e.g. the Connecticut, Texas and Nebraska Panhandles, this is never considered a panhandle since it accommodates the most densely populated parts of the state. (In New York's case, its irregular shape leaves certain regions up for debate. From a different perspective, that region is part of the New York mainland while a [[western New York|western salient]] juts out.) Thus, the concept of a panhandle may not be purely geographic but may also have a demographic component.

{{Scramble for Africa}}
{{Exploration of Africa}}{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}

The '''Scramble for Africa''' was the occupation, division, and colonization of [[Africa]]n territory by European powers during the period of [[New Imperialism]], between 1881 and 1914. It is also called the '''Partition of Africa''' and by some the '''Conquest of Africa'''. In 1870, only 10 percent of Africa was under formal European control; by 1914 it had increased to almost 90 percent of the continent, with only [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]] still being independent.  There were multiple motivations including the quest for national prestige, tensions between pairs of European powers, religious missionary zeal{{cn|date=September 2018}} and internal African native politics. 

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884, which regulated European colonisation and trade in Africa, is usually referred to as the ultimate point of the scramble for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brantlinger |first=Patrick |year=1985 |title=Victorians and Africans: The Genealogy of the Myth of the Dark Continent |journal=Critical Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=166–203 |jstor=1343467 |doi=10.1086/448326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequent to the political and economic rivalries among the European empires in the last quarter of the 19th century, the partitioning, or splitting up of Africa was how the Europeans avoided warring amongst themselves over Africa.&lt;ref&gt;R. Robinson, J. Gallagher and A. Denny, ''Africa and the Victorians'', London, 1965, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The later years of the 19th century saw the transition from "informal imperialism" by military influence and economic dominance, to direct rule, bringing about colonial [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Shillington"&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''History of Africa''. Revised second edition (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Preaching from a Waggon (David Livingstone) by The London Missionary Society.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Livingstone]], early explorer of the interior of Africa and fighter against the [[African slave trade|slave trade]]]]

By 1840 European powers had established small trading posts along the coast, but seldom moved inland.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. 

Even as late as the 1870s, European states still controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]]. By 1914, only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] remained independent of European control.&lt;ref&gt;

Technological advances facilitated European expansion overseas. Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.

==Causes==

===Africa and global markets===
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]] 

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by "informal imperialism", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873–96), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.&lt;ref name="Shillington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, "An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble? The Commercial Transition and the Commodity Price Boom of 1835–1885," ''Journal of Economic History'' 78#1 (2018) , pp. 231-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Africa – excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 – the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Léopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].

These events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and over-production caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A. Hobson]] argued in ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'' that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global "New Imperialism" period. [[William Easterly]], however, disagrees with the link made between [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]], arguing that [[colonialism]] is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than "corporate" development. He has stated that "imperialism is not so clearly linked to capitalism and the free markets... historically there has been a closer link between colonialism/imperialism and state-led approaches to development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aidwatchers.com/2009/09/the-imperial-origins-of-state-led-development/|title=The Imperial Origins of State-Led Development|last=Easterly|first=William|date=September 17, 2009|publisher=New York University Blogs|accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic rivalry===
[[File:LeCommandantMarchand.jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of Major [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand|Marchand]]'s [[Fashoda Incident|trek across Africa]] in 1898]]

The rivalry between Britain, France, Germany, and the other European powers accounts for a large part of the colonization.

While tropical Africa was not a large zone of investment, other overseas regions were. The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in [[China]] and its eastern colonies, most notably [[British India|India]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and West—the [[Suez Canal]]. However, a theory that Britain sought to annex East Africa during the 1880 onwards, out of geostrategic concerns connected to Egypt (especially the Suez Canal),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Diplomacy of Imperialism, 1890-1902|last=Langer|first=William A|last2=Bureau of International Research of Harvard University and Radcliffe College|publisher=Alfred A Knopf|year=1935|isbn=|volume=1|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa and the Victorians: The Official Mind of Imperialism|last=Robinson|first=Ronald|last2=Gallagher|first2=John|last3=Denny|first3=Alice|publisher=Macmillan|year=1961|isbn=|location=The University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been challenged by historians such as [[John Darwin (historian)|John Darwin]] (1997) and Jonas F. Gjersø (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, John. "Imperialism and the Victorians: The dynamics of territorial expansion." ''English Historical Review'' (1997) 112#447 pp: 614–642. http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/CXII/447/614.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gjersø |first= Jonas Fossli |date= 2015 |title= The Scramble for East Africa: British Motives Reconsidered, 1884-95 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03086534.2015.1026131 |journal= Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |volume= 43 |issue= 5 |pages= 831–60 |doi= 10.1080/03086534.2015.1026131 |access-date=4 March 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The scramble for African territory also reflected concern for the acquisition of military and naval bases, for strategic purposes and the exercise of power. The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"&gt;H. R. Cowie, ''Imperialism and Race Relations''. Revised edition, Nelson Publishing, Vol. 5, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonies were also seen as assets in "[[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]" negotiations, useful as items of exchange at times of international bargaining. Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars). In the age of [[nationalism]] there was pressure for a nation to acquire an empire as a status symbol; the idea of "greatness" became linked with the [[White Man's Burden|sense of duty]] underlying many nations' strategies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"/&gt;

In the early 1880s, [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] was exploring the [[Kongo Kingdom|Kingdom of Kongo]] for France, at the same time [[Henry Morton Stanley]] explored it on behalf of [[Léopold II of Belgium]], who would have it as his personal [[Congo Free State]] (see section below). France occupied [[Tunisia]] in May 1881, which may have convinced [[Italy]] to join the German-Austrian [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] in 1882, thus forming the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The same year, Britain occupied [[Egypt]] (hitherto an autonomous state owing nominal [[fealty]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]), which ruled over [[Sudan]] and parts of [[Chad]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Somalia]]. In 1884, Germany declared [[Togoland]], the [[Cameroons]] and [[South West Africa]] to be under its protection; and France occupied Guinea. [[French West Africa]] (AOF) was founded in 1895, and [[French Equatorial Africa]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham,

====Germany's ''Weltpolitik''====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA6364, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Polizeiaskaris.jpg|thumb|The [[Askari]] colonial troops in [[German East Africa]], circa 1906]]

Germany was hardly a colonial power before the New Imperialism period, but would eagerly participate in this race. Fragmented in various states, Germany was only unified under [[Prussia]]'s rule after the 1866 [[Battle of Königgrätz]] and the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]]. A [[Industrial revolution#Germany|rising industrial power]] close on the heels of Britain, Germany began its world expansion in the 1880s. After isolating France by the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] with [[Austria-Hungary]] and then the 1882 [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Italy, Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] proposed the 1884–85 [[Berlin Conference]], which set the rules of effective control of a foreign territory. ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' (world policy) was the foreign policy adopted by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, with the aim of transforming Germany into a global power through aggressive diplomacy, the acquisition of overseas colonies, and the development of a large navy.

Some Germans, claiming themselves of [[Friedrich List]]'s thought, advocated expansion in the [[Philippines]] and [[Timor]]; others proposed to set themselves up in Formosa (modern [[Taiwan]]), etc. At the end of the 1870s, these isolated voices began to be relayed by a real imperialist policy{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, backed by [[mercantilism|mercantilist thesis]]. In 1881, [[Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden|Hübbe-Schleiden]], a lawyer, published ''Deutsche Kolonisation'', according to which the "development of national [[political consciousness|consciousness]] demanded an independent overseas policy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris4.sorbonne.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/navette-7.pdf German colonial imperialism: a late and short-term phenomenon] (PDF) by Bernard Poloni, in "Imperialism, hegemony, leadership", 26 March 2004 Conference in the [[Sorbonne University]], Paris {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan-Germanism]] was thus linked to the young nation's imperialist drives{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In the beginning of the 1880s, the ''[[Deutscher Kolonialverein]]'' was created, and got its own magazine in 1884, the ''Kolonialzeitung''. This colonial lobby was also relayed by the nationalist ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]''. Generally, Bismarck was opposed to widespread German colonialism,&lt;ref name="Strandmann1969"&gt;Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann. "Domestic Origins of Germany's Colonial Expansion under Bismarck." ''Past &amp; Present'' (Feb 1969), Issue 42, pp. 140–59 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/650184 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; but he had to resign at the insistence of the new German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] on 18 March 1890. Wilhelm II instead adopted a very aggressive policy of colonisation and colonial expansion.

Germany's [[expansionism]] would lead to the [[Tirpitz Plan]], implemented by [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral von Tirpitz]], who would also champion the various [[Fleet Acts]] starting in 1898, thus engaging in an [[arms race]] with Britain. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly three-fifths the size of the [[Royal Navy]]). According to von Tirpitz, this aggressive naval policy was supported by the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] rather than by the conservatives, implying that imperialism was supported by the rising [[middle class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred von Tirpitz]], ''Erinnerungen'' (1919), quoted by [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', section on Imperialism, chapter I, part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany became the third-largest colonial power in Africa. Nearly all of its overall empire of 2.6 million square kilometres and 14 million colonial subjects in 1914 was found in its African possessions of Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika. Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. This led to the 1905 [[Algeciras Conference]], in which France's influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the [[Agadir Crisis]] in 1911. Along with the 1898 [[Fashoda Incident]] between France and Britain, this succession of [[international crisis|international crises]] reveals the bitterness of the struggle between the various imperialist nations, which ultimately led to [[World War I]].

====Italy's expansion====
[[File:Italian aircraft attacking Ottoman forces in Libya 1911 or 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian aircraft in action against Ottoman forces during the [[Italian invasion of Libya]] in the [[Italo-Turkish War]].]]

Italy [[Italian Eritrea|took possession]] of parts of [[Eritrea]] in 1870&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Ullendorff|Ullendorff, Edward]]. ''The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People'' 2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., p.&amp;nbsp;90. [[Oxford University Press]] (London), 1965. {{ISBN|0-19-285061-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea|volume=9|page=747}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1882. Following its defeat in the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]] (1895–1896), it acquired [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1889–90 and the whole of Eritrea (1899). In 1911, it engaged in a [[Italo-Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]], in which it acquired [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]], that together formed what became known as [[Italian Libya]]. In 1919 [[Enrico Corradini]]—who fully supported the war, and later merged his group in the early [[National Fascist Party|fascist party]] (PNF)—developed the concept of ''Proletarian Nationalism'', supposed to legitimise Italy's imperialism by a mixture of [[socialism]] with [[nationalism]]:

{{quote|We must start by recognizing the fact that there are proletarian nations as well as proletarian classes; that is to say, there are nations whose living conditions are subject...to the way of life of other nations, just as classes are. Once this is realised, nationalism must insist firmly on this truth: Italy is, materially and morally, a proletarian nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrico Corradini]], ''Report to the First Nationalist Congress'', Florence, 3 December 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] (1935–36), ordered by the Fascist [[Benito Mussolini]], would actually be one of the last colonial wars (that is, intended to colonise a foreign country, as opposed to [[wars of national liberation]]), occupying [[Ethiopia]]—which had remained the last independent African territory, apart from Liberia. [[Italian Ethiopia]] became a part of the [[Italian East Africa]].

==Crises prior to World War I==

===Colonisation of the Congo===
[[File:Henry Morton Stanley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Morton Stanley]]]]

[[David Livingstone]]'s explorations, carried on by [[Henry Morton Stanley]], excited imaginations with Stanley's grandiose ideas for colonisation; but these found little support owing to the problems and scale of action required, except from [[Léopold II of Belgium]], who in 1876 had organised the [[Association Internationale Africaine|International African Association]] (the Congo Society). From 1869 to 1874, Stanley was secretly sent by Léopold II to the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] region, where he made treaties with several African chiefs along the Congo River and by 1882 had sufficient territory to form the basis of the [[Congo Free State]]. Léopold II personally owned the colony from 1885 and used it as a source of [[ivory]] and [[rubber]].

[[File:Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] in his version of "native" dress, photographed by [[Félix Nadar]]]]

While Stanley was exploring Congo on behalf of Léopold II of Belgium, the Franco-Italian marine officer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza|Pierre de Brazza]] travelled into the western Congo basin and raised the French flag over the newly founded [[Brazzaville]] in 1881, thus occupying today's [[Republic of the Congo]]. Portugal, which also claimed the area due to old treaties with the native [[Kongo Empire]], made a treaty with Britain on 26 February 1884 to block off the Congo Society's access to the Atlantic.

By 1890 the Congo Free State had consolidated its control of its territory between [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] and [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], and was looking to push south down the [[Lualaba River]] from Stanleyville. At the same time, the [[British South Africa Company]] of [[Cecil Rhodes]] was expanding north from the [[Limpopo River]], sending the [[Pioneer Column]] (guided by [[Frederick Selous]]) through [[Matabeleland]], and starting a colony in Mashonaland.

To the west, in the land where their expansions would meet, was [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], site of the [[Yeke Kingdom]] of [[Msiri]]. Msiri was the most militarily powerful ruler in the area, and traded large quantities of copper, ivory and slaves — and rumors of gold reached European ears. The scramble for Katanga was a prime example of the period. Rhodes and the BSAC sent two expeditions to Msiri in 1890 led by [[Alfred Sharpe]], who was rebuffed, and [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]], who failed to reach Katanga. Leopold sent four CFS expeditions. First, the [[Le Marinel Expedition]] could only extract a vaguely worded letter. The [[Delcommune Expedition]] was rebuffed. The well-armed [[Stairs Expedition]] was given orders to take Katanga with or without Msiri's consent. Msiri refused, was shot, and the expedition cut off his head and stuck it on a pole as a "barbaric lesson" to the people. The [[Bia Expedition]] finished the job of establishing an administration of sorts and a "police presence" in Katanga. Thus, the half million square kilometers of Katanga came into Leopold's possession and brought his African realm up to {{Convert|2300000|km2}}, about 75 times larger than Belgium. The Congo Free State imposed such a [[terror regime]] on the colonised people, including mass killings and forced labour, that Belgium, under pressure from the [[Congo Reform Association]], ended Leopold II's rule and annexed it in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the [[Belgian Congo]].

According to the former Irish diplomat [[Roger Casement]], this depopulation had four main causes: "indiscriminate war", starvation, reduction of births and diseases.{{sfn|Hochschild|2006|pp=226–32}} [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping sickness]] ravaged the country and must also be taken into account for the dramatic decrease in population; it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower [[Congo River]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8DSa_viBgsgC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false John D.

Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. As the first census did not take place until 1924, it is difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. [[Casement Report|Casement's report]] set it at three million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urome.be/fr2/reflexions/casemrepo.pdf "Report of the British Consul, Roger Casement, on the Administration of the Congo Free State".]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Rubinstein]] wrote: "More basically, it appears almost certain that the population figures given by [[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild]] are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century, and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses.

A similar situation occurred in the neighbouring French Congo. Most of the resource extraction was run by concession companies, whose brutal methods, along with the introduction of disease, resulted in the loss of up to 50 percent of the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vansina |first=Jan |title=Paths in the Rainforest |year=1966 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government appointed a commission, headed by de Brazza, in 1905 to investigate the rumoured abuses in the colony.

===Suez Canal===
{{Main|Suez Canal}}
[[File:Port Said Suez Canal.jpg|thumb|[[Port Said]] entrance to Suez Canal, showing De Lesseps' statue]]

French diplomat [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] had obtained many concessions from [[Isma'il Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan, in 1854–56, to build the Suez Canal. Some sources estimate the workforce at 30,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html L'Aventure Humaine: ''Le canal de Suez'', Article de l'historien Uwe Oster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819201458/http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html |date=2011-08-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but others estimate that 120,000 workers died over the ten years of construction due to malnutrition, fatigue and disease, especially [[cholera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5195068.stm BBC News website:The Suez Crisis — Key maps].&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before its completion in 1869, Khedive Isma'il borrowed enormous sums from British and French bankers at high rates of interest. By 1875, he was facing financial difficulties and was forced to sell his block of shares in the Suez Canal. The shares were snapped up by Britain, under its [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who sought to give his country practical control in the management of this strategic waterway. When Isma'il repudiated Egypt's foreign debt in 1879, Britain and France seized joint financial control over the country, forcing the Egyptian ruler to abdicate, and installing his eldest son [[Tewfik Pasha]] in his place. The Egyptian and Sudanese ruling classes did not relish foreign intervention.

During the 1870s, European initiatives against the [[slave trade]] caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of [[Mahdi]]st forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Domke, D.

The same year, Tewfik suffered an even more perilous rebellion by his own Egyptian army in the form of the [[Urabi Revolt]]. In 1882, Tewfik appealed for direct British military assistance, commencing Britain's administration of Egypt. A joint British-Egyptian military force ultimately defeated the Mahdist forces in Sudan in 1898. Thereafter, Britain (rather than Egypt) seized effective control of Sudan.

===Berlin Conference (1884–85)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Berlin Conference}}
[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|thumb|Otto von Bismarck at the Berlin Conference, 1884]]

The occupation of Egypt, and the acquisition of the Congo were the first major moves in what came to be a precipitous scramble for African territory. In 1884, [[Otto von Bismarck]] convened the 1884–85 Berlin Conference to discuss the African problem. The diplomats put on a humanitarian façade by condemning the [[Slavery|slave trade]], prohibiting the sale of [[alcoholic beverage]]s and firearms in certain regions, and by expressing concern for missionary activities. More importantly, the diplomats in [[Berlin]] laid down the rules of competition by which the great powers were to be guided in seeking colonies. They also agreed that the area along the Congo River was to be administered by [[Léopold II of Belgium]] as a neutral area, known as the Congo Free State, in which trade and navigation were to be free. No nation was to stake claims in Africa without notifying other powers of its intentions. No territory could be formally claimed prior to being effectively occupied. However, the competitors ignored the rules when convenient and on several occasions war was only narrowly avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hist1112f2013.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/ch-18-colonial-encounters-indian-responses-the-scramble-for-africa/|title=Ch. 18: Colonial Encounters, Indian Responses &amp; the Scramble for Africa|website=Reflections on World History|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain's administration of Egypt and South Africa===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|[[Boer]] child in a British [[concentration camp]] during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902)]]

Britain's administration of [[Egypt]] and the [[Cape Colony]] contributed to a preoccupation over securing the source of the [[Nile River]]. Egypt was overrun by British forces in 1882 (although not formally declared a protectorate until 1914, and never an actual colony); [[Sudan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]] were subjugated in the 1890s and early 20th century; and in the south, the Cape Colony (first acquired in 1795) provided a base for the subjugation of neighboring African states and the Dutch [[Afrikaner]] settlers who had left the Cape to avoid the British and then founded their own republics. [[Theophilus Shepstone]] annexed the [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal) in 1877 for the British Empire, after it had been independent for twenty years. In 1879, after the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], Britain consolidated its control of most of the territories of [[South Africa]]. The Boers protested, and in December 1880 they revolted, leading to the [[First Boer War]] (1880–81). British Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] signed a peace treaty on 23 March 1881, giving self-government to the [[Boers]] in the Transvaal. The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.

The French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.

[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes over-ran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]

The [[Sudan]] (which in those days included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This "red line" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a "Cape to Cairo" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.

If one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].

A French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Moroccan Crisis===
{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}

Although the 1884–85 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.

Thus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Théophile Delcassé]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcassé was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.

[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]

The 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.

However, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]—the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.

The German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).

[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.

===Dervish resistance===
[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the "Mad Mullah"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]

Following the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the [[Warsangali Sultanate]], the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].

The [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires. The [[Turkish people|Turks]] also named Hassan [[Emir]] of the Somali nation,&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Lewis, ''The Modern History of Somaliland: from nation to state'' (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: 1965), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Germans promised to officially recognise any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Ofcansky, ''Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia'' (The Scarecrow Press, Inc.: 2004), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the [[Somaliland campaign (1920)|Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920]] as a direct consequence of Britain's use of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Samatar | first = Said Sheikh | title = Oral Poetry and Somali Nationalism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1982 | pages = 131 &amp; 135 | isbn = 0-521-23833-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herero Wars and the Maji-Maji Rebellion===
{{Main|Herero Wars|Maji-Maji Rebellion}}
[[File:Surviving Herero.jpg|thumb|Surviving [[Herero people|Herero]], emaciated, after their escape through the [[Omaheke]] desert]]

Between 1904 and 1908, Germany's colonies in [[German South-West Africa]] and [[German East Africa]] were rocked by separate, contemporaneous native revolts against their rule. In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].

In total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].

==Colonial encounter==

===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===

====Colonial lobby====
[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]

In its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the "parasites of [[patriotism]]" ([[John A. Hobson]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the "blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as "citizens" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)—published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''—or in [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).

Colonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a "place in the sun" for so-called "proletarian nations", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].

====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====

=====Colonial exhibitions=====
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]
However, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s had been instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial [[propaganda]], supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists. Thus, the conquest of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. Karl Hagenbeck, a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, thus decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as "purely natural" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such "[[human zoos]]" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[René Caillié]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Société de Géographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894. Not used to the climatic conditions, some of the indigenous exposed died, such as some [[Galibis]] in Paris in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.uc.pt/formacao/materiais_racismo_pos_racismo/From_human_zoos_to_colonial_apotheoses_the_era_of_exhibiting_the_Other.htm Pascal Blanchard, Nicolas Bancel, and Sandrine Lemaire, "From human zoos to colonial apotheoses: the era of exhibiting the Other".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Parisian Jardin d'acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organise two "ethnological spectacles", presenting Nubians and [[Inuit]]. The public of the Jardin d'acclimatation doubled, with a million paying entrances that year, a huge success for these times. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty "ethnological exhibitions" were presented at the [[Jardin d'Acclimatation|Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html "These human zoos of the Colonial Republic"], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', August 2000 {{fr icon}}. ([http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo Translation] {{en icon}})&lt;/ref&gt; "Negro villages" would be presented in Paris' 1878 and 1879 World's Fair; the 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] "living" in Madagascar, while the Colonial Exhibitions in Marseilles (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) would also display human beings in cages, often nudes or quasi-nudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverparis.net/newsletter.html?insight=3162983825694464 |title=February 2003, the end of an era |publisher=Discoverparis.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomadic "[[Senegal]]ese villages" were also created, thus displaying the power of the colonial empire to all the population.

In the US, [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[New York Zoological Society]], exposed [[Pygmies|Pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]] alongside the apes and others in 1906. At the behest of Grant, a prominent [[scientific racist]] and [[eugenicist]], zoo director Hornaday placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him "The Missing Link" in an attempt to illustrate [[Darwinism]], and in particular that Africans like Ota Benga are closer to apes than were Europeans. Other colonial exhibitions included the 1924 [[British Empire Exhibition]] and the successful 1931 Paris "Exposition coloniale".

===Countering disease===
From the beginning of the 20th century onward, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=696 Conquest and Disease or Colonialism and Health?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015726/http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=696 |date=2008-12-07 }}, Gresham College | Lectures and Events.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Slavery abolition===
{{Main|Slavery in Africa#Abolition}}
The continuing [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] in Europe became a reason and an excuse for the conquest and colonization of the Africa. It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889-90]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

==Colonialism leading to World War I==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Victoria (Cameroon).jpg|thumb|[[German Cameroon]], painting by [[Rudolf Hellgrewe|R. Hellgrewe]], 1908]]
During the New Imperialism period, by the end of the 19th century, Europe added almost {{Convert|9000000|mi2}} – one-fifth of the land area of the globe – to its overseas colonial possessions. Europe's formal holdings now included the entire African continent except [[Ethiopia]], [[Liberia]], and [[Saguia el-Hamra]], the latter of which would be integrated into [[Spanish Sahara]]. Between 1885 and 1914, Britain took nearly 30% of Africa's population under its control; 15% for France, 11% for Portugal, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and 1% for [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Nigeria]] alone contributed 15 million subjects, more than in the whole of [[French West Africa]] or the entire German colonial empire. It was paradoxical that Britain, the staunch advocate of free trade, emerged in 1914 with not only the largest overseas empire thanks to its long-standing presence in [[British Raj|India]], but also the greatest gains in the "scramble for Africa", reflecting its advantageous position at its inception. In terms of surface area occupied, the French were the marginal victors but much of their territory consisted of the sparsely populated [[Sahara]].

The political imperialism followed the economic expansion, with the "colonial lobbies" bolstering [[chauvinism]] and [[jingoism]] at each crisis in order to legitimise the colonial enterprise. The tensions between the imperial powers led to a succession of crises, which finally exploded in August 1914, when previous rivalries and alliances created a domino situation that drew the major European nations into World War I. [[Austria-Hungary]] attacked [[Serbia]] to avenge the murder by Serbian agents of Austrian crown prince Francis Ferdinand, [[Russia]] would mobilise to assist allied Serbia, Germany would intervene to support Austria-Hungary against Russia. Since Russia had a military alliance with France against Germany, the [[German General Staff]], led by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|General von Moltke]] decided to realise the well prepared [[Schlieffen Plan]] to invade and quickly knock France out of the war before turning against Russia in what was expected to be a long campaign. This required an invasion of Belgium which brought Britain into the war against Germany, Austria-Hungary and their allies. German [[U-Boat]] campaigns against ships bound for Britain eventually drew the [[United States]] into what had become World War I. Moreover, using the Anglo-Japanese Alliance as an excuse, [[Japan]] leaped onto this opportunity to conquer German interests in [[China]] and the [[Pacific]] to become the dominating power in the Western Pacific, setting the stage for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (starting in 1937) and eventually [[World War II]].

Once these two areas were secure, it was the intent of British colonialists such as [[Cecil Rhodes]] to establish a Cape-Cairo railway and to exploit mineral and agricultural resources. Control of the [[Nile]] was viewed as a strategic and commercial advantage.

===Independent states===
[[Liberia]] was the only nation in Africa that was a colony and a [[protectorate]] of the [[United States]]. Liberia was founded, colonised, established and controlled by the [[American Colonization Society]], a private organisation established in order to relocate freed [[African-American]] and Caribbean slaves from the United States and the Caribbean islands in 1821. Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847. Liberia is Africa's oldest [[democratic republic]], and the second-oldest black republic in the world (after [[Haiti]]).

[[Ethiopia]] maintained its independence from Italy after the [[Battle of Adwa]] which resulted in the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]]. With the exception of the occupation between 1936 and 1941 by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s military forces, Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent nation.

=== Modern Scramble for Africa ===
[[File:Sudan Map Oelgas.png|thumb|190px|Oil and gas concessions in [[Sudan]] – 2004]]
The new scramble for Africa began with the emergence of the Afro-Neo-Liberal capitalist movement in Post-Colonial Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Southall, Roger and Melber, Henning. ''A New Scramble For Africa?: Imperialism, Investment and Development,'' (University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2009) p 40&lt;/ref&gt; When African nations began to gain independence during the Post World War II Era, their post colonial economic structures remained undiversified and linear. In most cases, the bulk of a nation’s economy relied on [[cash crops]] or [[natural resources]]. The decolonisation process kept independent African nations at the mercy of colonial powers due to structurally-dependent economic relations. Structural adjustment programs led to the privatization and liberalization of many African political and economic systems, forcefully pushing Africa into the global capitalist market.  The economic decline in the 1990s fostered democratization by the [[World Bank]] intervening in the political and economic affairs of Africa once again. All of these factors led to Africa’s forced development under Western ideological systems of economics and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Southall and Melber, ''A New Scramble For Africa?: Imperialism, Investment and Development,''  pp 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petro-states ===

In the era of [[globalization]], many African countries have emerged as petro-states (for example Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Angola). These are nations with an economic and political partnership between transnational oil companies and the ruling elite class in oil-rich African nations.&lt;ref&gt;Southall, Roger and Melber, Henning. “A New Scramble For Africa?: Imperialism, Investment and Development,” South Africa:  University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2009: 46/47&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous countries have entered into a neo-imperial relationship with Africa during this time period. Mary Gilmartin notes that “material and symbolic appropriation of space [is] central to imperial expansion and control”; nations in the [[globalization]] era who invest in controlling land internationally are engaging in [[Neocolonialism|neo-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallaher, Carolyn et al. “Key Concepts in Political Geography,” London: Sage Printing Press, 2009: 123&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese (and other Asian countries) state oil companies have entered Africa’s highly competitive oil sector. [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] purchased 40% of Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company. Furthermore, Sudan exports 50–60% of its domestically produced oil to [[China]], making up 7% of China’s imports. China has also been purchasing equity shares in African oil fields, invested in industry related infrastructure development and acquired continental oil concessions throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Southall, Roger and Melber, Henning. “A New Scramble For Africa?: Imperialism, Investment and Development,” South Africa: University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2009: 192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simone Strey''' is a German internet [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] who is co-founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the mobile crop advisory app Plantix. For her work, she was honored with the [[TR35|Innovators under 35 Award]] by [[MIT Technology Review|MIT technology review]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Diagnose-per-Bilderkennung-3243259.html|title=Die Botanikerin Simone Strey (32) will Pflanzenkrankheiten besser diagnostizieren.|last=Stieler|first=Wolfgang|date=21 June 2016|website=heise.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Strey was born and raised in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. She studied geography with a focus on [[geobotanic]] and soil science at the [[University of Hanover]].

== Career ==
As a PhD candidate, Strey worked on several scientific papers dealing with carbon stocks in soil and sustainable land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strey et al.|first=Simone|date=January 2018|title=Seeing the forest not for the carbon: why concentrating on land-use-induced carbon stock changes of soils in Brazil can be climate-unfriendly|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10113-016-1008-1|journal=Regional Environmental Change|volume=18|pages=63–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strey et al.|first=Simone|date=January 2016|title=Future land use and land cover in Southern Amazonia and resulting greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-017-1235-0|journal=Regional Environmental Change|volume=18|pages=129–142|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strey et al.|first=Simone|date=19 October 2017|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE VALUE OF DEEP SOIL CARBON FOR POTENTIAL REDD+ PROJECTS IN TROPICAL FOREST COMMUNITIES IN AMAZONIA|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jens_Boy/publication/319972294_Digging_deeper_The_value_of_deep_soil_carbon_for_potential_REDD_projects_in_tropical_forest_communities_in_Amazonia/links/59e8904c458515c363133ecd/Digging-deeper-The-value-of-deep-soil-carbon-for-potential-REDD-projects-in-tropical-forest-communities-in-Amazonia.pdf|journal=Erdkunde|volume=71|pages=231–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Mekranoti, an indigenous tribe of the [[Kayapo]] nation in [[Brazil|Brazil's]] [[Pará|Pará state]], she investigated the carbon content of the soil to a depth of {{Convert|10|m|}} in an untouched forest in Amazonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIStcYWN4oM|title=Deep carbon stocks in the Brazilian Mekragnoti (Kayapó) territory – REDD|last=|first=|date=27 August 2016|work=Youtube|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Strey was also co-founder of Green Desert e.V. in 2008 and has been chairman of the association since then.

=== Plantix ===
The idea for Plantix began in 2014 as a scientific crowdsourcing science project called "Garden Bank", which was initiated together with Robert Strey, Pierre Munzel, Charlotte Schumann, Alexander Kennepohl, Bianca Kummer and Korbinian Hartberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gruender.wiwo.de/peat-digitaler-pflanzendoktor-punktet-auf-cebit/|title=Peat: Digitaler Pflanzendoktor punktet auf der Cebit|last=|first=|date=20 March 2017|website=wiwo.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Strey co-founded the PEAT [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], which is responsible for the Plantix app, with the above-mentioned team in 2015. Strey received the Exist startup scholarship for the idea of automated detection of plant diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exist.de/DE/Campus/Gruendergeist/EXIST-Erfolge/PEAT-GmbH/inhalt.html|title=PEAT-GmbH|last=|first=|date=May 2017|website=exist.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2017, Plantix had raised [[venture capital]] and successfully closed the [[Series A round|series A]] with [[Index Ventures|Index Venture]].

Spanish claims to [[Alaska]] and the [[history of the West Coast of North America|West Coast of North America]] date to the [[Inter caetera|papal bull of 1493]], and the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. In 1513, this claim was reinforced by Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]], the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]], when he claimed all lands adjoining this ocean for the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]]. Spain only started to colonize the claimed territory north of present-day Mexico in the 18th century, when it settled the northern coast of [[Las Californias]] (California).

Starting in the mid-18th century, Spain's rights began to be challenged by [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian]] fur traders and colonizers. King [[Charles III of Spain]] and his successors sent a number of expeditions from [[New Spain]] to present-day Canada and Alaska between 1774 and 1793, to counter this threat and to defend Spanish territorial rights. During this period in history, a nation's claims or rights to a certain territory were legitimized by exploration and "prior to Spanish discovery".

==1774 voyage of Pérez==
The first voyage was that of [[Juan José Pérez Hernández]] of the frigate ''Santiago'' (alias ''Nueva Galicia''&lt;ref name=pacific&gt;{{cite book |author= Geographical Society of the Pacific |title= Transactions and Proceedings of the Geographical Society of the Pacific, Volume 4 |location= San Francisco |year= 1907 |oclc= 15737543 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f2s9AAAAYAAJ |pages= 108, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sala&gt;{{cite book |last= Rodríguez Sala |first= María Luisa |title= De San Blas Hasta la Alta California: Los Viajes y Diarios de Juan Joseph Pérez Hernández |publisher= Universidad Autónoma de México |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-970-32-3474-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zcjBYIPI9J8C |language= Spanish |page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Although intending to reach Alaska, the expedition turned back at [[Haida Gwaii]]. Pérez and his crew of 86 were the first Europeans to visit the [[Pacific Northwest]].

==1775 voyage of Heceta and Bodega y Quadra==
In 1775 a second voyage of ninety men led by Lieutenant [[Bruno de Heceta]] aboard the ''Santiago'', set sail from [[San Blas, Nayarit]] on March 16, 1775 with orders to make clear Spanish claims for the entire Northwestern Pacific Coast. Accompanying Heceta was the [[schooner]] ''Sonora'', alias ''Felicidad'',&lt;ref name=pacific/&gt;&lt;ref name=sala/&gt; (also known as the ''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe''), initially under the command of [[Juan Manuel de Ayala]]. The {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=on}} long&lt;ref name=pethick&gt;{{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= First Approaches to the Northwest Coast |publisher= J.J. Douglas |location= Vancouver |year= 1976 |isbn= 0-88894-056-4 |page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sonora'' and its crew complement of 16 were to perform coastal reconnaissance and mapping, and could make landfall in places the larger ''Santiago'' was unable to approach on its previous voyage; in this way, the expedition could officially reassert Spanish claims to the lands north of [[New Spain]] it visited. Ayala took command of the [[packet boat]] ''San Carlos'', alias  ''Toysón de Oro'',&lt;ref name=pacific/&gt; also sailing with the expedition, after its initial commander, Miguel Manrique, took ill soon after leaving San Blas. Heceta then gave [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra|Bodega y Quadra]] command of the ''Sonora''. [[Francisco Antonio Mourelle]] served as Bodega y Quadra's pilot and the two forged a strong and enduring friendship.

The three vessels sailed together as far as [[Monterey Bay]] in [[Alta California]]. Ayala's mission was to explore the [[Golden Gate]] strait while Heceta and Bodega y Quadra continued north. Ayala and the crew of the ''San Carlos'' became the first Europeans known to enter [[San Francisco Bay]]. The ''Santiago'' and ''Sonora'' continued sailing north together as far as [[Point Grenville]], named ''Punta de los Martires'' (or "Point of the Martyrs") by Heceta in response to an attack by the local [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indians]]. The vessels parted company on the evening of July 29, 1775. Scurvy had so weakened the crew of the ''Santiago'' that Heceta decided to return to San Blas. On the way south he discovered the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] between present day [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  Juan Pérez, who was serving as Heceta's pilot, died during the voyage south.

Bodega y Quadra, in the ''Sonora'', moved up the coast according to the expedition's orders, ultimately reaching the [[59th parallel north|latitude 59° north]] on August 15, and entering [[Sitka Sound]] near the present-day town of [[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka, Alaska]]. During the return voyage south Bodega y Quadra discovered, named, and explored a portion of [[Bucareli Bay]] on the west side of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]].

During Bodega y Quadra's voyage numerous "acts of [[sovereignty]]" were performed. Many place names were given, including Puerto de Bucareli (Bucareli Bay), Puerto de los Remedios, and Mount San Jacinto, renamed [[Mount Edgecumbe (Alaska)|Mount Edgecumbe]] by [[England|British]] explorer [[James Cook]] three years later.

==1779 voyage of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra==
[[File:Spanish contact in BC and Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Areas of Alaska and British Columbia Explored by Spain]]
A third voyage took place in 1779 under the command of [[Ignacio de Arteaga]] with two armed [[corvettes]]: the ''Favorita'' under Arteaga, and the ''[[La Princesa (1778)|Princesa]]'' under Bodega y Quadra. With Arteaga on the ''Favorita'' was second officer Fernando Quiros y Miranda, surgeon Juan Garcia, pilot Jose Camacho, and second pilot [[Juan Pantoja y Arriaga]]. With Bodega y Quadra on the ''Princesa'' was second officer Francisco Antonio Mourelle, surgeon Mariano Nunez Esquivel, pilot Jose Canizares, and second pilot Juan Bautista Aguirre.&lt;ref name=SpanishNavy&gt;{{cite web |title= The Spanish Navy in the Californias during the Revolutionary War Era |publisher= The California State Military Museum |url= http://www.militarymuseum.org/SpanishNavy.html |accessdate= 6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition's objective was to evaluate the Russian penetration of Alaska, search for a Northwest Passage, and capture [[James Cook]] if they found him in Spanish waters. Spain had learned about Cook's 1778 explorations along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. In June 1779, during the expedition of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra, Spain entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] as an ally of France, precipitating a parallel [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Anglo-Spanish War]], which continued until the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra did not find Cook, who had been killed in Hawaii in February 1779.&lt;ref name=SpanishNavy/&gt;

During the voyage Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra carefully surveyed Bucareli Bay then headed north to [[Port Etches]] on [[Hinchinbrook Island (Alaska)|Hinchinbrook Island]]. They entered [[Prince William Sound]] and reached a latitude of 61°, the most northern point obtained by the Spanish explorations of Alaska. They also explored [[Cook Inlet]], and the [[Kenai Peninsula]], where a possession ceremony was performed on August 2, in what today is called Port Chatham. Due to various sicknesses among the crew Arteaga returned to California without finding the Russians.

Throughout the voyage, the crews of both vessels endured many hardships, including food shortages and scurvy. On September 8, the ships rejoined and headed south for the return trip to San Blas. Although the Spanish were normally secretive about their exploring voyages and the discoveries made, the 1779 voyage of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra became widely known. [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Perouse]] obtained a copy of their map, which was published in 1798. Mourelle's journal was acquired and published in London in 1798 by Daines Barrington.

After these three exploration voyages to Alaska within five years there were no further Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest until 1788, after the Treaty of Paris ended the war between Spain and Britain. During the war Spain dedicated the port of San Blas to the war effort in the Philippines. Voyages of exploration were suspended. Support of Alta California, which depended upon San Blas, was minimal. By 1786 Alta California had become nearly self-supporting and peace with Britain was restored, making further voyages to Alaska possible.&lt;ref name=SpanishNavy/&gt;

==1788 voyage of Martínez and Haro==
In March, 1788, two ships were sent north from San Blas to investigate Russian activity. [[Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra|Esteban José Martínez]], on the ''Princesa'', was in command of the expedition, accompanied by the ''San Carlos'' under [[Gonzalo López de Haro]], with [[José María Narváez]] serving as Haro's pilot. The ships arrived at [[Prince William Sound]] in May. Following evidence of Russian fur trading activity the ships sailed west. In June Haro reached [[Kodiak Island]] and learned from the natives that a Russian post was nearby.&lt;ref name=mcdowell&gt;{{cite book |last= McDowell |first= Jim |title= José Narváez: The Forgotten Explorer |year= 1998 |publisher= The Arthur H. Clark Company |location= Spokane, Washington |isbn= 0-87062-265-X |pages= 24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1788, Haro sent Narváez in a longboat to look for the Russian post at [[Three Saints Bay, Alaska|Three Saints Bay]]. Narváez found the post, becoming the first Spaniard to make contact with a large contingent of Russians in Alaska. Narváez took the Russian commander, [[Evstratii Ivanovich Delarov|Evstrat Delarov]] to meet Haro on the ''San Carlos'', then returned him to his outpost. Delarov gave Narváez a Russian map of the Alaskan coast and indicated the locations of seven Russian posts containing nearly 500 men. Delarov also told Narváez that the Russians intended to occupy [[Nootka Sound]], on the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]].

After this meeting Haro sailed east and joined Martínez at [[Sitkinak Island]]. Using the information acquired from Delarov, the expedition sailed to [[Unalaska Island]], where there was a large Russian post, also called [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], under the command of [[Potap Kuzmich Zaikov]]. Martínez arrived on July 29, Haro on August 4. Zaikov gave Martínez three maps covering the [[Aleutian Islands]]. He also confirmed that the Russians planned to take possession of Nootka Sound the next year.&lt;ref name=mcdowell/&gt; Zaikov explained that two Russian frigates were already on their way, and a third which was to sail to Nootka Sound. He was referring to the 1789 expedition of [[Joseph Billings]], but greatly exaggerating its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haycox |first= Stephen W. |title= Alaska: an American Colony |publisher= [[University of Washington Press]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-295-98249-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8yu3pYpzLdUC |page= 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2267 Billings, Joseph], Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt; The visit to Unalaska marks the westernmost point reached during the Spanish voyages of exploration in Alaska.

The Spanish expedition left Unalaska on August 18, 1788, heading south for California and Mexico. Due to increasing conflict between Martínez and Haro, the ships broke off contact within three days sailed south separately. Martínez had allowed this but ordered Haro to rejoin him at [[Monterey, California]]. But during the voyage south Haro, with support from Narváez and the other pilots, declared his ship no longer under Martínez's command. They sailed back to San Blas on their own, arriving on October 22, 1788. Martínez spent a month in Monterey waiting for Haro. He arrived at San Blas in December, where he found himself faced with charges of irresponsible leadership. He soon regained favor and was placed in charge of a new expedition to occupy Nootka Sound before the Russians did.&lt;ref name=mcdowell/&gt; This expedition took place in 1789, culminating in the [[Nootka Crisis]].

==1789 settlement in Nootka Sound==
Following up on the 1788 voyage to Alaska, Martínez and Haro were ordered to preemptively take possession of [[Nootka Sound]] before the Russians or British could. Events at Nootka Sound in 1789 led to the [[Nootka Crisis]]. During the summer of 1789 Martínez sent [[José María Narváez]] to explore the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] in the ''Santa Gertrudis la Magna'' (formerly the ''Northwest America'', a British vessel captured earlier by Martínez at Nootka Sound). Narváez found the Strait of Juan de Fuca to be a large inlet with much promise for further exploration. By the end of the year Martínez abandoned Nootka Sound.

==1790 Spanish base in Nootka Sound==
The Nootka Crisis became a major international incident nearly leading to war between Spain and Britain. As the process unfolded, the Viceroy of New Spain decided it was important to establish a permanent base at Nootka Sound. Three ships sailed to Nootka Sound, with [[Francisco de Eliza]] as the overall commander and captain of the ''Concepción''. [[Manuel Quimper]] captained the ''[[Princess Royal (sloop)|Princesa Real]]'' (the Spanish name for the British vessel ''Princess Royal'', captured by Martínez in 1789). [[Salvador Fidalgo]] captained the ''San Carlos''. The first settlement in present-day British Columbia was built on Nootka Sound, [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]] as well as [[Fort San Miguel]], manned by soldiers of the First Company of [[Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia]], under [[Pedro de Alberni]]. After getting settled, Eliza dispatched Fidalgo and Quimper on exploration voyages. Fidalgo was sent north and Quimper south.

==1790 voyage of Fidalgo==
In 1790, Spanish explorer [[Salvador Fidalgo]] took the ''San Carlos'' to Alaska, visiting and naming Cordova Bay and Port Valdez in Prince William Sound. Acts of sovereignty were performed at both places. Fidalgo entered Cook Inlet and found the Russian post Pavlovskaia, the Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin Company post at the mouth of the Kenai River. Fidalgo did not stop at the post but continued west to Kodiak Island, where he noted Shelikov's post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haycox |first= Stephen W. |title= Alaska: an American Colony |publisher= [[University of Washington Press]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-295-98249-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8yu3pYpzLdUC |page= 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidalgo then went to the Russian settlement at Alexandrovsk (today's English Bay or [[Nanwalek, Alaska]]), southwest of today's [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] on the Kenai Peninsula, where again, Fidalgo asserted the Spanish claim to the area by conducting a formal ceremony of sovereignty.&lt;ref name=FidalRey&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/bios/bl-cordova2.htm History of Spanish exploration of Pacific Northwest and Alaska]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1790 voyage of Quimper==
In 1790 [[Manuel Quimper]], with officers López de Haro and [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]], sailed the ''Princesa Real'' into the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], following up on voyage of Narváez the previous year. Quimper sailed to the eastern end of the Strait of [[Juan de Fuca]], discovering the [[San Juan Islands]] and many straits and inlets. Having limited time he had to return to Nootka without fully exploring the promising straits and inlets. Contrary winds made it impossible to sail the small vessel to Nootka, so Quimper went south to San Blas instead.

==1791 voyage of Eliza==
In 1791 [[Francisco de Eliza]] was ordered to continue the exploration of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The voyage consisted of two vessels. Eliza sailed on the ''San Carlos'', with Pantoja as his pilot (master). Narváez sailed on the ''Santa Saturnina'', with Carrasco and Verdía as pilots. During the voyage the [[Strait of Georgia]] was discovered, and Narváez conducted a quick exploration of most of it. Eliza sailed the ''San Carlos'' back to Nootka Sound, but the ''Santa Saturnina'', under Carrasco, failed to reach Nootka and instead sailed south to Monterey and San Blas. In Monterey Carrasco met [[Alessandro Malaspina]] and told him about the discovery of the Strait of Georgia. This meeting led directly to the 1792 voyage of Galiano and Valdés.

==1789-1794 voyage of Malaspina and Bustamante==
{{Main|Malaspina Expedition}}
The King of Spain gave [[Alessandro Malaspina|Alejandro Malaspina]] and [[José de Bustamante y Guerra]] command of an around-the-world scientific expedition with two corvettes, the [[Descubierta and Atrevida|''Descubierta'' and ''Atrevida'']]. One of the king's orders was to investigate a possible [[Northwest Passage]]. The expedition was also to search for [[gold]], precious stones, and any [[United States|American]], British, or Russian settlements along the northwest coast. Arriving in Alaska in 1791, Malaspina and Bustamante surveyed the coast to the Prince William Sound. At [[Yakutat Bay]], the expedition made contact with the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]. Spanish scholars made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and [[José Cardero]], produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. [[Malaspina Glacier]], between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named after Alessandro Malaspina.

==1792 voyage of Galiano and Valdés==
In 1792 [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]], on the ''[[Sutil (ship)|Sutil]]'', and [[Cayetano Valdés y Flores]], on the ''[[Mexicana (ship)|Mexicana]]'', sailed from San Blas to Nootka Sound, then circumnavigated [[Vancouver Island]]. An account of the voyage of Galiano and Valdés, in contrast, was published in Spain and widely promoted, overshadowing the more significant voyage of Malaspina, who had become a political prisoner shortly after returning to Spain.

==1792 voyage of Caamaño==
[[Jacinto Caamaño]], commander of the frigate ''Aránzazu'', sailed to Bucareli Bay in 1792. [[Juan Pantoja y Arriaga]] served as his pilot. Caamaño conducted a detailed survey of the coast south to [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. By 1792 much of the coast had already been visited by European explorers, but some areas had been overlooked, such as the southern part of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. A number of Caamaño's place names in the area have survived, such as Cordova Bay, [[Revillagigedo Channel]], Bocas de Quadra, and in what is now called [[Caamaño Passage]], [[Zayas Island]] (named for his second pilot, Juan Zayas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spanish Place Names on the Face of Alaska |publisher=ExploreNorth |url= http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-Spanish1.htm |accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/jcr/~vspanish1 |title= Spanish explorers |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100209052910/http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/jcr/~vspanish1 |archive-date= February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No report on Caamaño's voyage was published until long after and his discoveries remained obscure, although [[George Vancouver]] apparently met Caamaño and obtained copies of his maps, especially of areas north of [[Dixon Entrance]]. Vancouver later incorporated some of Caamaño's place names into his atlas.

==1793 voyage of Eliza and Martínez y Zayas==
In 1793 Francisco de Eliza and [[Juan Martínez y Zayas]] surveyed the coast between the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and the [[San Francisco Bay]]. They also explored the mouth of the [[Columbia River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |page= 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

[[File:NutcaEN.png|thumb|Spanish territorial claims in the North West Coast of North America, 18th century]]

In the end Spain withdrew from the North Pacific and transferred its claims in the region to the United States in the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. Today, Spain's legacy in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest endures as a number of place names, such as [[Malaspina Glacier]], [[Revillagigedo Island]], the towns of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], and numerous smaller features.

'''''Nahiyah''''' ({{Lang-ar|ناحية}}) or subdistrict is the third-level [[administrative division]] in [[Iraq]].

Iraq is divided into 18 ''[[Muhafazah]]'' ({{Lang-ar|محافظة}}) (See: [[Governorates of Iraq]]) which are divided into more than 130 ''[[Kaza]]'' ({{Lang-ar|قضاء}}) (See: [[Districts of Iraq]]). These districts are divided into subdistricts.

'''Sven Anders Hedin,''' [[Order of the Polar Star|KNO1kl]] [[Order of Vasa|RVO]],&lt;ref name="En biografi"&gt;Wennerholm, Eric (1978) ''Sven Hedin - En biografi'', Bonniers, Stockholm {{ISBN|978-9-10043-621-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (19 February 1865  – 26 November 1952) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[geographer]], [[topographer]], [[explorer]], [[photographer]], travel writer, and [[illustrator]] of his own works. During four expeditions to [[Central Asia]], he made the [[Transhimalaya]] known in the West and located sources of the [[Brahmaputra]], [[Indus]] and [[Sutlej]] Rivers. He also mapped lake [[Lop Nur]], and the remains of cities, grave sites and the [[Great Wall of China]] in the deserts of the [[Tarim Basin]]. In his book ''[[Från pol till pol]]'' (''From Pole to Pole''), Hedin describes a journey through Asia and Europe between the late 1880s and the early 1900s. While traveling, Hedin visited [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), [[Caucasus]], [[Tehran]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]), lands of the [[Kyrgyz people]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Russian Far East|Asiatic Russia]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedin, Anders Sven (1911) [https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=P0gNAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA69 ''Från pol till pol: genom Asien och Europa''], Bonnier, Stockholm {{oclc|601660137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posthumous publication of his ''Central Asia Atlas'' marked the conclusion of his life's work.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Anders Hedin; Nils Peter Ambolt (1966) ''Central Asia Atlas'', Statens etnografiska museum, Stockholm {{oclc|240272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
At 15 years of age, Hedin witnessed the triumphal return of the [[Arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] after his first navigation of the [[Northern Sea Route]]. From that moment on, young Sven aspired to become an explorer. His studies under the German geographer and China expert, [[Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen]], awakened a love of Germany in Hedin and strengthened his resolve to undertake expeditions to [[Central Asia]] in order to explore the last uncharted areas of Asia.  After obtaining a doctorate, learning several languages and dialects, and undertaking two trips through [[Persia]], he ignored the advice of Ferdinand von Richthofen to continue his geographic studies in order to acquaint himself with geographical research methodology; the result was that Hedin had to leave the evaluation of his expedition results later to other scientists.

Between 1894 and 1908, in three daring expeditions through the mountains and deserts of Central Asia, he mapped and researched parts of Chinese [[Turkestan]] (officially [[Xinjiang]]) and [[Tibet]] which had been unexplored until then. Upon his return to Stockholm in 1909 he was received as triumphantly as Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. In 1902, he became the last Swede (to date) to be raised to the untitled nobility and was considered one of Sweden's most important personalities. As a member of two scientific academies, he had a voice in the selection of [[Nobel Prize]] winners for both science and literature. Hedin never married and had no children, rendering his family line now extinct.

Hedin's expedition notes laid the foundations for a precise mapping of Central Asia. He was one of the first European scientific explorers to employ indigenous scientists and research assistants on his expeditions. Although primarily an explorer, he was also the first to unearth the ruins of ancient Buddhist cities in Chinese Central Asia. However, as his main interest in archaeology was finding ancient cities, he had little interest in gathering data thorough scientific excavations.  Of small stature, with a bookish, bespectacled appearance, Hedin nevertheless proved himself a determined explorer, surviving several close brushes with death from hostile forces and the elements over his long career. His scientific documentation and popular travelogues, illustrated with his own photographs, watercolor paintings and drawings, his adventure stories for young readers and his lecture tours abroad made him world-famous.

As a renowned expert on Turkestan and Tibet, he was able to obtain unrestricted access to European and Asian monarchs and politicians as well as to their geographical societies and scholarly associations. They all sought to purchase his exclusive knowledge about the power vacuum in Central Asia with gold medals, diamond-encrusted grand crosses, honorary doctorates and splendid receptions, as well as with logistic and financial support for his expeditions. Hedin, in addition to [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], Sir [[Francis Younghusband]], and Sir [[Aurel Stein]], was an active player in the British-Russian struggle for influence in Central Asia, known as the [[Great Game]]. Their travels were supported because they filled in the "white spaces" in contemporary maps, providing valuable information.&lt;ref name="Nalle"&gt;{{cite journal

Hedin was and remained a figure of the 19th century who clung to its visions and methods also in the 20th century. This prevented him from discerning the fundamental social and political upheavals of the 20th century and aligning his thinking and actions accordingly.

Concerned about the security of Scandinavia, he favored the construction of the battleship [[Sverige class battleship|''Sverige'']]. In [[World War I]] he specifically allied himself in his publications with the German monarchy and its conduct of the war. Because of this political involvement, his scientific reputation was damaged among Germany's wartime enemies, along with his memberships in their geographical societies and learned associations, as well as any support for his planned expeditions.

After a less-than-successful lecture tour in 1923 through North America and Japan, he traveled on to Beijing to carry out an expedition to Chinese Turkestan (modern Xinjiang), but the region's unstable political situation thwarted this intention. He instead traveled through [[Mongolia]] by car and through [[Siberia]] aboard the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].

With financial support from the governments of Sweden and Germany, he led, between 1927 and 1935, an international and interdisciplinary Sino-Swedish Expedition to carry out scientific investigations in Mongolia and Chinese Turkestan, with the participation of 37 scientists from six countries. Despite Chinese counter-demonstrations and after months of negotiations in China, was he able to make the expedition also a Chinese one by obtaining Chinese research commissions and the participation of Chinese scientists. He also concluded a contract which guaranteed freedom of travel for this expedition which, because of its arms, 300 camels, and activities in a war theater, resembled an invading army. However, the financing remained Hedin's private responsibility.

Because of failing health, the civil war in Chinese Turkestan, and a long period of captivity, Hedin, by then 70 years of age, had a difficult time after the currency depreciation of the [[Great Depression]] raising the money required for the expedition, the [[logistics]] for assuring the supplying of the expedition in an active war zone, and obtaining access for the expedition's participants to a research area intensely contested by local [[warlord]]s. Nevertheless, the expedition was a scientific success. The archaeological artifacts which had been sent to Sweden were scientifically assessed for three years, after which they were returned to China under the terms of the contract.

Starting in 1937, the scientific material assembled during the expedition was published in over 50 volumes by Hedin and other expedition participants, thereby making it available for worldwide research on eastern Asia. When he ran out of money to pay printing costs, he pawned his extensive and valuable library, which filled several rooms, making possible the publication of additional volumes.

[[File:Himalaya composite.jpg|thumb|A view of the entire area of [[Central Asia]] opened up for cartography and research by Hedin in his expeditions. Below the [[Himalaya]] and [[Transhimalaya]] ranges, in the middle the [[Tibetan plateau]], above which is the [[Pamir Mountain]] range with the [[Tarim Basin]] and the [[Taklamakan Desert]] alongside.]]

In 1935, Hedin made his exclusive knowledge about Central Asia available, not only to the Swedish government, but also to foreign governments such as China and Germany, in lectures and personal discussions with political representatives of Chiang Kai-shek and Adolf Hitler.

Although he was not a National Socialist, Hedin's hope that [[Nazi Germany]] would protect Scandinavia from invasion by the Soviet Union, brought him in dangerous proximity to representatives of National Socialism, who exploited him as an author. This destroyed his reputation and put him into social and scientific isolation. However, in correspondence and personal conversations with leading Nazis, his successful intercessions achieved the pardoning of ten people condemned to death and the release or survival of Jews who had been deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]].

At the end of the war, U.S. troops deliberately confiscated documents relating to Hedin's planned ''Central Asia Atlas''. The ''U.S. Army Map Service'' later solicited Hedin's assistance and financed the printing and publication of his life's work, the ''Central Asia Atlas''. Whoever compares this atlas with ''[[Stielers Handatlas|Adolf Stielers Hand Atlas]]'' of 1891 can appreciate what Hedin accomplished between 1893 and 1935.

Although Hedin's research was taboo in Germany and Sweden because of his conduct relating to Nazi Germany, and stagnated for decades in Germany, the scientific documentation of his expeditions was translated into Chinese by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] and incorporated into Chinese research. Following recommendations made by Hedin to the Chinese government in 1935, the routes he selected were used to construct streets and train tracks, as well as dams and canals to irrigate new farms being established in the Tarim and Yanji basins in Xinjiang and the deposits of iron, manganese, oil, coal and gold discovered during the Sino-Swedish Expedition were opened up for mining. Among the discoveries of this expedition should also be counted the many Asian plants and animals unheard of until that date, as well as fossil remains of dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Many were named after Hedin, the species-level [[scientific classification]] being ''hedini''. But one discovery remained unknown to Chinese researchers until the turn of the millennium: in the Lop Nur desert, Hedin discovered in 1933 and 1934 ruins of signal towers which prove that the [[Great Wall of China]] once extended as far west as [[Xinjiang]].

From 1931 until his death in 1952, Hedin lived in Stockholm in a modern high-rise in a preferred location, the address being Norr Mälarstrand 66. He lived with his siblings in the upper three stories and from the balcony he had a wide view over [[Riddarfjärden]] Bay and Lake [[Mälaren]] to the island of [[Långholmen]]. In the entryway to the stairwell is to be found a decorative [[stucco]] relief map of Hedin's research area in Central Asia and a relief of the Lama temple, a copy of which he had brought to Chicago for the [[1933 World's Fair]].

On 29 October 1952, Hedin's will granted the rights to his books and his extensive personal effects to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]; the Sven Hedin Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Sven Hedin Foundation| url=http://www.etnografiska.se/smvk/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1681&amp;l=en_US | publisher=Museum of Ethnography, Stockholm | accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; established soon thereafter holds all the rights of ownership.

Hedin died at Stockholm in 1952. The memorial service was attended by representatives of the Swedish royal household, the Swedish government, the Swedish Academy, and the diplomatic service. He is buried in the cemetery of [[Adolf Fredriks kyrka|Adolf Fredrik church]] in Stockholm.

==Biography==

===Childhood influences===
Sven Hedin was born in Stockholm, the son of Ludwig Hedin, Chief Architect of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/shedin.htm |title=Sven Hedin |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729175328/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/shedin.htm |archivedate=29 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When he was 15 years old Hedin witnessed the triumphal return of the Swedish [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] after his first navigation of the [[Northern Sea Route]].

[[File:Return of the Vega to Stockholm 24. April 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stockholm]] on 24 April 1880]]

He describes this experience in his book ''My Life as an Explorer'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On April 24, 1880, the [[Vega (ship)|steamer Vega]] sailed into [[Stockholms ström]]. The entire city was illuminated. The buildings around the harbor glowed in the light of innumerable lamps and torches. Gas flames depicted the [[Vega|constellation of Vega]] on the castle. Amidst this sea of light the famous ship glided into the harbor. I was standing on the Södermalm heights with my parents and siblings, from which we had a superb view. I was gripped by great nervous tension. I will remember this day until I die, as it was decisive for my future. Thunderous jubilation resounded from quays, streets, windows and rooftops. “That is how I want to return home some day,” I thought to myself.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===First trip to Iran (Persia)===
In May 1885, Hedin graduated from Beskowska secondary school in Stockholm. He then accepted an offer to accompany the student Erhard Sandgren as his private tutor to [[Baku]], where Sandgren's father was working as an engineer in the oil fields of [[Robert Nobel]]. Afterward he attended a course in topography for general staff officers for one month in summer 1885 and took a few weeks of instruction in portrait drawing; this comprised his entire training in those areas.

On 15 August 1885, he traveled to Baku with Erhard Sandgren and instructed him there for seven months, and he himself began to learn the [[Latin language|Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]] languages. He later learned several Persian dialects as well as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and some [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

On 6 April 1886, Hedin left Baku for [[Iran]] (then called Persia), traveling by [[paddle steamer]] over the Caspian Sea, riding through the [[Alborz]] Range to [[Tehran]], [[Esfahan]], [[Shiraz]] and the harbor city of [[Bushehr]]. From there he took a ship up the [[Tigris River]] to [[Baghdad]] (then in [[Ottoman Empire]]), returning to Tehran via [[Kermanshah]], and then travelling through the [[Caucasus]] and over the [[Black Sea]] to [[Constantinople]]. Hedin then returned to Sweden, arriving on 18 September 1886.

In 1887, Hedin published a book about these travels entitled ''Through Persia, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus''.

===Studies===
From 1886 to 1888, Hedin studied under the geologist [[Waldemar Christofer Brøgger (geologist)|Waldemar Brøgger]] in Stockholm and Uppsala the subjects of [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[zoology]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. In December 1888, he became a ''Candidate in Philosophy''. From October 1889 to March 1890 he studied in Berlin under [[Ferdinand von Richthofen|Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen]].

===Second trip to Iran===
On 12 May 1890, he accompanied as interpreter and vice-consul a Swedish legation to Iran which was to present the [[Shah]] of Iran with the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. As part of the Swedish legation, he was at an audience of the shah [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] in Tehran. He spoke with him and later accompanied him to the [[Elburz]] Mountain Range. On 11 July 1890, he and three others climbed Mount [[Damavand]] where he collected primary material for his dissertation. Starting in September he traveled on the [[Silk Road]] via cities [[Mashhad]], [[Ashgabat]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Tashkent]] and [[Kashgar]] to the western outskirts of the [[Taklamakan]] Desert. On the trip home, he visited the grave of the Russian Asian scholar, [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]] in [[Karakol]] on the shore of Lake [[Issyk Kul]]. On 29 March 1891, he was back in Stockholm. He published the books ''King Oscar's Legation to the Shah of Persia in 1890'' and ''Through Chorasan and Turkestan'' about this journey.

===Doctorate and career path===
On 27 April 1892, Hedin traveled to Berlin to continue his studies under [[Ferdinand von richthofen|Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen]]. Beginning of July he went to [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], attending lectures by [[Alfred Kirchhoff]]. Yet in the same month, he received the degree of ''Doctor of Philosophy'' with a 28-page dissertation entitled ''Personal Observations of Damavand''. This dissertation is a summary of one part of his book, ''King Oscar's Legation to the Shah of Persia in 1890''. Eric Wennerholm remarked on the subject: &lt;blockquote&gt;
I can only come to the conclusion that Sven [Hedin] received his doctorate when he was 27 years old after studying for a grand total of only eight months and collecting primary material for one-and-a-half days on the snow-clad peak of [[Mount Damavand]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen not only encouraged Hedin to absolve cursory studies, but also to become thoroughly acquainted with all branches of geographic science and the methodologies of the salient research work, so that he could later work as an explorer. Hedin abstained from doing this with an explanation he supplied in old age: &lt;blockquote&gt;
I was not up to this challenge. I had gotten out onto the wild routes of Asia too early, I had perceived too much of the splendor and magnificence of the Orient, the silence of the deserts and the loneliness of long journeys. I could not get used to the idea of spending a long period of time back in school.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hedin had therewith decided to become an explorer. He was attracted to the idea of traveling to the last mysterious portions of Asia and filling in the gaps by mapping an area completely unknown in Europe. As an explorer, Hedin became important for the Asian and European powers, who courted him, invited him to give numerous lectures, and hoped to obtain from him in return topographic, economic and strategic information about inner Asia, which they considered part of their sphere of influence. As the era of discovery came to a close around 1920, Hedin contented himself with organizing the Sino-Swedish Expedition for qualified scientific explorers.

===First expedition===
Between 1893 and 1897, Hedin investigated the [[Pamir Mountains]], travelling through the [[Tarim Basin]] in [[Xinjiang]] region, across the [[Taklamakan Desert]], [[Lake Kara-Koshun]] and [[Lake Bosten]], proceeding to study northern [[Tibet]]. He covered {{convert|26000|km}} on this journey and mapped {{convert|10498|km}} of them on 552 sheets. Approximately {{convert|3600|km}} led through previously uncharted areas.

He started out on this expedition on 16 October 1893, from Stockholm, traveling via [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Tashkent]] to the [[Pamir Mountains]]. Several attempts to climb the {{convert|7546|m}} high [[Muztagata]]—called the Father of the Glaciers—in the [[Pamir Mountains]] were unsuccessful. He remained in Kashgar until April 1895 and then left on 10 April with three local escorts from the village of Merket in order to cross the Taklamakan Desert via Tusluk to the [[Khotan River]]. Since their water supply was insufficient, seven camels died of thirst, as did two of his escorts (according to Hedin's dramatized and probably inaccurate account). [[Bruno Baumann]] traveled on this route in April 2000 with a camel caravan and ascertained that at least one of the escorts who, according to Hedin, had died of thirst had survived, and that it is impossible for a camel caravan traveling in springtime on this route to carry enough drinking water for both camels and travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Baumann: Karawane ohne Wiederkehr. Das Drama in der Wüste Takla Makan. München 2000, pp. 113–121, 203, 303–307&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other sources, Hedin had neglected to completely fill the drinking water containers for his caravan at the beginning of the expedition and set out for the desert with only half as much water as could actually be carried. When he noticed the mistake, it was too late to return. Obsessed by his urge to carry out his research, Hedin deserted the caravan and proceeded alone on horseback with his servant. When that escort also collapsed from thirst, Hedin left him behind as well, but managed to reach a water source at the last desperate moment. He did, however, return to his servant with water and rescued him. Nevertheless, his ruthless behavior earned him massive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Liebner: Söhne der Wüste - Durch Gobi und Taklamakan, Documentary film&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1896, after a stopover in Kashgar, Hedin visited the 1,500-year-old abandoned cities of [[Dandan Oilik]] and [[Kara Dung]], which are located northeast of [[Khotan]] in the Taklamakan Desert. At the beginning of March, he discovered [[Lake Bosten]], one of the largest inland bodies of water in Central Asia. He reported that this lake is supplied by a single mighty feeder stream, the [[Kaidu River]]. He mapped Lake Kara-Koshun and returned on 27 May to Khotan. On 29 June, he started out from there with his caravan across northern Tibet and China to [[Beijing]], where he arrived on 2 March 1897. He returned to Stockholm via Mongolia and Russia.

===Second expedition===
Another expedition in [[Central Asia]] followed in 1899-1902 through the Tarim Basin, Tibet and Kashmir to Calcutta. Hedin navigated the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], [[Tarim River|Tarim]] and [[Kaidu River|Kaidu]]&lt;ref&gt;Referred also as Konqi-, Kongque, Kontsche- or Konche-darja or Peacock River— see also note in [[Korla#Geography|Korla]] and [[Kaidu River]]&lt;/ref&gt; rivers and found the dry riverbed of the Kum-darja as well as the dried out lake bed of [[Lop Nur]]. Near Lop Nur, he discovered the ruins of the {{convert|340|by|310|m}} former walled royal city and later Chinese garrison town of Loulan, containing the brick building of the Chinese military commander, a [[stupa]], and 19 dwellings built of poplar wood. He also found a wooden wheel from a horse-drawn cart (called an [[Araba (carriage)|arabas]]) as well as several hundred documents written on wood, paper and silk in the [[Kharosthi]] script. These provided information about the history of the city of [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], which had once been located on the shores of Lop Nur but had been abandoned around the year 330 CE because the lake had dried out, depriving the inhabitants of drinking water.

During his travels in 1900 and 1901 he attempted in vain to reach the city of [[Lhasa]], which was forbidden to Europeans. He continued to [[Leh]], in [[Ladakh]] district, India. From Leh, Hedin's route took him to [[Lahore]], [[Delhi]], [[Agra]], [[Lucknow]], [[Varanasi|Benares]] to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], meeting there with [[George Nathaniel Curzon]], England's then Viceroy to India.

This expedition resulted in 1,149 pages of maps, on which Hedin depicted newly discovered lands. He was the first to describe [[yardang]] formations in the Lop Desert.

===Third expedition===
Between 1905 and 1908, Hedin investigated the Central Iranian desert basins, the western highlands of [[Tibet]] and the [[Transhimalaya]], which for a time was afterward called the Hedin Range. He visited the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|9th Panchen Lama]] in the cloistered city of [[Tashilhunpo Monastery|Tashilhunpo]] in [[Shigatse]]. Hedin was the first European to reach the Kailash region, including the sacred [[Lake Manasarovar]] and [[Mount Kailash]], the midpoint of the earth according to Buddhist and Hindu mythology. The most important goal of the expedition was the search for the sources of the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] Rivers, both of which Hedin found. From India, he returned via Japan and Russia to Stockholm.

He returned from this expedition with a collection of geological samples which are kept and studied in the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]]. These [[sedimentary rock]]s—such as [[breccia]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[limestone]], and [[slate]], as well as [[volcanic rock]] and [[granite]]—highlight the geological diversity of the regions visited by Hedin during this expedition.

[[File:Exploring expeditions of Sven Hedin 1886-1935.jpg|thumb|The explorations of Hedin 1886-1935. The routes of his colleagues during the Sino-Swedish Expedition of 1927-1935 are not included.]]

===Mongolia===
In 1923, Hedin traveled to Beijing via the USA—where he visited the [[Grand Canyon]]—and Japan. Because of political and social unrest in China, he had to abandon an expedition to [[Xinjiang]]. Instead, he traveled with [[Frans August Larson]] (called the "Duke of Mongolia") in November and December in a [[Dodge]] automobile from [[Peking]] through [[Mongolia]] via [[Ulaanbaatar]] to [[Ulan-Ude]], Russia and from there on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to [[Moscow]].

===Fourth expedition===
Between 1927 and 1935, Hedin led an international Sino-Swedish Expedition which investigated the [[meteorological]], [[topographic]] and [[prehistoric]] situation in [[Mongolia]], the [[Gobi Desert]] and [[Xinjiang]].

Hedin described it as a [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic university]] in which the participating scientists worked almost independently, while he—like a local manager—negotiated with local authorities, made decisions, organized whatever was necessary, raised funds and recorded the route followed. He gave [[archaeologist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[botanist]]s, [[geographer]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[meteorologist]]s and [[zoologist]]s from Sweden, Germany and China an opportunity to participate in the expedition and carry out research in their areas of specialty.

Hedin met [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Nanjing]], who thereupon became a patron of the expedition. The Sino-Swedish Expedition was honored with a Chinese postage stamp series which had a print run of 25,000. The four stamps show camels at a camp with the expedition flag and bear the Chinese text, "Postal Service of the Prosperous Middle Kingdom" and in Latin underneath, "Scientific Expedition to the Northwestern Province of China 1927-1933". A painting in the Beijing [[Palace Museum]] entitled ''Nomads in the Desert'' served as model for the series. Of the 25,000 sets, 4,000 were sold across the counter and 21,500 came into the possession of the expedition. Hedin used them to finance the expedition, selling them for a price of five dollars per set. The stamps were unwelcome at the time due to the high price Hedin was selling them at, but years later became valuable treasures among collectors.

[[File:Lettercover with stamps of the Sino-Swedish Expedition in China 1927-1933.jpg|thumb|Envelope of a letter from Hedin to his sister Alma with Chinese stamps issued on the occasion of the Sino-Swedish Expedition]]

The first part of the expedition, from 1927 to 1932, led from Beijing via [[Baotou]] to [[Mongolia]], over the [[Gobi Desert]], through [[Xinjiang]] to [[Ürümqi]], and into the northern and eastern parts of the [[Tarim Basin]]. The expedition had a wealth of scientific results which are being published up to the present time. For example, the discovery of specific deposits of [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[oil]], [[coal]] and [[gold]] reserves was of great economic relevance for China. In recognition of his achievements, the [[Berlin Geographical Society]] presented him with the ''Ferdinand von Richthofen Medal'' in 1933; the same honor was also awarded to [[Erich von Drygalski]] for his [[Gauss Expedition]] to the [[Antarctic]]; and to [[Alfred Philippson]] for his research on the [[Aegean Region]].

From the end of 1933 to 1934, Hedin led—on behalf of the [[Kuomintang]] government under Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing—a Chinese expedition to investigate [[irrigation]] measures and draw up plans and maps for the construction of two roads suitable for automobiles along the [[Silk Road]] from Beijing to Xinjiang. Following his plans, major irrigation facilities were constructed, settlements erected, and roads built on the Silk Road from Beijing to [[Kashgar]], which made it possible to completely bypass the rough terrain of Tarim Basin.

One aspect of the geography of central Asia which intensively occupied Hedin for decades was what he called the “wandering lake” [[Lop Nur]]. In May 1934, he began a river expedition to this lake. For two months he navigated the [[Kaidu River]] and the Kum-Darja to Lop Nur, which had been filled with water since 1921. After the lake dried out in 1971 as a consequence of irrigation activities, the above-mentioned transportation link enabled the People's Republic of China to construct a nuclear weapon test site at Lop Nur.

His caravan of truck lorries was [[truck hijacking|hijacked]] by the Chinese Muslim General [[Ma Zhongying]] who was retreating from northern Xinjiang along with his Kuomintang [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] from the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. While Hedin was detained by Ma Zhongying, he met General [[Ma Hushan]], and [[Kemal Kaya Effendi]].

Ma Zhongying's adjutant claimed to Hedin that Ma Zhongying had the entire region of Tian-shan-nan-lu (southern Xinjiang) under his control and Sven could pass through safely without any trouble. Hedin did not believe his assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=|title=The flight of "Big Horse": the trail of war in Central Asia|author=Sven Anders Hedin|editor=|edition=|year=1936|quote=amusing to listen to his outspoken but untruthful conversation... he said ...The whole country in that quarter, Tian-shan-nan-lu, acknowledged the rule of General Ma Chung-yin.

For the return trip, Hedin selected the southern Silk Road route via [[Hotan]] to [[Xi'an]], where the expedition arrived on 7 February 1935. He continued on to Beijing to meet with President [[Lin Sen]] and to Nanjing to Chiang Kai-shek. He celebrated his 70th birthday on 19 February 1935 in the presence of 250 members of the Kuomintang government, to whom he reported interesting facts about the Sino-Swedish Expedition. On this day, he was awarded the [[Order of Brilliant Jade|Brilliant Jade Order, Second Class]].

At the end of the expedition, Hedin was in a difficult financial situation. He had considerable debts at the German-Asian Bank in Beijing, which he repaid with the royalties and fees received for his books and lectures. In the months after his return, he held 111 lectures in 91 German cities as well as 19 lectures in neighboring countries. To accomplish this lecture tour, he covered a stretch as long as the equator, {{convert|23000|km}} by train and {{convert|17000|km}} by car—in a time period of five months. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Berlin]] before his lecture on 14 April 1935.

==Political views==
Hedin was a monarchist. From 1905 onwards he took a stand against the move toward democracy in his Swedish homeland. He warned of the dangers he assumed to be coming from Czarist Russia, and called for an alliance with the German Empire. Therefore, he advocated a strengthened national defence, with a vigilant military preparedness. [[August Strindberg]] was one of his opponents on this issue, which divided Swedish politics at the time. In 1912 Hedin publicly supported the ''Swedish coastal defense ship Society''. He helped collect public donations for the building of the [[coastal defense ship]] {{HSwMS|Sverige}}, which the [[Liberal Coalition Party|Liberal]] and anti-militarist government of [[Karl Staaff]] had been unwilling to finance.  In early 1914, when the Liberal government enacted cutbacks to the country's defenses, Hedin wrote the [[Courtyard Speech]], in which King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]] promised to strengthen the country's defenses. The speech led to a political crisis that ended with Staaff and his government resigning and being replaced by a non-party, more conservative government.

He developed a lasting affinity for the German empire, with which he became acquainted during his formal studies. This is also shown in his admiration for [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], whom he even visited in exile in the Netherlands. Influenced by imperial Russian and later the Soviet union's attempts to dominate and control territories outside its borders, especially in Central Asia and Turkestan, Hedin felt that Soviet Russia posed a great threat to the West, which may be part of the reason why he supported Germany during both World Wars.

He viewed World War I as a struggle of the German race (particularly against Russia) and took sides in books like ''Ein Volk in Waffen. Den deutschen Soldaten gewidmet'' (A People in Arms. Dedicated to the German Soldier). As a consequence, he lost friends in France and England and was expelled from the British [[Royal Geographical Society]], and from the Imperial [[Russian Geographical Society]]. Germany's defeat in World War I and the associated loss of its international reputation affected him deeply. That Sweden gave asylum to [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as a political refugee after the failure of the Kapp Putsch is said to be primarily attributable to his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://orient4.orient.su.se/personal/tobias.hubinette/asienforskare_2.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hedin and Nazi Germany==
Hedin's conservative and pro-German views eventually translated into sympathy for the [[Third Reich]], and this would draw him into increasing controversy towards the end of his life. [[Adolf Hitler]] had been an early admirer of Hedin, who was in turn impressed with Hitler's nationalism. He saw the German leader's rise to power as a revival of German fortunes, and welcomed its challenge against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communism]]. He was not an entirely uncritical supporter of the Nazis, however. His own views were shaped by  traditionalist, Christian and conservative values, while National Socialism was in part a modern revolutionary-populist movement. Hedin objected to some aspects of National Socialist rule, and occasionally attempted to convince the German government to relent in its anti-religious and anti-Semitic campaigns.

Hedin met Adolf Hitler and other leading [[National Socialist]]s repeatedly and was in regular correspondence with them. The politely-worded correspondence usually concerned scheduling matters, birthday congratulations, Hedin's planned or completed publications, and requests by Hedin for pardons for people condemned to death, and for mercy, release and permission to leave the country for people interned in prisons or concentration camps. In correspondence with [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Hans Dräger, Hedin was able to achieve the printing of the ''[[Daily Watchwords]]'' year after year.&lt;ref&gt;Verified sources: Sven Hedins in the Stockholm Riksarkivet archived correspondence with Hans Draeger, Wilhelm Frick, Joseph Goebbels, Paul Grassmann and Heinrich Himmler&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis attempted to achieve a close connection to Hedin by bestowing awards upon him. They asked him to present an address on ''Sport as a Teacher'' at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin's [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic stadium]]. They made him an honorary member of the ''German-Swedish Union Berlin'' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Schwedischen Vereinigung Berlin e.V.}}) In 1938, they presented him with the City of Berlin's ''Badge of Honor'' ({{lang-de|Ehrenplakette der Stadt Berlin}}). For his 75th birthday on 19 February 1940 they awarded him the [[Order of the German Eagle]]; shortly before that date it had been presented to [[Henry Ford]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. On New Year's Day 1943 they released the Oslo professor of philology and university rector [[Didrik Arup Seip]] from the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] at Hedin's request&lt;ref&gt;See letter from Hans Draeger dated 17 January 1942 to Sven Hedin from the Riksarkivet in Stockholm, file: Sven Hedins Arkiv, Korrespondens, Tyskland, 457 and the book by Michael H. Kater: Das "Ahnenerbe" der SS 1935-1945. Oldenbourg Verlag, 2001, {{ISBN|3-486-56529-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to obtain Hedin's agreement to accept additional honors during the 470th anniversary of [[Munich University]]. On 15 January 1943, he received the ''Gold Medal of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences'' (Goldmedaille der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften). On 16 January 1943 he received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of natural sciences of Munich University.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Kraus: Die Universität München im dritten Reich: Aufsätze. Herbert Utz Verlag GmbH, München 2006. pp. 494–502&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Nazis founded in his absence the ''Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian Research'' located at [[Mittersill Castle]], which was supposed to serve the long-term advancement of the scientific legacy of Hedin and [[Wilhelm Filchner]] as Asian experts. However, it was instead misused by [[Heinrich Himmler]] as an institute of the ''Research Association for German Genealogical Inheritance'' (Forschungsgemeinschaft Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V.).&lt;ref&gt;See file R 135 of the Bundesarchivs, located in the Dienststelle Berlin-Lichterfelde&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 1943, he was requested to sign the ''Golden Book of the city of Munich''.

Hedin supported the Nazis in his journalistic activities. After the collapse of Nazi Germany, he did not regret his collaboration with the Nazis because this cooperation had made it possible to rescue numerous Nazi victims from execution, or death in extermination camps.

===Criticism of National Socialism===
[[Johannes Paul]] wrote in 1954 about Hedin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Much of what happened in the early days of Nazi rule had his approval. However, he did not hesitate to criticize whenever he considered this to be necessary, particularly in cases of [[Jewish persecution]], conflict with the churches and bars to freedom of science.&lt;ref&gt;In: Abenteuerliche Lebensreise, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937 Hedin refused to publish his book ''Deutschland und der Weltfrieden'' (Germany and World Peace) in Germany because the [[Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] insisted on the deletion of Nazi-critical passages. In a letter Hedin wrote to [[State Secretary#Germany|State Secretary]] [[Walther Funk]] dated 16 April 1937, it becomes clear what his criticism of National Socialism was in this time before the establishment of extermination camps:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When we first discussed my plan to write a book, I stated that I only wanted to write objectively, scientifically, possibly critically, according to my conscience, and you considered that to be completely acceptable and natural. Now I emphasized in a very friendly and mild form that the removal of distinguished Jewish professors who have performed great services for mankind is detrimental to Germany and that this has given rise to many agitators against Germany abroad. So I took this position only in the interest of Germany.

My worry that the education of German youth, which I otherwise praise and admire everywhere, is deficient in questions of religion and the hereafter comes from my love and sympathy for the German nation, and as a Christian I consider it my duty to state this openly, and, to be sure, in the firm conviction that Luther’s nation, which is religious through and through, will understand me.

So far I have never gone against my conscience and will not do it now either. Therefore, no deletions will be made.&lt;ref&gt;As yet unpublished letters from the Riksarkivet in Stockholm, file of Heinrich Himmler: Sven Hedins Arkiv, Korrespondens, Tyskland, 470. The orthography and punctuation were updated&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hedin later published this book in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;On this matter there is a thorough investigation contained in the essay Sven Hedin und nationalsozialistische Expansionspolitik by Astrid Mehmel loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efforts on behalf of deported Jews===
After he refused to remove his criticism of National Socialism from his book ''Deutschland und der Weltfrieden'', the Nazis confiscated the passports of Hedin's Jewish friend [[Alfred Philippson]] and his family in 1938 in order to prevent their intended departure to American exile and retain them in Germany as a bargaining chip when dealing with Hedin. The consequence was that Hedin expressed himself more favorably about Nazi Germany in his book ''Fünfzig Jahre Deutschland'', subjugated himself against his conscience to the censorship of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and published the book in Germany.

On 8 June 1942, the Nazis increased the pressure on Hedin by deporting Alfred Philippson and his family to the [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp. By doing so, they accomplished their goal of forcing Hedin against his conscience to write his book ''Amerika im Kampf der Kontinente'' in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda and other government agencies and to publish it in Germany in 1942. In return, the Nazis classified Alfred Philippson as “A-prominent” and granted his family privileges which enabled them to survive.

For a long time Hedin was in correspondence with Alfred Philippson and regularly sent food parcels to him in Theresienstadt concentration camp. On 29 May 1946, Alfred Philippson wrote to him (translation, abbreviated quotation): &lt;blockquote&gt;
My dear Hedin! Now that letters can be sent abroad I have the opportunity to write to you…. We frequently think with deep gratitude of our rescuer, who alone is responsible for our being able to survive the horrible period of three years of incarceration and hunger in Theresienstadt concentration camp, at my age a veritable wonder. You will have learned that we few survivors were finally liberated just a few days before our intended gassing. We, my wife, daughter and I, were then brought on 9–10 July 1945 in a bus of the city of Bonn here to our home town, almost half of which is now destroyed….
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hedin responded on 19 July 1946 (translation, abbreviated quotation): &lt;blockquote&gt;
…It was wonderful to find out that our efforts were not in vain. In these difficult years we attempted to rescue over one hundred other unfortunate people who had been deported to Poland, but in most cases without success. We were however able to help a few Norwegians. My home in Stockholm was turned into something like an information and assistance office, and I was excellently supported by Dr. Paul Grassmann, press attaché in the German embassy in Stockholm. He too undertook everything possible to further this humanitarian work. But almost no case was as fortunate as yours, dear friend! And how wonderful, that you are back in Bonn….&lt;ref&gt;As yet unpublished letters from the Riksarkivet in Stockholm, file: Sven Hedins Arkiv, Korrespondens, Tyskland, 487&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The names and fates of the over one hundred deported Jews whom Hedin tried to save have not yet been researched.

===Efforts on behalf of deported Norwegians===
Hedin supported the cause of the Norwegian author [[Arnulf Øverland]] and for the Oslo professor of philology and university director [[Didrik Arup Seip]], who were interned in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. He achieved the release of Didrik Arup Seip, but his efforts to free Arnulf Øverland were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Arnulf Øverland survived the concentration camp.

===Efforts on behalf of Norwegian activists===
After the third senate of the highest German military court (Reichskriegsgericht) in Berlin condemned to death for alleged espionage the ten Norwegians Sigurd Jakobsen, Gunnar Hellesen, Helge Børseth, Siegmund Brommeland, Peter Andree Hjelmervik, Siegmund Rasmussen, Gunnar Carlsen, Knud Gjerstad, Christian Oftedahl and Frithiof Lund on 24 February 1941, Hedin successfully appealed via Colonel General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] to Adolf Hitler for their reprieve. Their death penalty was converted on 17 June 1941 by Adolf Hitler to ten years forced labor. The Norwegians Carl W. Mueller, Knud Naerum, Peder Fagerland, Ottar Ryan, Tor Gerrard Rydland, Hans Bernhard Risanger and Arne Sørvag who had been condemned to forced labor under the same charge received reduced sentences at Hedin's request. Unfortunately, Hans Bernhard Risanger died in prison just a few days before his release.

Von Falkenhorst was condemned to death, by firing squad, by a British military court on August 2, 1946, because of his responsibility for passing on a ''Führerbefehl'' called the [[Commando Order]]. Hedin intervened on his behalf, achieving a pardon on December 4, 1946, with the argument that von Falkenhorst had likewise striven to pardon the ten Norwegians condemned to death. Von Falkenhorst's death penalty was commuted by the British military court to 20 years in prison. In the end, Nikolaus von Falkenhorst was released early from the [[Werl prison|Werl war criminals prison]] on July 13, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sven Hedin's German Diary 1935–1942, Dublin 1951, S. 204–217 und Eric Wennerholm, Sven Hedin 1865–1952, S. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Because of his outstanding services, Hedin was raised to the untitled nobility by [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oskar II]] in 1902, the last time any Swede was to receive a charter of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldik.se/english_3.html |title=The Swedish Way |publisher=Swedish Heraldry Society |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107045907/http://www.heraldik.se/english_3.html |archivedate=7 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oskar II suggested that he prefix the name Hedin with one of the two common predicates of nobility in Sweden, "af" or "von", but Hedin abstained from doing so in his written response to the king. In many noble families in Sweden, it was customary to do without the title of nobility. The coat of arms of Hedin, together with those of some two thousand noble families, is to be found on a wall of the Great Hall in [[Riddarhuset]], the assembly house of Swedish nobility in Stockholm's inner city, [[Gamla Stan]].

In 1905, Hedin was admitted to membership in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and in 1909 to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences]]. From 1913 to 1952 he held the sixth of 18 chairs as an elected member of the [[Swedish Academy]]. In this position, he had a vote in the selection of Nobel Prize winners.

He was an honorary member of numerous Swedish and foreign scientific societies and institutions which honored him with some 40 gold medals; 27 of these medals can be viewed in Stockholm in a display case in the [[Royal Coin Cabinet]].

He received honorary doctorates from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1909), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1909), [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] (1928), [[University of Uppsala|Uppsala]] (1935), and [[University of Munich|Munich]] (1943) universities and from the [[Handelshochschule]] Berlin (1931) (all Dr. phil. h.c.), from [[Breslau University]] (1915, Dr. jur. h.c.), and from [[Rostock University]] (1919, Dr. med. h.c.).

Numerous countries presented him with medals.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Christian Thorén: Upptäcktsresanden Sven Hedins ordenstecken i Kungliga Livrustkammarens samlingar. In: Livrust Kammaren. Journal of the Royal Armoury 1997-98. Stockholm. pp. 91-128. ISSN 0024-5372. (Swedish text with English picture captions and English summary, color illustrations of Sven Hedin’s medals and decorations, literature)&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden he became a Commander 1st Class of the [[Order of the Polar Star|Royal Order of the North Star]] (KNO1kl) with a [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliant]] badge and Knight of the [[Order of Vasa|Royal Order of Vasa]] (RVO).&lt;ref name="En biografi" /&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] he was named [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire]] by [[King Edward VII]]. As a foreigner, he was not authorized to use the associated title of Sir, but he could place the designation KCIE after his family name Hedin. Hedin was also a [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the German Eagle]].&lt;ref name="En biografi" /&gt;

In his honor have been named a glacier, the [[Sven Hedin Glacier]]; a lunar crater [[Hedin (crater)|Hedin]]; a species of the flowering plant, ''Gentiana hedini''; the beetles ''Longitarsus hedini'' and ''Coleoptera hedini''; a butterfly, ''Fumea hedini Caradja''; a spider, ''Dictyna hedini''; a fossil hoofed mammal, ''Tsaidamotherium hedini''; a fossil [[Therapsid]] (a “mammal-like reptile”) ''[[Lystrosaurus]] hedini''; and streets and squares in the cities of various countries (for example, “Hedinsgatan” at Tessinparken in Stockholm).

A permanent exhibition of articles found by Hedin on his expeditions is located in the [[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden|Stockholm Ethnographic Museum]].

In the [[Adolf Frederick]] [[Adolf Fredriks kyrka|church]] can be found the Sven Hedin memorial plaque by [[Liss Eriksson]]. The plaque was installed in 1959. On it, a globe with Asia to the fore can be seen, crowned with a camel. It bears the Swedish epitaph: {{cquote|Asia’s unknown expanses were his world—Sweden remained his home.}}

==Research on Hedin==

===Source material===
A survey of the extensive sources for Hedin research shows that it would be difficult at present to come to a fair assessment of the personality and achievements of Hedin. Most of the source material has not yet been subjected to scientific scrutiny. Even the DFG project ''Sven Hedin und die deutsche Geographie'' had to restrict itself to a small selection and a random examination of the source material.

The sources for Hedin research are located in numerous archives (and include primary literature, correspondence, newspaper articles, obituaries and secondary literature).

[[File:Sven Hedin monument by Liss Eriksson 1959 in the Adolf Fredriks Kyrka, Stockholm.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque with epitaph for Hedin by [[Liss Eriksson]] (1959) in the [[Adolf Fredriks kyrka|Adolf Fredrik church]], Stockholm]]

* Hedin's own publications amount to some 30,000 pages.
* There are about 2,500 drawings and watercolors, films and many photographs.
* To this should be added 25 volumes with travel and expedition notes and 145 volumes of the diaries he regularly maintained between 1930 and 1952, totaling 8,257 pages.
* The extensive holdings of the Hedin Foundation (Sven Hedins Stiftelse), which holds Hedin effects in trust, are to be found in the [[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden|Ethnographic Museum]] and in the [[National Archives of Sweden|National Archives]] in Stockholm.
* Hedin's correspondence is in the archive of the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] in Bonn, in the [[German Federal Archives]] in Koblenz, at the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifl-leipzig.de/index.php?id=1&amp;L=1 Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography]&lt;/ref&gt; in Leipzig, and above all in the Ethnographic Museum and in the National Archives in Stockholm. Most of the correspondence in Hedin's  estate is in the National Archives and accessible to researchers and the general public. It includes about 50,000 letters organized alphabetically according to country and sender as well as some 30,000 additional unsorted letters.
* The scientific effects as well as a collection of newspaper articles about Hedin organized by year (1895–1952) in 60 bound folios can be found in the [[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden|Ethnographic Museum]].
* The finds from Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang are, among other places, in Stockholm in the Ethnographic Museum (some 8,000 individual items), in the Institutes of Geology, Minearology and Paleontology of the [[Uppsala University]], in the depots of the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology in Munich, and in the [[National Museum of China]], [[Beijing]].

===Hedin’s documentation===
During his expeditions Hedin saw the focus of his work as being in field research. He recorded routes by plotting many thousands of kilometers of his caravan itinerary with the detail of a high resolution topographical map and supplemented them with innumerable altitude measurements and latitude and longitude data. At the same time he combined his field maps with panoramic drawings. He drafted the first precise maps of areas unresearched until that date: the Pamir mountains, the Taklamakan desert, Tibet, the Silk Road and the Himalayas. He was likely the first European to recognize that the Himalayas were a continuous mountain range.

He systematically studied the lakes of inner Asia, made careful climatological observations over many years, and started extensive collections of rocks, plants, animals and antiquities. Underway he prepared watercolor paintings, sketches, drawings and photographs, which he later published in his works. The photographs and maps with the highest quality printing are to be found in the original Swedish publications.

Hedin prepared a scientific publication for each of his expeditions. The extent of documentation increased dramatically from expedition to expedition. His research report about the first expedition was published in 1900 as ''Die geographisch-wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse meiner Reisen in Zentralasien 1894–97'' (Supplement 28 to ''Petermanns Mitteilungen''), Gotha 1900. The publication about the second expedition, ''Scientific Results of a Journey in Central Asia'', increased to six text and two atlas volumes. ''Southern Tibet'', the scientific publication on the third expedition, totalled twelve volumes, three of which were atlases. The results of the Sino-Swedish Expedition were published under the title of ''Reports from the scientific expedition to the north-western provinces of China under leadership of Dr. Sven Hedin. The sino-Swedish expedition''. This publication went through 49 editions.

This documentation was splendidly produced, which made the price so high that only a few libraries and institutes were able to purchase it. The immense printing costs had to be borne for the most part by Hedin himself, as was also true for the cost of the expeditions. He used the fees and royalties which he received from his popular science books and for his lectures for the purpose.

[[File:Sven Hedin's gravestone at Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, Stockholm, Sweden.jpg|thumb|Hedin's Gravestone in the cemetery of Adolf Fredriks church in Stockholm, Sweden]]

Hedin did not himself subject his documentation to scientific evaluation, but rather handed it over to other scientists for the purpose. Since he shared his experiences during his expeditions as popular science and incorporated them in a large number of lectures, travelogues, books for young people and adventure books, he became known to the general public. He soon became famous as one of the most well-recognized personalities of his time.

D. Henze wrote the following about an exhibition at the Deutsches Museum entitled ''Sven Hedin, the last explorer'': &lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a pioneer and pathfinder in the transitional period to a century of specialized research. No other single person illuminated and represented unknown territories more extensively than he. His maps alone are a unique creation. And the artist did not take second place to the savant, who deep in the night rapidly and apparently without effort rapidly created awe inspiring works.  The discipline of geography, at least in Germany, has so far only concerned itself with his popularized reports. The consistent inclusion of the enormous, still  unmined treasures in his scientific work are yet to be incorporated in the regional geography of Asia.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Current Hedin research===
A scientific assessment of Hedin's character and his relationship to National Socialism was undertaken at Bonn University by Professor Hans Böhm, Dipl.-Geogr. Astrid Mehmel and Christoph Sieker M.A. as part of the DFG Project ''Sven Hedin und die deutsche Geographie'' (''Sven Hedin and German Geography'').

'''[[Titan (moon)|Titan]]''' is one of the moons of the planet [[Saturn]]. In the 30th and 31st centuries of the {{DC Universe}} the moon is inhabited by a colony of [[telepaths]].

==Fictional history==
It is the fictional home world of [[Saturn Girl]], Imra Ardeen. She is one of the most powerful telepaths in the history of Titan. Post Zero-Hour, the super villain [[Universo]] was retconned to be from Titan as well.

As for the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] different [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|universes]], each one exhibiting a different version of the Legion and their characters, three versions of Titan are shown in the current DC Multiverse. While the Earth-0 and the Earth-247 are largely similar, until Earth-247 was wiped out during the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] event, Earth-Prime Titan (who was implied to be part of the future of the ''Real Universe'') is populated by [[Muteness|mute]] telepaths, their [[vocal cord]]s [[atrophy|atrophied]], and later eradicated by the evolutionary process, due to their disuse brought by their advanced form of telepathy.

In Earth-0, it is revealed that the Titanians were originally from the planet Lanoth. Lanoth was destroyed by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who bottled a single city for study.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #698 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The bottle was recovered by [[Mon-El]] who was instructed to deliver the city to Saturn. [[Jemm]], the sovereign of the planet Saturn was hesitant to allow a species of telepaths to settle there but decided to put his trust in Mon-El and allows them to settle on Titan. In gratitude the Lanothians rename themselves Titanians and agree to serve under the rule of Jemm.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #11 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Saturn Queen]], other humanoid colonists settled on Titan with the Lanothians/Titanians at some point before the 31st century, and Saturn Queen herself is descended from these colonists.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 6) #3 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

While Earth-Prime Titan is not a xenophobic world itself like [[Daxam]] and [[Kandor (comics)|Rokyn]], many Titanians, especially the younger ones like Imra Ardeen and [[Titan Girl|Jeyra Entinn]], exhibit a strong sense of inadequacy when confronted, on daily basis, with ''speaking'' people.&lt;ref&gt;''Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #19 (August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 5) #47 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conflict with Superboy-Prime, the Time Institute relocated to Titan. One of their scientists used their time viewer to witness the birth of the universe, something that is strictly taboo. The shockwaves of this event caused all of Titan to implode on itself.

The '''Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground''', also known as '''Musudan-ri''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/back/news.607&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rocket]] [[Rocket launch site|launching site]] in [[North Korea]].

==Location==
It lies in southern [[Hwadae]] County, [[North Hamgyong Province]], near [[Musu Dan]], the cape marking the northern end of the [[East Korea Bay]]. The area was formerly known as Taep'o-dong (대포동) during the period when Korea was occupied by Japan, and the Taepodong rockets take their name from this. This single loose-surface road is susceptible to seasonal flooding. The site is 45&amp;nbsp;km northeast of port city of [[Kimchaek]] and 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the town of Kilju (길주읍). There is a small [[wharf]] located at the [[fishing village]] of Tongha-dong but can only accommodate [[Marine vessel|vessels]] smaller than 40 meters in length.

==History==
By the early 80s, North Korea needed a flight-test facility for its program to reverse-engineer and produce copies of the [[Scud-B]] which it acquired from the Soviet Union in the late 60s. Previously, North Korea used a facility at Hwajin-ri (華進里), Pyongwon-kun, South Pyongan Province to test for [[anti-ship missile]]s and probably [[2K6 Luna|FROG]]s, [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) and other rockets. However, Hawjin-ri had insufficient range for the [[Hwasong-5]], which would enter Chinese [[territorial waters]] during a test. The construction of the facility continued off and on throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Construction was made by the 117th Regiment under the Air Force Construction Bureau (空軍建設部) of the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two Facilities Seen at North Korean missile Base, Newspaper Says," Deutsche Presse-Agentur, 3 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the launch pad was completed in 1985. During the early stage of construction, the site had an extremely rudimentary infrastructure, such as a few roads, a command bunker, a [[radar]] facility, and modest storage and support facilities. 

However, by the early 1990s the Tonghae site was reportedly expanded from 2&amp;nbsp;km to 9&amp;nbsp;km and the following infrastructure was added: a missile assembly facility, a fuel storage facility, a guidance and range control center, and tracking facilities. Since 1984 military rockets of the types [[Hwasong-5|Hwasong]], [[Rodong-1|Rodong]] and [[Taepodong-1]] were launched from Musudan-ri. In 1998, North Korean media reported the successful launch of the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] satellite by a [[Paektusan (rocket)|Baekdusan-1]] SLV from Musudan-ri. North Korea claimed their first satellite was successfully placed into orbit, but no independent sources have confirmed this. A review of the rocket engine test stand on DigitalGlobe imagery coverage from February 15, 2002 to February 26, 2009 revealed a variety of activity, including drying grain on the concrete, the presence of cylindrical storage tanks and the arrival/departure of multiple support vehicles and personnel. A second failed satellite launch attempt [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2|apparently occurred in 2006]].

[[File:Facilities at Musudan-ri part 2.png|thumbnail|left|The launch pad at the left, the rocket motor test stand at the right, marked with a red X.]]
The facilities at Musudan-ri are modest, consisting of a [[launch pad]] at {{coord|40|51.342|N|129|39.948|E|region:KP-HAB_type:landmark}}. The launch pad consists of a 30-meter umbilical tower with a top-mounted gantry crane, a flame blast bucket, a launch blockhouse with a connecting access tunnel, two semi-buried [[liquid fuel]] storage buildings, a concrete apron/pad and multiple small support buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/dprk/facility/musudan-ri.pdf "Musudan Test Facility", FAS]&lt;/ref&gt; An engine test stand at {{coord|40|51.138|N|129|40.788|E|region:KP-HAB_type:landmark}}, a missile assembly/checkout building at {{coord|40|51.348|N|129|39.552|E|region:KP-HAB_type:landmark}}, a missile control building at {{coord|40|51.78|N|129|39.624|E|region:KP-HAB_type:landmark}} and a Ground Tracking Facility (coordinates obtained from Google Earth in June, 2006.).

An '''Abney level and [[clinometer]]''', is an instrument used in [[surveying]] which consists of a fixed sighting tube, a movable spirit level that is connected to a pointing arm, and a protractor scale.  An internal mirror allows the user to see the bubble in the level while sighting a distant target.  It can be used as a hand-held instrument or mounted on a [[Jacob's staff#Surveying|Jacob's staff]] for more precise measurement, and it is small enough to carry in a coat pocket.&lt;ref name="Gurley"&gt;Smaller Instruments and Appliances: The Abney Level and Clinometer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2poSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219 A Manual of the Principal Instruments used in American Engineering and Surveying], W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Troy, NY, 1891; page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George William Usill, Clinometers: The Abney Level, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sdpIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Practical Surveying], Crosby Lockwood and Son, London, 1889; page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abney level is an easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and, when used correctly, an accurate surveying tool.  Abney levels typically include scales graduated in measure [[degrees of arc]], [[percent grade]], and in topographic Abney levels, grade in feet per [[surveyor's chain]], and chainage correction.  The latter is the [[cosine]] of the angle, used to convert distances measured along the slope to horizontal distances.  By using trigonometry the user of an Abney level can determine height, volume, and grade.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;H. A. Calkins and J. B. Yule, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w98sAQAAMAAJ The Abney Level Handbook], United States Forest Service, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abney levels are made with square tubular bodies so that they may also be used to directly measure the slopes of plane surfaces by simply placing the body of the level on the surface, adjusting the level, and then reading the angle off of the scale.

== Origins ==
The Abney level was invented by Sir [[William de Wiveleslie Abney]] (Born 24 Jul 1843 Died 3 Dec 1920) who was an English astronomer and chemist best known for his pioneering of color photography and color vision. Abney invented this instrument under the employment of the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|School of Military Engineering]] in Chatham, England prior to late 1870.  It is described by W. &amp; L. E. Gurley as an English modification of the Locke hand level.&lt;ref name="Gurley" /&gt;

[[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliott Brothers of London]] registered an "improved clinometer and spirit level combined" in December 1870 based on "the old form as originally designed by Lieutenant Abney."&lt;ref&gt;Combined Clinometer and Spirit Level, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iyhJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA476 The Mechanics Magazine], Dec. 30, 1870; page 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1871, a committee of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] recommended a long list of instruments that explorers should carry.  Along with necessary tools such as a watch, compass, sextant and plenty of paper, the committee included "a pocket level (Abney's)" in a secondary list of "additional instruments, not necessary, but convenient."  &lt;ref&gt;Admiral Sir [[George Back]], Vice-Admiral [[Richard Collinson]], and [[Francis Galton]], Hints to Travellers (Third and Revised Edition), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxcRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society], Vol. XVI, No. 1 (Dec. 18, 1871).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
In 1914 and 1915, the ''Forestry Quarterly'' published a series of articles on the use of the Abney level.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Paeth, Obtaining Vertical Control of Practical Value with the Abney Hand Level, [https://archive.org/stream/forestryquarter03foregoog#page/n414/mode/1up/ Forestry Quarterly], Vol. XXII, No. 3 (Sept. 1914); page 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Erickson, The Use of the Abney Hand Level, [https://archive.org/stream/forestryquarter03foregoog#page/n437/mode/1up/ Forestry Quarterly], Vol. XXII, No. 3 (Sept. 1914); page 370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Anderson, The Abney Hand Level and the Chain on Intensive Forest Surveys, [https://archive.org/stream/forestryquarterl13newy#page/338/mode/1up/ Forestry Quarterly], Vol. XIII, No. 3 (Sept. 1915); page 338.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tutorial articles remain useful today, but the primary reference for usage is the 1927 Abney Level Handbook.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

The Abney level is typically used at the eye height of the [[surveying|surveyor]], either hand-held or mounted on a staff at that height.  To measure lines on a particular slope, the desired angle or grade is first set on the level and then the surveyor sights through the sighting tube and brings the cross-hair in line with the bubble in the level while viewing the target.  This allows the surveyor to see if the target is above or below the line of sight.

To measure an unknown slope, the surveyor first sights a target along that slope and then adjusts the angle of the level until the bubble is centered on the cross-hair.  Once this is done, the slope may be read from the scale.

Because the level is typically held at the surveyor's eye-height, it is common to use the face of a second surveyor of similar height as a target.  If the second surveyor is not the same height, the approximate location of eye-height must be noted (i.e. chin, nose, top of head).  Mounting a face-sized target at eye-height on a [[level staff]] may be more accurate.  Because most Abney levels do not contain a telescope, direct reading from a level staff is only possible at short range, although it is possible to make special staffs that can be read at a distance without magnification.

==Common uses==
Abney levels remain in common use in several fields:

* In topographic surveying, to place high precision surveying equipment, particularly in rough terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Nisbet, Noel Williams, Alan Brook, et al., [http://www.smc.org.uk/downloads/basteir-tooth-survey.pdf Survey of the Basteir Tooth], The Scottish Mountaineering Club, Sept. 13, 2013; see page 1 and the top photo on page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Layers of information lolly.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Design Di Quick, work done within the School]]
The '''[[UNSW]] School of Surveying and Geospatial Engineering''' (SAGE), part of the [[UNSW Faculty of Engineering]], was founded in 1970 and disestablished in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/Surveying-A274.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The School has undergraduate and postgraduate programs in Surveying and in GeoInformation Systems (GIS). The Bachelor of Engineering (Surveying) is recognised by the Surveying &amp; Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI) as a pathway to becoming a registered surveyor, and both undergraduate degrees are accredited by Engineers Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssis.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The School has strong research activity in wireless, ground-based and satellite-based positioning technology, being Australia’s largest academic research concentration in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap&lt;/ref&gt;  While the main research focus is [[Global Navigation Satellite Systems]] (GNSS) such as [[GPS]], the School also conducts research under the broad banner of ‘[[Navigation]] and [[Earth Observation]]’ including in [[surveying]], [[geodesy]], [[inertial navigation]] systems, [[pseudolites]], mobilephone positioning, integrated navigation and imaging systems, and [[radar]] [[remote sensing]].

The School has research and teaching links with institutions in North America, Europe and Asia, and School staff hold (or have held) leadership positions in international and national scientific and professional bodies such as the International Association of Geodesy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iag-aig.org&lt;/ref&gt;  the International Society for Photogrammetry &amp; Remote Sensing,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isprs.org&lt;/ref&gt;  the International GNSS Service,&lt;ref&gt;http://igs.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-GNSS Asia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multignss.asia&lt;/ref&gt;  Surveying &amp; Spatial Science Institute,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sssi.org.au&lt;/ref&gt;  the NSW Institution of Surveyors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surveyors.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==History==
The first independent undergraduate degree in surveying was established in 1957 in the UNSW School of Civil Engineering. Significant growth in the field led in 1970 to the establishment of an independent School of Surveying under founding Professor Peter Angus-Leppan.&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the School was divided into three departments, Geodesy, [[Photogrammetry]], and Surveying, to take account of emerging technologies deriving from developments in electronics and space science, including satellite technology for geopositioning and remote sensing. A major Image Analysis Laboratory was installed in 1977 and the Centre for Remote Sensing (later known as the Centre for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)) was established in 1982, jointly with the UNSW Schools of Geography and Electrical Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1992, a number of the School’s academics were engaged in the Thailand Land Titling Project. Funded by the Australian and Royal Thai Governments and the World Bank, this project worked to entirely remap Thailand and reform its land titling system in order to reduce poverty, overcome regional income disparities and promote economic growth. This project won The World Bank Group’s Excellence Award in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the launch of the first GPS satellite saw a revolution in the way position is measured. GPS research commenced at the School in 1984 and in the early 1990s, under Professor Chris Rizos, all GPS-related research was organised under the Satellite Navigation and Positioning (SNAP) group and was expanded to encompass other navigation technologies and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 110, 112, 137-38, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the School changed its name to the School of Geomatic Engineering to reflect its expansion of education and research beyond those of traditional surveying, to include remote sensing, geographic information analysis, image processing and satellite positioning. The name was never fully accepted within the NSW surveying profession, however, and there was a second name change in 2001 to Surveying and Spatial Information Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, two separate undergraduate degrees were launched, a Bachelor of Engineering (GeoInformation Systems) and a Bachelor of Engineering (Surveying).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssis.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the School was renamed the School of Surveying and Geospatial Engineering.

==Research==
Since the 1960s, the School has focused on geodesy research. Other past research areas have included photogrammetry, remote sensing, network adjustments, [[industrial metrology]] and [[cadastral systems]].

From 1984, the School made important contributions to the development of high accuracy (centimetre-level) positioning algorithms suitable for surveying and geodesy applications. In the early 1990s, all GPS-related research was organised under the Satellite Navigation and Positioning (SNAP) group. From 2004, this also included other wireless and inertial positioning technologies, and space techniques such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar ([[InSAR]]). The School’s research areas have extended to GNSS research, aspects of [[signal processing]] for the design of GNSS receivers, integrated navigation systems, new designs for terrestrial-based navigation systems and a variety of positioning/navigation applications.

The School has Australia’s strongest academic research group working in the areas of positioning/navigation and satellite radar remote sensing, with research strengths in Navigation and Earth Observation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/about/publications_year.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This combines all the technologies and applications dealing with GNSS, inertial and wireless positioning systems, with ‘metric’ (involving precise geometry-based measurements) remote sensing techniques such as InSAR, aerial and satellite digital imagery, [[LiDAR]] and terrestrial laser scanning, and modern geodesy.

Navigation research includes GPS/GNSS receiver design, data and signal processing algorithms, inertial navigation technologies and data fusion algorithms, other wireless positioning systems including those based on telecommunications (mobile telephony, WiFi, BlueTooth, RFID, vehicle-to-vehicle) as well as dedicated systems such as [[Locata Corporation]], and their optimal integration to support a range of applications from farm and mining machinery automation and robotics, to precise navigation, georeferencing mapping and imaging systems (terrestrial, airborne, or spaceborne), and personal navigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssis.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The School’s Earth Observation research refers to a subset of remote sensing technologies traditionally linked to geodesy, photogrammetry and surveying. These include InSAR satellite radar remote sensing; digital photogrammetry using terrestrial, aerial or satellite cameras; airborne and terrestrial laser scanning; and geodesy.

This Navigation and Earth Observation research is organised across broad research themes
* CORS Network Operations &amp; High-Accuracy GNSS Algorithms 
* Radar Remote Sensing &amp; Engineering Deformation Monitoring 
* Multi-Sensor Integration Algorithms &amp; Applications 
* New Positioning Technologies &amp; Applications 
* GNSS Receiver Design &amp; Signal Processing

Research activities and unique strengths include:
* GPS algorithms for precise positioning over long baselines, real-time carrier phase-based positioning, and network-based CORS (Continuously Operating Reference Station) designs (e.g. initiating the establishment of SydNet, from which today’s [[CORSnet]]-NSW has evolved).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/about/publications_year.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Development of the ‘[[Namuru]]’, a fully functional GNSS receiver that is the basis of research into future GNSS both within Australia and overseas. In 2010 the Namuru was flown on a sounding rocket by the German Space Agency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssis.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Signal processing expertise for multipath analysis, RF interference detection and self-interference mitigation, signal strength measurement, and structural deformation monitoring.
* Largest number of student prize winners at the annual US Institute of Navigation’s GNSS symposium – second only to the Dept of Geomatics, University of Calgary (Canada),&lt;ref&gt;http://plan.geomatics.ucalgary.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loeffel, Robert, The History of the UNSW School of Surveying and Spatial Information Systems: 1949-2007, UNSW/Engineering, 2007, p 101, 112, 125, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Operating Australia’s only permanent Galileo tracking receiver as part of a global network, as well as a GNSS station in the CORSnet-NSW.&lt;ref&gt;http://corsnet.lpma.nsw.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Assisting Australian company Locata with research on their groundbreaking alternative technologies to replicate GNSS performance indoors and in situations where GNSS signals fail.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.locatacorp.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Expertise in SAR-[[DEM]] generation, emergency flood mapping, and ground deformation monitoring using differential InSAR.
* Research into LiDAR wave form analysis, DEM generation, and biomass estimation.
* Addressing the requirements for indoor, [[UAV]] and vehicle-to-vehicle positioning, by conducting research into the use of a variety of technologies, on their own or in multi-sensor integrated systems – including mobile phone signals, [[WiFi]], [[assisted-GNSS]], [[Visual system|vision]] and [[inertial sensors]].

In July 2010, the Australian Government’s Australian Space Research Program granted $4.6M for the SAR Formation Flying project – led by the School in a consortium of university and private sector partners and worth more than $9.6M with in-kind contributions. And in November 2010 UNSW opened the Australian Centre for Space Engineering, in which the School is a major contributor.

==Rankings==
* Australia's largest Engineering Faculty. 
* Top performing Engineering discipline among Australian universities.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Melbourne Institute's Discipline Ratings for Australian Universities&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vathlo Island''' is a fictional location on the planet of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe.

==Publication history==
Vathlo Island is a Kryptonian island continent similar to [[Australia]] and populated by a "highly developed [[Black people|black]] race" of [[Kryptonian]]s, and "retained its independence throughout history and did not join the planetary federation, though good relations were maintained". Black Kryptonians were first shown in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #234, with the island itself shown on a map in #239.  Vathlo was rarely if ever referenced beyond these few issues, although a black Kryptonian named "Iph-Ro of Vathlo" appeared in the more recent ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #111.&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown (2001-04). Superman: The Man of Steel #111 (April 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; An offhand reference to the island was made in [[Alan Moore]]'s story [[For the Man Who Has Everything]], where "racial trouble with the Vathlo Island immigrants," are mentioned in a dream world Krypton that had avoided destruction. It is believed, based on the appearances of black Kryptonians in recent Superman issues, that the Vathlonians eventually were integrated into Krypton proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt |title=Superman's planet is racially diverse-finally |publisher=[[msnbc.com|MSNBC.com]] |date=January 7, 2009|accessdate=2009-01-11 |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28543087/?gt1=43001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Superman: World of New Krypton]]'' #4, it is established that Vathlo Islanders settled in [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] prior to the destruction of Krypton.&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown (2009-08). ''Superman: World of New Krypton'' #4 (August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #7 an African-American version of Superman is shown to reside on the alternate universe of Earth-23. This Superman, who's given name is Kalel but adopts the human alias of Calvin Ellis is shown to originate from Vathlo Island of his reality's Krypton.

==Other media==
While the island itself has not appeared or even referenced in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-looking/dark-skinned Kryptonians have been featured. One was a disciple of [[General Zod|Zod]], who goes by the name Nam-Ek (portrayed by [[Leonard Roberts]]). Another was named Basqat (played by Adrian Holmes).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7037">In [[computing]], the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] '''Web Feature Service  (WFS)''' Interface Standard provides an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] allowing requests for [[Geography|geographical]] features across the [[World Wide Web|web]] using platform-independent calls.  One can think of geographical features as the "[[source code]]" behind a map, whereas the [[Web Map Service|WMS]] interface or online [[Tiled web map|tiled mapping]] portals like [[Google Maps]] return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or [[Geographic information system#Spatial analysis with GIS|spatially analyze]].  The [[XML]]-based [[Geography Markup Language|GML]] furnishes the default payload-encoding for transporting geographic features, but other formats like [[shapefile]]s can also serve for transport. In early 2006 the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=15201&lt;/ref&gt; This profile is designed both to increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard.

The OGC membership defined and maintains the WFS specification.  Numerous commercial and [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementations of the WFS interface standard exist, including the open-source reference implementations [[GeoServer]] and [[deegree]]. The OGC Implementing Products page&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/byspec/?specid=50
&lt;/ref&gt;
provides a comprehensive list of WFS implementations.

==Overview ==
The WFS specification defines interfaces for describing data manipulation operations of geographic features. Data manipulation operations include the ability to:

* get or query features based on spatial and non-spatial constraints
* create a new feature instance
* delete a feature instance
* update a feature instance

The basic Web Feature Service allows querying and retrieval of features.  A transactional Web Feature Service ([[WFS-T]]) allows creation, deletion, and updating of features.

A WFS describes discovery, query, or data transformation operations. The client generates the request and posts it to a web feature server using HTTP. The web feature server then executes the request. The WFS specification uses HTTP as the distributed computing platform, although this is not a hard requirement.

There are two encodings defined for WFS operations:
* [[XML]] (amenable to HTTP POST, or [[SOAP]])
* Key/value pairs (encoded in HTTP GET [[query string]]s, to perform [[remote procedure call]]s)&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=36263&amp;format=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the taxonomy of [[Web Services]], WFS is best categorized as a non-RESTful RPC type service.

=== Communication models===
The WFS Web Feature Services or Web Feature Server specification supports two communication models:
*Stateless Request Reply
*Pub/Sub
::A messaging system in which clients address messages to a specific node in a content hierarchy, called a topic. Publishers and subscribers are generally anonymous and can dynamically publish or subscribe to the content hierarchy. The system takes care of distributing the messages arriving from a node's multiple publishers to its multiple subscribers. Messages are generally not persistent and will only be received by subscribers who are listening at the time the message is sent. A special case known as a “durable subscription” allows subscribers to receive messages sent while the subscribers are not active. (Source: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/glossary.html)

The Web Notification Service (WNS) is one of the implementation specifications for the Pub/Sub model. Regardless of the model, [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] format is used and specified in the WFS specification. At this time there are no open-standard implementations of WNSs. Vendors plan to release implementations once the standard has been ratified.

===Data ===
{{main|Geography Markup Language}}

Data passed between a Web Feature Server and a client is encoded with [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML), an XML dialect which can be used to model geographic features.

The 1.0.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 2.1.2, while the 1.1.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 3.1.1.  For both versions of the WFS specification, an arbitrary number of other encodings can also be defined, in addition to the required GML 2.1.2 or 3.1.1 format (for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 respectively).

GML 2.1.2 contains encoding support for basic geometric 'primitives':  points, lines, polygons, etc.

GML 3.1.1 contains encoding support for more advanced geometric representations:  curves, surfaces, multi-dimensions (time, elevation, multi-band imagery).  In addition, GML 3.1.1 includes encoding support for topologically integrated datasets.

===Static Interfaces ===
The static interface model for the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] Web Service model appears in the figure below.

The Transaction and LockFeature operations are also optional.

When writing a WFS, you must implement the following operations:
*GetCapabilities - this queries the WFS service to determine available options.
*DescribeFeatureType - this retrieves the XML schema to allow the WFS client to parse the resultsets.
*GetFeature - this performs the actual query - parameters such as [[bounding box]] and any other filters should be passed in, as appropriate, and the WFS service then returns a GML resultset containing full geometry and feature attributes.

===Dynamic interface updates ===
The client gets updates by one of two mechanisms:
*Notification: Recommended but not mandatory. Depends on the availability of a WMS implementation.
*Polling: Use this method if a WMS implementation is not available.

'''WFS dynamic interface web notification model'''

This model uses the OGC Web Notification Service to send update notifications to registered clients.
