'''Abalos Undae''' ([[Latin]] for "Abalos Waves") is a [[dune field]] on [[Mars]] in the periphery of [[Planum Boreum]], the Martian North pole. It is one of the [[Classical albedo features on Mars|officially named]] northern circumpolar dune fields, along with [[Olympia Undae|Olympia]], [[Hyperboreae Undae|Hyperboreae]], and [[Siton Undae]], and also one of the densest of the region.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kate Fishbaugh|title=Dunes in Abalos Undae|url=https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010219_2785|date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its northernmost boundary is located in the southwest channel that separates the [[Abalos Colles]] formation from the main polar ice cap, and from there the dune field extends southwest all the way to the lowlands of [[Vastitas Borealis]].&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarus(2008)"/&gt;

It is theorised that the dunes of the Abalos field may have resulted from erosion of ''[[Rupes Tenuis]]'' ({{lang-la|Thin Cliff}}), the polar [[Escarpment|scarp]].&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAimage/&gt; Its name was approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; It extends from latitude 74.94°N to 82.2°N and from longitude 261.4°E to 283.03°E (76.97°W – 98.6°W). Its origin is located at classical [[albedo feature]] with coordinates 72°N, 70°W and has a diameter of 442.74&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web|website= Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature|title=Abalos Undae|url=https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/5?__fsk=-1259906441|publisher=[[USGS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grey regions are lower density fields. The four densest dune fields including Abalos Undae are shown in black. The [[prime meridian]] is at the bottom of the map. Abalos Undae is the smaller black region at centre left, between longitude 261.4°E to 283.03°E (76.97°W – 98.6°W).]]
Abalos Undae is a [[dune field]] on [[Mars]], in the periphery of Planum Boreum, the Martian north pole. It is a part of the northern circumpolar dune fields, along with Olympia, Hyperboreae, and Siton Undae, which are officially named after nearby [[Classical albedo features on Mars|classical albedo features]].&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt; It is located in the southwest channel that separates the Abalos Colles formation remnant from the main ice cap, and continues all the way to the channel's southern boundary.&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarus(2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Niels Hovius, Andrew Lea-Cox, Jens M.

Enhanced colour images obtained by the [[HiRISE|High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment]] (HiRISE) camera on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] highlight the areas of the dunes where different materials are present.&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt; The blue areas indicate the presence of dunes of [[basalt]]ic origin, while the light-colour areas are probably dust. The pictures are of sufficient resolution to show ripples on the dune surface.&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt; The ripples are generated by winds, as are the dunes.&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt; The dunes are considered stationary as a unit, with only small ripple movements present.&lt;ref name="hirise.lpl"/&gt;

Similarly to the rest of the dune fields around the periphery of Planum Borealis, the Abalos dune field is considered to consist of [[lag deposit]]s resulting from the [[ablation]] of the sediment found in [[Basal sliding|basal units]].&lt;ref name="Icarus(2008)"/&gt; The Abalos dune field is considered one of the densest dune fields in the northern circumpolar region of Mars.

'''Arkiko''' ({{lang-ar|حرقيقو}}, alternately '''Archigo''', '''Arqiqo''', '''Ercoco''', '''Hirgigo''', '''Hargigo''' or '''Harkiko''') is a town in the [[Northern Red Sea Region|Northern Red Sea]] [[Regions of Eritrea|region]] of [[Eritrea]]. Situated on the [[Red Sea]], it lies on the mainland across from the island of [[Massawa]].

==Overview==
Arkiki or known by the locals Saho tribe; the clans of Dasamo, as Hirg-Higo. The clan of Dasamo are the inhabitant of this area, it is also known by the name Dahano, from either the [[Saho language|Saho]] or [[Afar language|Afar]] word for "elephant". The meaning of Higo is legend of legends in Saho language. [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] explains this etymology to the importance of the [[ivory trade]] to Hirg-Higo or known as Arkiko.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Asmara: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826–48 (during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, but not the phase under de facto [[Egypt]]ian rule), parts of Eritrea were ruled by the [[Naib]] (or deputy) of Hirg-Higo, according to some sources part of the time cumulating with the office of [[wali]] (regular military governor) of Massawa, the present [[Capital (political)|capital]].

This town was the site of a terrible massacre by the [[Derg]]ue [[military junta]] of [[Ethiopia]] in 1975, during the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]. Also located in this town is Eritrea's largest [[Electricity generation|power generation]] facility. This facility was partially destroyed during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]], but has now been fully repaired.

==Climate and habitat==
The region is reputedly one of the hottest inhabited places on earth, with temperatures soaring well above 40°C (104°F) for much of the year, combined with an average annual rainfall of less than two centimetres (an inch).

Formerly covering significant portions of the Eritrean coast, original [[mangrove]] forest was destroyed by overgrazing by camels or cutting for firewood or the building of homes and boats.

==Economy==
Today, Arkiko is the site of the artificial planting on mangrove trees with the help of low-cost slow-release fertilizer packs of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and iron, allowing the plant growth in areas previously uninhabited by trees. It is supported by the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries, in the hope to restore mangrove coastline boosting the numbers of livestock, fish and seafood.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080414/sc_afp/eritreaenvironmentpovertyfishing{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expedition Atlantis''' is the name given to the crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] made by five Argentines in 1984, leaving from the port of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]] and 52 days later arriving in [[La Guaira]], [[Venezuela]].

The aim was to prove that 3500 years before [[Christopher Columbus]], African sailors may have accidentally reached the shores of America led by specific [[ocean current]]s.

The boat was a raft {{convert|13.6|m}} long by {{convert|5.8|m}} wide, built out of logs, rudderless, and with only a single sail. The crew consisted of Alfredo Barragan, Jorge Iriberri, Horacio Giaccaglia, Daniel Sanchez and Felix Arrieta Magariños.

The departure date was May 22, 1984, and landfall was made 52 days later, on July 12, 1984. The distance traveled was approximately {{convert|3200|nmi}}.

Being a [[metallogenetic province]] the Bolivian tin belt is rich in [[tin]], [[tungsten]], [[silver]] and [[base metal]]s. The Bolivian tin belt follows the same bend as the [[Bolivian orocline]].&lt;ref name=MlyWill2005/&gt; The [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]s of the belt were formed episodically beginning in the [[Triassic]] and with the youngest known mineralizations dating to the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=HallsSchneider1888/&gt; 

The mineral enrichment is a result of [[Hydrothermal circulation|fluids]] expelled from [[peraluminous]] magmas. Peraluminous magmas in turn results from the [[partial melting]] ([[anatexis]]) of [[metasediment|metasedimentary rock]] and [[gneiss]] in the [[continental crust]].&lt;ref name=MlyWill2005/&gt; Analysis of [[trace element]]s in the igneous rocks formed by this magma suggests that some of its material derives from melting of a [[pelite|pelitic rock]] of [[Paleozoic|Lower Paleozoic]] age. Besides crustal components magmas did also involved sources in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehmann |first1=B. |last2=Dietrich |first2=A. |last3=Heinhorst |first3=J.|last4=Métrich |first4=N. |last5=Mosbah |first5=M.|last6= Palacios|first6=C. |last7=Schneider |first7=H.-J.|last8=Wallianos |first8=A. |last9=Webster |first9=J.|last10=Winkelmann |first10=N. |date=2000 |title=Boron in the Bolivian tin belt |url=http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/126162/Lehmann_B.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=[[Mineralium Deposita]] |volume=35 |issue= |pages=23–232 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of these magmas is thus a form of [[crustal recycling]].&lt;ref name=HallsSchneider1888/&gt;  

Peraluminous magmas are rare in the [[Andes]] but more common in [[Continental collision|collisional]] [[orogeny|orogens]] such the [[Himalaya]]s. From this it is inferred that the [[Andean orogeny]] in Bolivia should have features in common with collisional orogens. This in turn might be related to particularities in  the interaction of the [[South American Plate]] and the [[Nazca Plate]] during the Andean orogeny which led to collision-like events in the [[Cenozoic]] at the latitudes of Bolivia. The tectonic mechanism makes the invocation of a long-lived "tin anomaly" beneath the Cordillera Oriental [[Ockham's razor|unnecessary]].&lt;ref name=MlyWill2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mlynarczyk |first1=Michael S.J. |last2=Williams-Jones |first2=Anthony E. |date=2005 |title=The role of collisional tectonics in the metallogeny of the Central Andean tin belt |url= |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=240 |issue= |pages=656–667 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braal''' is a [[fictional planet]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. It is the homeworld of a race of magnetism manipulators. Its most famous resident is [[Cosmic Boy]], a [[DC Comics]]' superhero and founding member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  It was also home to his brother Pol, who later joined the Legion as [[Magnetic Kid]], and in the post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|''Zero Hour'']] continuity is the home planet of Dyrk Magz, a.k.a. [[Magno (comics)|Magno]].  Braal was first mentioned in ''Adventure Comics'' #247 (April 1958).

==History==
{{in-universe|section|date=March 2014}}

===Pre-Crisis===
Some history of the planet Braal is given in ''Adventure Comics'' #352 (January 1967).  Along with its humanoid natives, Braal is inhabited with several species of animals made of living metal.  Some of these metal animals are dangerous and often attack the human settlements.  The natives of Braal evolved the magnetic abilities that give them a defense against the metal monsters.

About the time Cosmic Boy is 14, Braal suffers a planet-wide depression.  As the age of adulthood on Braal is 14, Rokk Krinn (as Cosmic Boy was then known) leaves his home planet to seek work on the planet Earth.  During his trip he meets [[Garth Ranzz]] and [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ardeen]], the other two founding members of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

===v4 Legion===
Braal's history is modified for the v4/"Five Year Gap" Legion stories.  Never a prosperous planet, Braal is devastated by the economic collapse of the United Planets.  Braal enters into a war with [[Imsk]], and is thrashed when the Imskians deploys a weapon which turns Braalian magnetic abilities against them, at the battle of [[Venado Bay]].  Those who get a partial dose are merely knocked out and lose their magnetic abilities.  Those who get a full dose are torn apart by their own magnetic powers.  After being defeated, Braal is occupied by Imsk, which keeps a sizable garrison on the planet to control it.

===Post Zero-Hour===
Braal's history is modified again after the events of Zero Hour.  Braal is still an ecomically depressed world, but is now involved in a war with Titan, the moon of [[Saturn]].  The planet's major source of pride is Magnoball, the most popular sport on Braal.  It involving an iron ball which is manipulated by Braalians to score goals.  Prior to founding the legion, Cosmic Boy was a champion Magnoball player.  While visit Earth on a tour of the United Planets, Cosmic Boy, along with [[Garth Ranzz]] and [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ardeen]] help prevent the murder of billionaire [[R.J. Brande]].

The territory of Brigantia which now forms [[Northern England]] and part of [[The Midlands]] covered the majority of the land between the [[River Tyne]] and the [[River Humber]] forming the largest Brythonic Kingdom in ancient Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/roman/brigantes.htm|title=Brigantes|author=Britain Express|work=Britain Express|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD to extend sea to sea, from the [[Irish sea]] on the west coast to the [[North sea]] in the east

==Etymology==
It is unclear if the [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] name Brigantia is derived from the highland topography of the area or from the Goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]] who was worshiped by the [[Brigantes]] themselves. In modern Welsh the word ''braint'' means 'privilege, prestige' and comes from the same root ''*brigantī''.  Other related forms from the modern Celtic languages are: Welsh ''brenin'' 'king' (&lt; *''brigantīnos''); Welsh/Cornish/Breton ''bri'' 'prestige, reputation, honour, dignity', Scottish Gaelic ''brìgh'' 'pith, power', Irish ''brí'' 'energy, significance', Manx ''bree'' 'power, energy' (all &lt; *''brīg-/brigi-''); and Welsh/Cornish/Breton ''bre'' 'hill' (&lt; ''*brigā'').  The name Bridget from [[Old Irish]] ''[[Brigit]]'' (Modern Irish ''Bríd'') also comes from ''Brigantī'', as does the English river name [[River Brent|Brent]].

This mirrors the debate as to whether settlements named ''Brigantium'' (meaning 'settlement of the high ones') is in reference to nobility or the highlands they lived around, such as the [[Pennines]]. There are several ancient settlements named ''[[Brigantium (disambiguation)|Brigantium]]'' around Europe, such as Berganza in [[Alava]] (Spain), [[Betanzos]] and [[Bergondo]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (Spain), [[Bragança (Portugal)|Bragança]] in [[Portugal]] and  [[Briançon]],&lt;ref name="rborg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/brigantes.htm|publisher=Roman-Britain.org|title=The Brigantes|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://personal.telefonica.terra.es/web/brigantium/brigantiumcity.htm|publisher=Terra.es|title=Brigantium|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szőny|Brigetio]] on the border of [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="brigetio1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=brigetio|publisher=The Princeton encyclopedia|title=Brigetio (Szöny) Komárom|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hüfingen|Brigobanne]] situated on the [[Breg River|Breg river]] and near the [[Brigach]] river in south [[Germany]] (pre-Roman [[Vindelicia]]&lt;ref name="vindmap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cartotecadigital.icc.cat/cdm/singleitem/collection/europa/id/1401|publisher=Europeana|title=Vindelicia map|year=1830}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name="brigobanne"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=brigobanne|publisher=The Princeton encyclopedia|title=Brigobanne Germany|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bregenz]] in the [[Alps]]. From the same origin also stems the name of the Italian sub-region of [[Brianza]].

==History==
In the form of a loose confederation, Brigantia existed as the territory of a number of small tribes with the Pennines being described as composing the heart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/iron_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Native Tribes of Britain|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extending from this, Brigantia was further formed by a number of sub-tribes whose territory is sometimes coined by some researchers as being part of '''Greater Brigantia''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kenyon | first=Denise | title=The Origins of Lancashire | website= | date=2015-04-23 | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Lancashire.html?id=Ez68AAAAIAAJ | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-23| isbn=9780719035463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is often debated as to which tribes formed a [[sept]] of Brigantia and which may have been independent. Some of the sub-tribes often included are the [[Setantii]] who occupied western and southern [[Lancashire]], [[Textoverdi]] in the upper valley of the River South Tyne and the [[Carvetii]] who occupied what is now [[Cumbria]].

[[Isurium]] or Isurium of the Brigantes (Latin: ''Isurium Brigantum'') the historical capital of the kingdom became a Roman fort and town in the province of Britannia at the site of present-day [[Aldborough, North Yorkshire]], England, in the United Kingdom. Its remains—the Aldborough Roman Site—are in the care of English Heritage. ''Bremetennacum Veteranorum'' ([[Ribchester]]) and ''Mamucium'' (Manchester) as well as ''Coccium'' (Wigan) were all Roman forts stationed in Brigantia.

Around [[Roman conquest of Britain|43 AD]] when the Brigantes were first recorded, Brigantia consisted of mossland, marshes and forests which they inhabited; such ancient forests include the [[Forest of Lyme]] and the [[Forest of Bowland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2EWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=PTOLEMY+DESCRIBES+BRIGANTES&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oxiAQ_L-dy&amp;sig=YO61RcPwqe6KXus0iom6lJhG3aI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dtU8VcSyAoL1apypgKgB&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=PTOLEMY%20DESCRIBES%20BRIGANTES&amp;f=false |title=Eburacum: Or York Under the Romans - Charles Wellbeloved - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time they would have been wild with fauna that were hunted, including: [[eurasian brown bear]], [[wild boar]], [[bison]], [[Wolves in Great Britain|wolves]], [[deer]] and eagles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/livingwithromans/ancestors.aspx |title=Our ancestors and the Roman invasion - Museum of Liverpool, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/7330504/Bears-lynx-wolves-and-elk-considered-for-reintroduction-into-British-countryside.html |title=Bears, lynx, wolves and elk considered for reintroduction into British countryside |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cape Horn''' ({{lang-es|Cabo de Hornos}}, {{IPA-es|ˈkaβo ðe ˈoɾnos|pron}}) is the southernmost [[headlands and bays|headland]] of the [[Tierra del Fuego]] [[archipelago]] of southern [[Chile]], and is located on the small [[Hornos Island]]. Although not the most southerly point of [[South America]] (which are the [[Diego Ramírez Islands]]), Cape Horn marks the northern boundary of the [[Drake Passage]] and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet.

Cape Horn was discovered and first rounded by the Dutchman [[Willem Schouten]], who named it {{Audio|Nl-Kaap Hoorn.ogg|''Kaap Hoorn''}} after the city of [[Hoorn]] in the [[Netherlands]]. For decades, Cape Horn was a major milestone on the [[clipper route]], by which [[sailing ship]]s carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and [[iceberg]]s; these dangers have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard.

The need for boats and ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in August 1914. However, sailing around the Cape Horn is still widely regarded as one of the major challenges in [[yachting]]. Thus a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Almost all of these choose routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point.) Several prominent ocean [[yacht racing|yacht races]], notably the [[Volvo Ocean Race]], the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|VELUX 5 Oceans]], and the [[Vendée Globe]], sail around the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route.

=== Climate ===
The climate in the region is generally cool, owing to the southern latitude. There are no weather stations in the group of islands including Cape Horn; but a study in 1882–1883, found an annual rainfall of {{convert|1,357|mm|abbr=off}}, with an average annual temperature of {{convert|5.2|°C}}.

Cape Horn is part of the [[Communes of Chile|Commune]] of [[Cabo de Hornos, Chile|Cabo de Hornos]], whose capital is [[Puerto Williams]]; this in turn is part of [[Antártica Chilena Province]], whose capital is also Puerto Williams.

==Modern navigation==
Many modern tankers are too wide to fit through the Panama Canal, as are a few passenger ships and several aircraft carriers. But there are no regular commercial routes around the Horn, and modern ships carrying cargo are rarely seen.  However, a number of [[cruise ship]]s routinely round the Horn when traveling from one ocean to the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avidcruiser.com/2012/09/05/avid-cruiser-voyages-rounding-the-horn/ Avid Cruiser Voyages: Rounding the Horn]&lt;/ref&gt;  These often stop in Ushuaia or [[Punta Arenas]] as well as Port Stanley.  Some of the small passenger vessels shuttling between Ushuaia and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] will pass the Horn too, time and weather permitting.
=== Sailing routes ===
A number of potential sailing routes may be followed around the tip of South America. The [[Strait of Magellan]], between the mainland and Tierra del Fuego, is a major—although narrow—passage, which was in use for trade well before the Horn was discovered. The [[Beagle Channel]] (named for the ship of Charles Darwin's expedition), between Tierra del Fuego and [[Isla Navarino]], offers a potential, though difficult route. Other passages may be taken around the Wollaston and Hermite Islands to the north of Cape Horn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yachting.web.cern.ch/yachting/Lectures/Winter/beppe.html ''Sailing the Patagonian channels''], Yachting Club CERN, 2005. Retrieved February 5, 2006.{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these, however, are notorious for treacherous ''[[williwaw]]'' winds, which can strike a vessel with little or no warning;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/feature/wb241002.htm ''Winds of the World: The Williwaw''], Weather Online. Retrieved February 5, 2006.{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the narrowness of these routes, vessels have a significant risk of being driven onto the rocks. The open waters of the Drake Passage, south of Cape Horn, provide by far the widest route, at about {{convert|800|km|abbr=off}} wide; this passage offers ample sea room for maneuvering as winds change, and is the route used by most ships and sailboats, despite the possibility of extreme wave conditions.&lt;ref name=essort&gt;[http://www.essortment.com/perilous-cape-horn-16725.html ''Perilous Cape Horn''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211043143/http://www.essortment.com/perilous-cape-horn-16725.html |date=2011-12-11 }}, by P.J.

=== 'Rounding the Horn' ===
Visiting Cabo de Hornos can be done on a day trip by helicopter or more arduously by charter power boat or sailboat, or by cruise ship. "Doubling the Horn" is traditionally understood to involve sailing from [[50th parallel South|50 degrees South]] on one coast to 50 degrees South on the other coast, the two benchmark latitudes of a Horn run,&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Time Around Cape Horn. The Historic 1949 Voyage of the Windjammer [[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]'' by William F. Stark. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers. 2003; p. 147  {{ISBN|0-7867-1233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a considerably more difficult and time-consuming endeavor having a minimum length of {{convert|930|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;The fastest time on record for a commercial sailing ship working ''westward'' around the Horn, from 50 degrees South in the Atlantic to 50 degrees South in the Pacific, is 5 days and 14 hours, made in 1938 by the 4-mast barque ''[[Priwall (barque)|Priwall]]'' of the [[Flying P-Line]] under Captain Adolf Hauth [Stark, p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipping hazards ===
[[File:Unidentified tall ship near Cape Horn - Nla.pic-vn3299637-v.jpg|thumb|right|View from an unidentified sailing ship during a storm at Cape Horn, between 1885 and 1954]]
Several factors combine to make the passage around Cape Horn one of the most hazardous shipping routes in the world: the fierce sailing conditions prevalent in the Southern Ocean generally; the geography of the passage south of the Horn; and the extreme southern latitude of the Horn, at [[56th parallel south|56° south]]. (For comparison, [[Cape Agulhas]] at the southern tip of Africa is at [[35° south]]; [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] at the south end of [[New Zealand]] is [[47° south]].)

The [[prevailing winds]] in latitudes below 40° south can blow from west to east around the world almost uninterrupted by land, giving rise to the "[[roaring forties]]" and the even more wild "furious fifties" and "screaming sixties". These winds are hazardous enough that ships traveling east would tend to stay in the northern part of the forties (i.e. not far below 40° south latitude); however, rounding Cape Horn requires ships to press south to 56° south latitude, well into the zone of fiercest winds.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way'', Francis Chichester; p. 134. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1966. {{ISBN|0-340-00191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These winds are exacerbated at the Horn by the funneling effect of the [[Andes]] and the [[Antarctic peninsula]], which channel the winds into the relatively narrow Drake Passage.

The strong winds of the Southern Ocean give rise to correspondingly large waves; these waves can attain great height as they roll around the Southern Ocean, free of any interruption from land. At the Horn, however, these waves encounter an area of shallow water to the south of the Horn, which has the effect of making the waves shorter and steeper, greatly increasing the hazard to ships.  If the strong eastward current through the Drake Passage encounters an opposing east wind, this can have the effect of further building up the waves.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these "normal" waves, the area west of the Horn is particularly notorious for [[rogue wave]]s, which can attain heights of up to {{convert|30|m|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news

The prevailing winds and currents create particular problems for vessels trying to round the Horn against them, i.e. from east to west. This was a particularly serious problem for traditional sailing ships, which could make very little headway against the wind at the best of times;&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; modern sailing boats are significantly more efficient to windward and can more reliably make a westward passage of the Horn, as they do in the ''[[Global Challenge]]'' race.

Ice is a hazard to sailors venturing far below 40° south. Although the ice limit dips south around the horn, [[icebergs]] are a significant hazard for vessels in the area. In the South Pacific in February (summer in Southern Hemisphere), icebergs are generally confined to below 50° south; but in August the iceberg hazard can extend north of 40° south. Even in February, the Horn is well below the latitude of the iceberg limit.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of Pilot Charts: South Pacific Ocean''; Lighthouse Press, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57785-202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hazards have made the Horn notorious as perhaps the most dangerous ship passage in the world; many ships were wrecked, and many sailors died attempting to round the Cape.

=== Lighthouses ===
 {{GeoGroup}}
Two [[lighthouses]] are located near or in Cape Horn. The one located in the Chilean Navy Station is the more accessible and visited, and is commonly referred to as ''the'' Cape Horn lighthouse. However, the Chilean Navy station, including the lighthouse ([[Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society|ARLS]] CHI-030, {{coord|55|57|49|S|67|13|14|W|name=CHI-030}}) and the memorial, are not located on Cape Horn (which is difficult to access either by land or sea), but on another land point about one mile east-northeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/chls.htm|title=Lighthouses of Southern Chile|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Cape Horn proper is a smaller {{convert|4|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} fiberglass light tower, with a focal plane of {{convert|40|m|abbr=off}} and a range of about {{convert|21|km|abbr=off}}. This is the authentic Cape Horn lighthouse ([[Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society|ARLS]] CHI-006, {{coord|55|58|38|S|67|15|46|W|name=CHI-006}}), and as such the world's southernmost traditional lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/chls.htm|title=Faro Cabo de Hornos|language=Spanish|trans-title=Cape Horn Light Station |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few minor [[navigation aid|aids to navigation]] are located farther south, including one in the [[Diego Ramírez Islands]] and several in Antarctica.

=== Recreational and sport sailing ===
[[File:Cape Horn-650px.jpg|thumb|Approaching Cape Horn from the south-west.]]
Despite the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and Panama Canals, the Horn remains part of the fastest sailing route around the world, and so the growth in recreational long-distance sailing has brought about a revival of sailing via the Horn. Owing to the remoteness of the location and the hazards there, a rounding of Cape Horn is widely considered to be the yachting equivalent of climbing Mount Everest, and so many sailors seek it for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://robduncan.com/tag/cape-horn/ ''Rob Duncan's Quest for Cape Horn''], by Rob Duncan.

[[Joshua Slocum]] was the first [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] yachtsman to successfully pass this way (in 1895) although in the end, extreme weather forced him to use some of the inshore routes between the channels and islands and it is believed he did not actually pass outside the Horn proper. If one had to go by strict definitions, the first small boat to sail around outside Cape Horn was the {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on|lk=on|abbr=off}} [[yacht]] ''Saoirse'', sailed by [[Edward Conor Marshall O'Brien|Conor O'Brien]] with three friends, who rounded it during a circumnavigation of the world between 1923 and 1925.&lt;ref name=nautweb/&gt; In 1934, the Norwegian Al Hansen was the first to round Cape Horn single-handed from east to west—the "wrong way"—in his boat ''Mary Jane'', but was subsequently wrecked on the coast of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/circumna/ci_15.htm ''The Circumnavigators''], by Don Holm; Chapter 15. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510154215/http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/circumna/ci_15.htm |date=May 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to successfully circumnavigate the world single-handed via Cape Horn was Argentinian [[Vito Dumas]], who made the voyage in 1942 in his {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=on||abbr=off}}  [[ketch]] ''[[Lehg II]]''; a number of other sailors have since followed him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org/solo/solotable.htm ''List Of Solo Circumnavigators''], from the Joshua Slocum Society International. Retrieved February 12, 2006.{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Webb Chiles]] aboard "{{sc|EGREGIOUS}}" who in December 1975 rounded Cape Horn single-handed. On March 31, 2010, 16-year-old [[Abby Sunderland]] became the youngest person to single-handedly sail around Cape Horn in her attempt to circumnavigate the globe. In 1987 The British Cape Horn Expedition, headed by Nigel H Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing kayaks' called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing positions between the two kayaks.

Today, there are several major yacht races held regularly along the old clipper route via Cape Horn. The first of these was the ''[[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]]'', which was a single-handed race; this inspired the present-day ''[[Around Alone]]'' race, which circumnavigates with stops, and the ''[[Vendée Globe]]'', which is non-stop. Both of these are single-handed races, and are held every four years. The ''[[Volvo Ocean Race]]'' is a crewed race with stops which sails the clipper route every four years. Its origins lie in the ''[[Whitbread Round the World Race]]'' first competed in 1973–74. The [[Jules Verne Trophy]] is a prize for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by any type of yacht, with no restrictions on the size of the crew (no assistance, non-stop). Finally, the ''Global Challenge'' race goes around the world the "wrong way", from east to west, which involves rounding Cape Horn against the prevailing winds and currents.

The Horn remains a major hazard for recreational sailors, however. A classic case is that of [[Miles and Beryl Smeeton]], who attempted to round the Horn in their yacht ''Tzu Hang''. Hit by a rogue wave when approaching the Horn, the boat pitchpoled (i.e. somersaulted end-over-end). Although they survived, and were able to make repairs in [[Talcahuano]], Chile, they attempted the passage again, only to be rolled over, and dismasted for a second time, by another rogue wave, which again they miraculously survived.&lt;ref&gt;''Once Is Enough'', by Miles Smeeton.

=== Discovery ===
[[File:Le Maire en Schouten - Reis via Kaap Hoorn naar Indie 1615-1616.png|thumb|The voyage of [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob le Maire]] in 1615–16]]
In 1525 the vessel ''San Lesmes'' commanded by [[Francisco de Hoces]], member of the [[Loaísa Expedition]], was blown south by a gale in front of the Atlantic end of [[Magellan Strait]] and reached 56° S where ''they thought to see Land's End.''

In September 1578, Sir [[Francis Drake]], in the course of his circumnavigation of the world, passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean. Before he could continue his voyage north his ships encountered a storm, and were blown well to the south of [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The expanse of open water they encountered led Drake to guess that far from being another continent, as previously believed, Tierra del Fuego was an island with open sea to its south. This discovery went unused for some time, as ships continued to use the known passage through the Strait of Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenhind.co.uk/education/worksheets/voyage.html ''Voyage of the Golden Hind''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050104112053/http://www.goldenhind.co.uk/education/worksheets/voyage.html |date=2005-01-04 }}, from The Golden Hind.

By the early 17th century the [[Dutch East India Company]] was given a monopoly on all Dutch trade via the Straits of Magellan and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], the only known routes at the time to the [[Far East]]. To search for an alternate route and one to the unknown ''Terra Australis'', [[Isaac Le Maire]],&lt;ref&gt;it seems to have been Le Maire who pursued the idea of such a passage [''A History of Geographical Discovery and Exploration'' by J.N.L.Baker. London: George G. Harrap &amp; Co., Ltd. 1931, p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy Amsterdam merchant and [[Willem Schouten]], a ship’s master of Hoorn, contributed in equal shares to the enterprise, with additional financial support from merchants of Hoorn.&lt;ref&gt;''THE RELATION OF a Wonderful Voyage made by Willem Cornelison Schouten of Horne.

The two ships that departed Holland at the beginning of June 1615 were the ''Eendracht''&lt;ref&gt;called ''Unitie'' in the Philip translation&lt;/ref&gt; of 360 tons with Schouten and Le Maire aboard, and the ''Hoorn'' of 110 tons, of which Schouten’s brother Johan was master. It was ''Eendracht'' then, with the crew of the recently wrecked ''Hoorn'' aboard,&lt;ref&gt;''Hoorn'' was accidentally burned and destroyed on December 19, 1615 with no loss of life in [[Patagonia]] during a bungled cleaning attempt of the hull&lt;/ref&gt; that passed through the [[Le Maire Strait]] and Schouten and Le Maire made their great discovery:

:“In the evening 25 January 1616 the winde was South West, and that night wee went South with great waves or billowes out of the southwest, and very blew water, whereby wee judged, and held for certaine that ... it was the great South Sea, whereat we were exceeding glad to thinke that wee had discovered a way, which until that time, was unknowne to men, as afterward wee found it to be true.”&lt;ref name=Relation&gt;''The Relation'', pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

:“... on 29 January 1616 we saw land againe lying north west and north northwest from us, which was the land that lay South from the straights of Magelan which reacheth Southward, all high hillie lande covered over with snow, ending with a sharpe point which wee called Cape Horne [Kaap Hoorn] ...”&lt;ref name=essort/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relation /&gt;

At the time it was discovered, the Horn was believed to be the southernmost point of Tierra del Fuego; the unpredictable violence of weather and sea conditions in the Drake Passage made exploration difficult, and it was only in 1624 that the Horn was discovered to be an island. It is a telling testament to the difficulty of conditions there that Antarctica, only {{convert|650|km|abbr=off}} away across the Drake Passage, was discovered only as recently as 1820, despite the passage having been used as a major shipping route for 200 years.&lt;ref name=nautweb/&gt;

The only facilities in the vicinity able to service or supply a ship, or provide medical care, were in the [[Falkland Islands]]. The businesses there were so notorious for price-gouging that damaged ships were sometimes abandoned at [[Port Stanley]].

While most companies switched to steamers and later used the [[Panama canal]], German steel-hulled sailing ships like the [[Flying P-Liner]]s were designed since the 1890s to withstand the weather conditions around the Horn, as they specialized in the South American nitrate trade and later the Australian grain trade. None of them were lost travelling around the Horn, but some, like the mighty ''[[Preußen (ship)|Preußen]]'', were victims of collisions in the busy English channel.

Traditionally, a sailor who had rounded the Horn was entitled to wear a gold loop earring—in the left ear, the one which had faced the Horn in a typical eastbound passage—and to dine with one foot on the table; a sailor who had also rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] could place both feet on the table.&lt;ref&gt;''A Voyage for Madmen'', by Peter Nichols; pp. 4–5.

One particular historic attempt to round the Horn, that of [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] in 1788, has been immortalized in history due to the subsequent [[Mutiny on the Bounty]]. This abortive Horn voyage has been portrayed (with varying historical accuracy) in three major motion pictures about Captain [[William Bligh]]'s mission to transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica. The Bounty made only 85 miles of headway in 31 days of east-to-west sailing, before giving up by reversing course and going around Africa. Although the 1984 movie portrayed another decision to go round the Horn as a precipitating factor in the mutiny (this time west-to-east after collecting the breadfruits in the South Pacific), in fact that was never contemplated out of concern for the effect of the low temperatures near the Horn on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroads]] in North America, as well as the [[Panama Canal]] that opened in 1914 in Central America, led to the gradual decrease in use of the Horn for trade. As [[steamboat|steamships]] replaced sailing ships, Flying P-Liner ''[[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]'' became the last commercial sailing ship to round Cape Horn laden with cargo, carrying grain from [[Port Victoria, South Australia|Port Victoria]], Australia, to [[Falmouth, England|Falmouth]], England, in 1949.

== Literature and culture ==
Cape Horn has been an icon of sailing culture for centuries; it has featured in [[sea shanty|sea shanties]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingeb.org/songs/aroundca.html ''Around Cape Horn''], from Frank Petersohn. Retrieved February 5, 2006.{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many books about sailing. One of the classic accounts of a working ship in the age of sail is ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', by [[Richard Henry Dana Jr.]], in which the author describes an arduous trip from Boston to California via Cape Horn:

{{quote|Just before eight o'clock (then about sundown, in that latitude) the cry of "All hands ahoy!" was sounded down the fore scuttle and the after hatchway, and hurrying upon deck, we found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west, and blackening the whole heavens. "Here comes Cape Horn!" said the chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up, before it was upon us. In a few moments, a heavier sea was raised than I had ever seen before, and as it was directly ahead, the little brig, which was no better than a bathing machine, plunged into it, and all the forward part of her was under water; the sea pouring in through the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knightheads, threatening to wash everything overboard. In the lee scuppers it was up to a man's waist. We sprang aloft and double reefed the topsails, and furled all the other sails, and made all snug. But this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining against the head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse. At the same time sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us. We clewed down, and hauled out the reef-tackles again, and close-reefed the fore-topsail, and furled the main, and hove her to on the starboard tack. Here was an end to our fine prospects....}}

After nine more days of headwinds and unabated storms, Dana reported that his ship, the "Pilgrim" finally cleared the turbulent waters of Cape Horn and turned northwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/23/5.html ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative''], by Richard Henry Dana; Chapter V, ''Cape Horn — A Visit''. Signet Classics, 2000. {{ISBN|0-451-52759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]], in ''The Voyage of the Beagle'', a [[Diary|journal]] of the five-year expedition upon which he based ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', described his 1832 encounter with the Horn:

{{quote|... we closed in with the Barnevelts, and running past Cape Deceit with its stony peaks, about three o'clock doubled the weather-beaten Cape Horn. The evening was calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding isles. Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before night sent us a gale of wind directly in our teeth. We stood out to sea, and on the second day again made the land, when we saw on our weather-bow this notorious promontory in its proper form—veiled in a mist, and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water. Great black clouds were rolling across the heavens, and squalls of rain, with hail, swept by us with such extreme violence, that the Captain determined to run into Wigwam Cove. This is a snug little harbour, not far from Cape Horn; and here, at Christmas-eve, we anchored in smooth water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000816193056/http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-voyage-of-the-beagle/ ''The Voyage of the Beagle''], by Charles Darwin. National Geographic, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7922-6559-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

William Jones, writing of his experience in 1905 as a fifteen year-old apprentice on one of the last commercial sailing ships, noted the contrast between his ship, which would take two months and the lives of three sailors to round the Horn, and birds adapted to the region:

{{quote|An albatross appears out of the murk, to examine us in our plight. The gale is of hurricane force, but the bird sails serenely and unhurriedly through the air, within a few feet of the ship's rail, on the windward side.

Then it turns into the eye of the wind, and disappears in the murk —westward —without any discernible effort in its aerial gliding, while we are still drifting to leeward, incapable of emulating its brilliant defiance of the gusts.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Cape Horn Breed''], by William H.S. Jones. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 56-9964, 1956. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alan Villiers]], a modern-day expert in traditional sailing ships, wrote many books about traditional sailing, including ''By way of Cape Horn''.&lt;ref&gt;''By way of Cape Horn'', by Alan John Villiers. (Out of print.)&lt;/ref&gt; More recent sailors have taken on the Horn singly, such as [[Vito Dumas]], who wrote ''Alone Through The Roaring Forties'' based on his round-the-world voyage;&lt;ref&gt;''Alone Through The Roaring Forties'', Vito Dumas; McGraw-Hill Education, 2001. {{ISBN|0-07-137611-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with small crews.

[[Bernard Moitessier]] made two significant voyages round the Horn; once with his wife Françoise, described in ''Cape Horn: The Logical Route'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cape Horn: The Logical Route; 14,216 Miles Without Port of Call'', by Bernard Moitessier. Sheridan House, 2003. {{ISBN|1-57409-154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once single-handed. His book ''The Long Way'' tells the story of this latter voyage, and of a peaceful night-time passage of the Horn: "The little cloud underneath the moon has moved to the right. I look... there it is, so close, less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} away and right under the moon. And nothing remains but the sky and the moon playing with the Horn. I look. I can hardly believe it. So small and so huge. A hillock, pale and tender in the moonlight; a colossal rock, hard as diamond."&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Way'', by Bernard Moitessier; p. 141. Sheridan House, 1995. {{ISBN|0-924486-84-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And [[John Masefield]] wrote: "Cape Horn, that tramples beauty into wreck / And crumples steel and smites the strong man dumb." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/103/99.html |title=99. Rounding the Horn. John Masefield. Modern British Poetry |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial presented in [[Robert FitzRoy]]'s bicentenary (2005) commemorates his landing on Cape Horn on 19 April 1830.

Canadian singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] wrote a song entitled "Ghosts of Cape Horn"

In 1980 [[Keith F. Critchlow]] directed and produced the [[documentary film]] "Ghosts of Cape Horn", with the participation and archaeological consulting of famous underwater archaeologist [[Peter Throckmorton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">The '''Carbon County Courthouse''', located in [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania]], was built on April 27, 1893.  The winning bid went to the architect Herman Riebe&lt;ref name="carboncourts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carboncourts.com/history.htm|title=History|website=www.carboncourts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of 81,250 dollars.

==Opening==
The completed courthouse was opened in May of 1894.  This was to be the main courthouse for Carbon County and the 3rd such courthouse for the town itself.  It was based on the design of the [[Big Ben]] Clock tower in London, England.  Many of the features inside the courthouse featured many ornate pieces including: fireplaces, vaulted ceilings, stained glass, ornate English Wainscoting, adamant wall plaster and [[Mintons]] Tile that ordained the hallways.  The exterior was based on the [[Romanesque architecture]] revival and sandstone from Rockport, in Northern Carbon County.&lt;ref name="carboncourts.com"/&gt;  The brass bell in the tower was cast at [[McShane Bell Foundry]] [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] from an earlier cast in 1844 weighing in at 2,122 lbs.  Before this present day courthouse for the county seat, there was the 1st courthouse, which was basically the converted Company Store Building or "Old Store".  Donated over to the town itself from the founders of the [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]], it was revamped into a courthouse in 1843.  Housing the county row offices on the 1st floor and the courtroom on the 2nd Floor.&lt;ref name="carboncourts.com"/&gt;

==Fire==
From Dec. 8, 1843 to the devastating fire of July 15, 1849, it served the public; and the court documents that were recovered were then to be put into the 2nd Court House.  The 2nd Court House was started in 1850.&lt;ref name="carboncourts.com"/&gt;  It was February 8, 1850 that construction started with the Blay &amp; Root Contractors of PA.  The courthouse was designed like in the style of a Greek Revival Building.  Completing work in November of 1850, the first trial was set in December 30, 1850 by Judge Eldred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carboncourts.com/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous of all court cases heard here was the court case of the [[Molly Maguires]] from 1876 to 1878.  Due to inadequacy and inefficiency from population of the county, which was nearing 40 thousand at his time, this 2nd courthouse was dismantled and the present day 3rd court house was built on the present site today.

'''Cerro Catedral''' ("Cathedral Hill"), also known as '''Cerro Cordillera''', is a peak and the highest point of [[Uruguay]], with an altitude of {{convert|513.66|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is located north of [[Maldonado Department]], in the municipality of [[Aiguá]], in a hill range named [[Sierra Carapé]], which constitutes part of a larger range named [[Cuchilla Grande]]. Its name derived from the curious forms of the rocky elevations of its summit, which are very common in the southern part of this country.

==History==
Until 1973, [[Cerro de las Ánimas]] (formerly known as ''Mirador Nacional''), with an elevation of {{convert|501|m|ft|abbr=on}}, was considered the highest point of Uruguay. However, in that year, a group of scientists of the ''Servicio Geográfico Militar'' (''Military Geographic Service'') changed the measure of Cerro Catedral.

==Geography==
===Location and geology===
[[Image:Marco del Cerro Catedral.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A [[Triangulation station|geodetic mark]] that indicates the summit]]
Sierra Carapé, formed in [[Precambrian]] time, crosses the Maldonado Department from west to east and enters the [[Rocha Department]]. It constitutes the border between the departments of [[Lavalleja Department|Lavalleja]] and Maldonado. Cerro Catedral, or Cerro Cordillera, is situated in the region of Las Cañas, in the 8th Judicial Section and the 9th Police Section of the Maldonado Department. Near Cerro Catedral there are the source of José Ignacio Stream (''Arroyo José Ignacio''), which runs from north to south, and the source of Coronilla Stream (''Arroyo Coronilla''), running to the northwest, which drains into Aiguá.

The hill is situated in an area of the range which its formation is mainly [[Granite|granitic]] and [[gneiss]]ic.

===Vegetation===
In the highest areas of Cerro Catedral, the vegetation practically does not exist, with the sparse appearance of a shrub called [[Ugni molinae|Myrtus ugni]] between the rocks. Above the altitude of {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, tough grasses, xerophile vegetation, [[baccharis|Baccharis articulata]] and [[Achyrocline satureioides|marcela]] predominate.

===Climate===
The climate in this locality is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] or [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] (described by the [[Köppen climate classification]] as ''Cfb''), with mild to warm [[summer]]s and chilly to cool [[winter]]s (with frequent [[frost]]s). Strong winds are a common occurrence. The [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is evenly distributed throughout the year and [[snow]]falls are uncommon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5049">The '''geology of [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]]''' formed beginning 3.6 billion years ago, in the [[Archean]] Eon of the [[Precambrian]]. Eswatini is the only country entirely underlain by the [[Kaapvaal Craton]], one of the oldest pieces of stable continental crust and the only craton regarded as "pristine" by geologists, other than the [[Yilgarn Craton]] in Australia. As such, the country has very ancient [[granite]], [[gneiss]] and in some cases sedimentary rocks from the Archean into the [[Proterozoic]], overlain by sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks formed during the last 541 million years of the [[Phanerozoic]] as part of the [[Karoo Supergroup]]. Intensive weathering has created thick zones of [[saprolite]] and heavily weathered soils. 

==Stratigraphy and geologic history==
[[Image:Map of Kaapvaal craton.svg|thumb|right|alt=|Eswatini is the only country entirely underlain by the Kaapvaal Craton.]]
Eswatini is built on 3.6 to 2.5 billion year old [[Archean]] continental crust that forms the [[Kaapvaal Craton]] spanning into South Africa, northern Lesotho, western Mozambique, Botswana and southern Zimbabwe. The [[Precambrian]] rocks of Eswatini from this period are primarily [[gneiss]] and [[granite]], formed between 3.4 and 2.6 billion years ago, based on [[rubidium-strontium dating]] analysis in 1976. 

The two rock units of the basement in Eswatini are the Ancient Gneiss Complex and 20 kilometer thick [[mafic]] and ultramafic volcanic rocks of the [[Paleoarchean]] [[Swaziland Supergroup]] includes [[tonalite]] [[gneiss]], [[ironstone]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and other sediments. The Swaziland Supergroup and the Ancient Gneiss Complex are overlain by [[tuff]], [[shale]], [[quartzite]], conglomerate and [[graywacke]].  The two formations are separated by faulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Davies &amp; Allsop |year=1976|title=Strontium isotopic evidence relating to the evolution of the lower Precambrian granitic crust in Swaziland|publisher=Geology|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/4/9/553/194187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granite, gneiss, [[amphibolite]] and a variety of sediments and volcanics formed the [[Pongolo Supergroup]] in the [[Mesoarchean]]. The [[Neoarchean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] is represented by granite and [[granodiorite]]. 

In the [[Paleozoic]], a major rift valley opened across the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], spanning what is now southern Africa and southern South America. The basin filled with sediments, producing the [[Karoo Supergroup]], the most extensive stratigraphic unit in southern Africa. The Karoo Supergroup in Swaziland is composed of [[Permian]] claystones as well as basalt and [[rhyolite]] from the [[Early Jurassic]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soils and saprolite==
The Swaziland Middleveld is dominated by soils and [[saprolite]], formed out of [[diorite]] and [[granodiorite]]. Saprolite formed due to intense chemical weathering in the [[Early Cretaceous]], with an upper oxidation zone and a lower reduction zone. In lower saprolite zones, [[plagioclase]] weathered to [[kaolin]]. [[Mica]], [[feldspar]] and [[amphibole]] are most weathered nearest the surface and iron oxides are more common close to the surface as well. [[Smectite]] clay represents transitional zones of weathering. 

Most soils in the Middleveld are [[oxisols]], [[cambisols]] or [[acrisols]], with significant [[quartz]] and [[kaolinite]], as well as some [[illite]] and [[gibbsite]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Scholten, Felix-Henningsen &amp; Schotte |year=1997|title=Geology, soils and saprolites of the Swaziland Middleveld|publisher=Soil Technology|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093336309700010X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogeology==
Most of central and western Eswatini is underlain by low to moderate productivity aquifers in Precambrian basement rock. A narrow north-south band in the center of the country hosts fracture-flow sedimentary aquifers, while a different north-south band in the east is moderate yield volcanic rocks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Swaziland|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Swaziland#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Eswatini has diverse mineral resources, including diamonds, gold, [[kaolin]], silica sand, arsenic, manganese, copper, nickel and tin. However, most of these deposits are small and are not mined. The Maloma Mine in eastern Eswatini is one of the few active mines in the country, extracting coal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=2010 Minerals Yearbook: Lesotho and Swaziland|publisher=US Geological Survey|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2010/myb3-2010-lt-wz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin''' (''Berlin Geographical Society'') was founded in 1828 and is the second oldest geographical society.

It was founded by some of the foremost geographers of its time. The founder [[Carl Ritter]] and the founding member [[Alexander von Humboldt]] can also be considered the founders of modern scientific geography.

Today the society's aim still is to promote the exchange and spreading of geographical knowledge.

The society publishes the scientific journal ''Die Erde'' (Earth) which has been published since 1853. It also sponsors young scientists with the ''Humboldt-Ritter-Penck-Preis''.

'''ISO 3166-2:PL''' is the entry for [[Poland]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Poland, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[voivodeships of Poland|16 voivodeships ]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PL}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Poland. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Subdivision names are sorted in [[Polish alphabet]]ical order: a, ą, b-c, ć, d-e, ę, f-l, ł, m-n, ń, o, ó, p-s, ś, t-z, ź, ż.

[[File:JanHuygenVanLinschoten.png|thumb|Portrait of Jan Huygen van Linschoten, from the ''princeps'' edition of his ''Itinerario''.]]

'''Jan Huyghen van Linschoten''' (1563 &amp;ndash; 8 February 1611) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchant, trader and historian. An alternative (modern Dutch) spelling of his second name is ''Huijgen''.

He travelled extensively along the East Indies' regions under Portuguese influence and served as the Portuguese Viceroy's secretary in [[Goa]] between 1583 and 1588. He is credited with publishing in Europe important classified information about Asian trade and navigation that was hidden by the Portuguese. In 1596 he published a book, ''Itinerario'' (later published as an English edition as ''Discours of Voyages into Y East &amp; West Indies'') which graphically displayed for the first time in Europe detailed maps of voyages to the East Indies, particularly India. During his stay in Goa, abusing the trust put in him by the Viceroy, Jan Huyghens meticulously copied the top-secret charts page-by-page. Even more crucially, Jan Huyghens provided nautical data like currents, deeps, islands and sandbanks, which was absolutely vital for safe navigation, along with coastal depictions to guide the way. The publication of the navigational routes enabled the passage to the East Indies to be opened to trading by the Dutch, French and the English. As a consequence, The [[Dutch East India Company]] and [[British East India Company]] would break the 16th-century monopoly enjoyed by the Portuguese on trade with the East Indies.

==Origins==
Jan Huyghen was born in [[Haarlem]] in [[Holland]], the son of a [[public notary]] and his wife. The family moved to the town of [[Enkhuizen]] when he was young. The addition of ''van Linschoten'' could indicate that his family had origins in the Utrecht village of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vitrine.library.uu.nl/wwwroot/en/texts/Tfol133rar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102064901/http://vitrine.library.uu.nl/wwwroot/en/texts/Tfol133rar.htm |archivedate=2005-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Huyghen left for [[Spain]] during December 1576 to live with his older brother Willem, who was working as a merchant in [[Seville]]. He learned Spanish and worked there until 1580, when he got a job in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, working with another merchant. A downturn in trade led him to seek alternatives.  With the help of Willem, who was acquainted with the newly appointed [[Archbishop]] of the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], Dominican Vicente da Fonseca, the younger Huyghen was appointed Secretary to the Archbishop. Huyghen sailed for Goa on 8 April 1583, arriving five months later via [[Madeira]], [[Guinea]], [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Mozambique]].

==Goa==
[[File:Fusta by Jan Huygen van Linschoten.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Fusta]] with Portuguese pavilion from a book by Jan Huygen van Linschoten]]
While in Goa, Jan Huygen kept a diary of his observations of the Portuguese-ruled city, amassing information about the Europeans, Indians, and other Asians who lived there. He also had access to maps and other privileged information about commerce and Portuguese navigation in southeast Asia and used his cartographic and drawing skills in order to copy and draw new maps, reproducing a considerable amount of nautical and mercantile information. Several of the nautical charts that he copied had been meticulously kept secret by the Portuguese for more than a century.

Later after returning to Enkhuizen, he collected accounts from other travelers, such as Dirck "China" Gerritsz, a fellow resident of Enkhuizen who earned his nickname from his travels in the Far East. Jan Huygen made note of the trading conditions among different countries, and the sea routes for travelling between them. This information later helped both the Dutch and the English to challenge the Portuguese monopoly on East Indian trade.

The 1587 death of his sponsor, the Archbishop of Goa, while on a trip to Lisbon to report to the King of Portugal, meant the end of the Huyghens' appointment. He set sail for Lisbon in January 1589, passing by the Portuguese supply depot at [[Saint Helena|St. Helena Island]] in May 1589.

==Back in Holland==
[[File:Terceira Azores seen by Linschoten.jpg|thumb|250px|The island of [[Terceira]], [[Azores]], in a hand-colored engraving in the ''Itinerario''.]]
[[File:Plakaat jan huygens walviskaak 1594.JPG|thumb|250px|Plaque painted by [[Karel van Mander]] commemorating whalebone given to Haarlem by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten from [[Willem Barentsz]] expedition.]]
The voyage was interrupted by English piracy which forced a shipwreck. Huyghen spent two years in the [[Azores]]. He did not reach Lisbon until 1592, returning to his home city of Enkhuizen.

In June 1594, Huyghen (now recorded as Linschoten) sailed from [[Texel]] in the expedition headed by Dutch cartographer [[Willem Barentsz]]. The fleet of three ships was to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast passage]] above Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a polar bear for the first time.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. The following year they sailed again in a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that they hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually had to turn back when discovering the Kara Sea to be frozen. Linschoten was one of the two crew members to publish journals about the Barentsz expedition.

In 1595, with assistance from Amsterdam publisher Cornelis Claesz, who specialised in shipping, geography and travels, Jan Huyghens wrote ''Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'' (Travel Accounts of Portuguese Navigation in the Orient). This work contains numerous sailing directions, not only for shipping between Portugal and the East Indies colonies, but also between India, China and Japan.&lt;ref name="schama"/&gt;  It also contains one of the earliest European accounts of [[tea]] drinking in Japan:

"Their manner of eating and drinking is: everie man hath a table alone, without table-clothes or napkins, and eateth with two pieces of wood like the men Chino: they drink wine of Rice, wherewith they drink themselves drunke, and after their meat they use a certain drinke, which is a pot with hote water, which they drink as hot as ever they may indure, whether it be Winter or Summer...  The aforesaid warme water is made with the powder of a certaine hearbe called Chaa, which is much esteemed, and is well accounted among them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&amp;pg=PA63 'The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug', by Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer, p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, 1595, he married Reynu Meynertsdr. Seymens of Enkhuizen. She was "already four months pregnant by her intended second husband....At the time of her courtship Reynu Seymens was thirty-one and a mother of three.

New York: Vintage Books, 1987, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Huyghen also wrote two other books, ''Beschryvinghe van de gantsche custe van Guinea, Manicongo, Angola ende tegen over de Cabo de S. Augustijn in Brasilien, de eyghenschappen des gheheelen Oceanische Zees'' (Description of the Entire Coast of Guinea, Manicongo, Angola and across to the Cabo de St. Augustus in Brazil, the Characteristics of the Entire Atlantic Ocean), published in 1597; and ''Itinerario: Voyage ofte schipvaert van Jan Huyghen van Linschoten naer Oost ofte Portugaels Indien, 1579-1592'' [http://fondosdigitales.us.es/books/digitalbook_view?oid_page=291800] (Travel account of the voyage of the sailor Jan Huyghen van Linschoten to the Portuguese East India), published in 1596. "The frontispiece of the first edition [was] pirated [from] the engraving from (of all things) a work celebrating the campaigns of a Spanish general and printed...up as the Dutch hero" by his publisher Joost Gillis Saeghman.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The map published in this book, [http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm4335 ''Exacta &amp; accurata delinatio… regionibus China, Cauchinchina, Camboja, sive Champa, Syao, Malacca, Arracan &amp; Pegu''], was prepared by [[Petrus Plancius]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Bagrow, ''History of Cartography,'' revised and enlarged by R. A. Skelton, London, Watts, 1964, p. 265.

Also in ''Revista da Universidade de Coimbra,'' vol. 32, 1985, pp. 27–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An English-language edition of the ''Itinerario'' was published in [[London]] in 1598, entitled ''Iohn Huighen van Linschoten his Discours of Voyages into ye Easte &amp; West Indies''. A German edition was printed the same year. Considered very significant, it was published in Latin in Frankfurt, 1599; another Latin translation in Amsterdam, 1599; and in French in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the various editions, see Koeman (1985: pp. 41ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to detailed maps of these places, Linschoten also provided the geographic ‘key’ to unlocking the Portuguese grip on passage through the [[Malacca Strait]]. He suggested traders approach the East Indies from the south of [[Sumatra]] through the [[Sunda Strait]], thereby minimizing the risk of Portuguese intervention. This passage eventually became the main Dutch route into southeast Asia and was at the origin of their colonization of the territories that form today's [[Indonesia]].

Linschoten died in [[Enkhuizen]] where he had acted as Treasurer to the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gerrit|last=de Veer|title=A True Description of Three Voyages by the North-east Towards Cathay and China: Undertaken by the Dutch in the Years 1594, 1595 and 1596|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNxJAQAAMAAJ|year=1853|publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]]|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7020">{{short description|Two large igneous provinces in Southern Africa and Antarctica respectively}}
The '''Karoo''' and '''Ferrar Large Igneous Provinces''' (LIPs) are two [[large igneous province]]s in [[Southern Africa]] and [[Antarctica]] respectively, collectively known as the '''Karoo-Ferrar''', '''Gondwana''',&lt;ref name="Elliot-2001"&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Elliot|Fleming|Foland|Zhang|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Southeast African''' LIP,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Grobys|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the initial break-up of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent at {{Circa}} {{Ma|183|{{Abbr|Ma|Million year ago}}}}.
Its [[flood basalt]] mostly covers [[South Africa]] and Antarctica but portions extend further into southern Africa and into [[South America]], [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Segev|2002|loc=Fig. 5, p. 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karoo-Ferrar formed just prior to the breakup of Gondwana in the [[Lower Jurassic]] epoch, about 183 million years ago; this timing corresponds to the [[Anoxic event#Jurassic|early Toarcian anoxic event]] and the [[Toarcian turnover|Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jourdan|Féraud|Bertrand|Kampunzu|2005|loc=Relation with mass extinction, p. 748}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered about 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jourdan|Féraud|Bertrand|Kampunzu|2005|loc=Geological setting, p. 745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total original volume of the flow, which extends over a distance in excess of 6000&amp;nbsp;km (4000&amp;nbsp;km  in Antarctica alone), was in excess of 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km³ (2.5 million cubic kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Courtillot|Renne|2003|loc=The Karoo and Farrar provinces, p. 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ferrar LIP is notable for long distance transport and the Karoo LIP for its large volume and chemical diversity.&lt;ref name="Elliot-2001" /&gt; 

The igneous activity of the Karoo LIP began {{Circa}} {{Ma|204|Ma}} at the northern margin of the province.  The long-lasting [[Chon-Aike Province]] in Patagonia, the Antarctic Peninsula, and [[Ellsworth Land]] was activated {{Circa}} {{Ma|190|Ma}} in an unstable tectonic environment in which both extension and subduction occurred.  Chon-Aike had a peak between {{Ma|183|173|Ma}} but produced continued [[magmatism]] between {{Ma|168|141|Ma}}.  By {{Ma|184|175|Ma}} the Karoo magmatism had spread to Namibia, Lesotho, Lebombo, and the Ferrar province in Antarctica.  The Karoo LIP ended {{Ma|145|Ma}} with peripheral eruptions in Patagonia, the Antarctica Peninsula, northern South Africa, Kerala in India, and southeast Australia.  The Karoo Province uplifted southern Africa c. {{Convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} and broke East Gondwana (India, Antarctica, and Australia) away from West Gondwana (South America and Africa) beginning in the opening of the [[Weddell Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Segev|2002|loc=The first tectonomagmatic period in southern Gondwana – the Karoo province, pp. 175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cretaceous, some 15 million years after the last Karoo eruption, renewed magmatism was initiated between Mary Byrd Land in Antarctica and New Zealand from where it spread along Gondwana's southern margin, from eastern Australia to the Antarctic Peninsula.  Isotopic dating suggests a series of igneous events at 133-131, 124-119, and 113-107 Ma in Australia; 110-99 Ma in Mary Byrd Land; 114-109 and 82 Ma in New Zealand; and 141 and 127 Ma in the Antarctic Peninsula.  This phase of magmatism resulted in extension and rift between Australia and Antarctica, Australia and [[Lord Howe Rise]], and Mary Byrd Land and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Segev|2002|loc=The Cretaceous Marie Byrd Land – Eastern Australia province, pp. 176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide.

Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology.

In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===

[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|220px|left|thumb|[[Medieval]] Ridge and Furrow above [[Wood Stanway]], [[Gloucestershire]], England.]]
Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

{{See also|Landscaping|Landscape design|Landscape architecture|Garden|Park}}
The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===
{{See also|Pastoral|British regional literature|American literary regionalism}}

====The earliest landscape literature====
[[File:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape]]
Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian aboriginal myths]]  (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]), the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A. (Eds) ''An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.'' Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hambledon Hill towards Stourton Tower 20070730.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vale of Blackmore]], the main setting for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''. [[Hambledon Hill]] towards [[King Alfred's Tower|Stourton Tower]] ]]

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source =from ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805), Book 13, lines 41-51.&lt;br&gt;by [[William Wordsworth]]
}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape art===

====Landscape photography====

[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942) photograph by [[Ansel Adams]]]]
Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

[[File:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|330px|The western portion of the Line of Actual Control, which lies between Chinese-controlled and Indian-controlled territory in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region. The line was the focus of a brief war in 1962, when Indian and Chinese forces struggled to control land where, "not even a blade of grass grows," as Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] put it.]]
[[File:Aksai Chin Sino-Indian border map.png|thumb|330px|The map shows the Indian and Chinese claims of the border in the western (Aksai Chin) region, the Macartney–MacDonald line, the Foreign Office Line, as well as the progress of Chinese forces as they occupied areas during the Sino-Indian War.]]

The '''Line of Actual Control''' ('''LAC''') is a [[demarcation line]] that separates [[India|Indian]]-controlled territory from [[China|Chinese]]-controlled territory in the former [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], formed after the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/line-actual-control-china-india-again-squabbling-over-disputed-himalayan-border-1236401 Line of Actual Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two common ways in which the term "Line of Actual Control" is used. In the narrow sense, it refers only to the line of control in the western sector of the borderland between the two countries. In that sense, the LAC forms the effective border between the two countries, together with the (also disputed) [[McMahon Line]] in the east and a small undisputed section in between. In the wider sense, it can be used to refer to both the western line of control and the MacMahon Line, in which sense it is the effective border between [[India]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC).

==Overview==
The entire Sino-Indian border (including the western LAC, the small undisputed section in the centre, and the MacMahon Line in the east) is 4,056&amp;nbsp;km (2520&amp;nbsp;mi) long and traverses five Indian states: [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.oneindia.in/2008/06/19/another-chinese-intrusion-in-sikkim.html Another Chinese intrusion in Sikkim]", OneIndia, Thursday, 19 June 2008. Accessed: 2008-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Chinese side, the line traverses the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The demarcation existed as the informal cease-fire line between India and China after the [[1962 war]] until 1993, when its existence was officially accepted as the 'Line of Actual Control' in a bilateral agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stimson.org/research-pages/agreement-on-the-maintenance-of-peace-along-the-line-of-actual-control-in-the-india-china-border/ |title=Agreement On The Maintenance Of Peace Along The Line Of Actual Control In The India-China Border |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=stimson.org |publisher=[[The Stimson Center]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese scholars claim that the Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]] first used the phrase in a letter addressed to Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] dated 24 October 1959.

Although no official boundary had ever been negotiated between China and India, the Indian government even today claims a boundary in the western sector similar to the Johnson Line of 1865, whereas the PRC government considers a line similar to the [[Macartney–MacDonald Line]] of 1899 as the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Sino Indian Relations.

In a letter dated 7 November 1959, Zhou told Nehru that the LAC consisted of "the so-called [[McMahon Line]] in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west". During the [[Sino-Indian War]] (1962), Nehru refused to recognise the line of control: "There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call 'line of actual control'. What is this 'line of control'? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September? Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centurychina.com/plaboard/uploads/1962war.htm |title=India's China War |last=Maxwell |first=Neville |year=1999 |accessdate=2008-10-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822215146/http://www.centurychina.com/plaboard/uploads/1962war.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou responded that the LAC was "basically still the line of actual control as existed between the Chinese and Indian sides on 7 November 1959. To put it concretely, in the eastern sector it coincides in the main with the so-called [[McMahon Line]], and in the western and middle sectors it coincides in the main with the traditional customary line which has consistently been pointed out by China."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/10-3-106.shtml Chou's Latest Proposals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201203/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/10-3-106.shtml |date=2011-07-17 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "LAC" gained legal recognition in Sino-Indian agreements signed in 1993 and 1996. The 1996 agreement states, "No activities of either side shall overstep the line of actual control."&lt;ref name="Sali"&gt;Sali, M.L., (2008) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvXlFsxmJiMC India-China border dispute]'', p. 185, {{ISBN|1-4343-6971-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However clause No 6 of the 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas mentions, "The two sides agree that references to the line of actual control in this Agreement do not prejudice their respective positions on the boundary question"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peacemaker.un.org/chinaindia-borderagreement93|title=Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas|last=|first=|date=07/09/1993|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was resolved and both Chinese and Indian troops withdrew in exchange for a Chinese agreement to destroy some military structures over 250&amp;nbsp;km to the south near [[Chumar]] that the Indians perceived as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;Defense News.

They recorded 155 such intrusions. Later some of the objects were identified as  planets  by the [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]] as Venus and Jupiter appearing brighter as a result of the different atmosphere at altitude and confusion due to the increased use of surveillance drones.&lt;ref name="BBC: planets"&gt;{{cite news|title=India: Army 'mistook planets for spy drones'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23455128|accessdate=27 July 2013|date=25 July 2013|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, India and China signed a border defence cooperation agreement to ensure that patrolling along the LAC does not escalate into armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in South America'''. [[South America]] is the "Bird Continent": It boasts 3402 species, more than any other. (Much larger [[Eurasia]] is second with 3232.) Colombia's list alone numbers almost 1850 confirmed species, and Brazil's more than 1800. Of the continent's species, 2456 are [[Endemism|endemic]], significantly more than Eurasia's 2018. Nine entire families, containing 21 species, are endemic to the continent.&lt;ref name=baseline&gt;Remsen, J. V., Jr., J. I. Areta, C. D. Cadena, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, J. F. Pacheco, J. Pérez-Emán, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F. Stotz, and K. J. Zimmer. Version 7 July 2018. A classification of the bird species of South America. American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved 7 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, D. Roberson, T. A.

Downloaded 18 August 2017 from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 2456 endemic species, 234 are found only in Brazil and 316 are only in one of 12 other countries and territories. Thirteen of the 3394 total species have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] to South America. In addition, 76 of the species are [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]] to the continent, with only a few records, and some have made only a single appearance. Twenty-six species have been recorded in all 18 countries and territories addressed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = South American Classification Committee | year = 2018 | url = http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCCountryLists.htm | title = Species lists of birds for South American countries and territories, Version 7 July 2018| accessdate = 7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list includes birds confirmed in mainland South America, islands within 1200&amp;nbsp;km of its Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and the [[Caribbean]] countries and territories of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and Trinidad and Tobago. Major offshore entities include the Falkland Islands (Islas las Malvinas), the Galápagos Islands, and the Juan Fernandez Islands. Waters within 200 nautical miles of these lands are also included.&lt;ref name=baseline/&gt;

Unless otherwise noted, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the [[American Ornithological Society]] (AOS). The list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomomy]] (names and sequence of orders, families, and species) is also that of the SACC unless noted otherwise. The list does not include domestic birds or escaped and introduced species which do not have established populations. It also does not include the results of species splits which have been accepted by the SACC but not finalized.&lt;ref name=baseline/&gt;

The following tags annotate many species:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32301">This is a '''List of places visited by Ibn Battuta''' in the years 1325-1353.

The Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] set out from his native town of [[Tangiers]] on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in June 1325, when he was 21 years old. On completing his first ''[[hajj]]'' he continued travelling, only returning to Morocco twenty four years later in 1349. In 1350, Battuta visited [[Al-Andalus]] and then between 1352-1353 he crossed the [[Sahara Desert]] to visit the [[Kingdom of Mali]] in [[West Africa]]. On his return to [[Fes]] he dictated an account of his travels to [[Ibn Juzayy]], a scribe employed by [[Abu Inan Faris]], the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] ruler of Morocco.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|pp=1-4}}

Ibn Juzayy's Arabic text was translated into English by [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|Hamilton Gibb]] and Charles Beckingham and published by the [[Hakluyt Society]] in four volumes between 1958 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibb|1958|loc=Vol. 1}}; {{harvnb|Gibb|1962|loc=Vol. 2}}; {{harvnb|Gibb|1971|loc=Vol. 3}}; {{harvnb|Gibb|Beckingham|1994|loc=Vol. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places visited by Ibn Battuta==
Over his lifetime, Ibn Battuta travelled over 73,000 miles (117,000&amp;nbsp;km) and visited around 40 present-day countries.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=3}}

In the following list the [[Romanization]] used by Gibb and Beckingham is given in parentheses. The states are modern. Within each section the towns are listed in the order that they are first mentioned in Ibn Battuta's ''[[rihla]]''. Historians such as Hamilton Gibb and [[Ross E. Dunn|Ross Dunn]] have argued that some parts of Ibn Battuta's ''rihla'' are fictional and it is extremely unlikely that he visited all the places that he claimed. The cities for which Ibn Battuta's visit is believed to be fictional are flagged as "doubtful" in the list below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4887">{{Politics of Sark}}
The '''Seigneur of Sark''' is the head of [[Sark]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. "[[Seigneur]]" is the French word for "lord", and a female head of Sark is called the '''Dame of Sark''', of which there have been three. The husband of a female ruler of Sark is not a [[Prince consort|consort]] but is ''[[jure uxoris]]'' ("by right of (his) wife"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = HC | last = Black | title = Law Dictionary | edition = 4th | year = 1968}}, citing {{Citation | last = Blackstone | title = Commentaries | volume = 3 | page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a Seigneur himself.&lt;ref name="Collings Hathaway"&gt;{{cite book |last=Collings Hathaway |first=Sibyl |title=Dame of Sark, an autobiography |publisher=Heinemann |year=1975 |isbn= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{see|Sark#Politics}}
The Seigneur's office is hereditary, but with permission of [[The Crown#Crown dependencies|the Crown]], it may be mortgaged or sold, as happened in 1849 when [[Pierre Carey le Pelley]] sold the fief to [[Marie Collings]] for £6,000.&lt;ref name="Marr"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marr |first=James |author-link=James Marr (author) |title=Guernsey people |date=1984 |isbn=0850335299 |publisher=Phillimore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seigneur was, before the constitutional reforms of 2008, the head of the feudal government of Sark, with the British monarch being the feudal overlord. The Seigneur had a suspensive veto power and the right to appoint most of the island's officers. Many of the laws, particularly those related to inheritance and the rule of the Seigneur, had changed little since Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted a [[fief]]dom to [[Hellier de Carteret]] in 1565. 

The residents of Sark voted to introduce a fully elected legislature to replace the [[Feudalism|feudal]] government in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=After four centuries, Sark gives power to the people|publisher=''Times Online''|date=5 October 2006|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2389102.html|accessdate=2007-08-20 | location=London | first=Simon | last=de Bruxelles}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law change was approved on 9 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After 450 years, Sark turns back on feudal law|publisher=''The Independent''|date=10 April 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/after-450-years-sark-turns-back-on-feudal-law-807006.html | location=London | first=Mark | last=Hughes | accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the political system mostly apply to the parliament, the [[Chief Pleas]], not to the Seigneur.

The Marshalite signal consisted of dials facing each street at an intersection, with a rotating hand pointing to coloured sections that denoted whether traffic in either direction should proceed, prepare to stop, or stop, and how much longer that phase had to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Safety First!|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/77822786#|accessdate=2017-05-15|work=The Daily News|date=1946-07-23|location=Perth|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations existed for [[pedestrian crossings]], with additional text instructing people to "Walk" or "Don't Walk".

The first experimental model was erected in 1937 at the corner of [[Gertrude Street, Melbourne|Gertrude]] and [[Brunswick Street, Melbourne|Brunswick]] streets, Fitzroy, but was removed when its legality came into question. After 1945, Mashalite signals were installed at a number of locations in metropolitan [[Melbourne]], starting with the intersection of Brunswick and Johnston streets, Fitzroy &lt;ref name=inventor/&gt; At the intersection of [[Maroondah Highway|Whitehorse]] and Union roads, [[Surrey Hills, Victoria| Surrey Hills]], the clock was used in conjunction with conventional traffic lights, so that the point of change was absolute and unambiguous. The last Marshalite to operate was situated on the [[Nepean Highway]].

A similar system was used in [[The Netherlands]], [[Vienna]] and [[West Germany]]. In Germany it was called "[[:de:Ampel#Heuer-Ampel|Heuer-Ampel]]", after the engineer Josef Heuer, and was used in a number of places until 1972, when a change in traffic laws outlawed them. For historic reasons, an unused one is still in place in [[Bochum]].

[[File:Manang site (54).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The snow-free debris hills around the lagoon are lateral and terminal moraines of a [[valley glacier]] in [[Nepal]].]]
A '''moraine''' is any [[Glacial landform|glacially formed]] accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris ([[regolith]] and [[Rock (geology)|rock]]) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past [[glacial maximum]]), through [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consisting of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute [[Rock flour|glacial flour]]. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and [[terminal moraine]]s at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, [[till]]-covered areas with irregular [[topography]], and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet.

== Characteristics ==
Moraines may be composed of debris ranging in size from [[silt]]-sized [[Rock flour|glacial flour]] to large boulders.
The debris is typically sub-angular to rounded in shape. Moraines may be on the glacier’s surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted.

=== Formation ===
Moraines may form through a number of processes, depending on the characteristics of sediment, the dynamics on the ice, and the location on the glacier in which the moraine is formed.&lt;ref name="Benn &amp; Evans" /&gt;  Moraine forming processes may be loosely divided into passive and active. Passive processes involve the placing of chaotic supraglacial sediments onto the landscape with limited reworking, typically forming hummocky moraines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kjær|first=Kurt H.|last2=Krüger|first2=Johannes|date=2001-10-21|title=The final phase of dead-ice moraine development: processes and sediment architecture, Kötlujökull, Iceland|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2001.00402.x/abstract|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=935–952|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3091.2001.00402.x|issn=1365-3091|bibcode=2001Sedim..48..935K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These moraines are composed of supraglacial sediments from the ice surface. Active processes form or rework moraine sediment directly by the movement of ice, known as glaciotectonism. These form push moraines and thrust-block moraines, which are often composed of [[till]] and reworked proglacial sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Matthew R.|date=2001-04-01|title=The morphology, structural evolution and significance of push moraines|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000398|journal=[[Earth-Science Reviews]]|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=197–236|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(00)00039-8|bibcode=2001ESRv...53..197B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moraine may also form by the accumulation of sand and gravel deposits from glacial streams emanating from the ice margin. These fan deposits may coalesce to form a long moraine bank marking the ice margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulton|first=G. S.|date=1986-10-01|title=Push-moraines and glacier-contact fans in marine and terrestrial environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1986.tb01969.x/abstract|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=677–698|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1986.tb01969.x|issn=1365-3091|bibcode=1986Sedim..33..677B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several processes may combine to form and rework a single moraine, and most moraines record a continuum of processes.

==Types of moraines==
{{see also|List of glacial moraines}}
Moraines can be classified either by origin, location with respect to a glacier or former glacier, or by shape. The first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciers—but more difficult to apply to [[old moraine]]s, which are defined by their particular morphology, since their origin is debated. Some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers, while medial moraines of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier.

===Lateral moraines===
[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Lateral moraines above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.]]
Lateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by [[frost shattering]] of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley.{{fact|date=February 2018}} The [[till]] is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts. Because lateral moraines are deposited on top of the glacier, they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore, as the glacier melts, lateral moraines are usually preserved as high ridges.
[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|Moraines clearly seen on a side glacier of the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]]. The '''lateral moraine''' is the high snow-free bank of debris in the top left hand quarter of the picture. The '''medial moraine''' is the double line of debris running down the centre-line of the glacier.]]
Lateral moraines stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements, causing it to melt or [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublime]] less than the uncovered parts of the glacier. Multiple lateral moraines may develop as the glacier advances and retreats.

===Ground moraines===
[[File:Ground moraine 9004.jpg|thumb|Ground moraines create irregular, rolling topography]]
Ground moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains. They are accumulated at the base of the ice as [[Till#Types of till|lodgment till]], but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats.  In [[wikt:alpine|alpine]] glaciers, ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines. Ground moraines may be modified into [[drumlins]] by the overriding ice.

====Rogen moraines====
{{main|Rogen moraine}}
Rogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an [[ice sheet]]. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like [[tigerstripe]]s on [[aerial photograph]]s. Rogen moraines are named after [[Lake Rogen]]&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;Möller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial reshaping of preexisting landforms. ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', '''25''':362-389&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Härjedalen]], [[Sweden]], the landform’s type locality.

[[File:Nuussuaq-peninsula-moraines.jpg|thumb|Medial moraines, [[Nuussuaq Peninsula]], [[Greenland]]]]

===End or terminal moraines===
{{main|Terminal moraine}}
[[Image:Erratics-Cascades-PB110028.JPG|thumb|left|Multiple erratics on the terminal moraine of the Okanogan Lobe. Cascade mountains in the background.]]
End moraines, or [[terminal moraine]]s, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier.  They usually reflect the shape of the [[Glacier terminus|glacier's terminus]].  Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines.  End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine.  There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional.  Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier.  Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat.  After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.

===Recessional moraine===
Recessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.&lt;ref name="Benn &amp; Evans"&gt;Benn, D. I. and Evans, D. J. A. (1998) ''Glaciers &amp; Glaciation.'' Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Moraine." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition (2009): 1. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 6 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medial moraine===
A medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]] in the [[Kluane National Park]], [[Yukon]], has a ridge of medial moraine 1&amp;nbsp;km wide.

===Supraglacial moraines===
Supraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the [[ablation zone]], melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.

===Washboard moraines===
[[Washboard moraine]]s, also known as '''minor''' or '''corrugated moraines''', are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. The name "washboard moraine" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].

===Veiki moraine===
{{main|Veiki moraine}}
A Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern [[Sweden]] and parts of [[Canada]].

The '''Neutral Municipality''' (Portuguese: ''Município Neutro'') was an administrative unit created in the Empire of Brazil, which existed in the territory of the current municipality of [[Rio de Janeiro]] between August 12, 1834 (when it was proclaimed the Additional Act to the [[Brazilian Constitution of 1824|Constitution of 1824]]) and November 15, 1889, when was proclaimed the republic in Brazil. But it only officially ceased to exist with the promulgation of the [[Brazilian Constitution of 1891|1891 Constitution]].

By the republican constitution, this administrative unit became the [[:pt:Distrito Federal do Brasil (1891–1960)|Federal District]] in 1891, whose political situation changed again when it became the state of [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]] in 1960, and later, with the fusion of this with the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/monografias/GEBIS%20-%20RJ/Recenseamento_do_Brazil_1872/Municipio%20Neutro.pdf Recenseamento Geral do Brazil 1972: Municipio Neutro.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the transfer of the Portuguese Court to the city of Rio de Janeiro, the [[:pt:Capitania do Rio de Janeiro|captaincy]] remained directly administered by the royal government, in a status differentiated from the others, whose administrations were slightly more autonomous in relation to the central power, given their main city have become the capital of the whole Portuguese kingdom.

With the [[Independence of Brazil|independence of Brazil]], a greater administrative autonomy that was aspired by its elite could not be reached as in the other [[Captaincies of Brazil|captaincies]], now transformed into [[Provinces of Brazil|provinces]], since the minister of the Kingdom, position that was practically a substitute for the one of Viceroy, was entrusted with its Rio administration.

Allied to this was the fact that the city of Rio de Janeiro remained as the capital of the [[Empire of Brazil|empire of Brazil]], which caused the minister to administer the whole province by means of "warnings", which he directed to the [[Municipal chamber|Municipal Chambers]] of cities which, at that time, were growing at a rapid pace due to the expansion and strengthening of coffee plantations in the [[:pt:Vale do Paraíba|Paraíba Valley]], which already surpassed the strength of sugarcane plantations in the [[:pt:Norte_Fluminense|North Fluminense region]].

These differences in relation to the other administrative units of Brazil meant that, in [[1834]], the city of Rio de Janeiro was included in the Neutral Municipality, which remained as the capital of the country and directly administered by the imperial government, while the Rio de Janeiro had the same political-administrative organization of the others, having its capital in ''Vila Real da Praia Grande'', which the following year was renamed '''Nictheroy''' (current [[Niterói]]).

The city of Rio de Janeiro also had a Municipal Chamber elected by the local population and would take care of the life of that city without interference from the provincial president or the Cabinet of Ministers, except for services that were subordinated to the national government. In [[1889]], after the implantation of the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Republic]] in [[Brazil]], the city continued as the capital of the country, and the Neutral Municipality becomes the [[:pt:Distrito Federal do Brasil (1891–1960)|Federal District]] after the proclamation of the [[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1891|Constitution of 1891]].

With the change of the capital of the country to [[Brasília]], the former [[:pt:Distrito Federal do Brasil (1891–1960)|Federal District]], becomes the state of [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]]. With the merger of the states of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro in 1975, the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] ceases to be understood in the state of Guanabara, fused with the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], returning to the state capital condition.

'''Okrug''' ({{lang-bg|окръг}}, ''okrǎg''; {{lang-ru|о́круг}}; {{lang-sr|округ}}, {{IPA-sr|ôkruːɡ|IPA}}; {{lang-uk|окру́га}}, ''okruha''; {{lang-be|акруга}}, ''Akruha''; {{lang-pl|[[okręg]]}}; {{lang-ab|оқрҿс}}; {{lang-mhr|йырвел}}, ''jyrvel'') is an [[administrative division]] of some [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] states. The word "okrug" is a [[loanword]] in English,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] on CD-ROM, Second Edition.  Entry on ''okrug''. Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but it is nevertheless often translated as "[[area]]", "[[district]]", or "[[region]]".

In meaning, the word is similar to the [[German language|German]] term ''[[Bezirk]]'' ("[[district]]") and the French word ''[[Arrondissement]]''; all of which refer to something "encircled" or "surrounded".
{{TOC right}}

==Bulgaria==
{{Main article|Provinces of Bulgaria}}

In [[Bulgaria]], ''okrаgs'' are the abolished primary unit of the administrative division and implied "districts" or "counties". They existed in the post-War Bulgaria between 1946 and 1987 and corresponded approximately to today's [[oblast]]s.

==Poland==
{{Main article|Okręg}}

As historical administrative subdivisions of [[Poland]], okręgi existed in the later part of the [[Congress Poland]] period, from 1842, when the name was applied to the former [[powiat]]s (the name ''powiat'' being transferred to the former ''[[obwód|obwody]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Podział administracyjny Królestwa Polskiego 1837-1914|Administrative division of the Congress Poland (in Polish)]]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Administrative division of Congress Poland]].

Okręgi were also created temporarily from 1945 to 1946, in the areas annexed to Poland from Germany as a result of the Soviet military advance. An okręg was then subdivided into obwody. These okręgi were later replaced by [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]]s, and the obwody by powiats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baza.archiwa.gov.pl/sezam/iza.php?nrarchiwum=65&amp;nrzespolu=357&amp;cdnumeru=0&amp;mode=showzesp&amp;search1=get&amp;offset=100 Article in Polish re 1945-46]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==

===Imperial Russia===
''Okrugs'' were one of the several types of administrative division for [[oblast]]s and selected [[guberniya|governorates]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. Until the 1920s, ''okrugs'' were administrative districts in [[Cossack host]]s such as the Don's Cossacks.

===Soviet Union===
{{see also|Okruhas of Ukraine}}
Inherited from the Imperial Russia, in the 1920s, ''okrugs'' were administrative divisions of several other primary divisions such as [[oblast]]s, [[krai]]s, and others. For sometime in the 1920s they also served as the primary unit upon the abolishment of [[guberniya]]s and were divided into [[raion]]s. On July 30, 1930 most of the okrugs were abolished. The remaining okrugs were phased away in the [[Russian SFSR]] during 1930–1946, although they were retained in [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] in status equivalent to that of a raion.

''National okrugs'' were first created in the [[Mountain ASSR]] of the Russian SFSR in 1921 as units of the Soviet autonomy and additional national okrugs were created in the Russian SFSR for the peoples of the north and Caucasus region. In 1977, all national okrugs were renamed ''autonomous okrugs''.

===Russian Federation===
{{Main article|Subdivisions of Russia}}

In the present-day [[Russia|Russian Federation]], the term "okrug" is either translated as "district" or rendered directly as "okrug", and is used to describe the following types of divisions:
*[[Federal districts of Russia|Federal Districts]] (''federalny okrug''), such as the [[Siberian Federal District]]
*[[Autonomous okrugs of Russia|Autonomous okrugs]] (''avtonomny okrug''), such as [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]

After the series of mergers in 2005–2008, several autonomous okrugs of Russia lost their federal subject status and are now considered to be administrative territories within the federal subjects they had been merged into:
*[[Agin-Buryat Okrug]], a territory with special status within [[Zabaykalsky Krai]]
*[[Komi-Permyak Okrug]], a territory with special status within [[Perm Krai]]
*[[Koryak Okrug]], a territory with special status within [[Kamchatka Krai]]
*[[Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug]], a territory with special status within [[Irkutsk Oblast]]

"Okrug" is also used to describe the administrative divisions of the two "[[federal cities of Russia|federal cities]]" in Russia:
*the [[administrative divisions of Moscow|administrative okrugs]] of [[Moscow]] are an upper-level administrative division
*the [[administrative divisions of Saint Petersburg|municipal okrugs]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg]] are a lower-level administrative division

In the federal city of [[Sevastopol]], municipal okrugs are a type of a municipal formation.

In [[Tver Oblast]], the term "okrug" also denotes a type of an [[city of federal subject significance|administrative division]] which is equal in status to that of the districts.

Furthermore, the designation "okrug" denotes several ''[[selsoviet]]''-level administrative divisions:
*[[Selsoviet#Selsoviets in Russia|okrugs]], such as [[administrative divisions of Samara Oblast|okrugs of Samara Oblast]]
*[[Selsoviet#Selsoviets in Russia|rural okrugs]] (''selsky okrug''), such as the [[administrative divisions of Belgorod Oblast|rural okrugs of Belgorod Oblast]]
*[[Selsoviet#Selsoviets in Russia|rural territorial okrugs]] (''selsky territorialny okrug''), such as the [[administrative divisions of Murmansk Oblast|rural territorial okrugs of Murmansk Oblast]]
*[[Selsoviet#Selsoviets in Russia|stanitsa okrugs]] (''stanichny okrug''), such as the [[administrative divisions of Krasnodar Krai|stanitsa okrugs of Krasnodar Krai]]

In some cities, the term "okrug" is used to refer to the administrative divisions of those cities.  "Administrative okrugs" are such divisions in the cities of [[Murmansk]], [[Omsk]], and [[Tyumen]]; "city okrugs" are used in [[Krasnodar]]; "municipal okrugs" are the divisions of [[Nazran]]; "okrugs" exist in [[Belgorod]], [[Kaluga]], [[Kursk]], and [[Novorossiysk]]; and "territorial okrugs" are the divisions of [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Lipetsk]].

The term "okrug" is also used to describe a type of a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal formation]], the "municipal urban okrug"—a municipal urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal district.&lt;ref name="Mun"&gt;{{cite Russian law

The '''Imamate of Oman''' ({{Lang-ar|عُمان الوسطى}} ''ʿUmān al-Wusṭā'') refers to a historical area within the present-day [[Sultanate of Oman]].  It lay inland from [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] beyond the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] (Green Mountains) and was centered on the city of [[Nizwa]] in the area of the current [[Subdivisions of Oman|region]] of [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region|Ad Dakhiliyah]].  Along with Muscat and [[Dhofar]], it was a constituent part of the Sultanate of [[Muscat and Oman]], but with the [[1970 Omani coup d'état|1970 coup d'état]], the term Oman alone was applied to the entire country.

==History==
Oman proper was ruled by [[Ibadi]]te [[imam]]s who exercised spiritual and often temporal authority over the region.  The Imamate is a thousand-year-old system of government pioneered by the Ibadi religious leaders of Oman, and is based upon the Islamic [[sharia]]. It governed parts or the whole of Oman and other lands for interrupted periods of time for over 1000 years. There were often tensions between these imams and the [[sultan]]s of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and in 1913, the election of [[Salim ibn Rashid al-Kharusi]] as imam led to the [[Treaty of Seeb|Seeb Peace Treaty]] between '''Imamate of Oman''' (Arabic: إمامة عُمان ''Imāmat ʿUmān'') with its capital at Nizwa and the Sultanate of Oman with its capital in Muscat.  In 1954, a new imam, [[Imam Ghalib Bin Ali|Ghalib bin Ali]], defended the Imamate from attack from Muscat, after oil was discovered in his lands. Sultan [[Said Bin Taimur of Muscat]] with the help of the colonial British forces were able to win eventually.  In 1955, Nizwa was taken, the imam had exiled to Saudi Arabia, but continued to lead the Imamate and guide the war efforts with a temporary government set-up in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. In 1959, the last forces of the Imamate were defeated and the name of the whole of Muscat and Oman was changed to the Sultanate of Oman in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:State of Oman stamp.JPG|thumb|right|150px|State of Oman postage stamp with the capital of Nizwa shown as "Nazwa"]] --&gt;
In current usage, "Oman proper" can also refer to the whole of the present-day sultanate minus the [[exclave]]s of [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam]] and [[Madha]].

===Postal history===
Following its overthrow, the Imamate of Oman issued [[postage stamp]]s under the name of the '''State of Oman''' (Arabic: دولة عُمان ''Dawlat ʿUmān'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">'''Overwash''' is the flow of water and sediment over a [[coastal dune]] or beach crest during storm events (or other sitations with high water). 'Overwash' may refer only to the landward flux of water due to overtopping of a dune system while 'washover' may refer to the sediment deposited by overwash.&lt;ref name="Donnelly2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=C..|year=2006|title=State of knowledge on measurement and modeling of coastal overwash|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=22|pages=965–991|doi=10.2112/04-0431.1|author2=Kraus, N.|author3=Larson, M.|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common process on [[barrier islands]], Overwash redistributes sediment and facilitates the migration of barrier islands in response to sea level rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorenzo-Trueba|first=Jorge|last2=Ashton|first2=Andrew D.|date=2014-04-01|title=Rollover, drowning, and discontinuous retreat: Distinct modes of barrier response to sea-level rise arising from a simple morphodynamic model|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=2013JF002941|doi=10.1002/2013JF002941|issn=2169-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overwash can occur as a result of runup (the maximum height of the [[swash]]), or [[inundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asbury H.

Deposition from overwash (washover) can be deposited onto the beach berm, the [[Coastal dune|dune]], or as far as the back [[barrier bay]], [[Salt marsh|marsh]], [[estuary]], or [[lagoon]]. Sediment deposits created during overwash exhibit consistent scaling — for example, the distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is proportional to the area that the overwash deposit covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=Eli D.|date=2016-12-16|title=Scaling laws for coastal overwash morphology|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=43|issue=23|pages=12,113–12,119|doi=10.1002/2016GL071213|issn=1944-8007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is also correlated with the volume of sand deposited.&lt;ref name="Rogersetal2015" /&gt; The amount of overwash and washover sedimentation also depends on the characteristics of the storm and the setting — [[Coastal management|coastal development]] tends to reduce in the amount of sand deposited on a barrier island during overwash, with consequences for barrier island evolution.&lt;ref name="Rogersetal2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Rogers | first = L.J..| author2=Moore L.

The [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] layers of [[sediment]] in an overwash deposit can be used to estimate the length of the storm that caused the deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=J.|last2=You|first2=Y.|last3=Mohrig|first3=D.|last4=Kocurek|first4=G.|title=Tracking hurricane-generated storm surge with washover fan stratigraphy|journal=Geology|volume=43|issue=2|pages=127–130|doi=10.1130/g36460.1|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment deposited via overwash can also impact the rate of growth of [[salt marsh]] [[Spartina alterniflora|plants]] — a small amount of sand deposted can increase salt marsh plant growth, but too much deposited sand will kill vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=David C.|last2=Kirwan|first2=Matthew L.|date=2016-05-01|title=Optimal hurricane overwash thickness for maximizing marsh resilience to sea level rise|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2948–2956|doi=10.1002/ece3.2024|pmid=27069590|pmc=4808077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postcode areas imagemap|location=right}}
[[Postal code]]s used in the [[United Kingdom]] are known as '''postcodes''' (originally postal codes).&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Royal Mail]] | publisher =Royal Mail Group | edition=4 | title =Address Management Guide |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[alphanumeric]] and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974, having been devised by the [[General Post Office|GPO]] ([[Royal Mail]]).&lt;ref name="Short history"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/mortgages/a-short-history-of-the-postcode-751884.html|title=A short history of the postcode|date=1 Jan 2005|work=The Independent|accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full postcode is known as a "postcode unit" and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The structure of a postcode is that of two alphanumeric codes each made up of three (or four) characters.  First, one or two letters indicate the city or region, followed by one or two digits signifying a locality/ area or neighbourhoods in that city/ region. This is followed by a space and then a number and two letters which are allocated to streets, and sides of the street. 
The central part of the city or region a.k.a the city centre/ town centre will have the number 1 designation alongside the city code e.g. B1 (Birmingham), LS1 (Leeds), M1 (Manchester) - all central addresses.  As a general rule, a higher number indicates distance from that centre.
See [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]]

Postcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of the mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in [[route planning software]] and as the lowest level of aggregation in [[census]] enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29&amp;nbsp;million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the [[Postcode Address File]] database.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The initial system of named postal districts, developed in London and other large cities from 1857, evolved towards the present form: in 1917 London was split into broad numbered subdivisions, and this extended to the other cities in 1934. After the reorganisation of London in the 1960s, many parts of the city now lie outside the traditional postcode zone. This includes, but is not limited to, large parts of the "TW" "KT" "SM" "CR" "HA" and "UB" postcode areas, among a few others.

The postcode of [[GCHQ]] is GL51 0EX, where GL signifies the postal area of [[Gloucester]]. The postal town refers to a wide area and does not relate to a specific town, county or region. GL51 is one of the postcodes for the town of Cheltenham (in Gloucestershire) which is where GCHQ is located.

Theoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number and post code alone, however this is against Royal Mail guidelines who request a full address at all times.

==History==
===Earlier postal districts===
====London====
{{main|London postal district}}
The London post town covers 40% of [[Greater London]]. On inception (in 1857/8) it was divided into ten postal districts: EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The S and NE sectors were later abolished. In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, these were subdivided with a number applied to each sub-district, with the area served directly by the district head office as "1" with the others allocated alphabetically by delivery office, leading to N2 East Finchley delivery office, N3 Finchley delivery office, N4 Finsbury Park delivery office. These divisions changed little, usually only changed for operational efficiency.

Some older road signs in Hackney still indicate the North East (NE/N.E.) sector/district.

====Other large towns====
[[Image:BirdbrookRoadSigns.jpg|thumb|right|Street name signs on Birdbrook Road, Great Barr, Birmingham, showing old "Birmingham 22" (top) and modern "B44" postcodes.]]
Following the successful introduction of postal districts in London, the system was extended to other large towns and cities. Liverpool was divided into Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western districts in 1864/65, and Manchester and Salford into eight numbered districts in 1867/68.&lt;ref name=bpma/&gt;

In 1917, Dublin – then still part of the United Kingdom – was divided into [[Dublin postal districts|numbered postal districts]]. These continue in use in a modified form by [[An Post]], the postal service of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1923, Glasgow was divided in a similar way to London, with numbered districts preceded by a letter denoting the compass point (C, W, NW, N, E, S, SW, SE).&lt;ref name=bpma/&gt;

In January 1932 the Postmaster General approved the designation of some predominantly urban areas into numbered districts.&lt;ref name=bpma/&gt; In November 1934 the Post Office announced the introduction of numbered districts (short postal codes) in "every provincial town in the United Kingdom large enough to justify it". Pamphlets were issued to each householder and business in ten areas notifying them of the number of the district in which their premises lay. The pamphlets included a map of the districts, and copies were made available at local head post offices. The public were "particularly invited" to include the district number in the address at the head of letters.&lt;ref name=times1934&gt;{{Cite news|title=Numbered P.O. Districts In Country Towns. Aid To Accurate Delivery |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=20 November 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A publicity campaign in the following year encouraged the use of the district numbers. The slogan for the campaign was "For speed and certainty always use a postal district number on your letters and notepaper". A poster was fixed to every pillar box in the affected areas bearing the number of the district and appealing for the public's co-operation. Every post office in the numbered district was also to display this information. Printers of Christmas cards and stationery were requested to always include district numbers in addresses, and [[election agent]]s for candidates in the upcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|general election]] were asked to ensure they correctly addressed the 100&amp;nbsp;million items of mail they were expected to post. Businesses were issued with a free booklet containing maps and listings of the correct district number for every street in the ten areas.&lt;ref name=times1935&gt;{{Cite news|title=Postal District Numbers Appeal For Use In Addresses|work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=29 October 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten areas were:&lt;ref name=times1935/&gt;
*[[Birmingham]]
*[[Brighton]]/[[Hove]]
*[[Bristol]]
*[[Edinburgh]]
*[[Glasgow]]
*[[Leeds]]/[[Bradford]]
*[[Liverpool]]
*[[Manchester]]/[[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]
*[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]
*[[Sheffield]]

For example, [[Toxteth]] was ''Liverpool 8''. A single numbering sequence was shared by Manchester and Salford: letters would be addressed to Manchester 1 or Salford 7 (lowest digits, respectively). Some Birmingham codes were sub-divided with a letter, such as ''Great Barr, Birmingham 22'' or ''Birmingham 22a'',&lt;ref name=Will&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208065042/http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 February 2007 |title=1951 will, using address in "Birmingham 22a" |publisher=Jacomb.com |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as can still be seen on many older street-name signs.

===Modern postcode system===
The Post Office experimented with electromechanical sorting machines in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8288148.stm "Modern postcodes are 50 years old"], [[BBC News]], 2 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These devices presented an envelope to an operator, who would press a button indicating which bin to sort the letter into. Postcodes were suggested to increase the efficiency of this process, by removing the need for the sorter to remember the correct sorting for as many places.&lt;ref name=new_scientist&gt;''New Scientist'', 21 July 2007, p16&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1959 the Post Office analysed the results of a survey on public attitudes towards the use of postal codes, choosing a town in which to experiment with codes. The envisaged format was a six-character alphanumeric code with three letters designating the geographical area and three numbers to identify the individual address.&lt;ref name=times_150189&gt;"Postal codes to speed up mail", ''The Times'', 15 January 1959&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July [[Ernest Marples]], the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], announced that [[Norwich]] had been selected, and that each of the 150,000 private and business addresses would receive a code by October. Norwich had been selected as it already had eight automatic mail sorting machines in use.&lt;ref name=times_290659&gt;"Norwich to use postal codes – Experimenting in automation", ''The Times'', 29 July 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The original Norwich format consisted of "NOR" followed by a space, then a two-digit number (which, unlike the current format, could include a leading zero) and a single final letter (instead of the two final letters in the current format).&lt;ref name="norexamples"&gt;Examples of Norwich NOR postcodes in the old format: "NOR 03Z", "NOR 66F", "NOR 83B", "NOR 05S". {{London Gazette |issue=45542 |date=13 December 1971 |page=13658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1965, [[Tony Benn]] as Postmaster General&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26575843 |title = Five lesser-spotted things Tony Benn gave the UK |publisher = BBC |date = 14 March 2014 |website = BBC News |accessdate= 13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that postal coding was to be extended to the rest of the country in the next few years.&lt;ref name=times_051065&gt;"G.P.O. robot postman sorts 20,000 letters an hour", ''The Times'', 5 October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1967 postcodes were introduced in [[Croydon]]. The many postcodes for central Croydon began with "CRO", and those of the surrounding [[post town]]s with outward codes (the characters before the space) CR2, CR3 and CR4. The uniform system of a set of three final characters, after the space, such as 0AA, known as the inward code, was adopted. This was to be the beginning of a ten-year plan, costing an estimated £24&amp;nbsp;million. Within two years it was expected that full coding would be used in [[Aberdeen]], [[Belfast]], [[Brighton]], [[Bristol]], [[Bromley]], [[Cardiff]], [[Coventry]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sheffield]], [[Southampton]] and the [[W postcode area|Western district]] of London.&lt;ref name=times_121066&gt;"Someone, Somewhere in postal code", ''The Times'', 12 October 1966&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1967, codes had been introduced to Aberdeen, Southampton, Brighton and [[Derby]].&lt;ref name=times_040767&gt;"Post Office plans faster service", ''The Times'', 4 July 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, codes were introduced to the London W and [[NW postcode area|North Western]]  postal districts.&lt;ref name=times_150870&gt;"London in brief", ''The Times'', 15 September 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1970 much Christmas mail was postmarked with the message "Remember to use the Postal Code", although codes were used to sort mail in only a handful of [[sorting office]]s.&lt;ref name=times_180171&gt;"Inside the Post Office", ''The Times'', 18 January 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1971, occupants of addresses began to receive notification of their postcode. Asked in the House of Commons about the completion of the coding exercise, the [[Minister of State]] for Posts and Telecommunications (whose role superseded that of Postmaster General in 1969), [[John Eden, Baron Eden of Winton|Sir John Eden]], stated that it was expected to be completed during 1972.&lt;ref name=times_200472&gt;"Postal code programme", ''The Times'', 20 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was finalised in 1974 when Norwich was completely re-coded but the scheme tested in Croydon was sufficiently close to the final design for it to be retained, with CRO standardised as CR0 (district zero), thus removing the need to create a CR1 district.&lt;ref name=bpma&gt;[http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf Information Sheet: Postcodes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320052708/http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }}, British Postal Museum and Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

A quirk remained: the central Newport area was allocated NPT, at a similar time to Croydon becoming CRO, and surrounding areas were, as today, allocated NP1–NP8. NPT lasted until the end of 1984 when it was recoded NP9.&lt;ref name="nptgazette"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/49959/pages/17064/page.pdf|title=Borough of Newport (Kingsway) (Business Parking Places) Order 1985|last=Newport Borough Council|date=17 December 1984|work=The London Gazette (No. 49959)|publisher=HMSO|page=17064|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girobank]]'s GIR 0AA, the last domestic postcode with a fully alphabetical outward code, no longer exists in the Royal Mail's PAF system,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://zestate.co.uk|title=Find an address|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remains in active use by the bank's owners, currently [[Santander UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.mybank.alliance-leicester.co.uk/registration/r7.asp |title=Santander Internet Banking Terms &amp; Conditions |accessdate=8 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012133258/https://www.mybank.alliance-leicester.co.uk/registration/r7.asp |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptation of earlier systems into national system====
When the national postcode system was introduced, many existing postal districts were incorporated into it, so that postcodes in Toxteth (Liverpool 8) start with L8. The districts in both Manchester and Salford gained M postcodes, so Salford 7 became M7 and so on (and similarly in Brighton and Hove, both using the prefix BN). The old coding lives on in a small number of street signs with (for example) "Salford 7" at the bottom. In other cases, the district numbers were replaced with unrelated numbers. In Glasgow many of its G-prefixed numbers are not used as C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. In London (as postally defined) 1917-created postal districts are mapped unchanged to those of today but its much enlarged administrative area, Greater London was created in April 1965. From that month the remaining 60% of Greater London's area has postcodes referring to 13 other post towns. Additionally, there were too few postcodes to adequately cover districts in central London (particularly in the WC and EC areas), so these were subdivided with a letter suffix rather than being split into new numbered districts, so as to retain the familiar codes.

====GB postcodes available as OpenData====
Prior to 1 April 2010 the Royal Mail licensed use of the postcode database for a charge of about £4000 per year.&lt;ref name=planning/&gt; Following a campaign and a government consultation in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |title=DCLG: Policy options for geographic information from Ordnance Survey: Consultation |language=zh |publisher=Communities.gov.uk |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230115507/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |archivedate=30 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ordnance Survey released Code-Point Open, detailing each current postcode in Great Britain together with a geo-code for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence [[Open Government Licence]] as part of [[Ordnance Survey#OS OpenData|OS OpenData]].

====Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies==== 
The [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS Geography) maintains and publishes a series of freely available, downloadable postcode products that link all current and terminated UK postcodes to a range of administrative, health, statistical and other geographies using the Code-Point Open grid reference.

==Formatting==
===Overview===
The postcodes are alphanumeric, and are variable in length: ranging from six to eight characters (including a space) long. Each post code is divided into two parts separated by a single space: the ''outward code'' and the ''inward code'' respectively. The ''outward code'' includes the ''postcode area'' and the ''postcode district'', respectively. The ''inward code'' includes the ''postcode sector'' and the ''postcode unit'' respectively. Examples of postcodes include "SW1W 0NY", "PO16 7GZ", "GU16 7HF", or "L1 8JQ".

{| align="center" border="0"

| Postcode Area|| Postcode District|| Postcode Sector || Postcode Unit
|- style="background:#0000cd; color:#ffffff;" align="center"
| SW || 1W || 0 || NY
|}

===Outward code===
The outward code is the part of the postcode before the single space in the middle. It is between two and four characters long. Examples of outward codes include "L1", "W1A", "RH1", "RH10" or "SE1P". A few outward codes are non-geographic, not divulging where mail is to be sent.

====Postcode area====
The [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]] is part of the outward code. The postcode area is either one or two characters long and is all letters. Examples of postcode areas include "L" for [[Liverpool]], "RH" for [[RH postcode area|Redhill]] and "EH" for [[Edinburgh]]. A postal area may cover a wide area, for example "RH" covers north Sussex, and "BT" ([[Belfast]]) covers the whole of [[Northern Ireland]].

====Postcode district====
The [[List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|postcode district]] is made of one or two digits or a digit followed by a letter. The outward code is between two and four characters long. Examples include "W1A", "RH1", "RH10" or "SE1P".

===Inward code===
The inward code is the part of the postcode after the single space in the middle. It is three characters long. The inward code assists in the delivery of post within a postal district. Examples of inward codes include "0NY", "7GZ", "7HF", or "8JQ".&lt;ref name="Postcodes &amp; Addresses Explained" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Postcodes &amp; Addresses Explained" /&gt;

====Postcode sector====
The postcode sector is made up of the postcode district, the single space, and the first character of the inward code. It is between four and six characters long (including the single space). Examples of postcode sectors include "SW1W 0", "PO16 7", "GU16 7", or "L1 8", "CV1 4".

====Postcode unit====
The postcode unit is two characters added to the end of the postcode sector. Each postcode unit generally represents a street, part of a street, a single address, a group of properties, a single property, a sub-section of the property, an individual organisation or (for instance [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]) a subsection of the organisation. The level of discrimination is often based on the amount of mail received by the premises or business. Examples of postcode units include "SW1W 0NY", "PO16 7GZ", "GU16 7HF", or "L1 8JQ".

===Validation===
The format is as follows, where '''A''' signifies a letter and '''9''' a digit:

Notes:
* As all formats end with 9AA, the first part of a postcode can easily be extracted by ignoring the last three characters
* Areas with only single-digit districts: BR, FY, HA, HD, HG, HR, HS, HX, JE, LD, SM, SR, WC, WN, ZE (although WC is always subdivided by a further letter, e.g. WC1A).
* Areas with only double-digit districts: AB, LL, SO.
* Areas with a district '0' (zero): BL, BS, CM, CR, FY, HA, PR, SL, SS (BS is the only area to have both a district 0 and a district 10).
* The following central London single-digit districts have been further divided by inserting a letter after the digit and before the space: EC1–EC4 (but not EC50), SW1, W1, WC1, WC2, and part of E1 (E1W), N1 (N1C and N1P), NW1 (NW1W) and SE1 (SE1P).
* The letters ''QVX'' are not used in the first position.
* The letters ''IJZ'' are not used in the second position.
* The only letters to appear in the third position are ''ABCDEFGHJKPSTUW'' when the structure starts with A9A.
* The only letters to appear in the fourth position are ''ABEHMNPRVWXY'' when the structure starts with AA9A.
* The final two letters do not use the letters ''CIKMOV'', so as not to resemble digits or each other when hand-written.
* Post code sectors are one of ten digits: 0 to 9 with 0 only used once 9 has been used in a post town, save for Croydon and Newport (see above).

A postcode can be validated against a table of all 1.7&amp;nbsp;million postcodes in [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html Code-Point Open]. The full delivery address including postcode can be validated against the  [[Royal Mail]]  [[Postcode Address File]] (PAF) which lists 29&amp;nbsp;million valid delivery addresses,&lt;ref name=bbc_50&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7803267.stm Postcodes to celebrate 50th year] [[BBC News]], 30 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; constituting most (but not all) addresses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses|
url=http://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/|
author=Michael Tandy|website=Mjt.me.uk|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[regular expression]] can be used for the purpose of validation:

&lt;code&gt;^([A-Za-z][A-Ha-hJ-Yj-y]?[0-9][A-Za-z0-9]? [0-9][A-Za-z]{2}|[Gg][Ii][Rr] 0[Aa]{2})$&lt;/code&gt;

If you can accept a lack of space between the Outward and Inward codes use the following:

&lt;code&gt;^([A-Za-z][A-Ha-hJ-Yj-y]?[0-9][A-Za-z0-9]? ?[0-9][A-Za-z]{2}|[Gg][Ii][Rr] ?0[Aa]{2})$&lt;/code&gt;

===Post towns===
All, or part, of one or more postcode districts are grouped into [[post town]]s.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Address Management Guide |edition=5th |publisher=Royal Mail Group plc |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.royalmail.com/marketing-services/address-management-unit/address-data-products/address-management-guide |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger post towns may use more than one postcode district, for example Crawley uses RH10 and RH11. In a minority of cases a single number can cover two post towns – for example, the WN8 district includes Wigan and Skelmersdale post towns.

==Special cases==
===Crown Dependencies===
The [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] established their own postal administrations separate from the UK in 1969. Despite this they adopted the UK format postcodes, [[Guernsey]] in 1993 using [[GY postcode area|GY]], the Isle of Man the same year using [[IM postcode area|IM]], and [[Jersey]] in 1994 using [[JE postcode area|JE]].&lt;ref name="newareas"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021217/text/21217w16.htm Written Answer &lt;nowiki&gt;[87341]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], House of Commons Hansard, 17 December 2002, column 739W.&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent jurisdiction of [[Sark]] was assigned a unique postcode prefix GY10 in 2011 to differentiate it from Alderney. The CEO of Guernsey Post, Boley Smillie said "this has been a long time coming" and "... Sark should have had its own identity back then [when postcodes were adopted in 1993]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-12121380|title=Sark gets own GY10 postcode after split from Alderney|date=2011-01-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Overseas Territories===
Some of the [[British Overseas Territories]] have their own postcodes or postcode systems:

These were introduced because mail was often sent to the wrong place, e.g., for St Helena to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Merseyside]]&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.royalmail.com/Downloads/public/cmwalk/doc/active/doc41000003/Courier%20Landmark%20Article%20Oct_09.pdf Landmark birthday for postcode]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ascension Island to [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]], and many online companies would not accept addresses without a postcode. Mail from the UK continues to be treated as international, not inland, and sufficient postage must be used. Royal Mail's Heathrow centre collects all live underpaid mail for surcharging, and there is a reciprocal arrangement with postal services around the world to collect. An agreed payment based on volumes is made, year on year. Other forms of postage are collected at local mail centres, but Heathrow collects those that still get forwarded to them. [[Bermuda]], the UK's most populous remaining overseas territory, has developed its [[postal codes in Bermuda|own postcode system]], with unique postcodes for street and PO Box addresses,&lt;ref name="bpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpo.bm/postalcodes.aspx?activemenu=40&amp;sub=26|website=bpo.bm|title=Bermuda Post Office|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have the [[Cayman Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caymanpost.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1327,1736998&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |title=Cayman Islands Postal Service Postcode Finder |publisher=Caymanpost.gov.ky |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Montserrat]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000034/003481.htm |title=British Virgin Islands to get its own postal code |publisher=Caribbeannetnews.com |date=29 September 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004101335/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000034/003481.htm |archivedate=4 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montserrat]] recently introduced postal codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ms/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Postal-Code-Guide-pamphlet.pdf|format=PDF|title=A QUICK GUIDE TO USING POSTCODE IN YOUR MAIL|website=Gov.ms|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a system has been under consideration in [[Gibraltar]],&lt;ref name=gibralta&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061020003717/http://www.gibraltarnewsonline.com/2006/06/30/government-set-to-introduce-post-codes// Government set to introduce post codes]. ''Gibraltar News''. 30 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the code GX11 1AA has been introduced as the generic postcode for the territory.&lt;ref name="gx111aa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/fileadmin/documentsFiles/activities/addressingUnit/gibEn.pdf|title=Universal Postal Union document on Gibraltar|website=Upu.int|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcodes are not used in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the TKCA 1ZZ designation is generally unknown.

British Overseas Territories typically have a local or UK government postal system operator (see [[List of postal entities]]), even if a postal code is assigned by Royal Mail for internal UK routing.

==={{anchor|British Forces}} British Forces Post Office (BFPO)===
&lt;!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links. Please do not move it out of the section heading, even though it disrupts edit summary generation (you can manually fix the edit summary before saving your changes). Please do not modify it, even if you modify the section title. See [[Template:Anchor]] for details. (This text: [[Template:Anchor comment]]) --&gt;
The [[British Forces Post Office]] (BFPO) provides a postal service to HM Forces separate from that provided by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom, with BFPO addresses used for the delivery of mail in the UK and around the world. BFPO codes such as "BFPO 801" serve the same function as postal codes for civilian addresses, with the last line of the address consisting of "BFPO" followed a space and a number of 1 to 4 digits.

For consistency with the format of other UK addresses, in 2012 BFPO and Royal Mail jointly introduced an optional alternative postcode format for BFPO addresses, using the new non-geographic postcode area "BF" and the notional [[post town]] "BFPO". Each BFPO number is assigned to a postcode in the standard UK format, beginning "BF1". The database was released commercially in March 2012 as part of the Royal Mail [[Postcode Address File|Postal Address File]] (PAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/community/news/archive/a-better-deal-for-overseas-personnel-23042012|title=A better deal for overseas personnel|publisher=Royal Air Force|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/D4C88C78-EB65-405E-ACBD-C107A28D5981/0/bfpo__indicator_list.pdf|title=BFPO Indicator List|publisher=Ministry of Defence|format=PDF|date=April 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A postcode is not required if the traditional "BFPO nnnn" format is used.

===Non-geographic codes===
Most postcodes apply to a geographic area but some are used only for routing and cannot be used for navigation or distance-finding.&lt;ref name="non_geo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=ftp://ftp.royalmail.com/Downloads/public/ctf/rm/07mar_Current_Non_Geo.pdf |title=07mar_Current_Non_Geo.xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often used for [[direct marketing]] and [[PO box]]es. Some postcode sectors or districts are set aside solely for non-geographic postcodes, including EC50, BS98, BT58, BX1-BX9, IM99, M60, N1P, NE99, SA99, SW99 and JE4.

[[Girobank]]'s headquarters in [[Bootle]] used the non-geographic postcode GIR 0AA. Non-geographic postcode area BX is used solely for non-geographic addresses, with codes independent of the location of the recipient. See next paragraph. There is also a special postcode for [[letters to Santa|letters to Santa/Father Christmas]], XM4 5HQ.&lt;ref name=santa&gt;{{Cite web
| author      =[[Royal Mail]]
| title       =Christmas letters to Santa
| url         =http://www.royalmail.com/letters-to-santa
| work        =
| publisher   =
| date        =12 May 2013
| accessdate  =5 December 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special postcodes===
[[Postcodes]] are allocated by Royal Mail's Address Management Unit and cannot be purchased or specified by the recipient. However, Royal Mail sometimes assigns semi-[[mnemonic]] postcodes to high-profile organisations.&lt;ref name="bbceu"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19046445 |title=Postcode lottery?

Postcodes are used to sort letters to their destination either manually, where sorters use labelled frames, or increasingly with letter-coding systems, where machines assist in sorting.&lt;ref name=compcomm1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Post Office Letter Post Service: a report on the letter post service of the Post Office in the Head Post Office areas of Glasgow, Belfast and Cardiff and in the numbered London postal districts |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1984/fulltext/180c02.pdf |chapter=2: The organisation of the Post Office and its letter post operations |pages=19–20 |year=1984 |publisher=[[Competition Commission]] |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120119215329/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1984/fulltext/180c02.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of automated sorting uses [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) to read printed postcodes, best suited to mail that uses a standard layout and addressing format.&lt;ref name="clear"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/Guide_for_clear_addressing_August2012.pdf |title=A guide for letter envelope design and clear addressing – How to get it right |date=August 2012 |publisher=[[Royal Mail]] |accessdate=28 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031014230/http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/Guide_for_clear_addressing_August2012.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long string of "faced" letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is presented to a keyboard operator at a coding desk, who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters.&lt;ref name="Postcodes &amp; Addresses Explained"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmail.com/delivery/mail-advice/postcodes-addresses-explained |title=Postcodes &amp; Addresses Explained |publisher=[[Royal Mail]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716211307/http://www.royalmail.com/delivery/mail-advice/postcodes-addresses-explained |archive-date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature depends upon whether or not it is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled.&lt;ref name=compcomm&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1984/fulltext/180c02.pdf/|title=The Post Office Letter Post Service: a report on the letter post service of the Post Office in the Head Post Office areas of Glasgow, Belfast and Cardiff and in the numbered London postal districts|chapter=2: The Organisation of the Post Office and its letter post operations|year=1984|publisher=[[Competition Commission]]|accessdate=9 May 2011|pages=19–20|quote=When the mail reaches its destination delivery office, it is sorted into postmen's walks.

====Integrated Mail Processors====
Integrated Mail Processors (IMPs) read the postcode on the item and translate it into two phosphorous barcodes, unique to the inward and outward parts of the postcode, which the machines subsequently print and read, to sort the mail to the correct outward postcode. Letters may also be sequentially sorted by a Compact Sequence Sorter (CSS) reading the outward postcode, in the order that a walking postman/woman will deliver, door to door. On such items the top phosphorous barcode is the inward part of the code, the bottom is the outward.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

IMPs can also read RM4SCC items, as used in Cleanmail, a different format to the above.

====Mailsort and Walksort====
A newer system of five-digit codes called [[Mailsort]] was designed for users who send "a minimum of 4,000 letter-sized items".&lt;ref name=mailsort_faq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmailgroup.co.uk/discounts-payment/discounts-letters-uk/walksort/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062716/http://www.royalmailgroup.co.uk/discounts-payment/discounts-letters-uk/walksort/details |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2014 |title=Walksort |publisher=[[Royal Mail]] |accessdate=28 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It encodes the outward part of the postcode in a way that is useful for mail routing, so that a particular range of Mailsort codes goes on a particular plane or lorry. Mailsort users are supplied with a database to allow them to convert from postcodes to Mailsort codes and receive a discount if they deliver mail to the post office split up by Mailsort code. Users providing outgoing mail sorted by postcode receive no such incentive since postcode areas and districts are assigned using permanent mnemonics, and do not therefore assist with grouping items together into operationally significant blocks. Walksort{{clarify|date=November 2016}} was discontinued in May 2012.

==Listings and availability==
{{further|List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|List of post towns in the United Kingdom}}
There are approximately 1.7&amp;nbsp;million postcodes in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).&lt;ref name="pafstats1208"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poweredbypaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/062016_PAF-Stats.pdf |title=Postcode Address File statistics |publisher=Royal Mail |date=June 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each postcode is divided by a space into two parts. As mentioned above, the first part is known as a [[postcode district]]. Postcode districts with the same one or two letter prefixes are grouped into [[postcode area]]s. The second part of a postcode begins with a single digit which indicates the '''postcode sector''' within each district.

Postcode areas are also divided into several [[post town]]s, which predate the introduction of postcodes, with the [[London postal district|London]] post town uniquely covering more than one postcode area.

As of June 2016, there are 124 postcode areas, 2,987 postcode districts, 11,192 postcode sectors, and 1,500 post towns.&lt;ref name="pafstats1208" /&gt;  Addresses receiving large volumes of mail are each assigned separate "large user" postcodes. But most postcodes are shared by several neighbouring properties, typically covering about 15 addresses.

===Life-cycle of post codes===
There are also significant numbers of discontinued (terminated) codes. Each month some 2,750 postcodes are created and 2,500  terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.listmark.net/blog/how-often-do-postcodes-change |title=How often do postcodes change? |last1=Edwards |first1=Alex |date=23 January 2013 |website=Listmark |accessdate=28 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016003852/http://www.listmark.net/blog/how-often-do-postcodes-change |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcode Address File (PAF)===
The Address Management Unit of [[Royal Mail]] maintains an official database of UK postal addresses and postcodes on its [[Postcode Address File]] (PAF), which is made available under licence for a fee regulated by [[Ofcom]]. The PAF is commercially licenseable and is often incorporated in address management software packages. The capabilities of such packages allow most addresses to be constructed solely from the postcode and house number. By including the [[Ordnance Survey|map reference]]s of postcodes in the address database, the postcode can be used to pinpoint a postcode area on a map. PAF is updated daily.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

On its [http://www.poweredbypaf.com poweredbypaf.com] website, Royal Mail publishes summary information about major changes to postcode sectors and postal localities (including post towns). Individual postcodes or postal addresses can be found using Royal Mail's [http://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode Postcode and Address Finder] website, but this is limited to 50 free searches per user per day.

===Code-Point Open===
A complete list of all current Great Britain postcodes, known as Code-Point Open, has been made available online (since 1 April 2010) by Ordnance Survey. Under the government's [[OS OpenData]] initiative, it is available for re-use without charge under an attribution-only licence. The Code-Point Open list includes median coordinates for each postcode but excludes postcodes in Northern Ireland and the [[Crown dependencies]]. Unlike the PAF products provided by Royal Mail, the Code-Point Open list does not include postal address text.

===ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup===
The [[Office For National Statistics]] also produces postcode directories, under similar licence terms to the OS product. Both the ONSPD and NSPL contain Northern Ireland postcodes, with centroid coordinates in the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|OSI]] grid as opposed to the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB grid]], although Northern Ireland postcodes are subject to a more restrictive licence permitting internal business use only.&lt;ref name="ons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences|title=Licences|website=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcodes for the Crown Dependences are also included, without co-ordinates. A further difference is that non-current postcodes, and dates of introduction and withdrawal of postcodes are included.

==Other uses==
{{See also|Postcode lottery}}
While postcodes were introduced to expedite the delivery of mail, they are useful tools for other purposes, particularly because codes are very fine-grained and identify just a few addresses. Among uses are:
* Finding the nearest branch of an organisation to a given address. A computer program uses the postcodes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance as the crow flies (or, if used in conjunction with streetmap software, by road distance). This can be used by companies to inform potential customers where to go, by [[job centre]]s to find jobs for job-seekers, to alert people of [[town planning]] applications in their area, and a great many other applications.&lt;ref name=planning&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon |title=newspaper article on postcodes |publisher=Guardian |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With [[satellite navigation]] systems, to navigate to an address by street number and postcode.
* By life insurance companies and pension funds to assess longevity for pricing and reserving.&lt;ref name="insurance"&gt;[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/103077/sm20080225.pdf Richards, S.

* By other types of insurance companies to assess premiums for motoring/business/domestic policy premiums.
* To determine [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment areas]] for school places or [[General practitioner|doctors']] surgeries.
The phrase "[[postcode lottery]]" refers to the variation in the availability of services by region, though not always because of postcodes.

For these and related reasons, postcodes in some areas have become indicators of social status. Some residents have campaigned to change their postcode to associate themselves with a more desirable area,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26367320 The march of the postcode battlers], BBC News Magazine, 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to disassociate with a poorer area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2668561.stm |title=England &amp;#124; 'Snobs' want to slough off postcode |publisher=BBC News |date=17 January 2003 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to be associated with an area with a lower [[cost of living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/archive/display.var.334327.0.cracking_the_codes_not_easy.php |title=Cracking The Codes Not Easy (from This Is Local London) |publisher=Thisislocallondon.co.uk |date=12 March 2002 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526111315/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/archive/display.var.334327.0.cracking_the_codes_not_easy.php |archivedate=26 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases [[Royal Mail]] has said that there is "virtually no hope" of changing the postcode, referring to their policy of changing postcodes only to match changes in their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scrivens |first=Louise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4409163.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; The power of the postcode |publisher=BBC News |date=5 April 2005 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postcode areas rarely align with local government boundaries, and a few straddle [[England]]'s borders with [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. This has led to [[British Sky Broadcasting]] subscribers receiving the wrong BBC and ITV regions, and newly licensed [[radio amateurs]] being given incorrect [[call signs]].

'''Simple Features''' (officially '''Simple Feature Access''') is both an [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) and [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) standard '''ISO 19125''' that specifies a common storage and access model of mostly two-dimensional geometries (point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line, etc.) used by [[geographic information system]]s.

The ISO 19125 standard comes in two parts. Part one, ISO 19125-1 (SFA-CA for "common architecture"), defines a model for two-dimensional simple features, with linear interpolation between vertices. The data model defined in SFA-CA is a hierarchy of [[class (computer programming)|classes]]. This part also defines representation using [[Well-Known Text]] (and Binary). Part 2 of the standard, ISO 19125-2 (SFA-SQL), defines an implementation using [[SQL]].&lt;ref name="KresseDanko2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolfgang Kresse|author2=David M. Danko|title=Springer Handbook of Geographic Information|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-72678-4|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenGIS standard(s) cover implementations in [[CORBA]] and [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]]/[[Component Object Model|COM]] as well, although these have lagged behind the SQL one and are not standardized by ISO.

The ISO/IEC 13249-3 [[SQL/MM Spatial]] extends the Simple Features data model mainly with circular interpolations (e.g. [[Arc (geometry)|circular arc]]s) and adds other features like coordinate transformations and methods for validating geometries as well as [[Geography Markup Language]] support.&lt;ref name="KresseDanko2011"/&gt;

== Part 1 details ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
The geometries are also associated with [[spatial reference system]]s. The standard also specifies [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]], [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] and [[Assertion (computing)|assertions]] with the geometries. In general, a 2D geometry is simple if it contains no self-intersection. The specification defines [[DE-9IM]] spatial predicates and several spatial operators that can be used to generate new geometries from existing geometries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34280">'''Space law''' encompasses national and [[international law]] governing activities in [[outer space]].  International lawyers have been unable to agree on a uniform definition of the term "outer space", although most lawyers agree that outer space generally begins at the lowest altitude above sea level at which objects can orbit the [[Earth]], approximately {{convert|122|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The inception of the field of space law began with the launch of the world's first artificial satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] in October 1957.  Named ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', the satellite was launched as part of the [[International Geophysical Year]]. Since that time, space law has evolved and assumed more importance as mankind has increasingly come to use and rely on space-based resources.

== Early developments ==
At [[Caltech]] in 1942 [[Theodore von Kármán]] and other rocket scientists banded together to form [[Aerojet]] rocket company with the help of lawyer [[Andrew G. Haley]]. To toast the new corporation, Kármán said, "Now, Andy, we will make the rockets – you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we behave well in outer space...After all, we are the scientists but you are the lawyer, and you must tell us how to behave ourselves according to law and to safeguard our innocence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew G. Haley]] (1963) ''Space Law and Government'', page xii, [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, twenty years later Haley published the fundamental textbook, ''Space Law and Government''.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed both for the book, but also of a secondary source by a 3rd party declaring this "the fundamental textbook". Both need cited.|date=November 2017}}

Beginning in 1957 with the [[Space Race]], nations began discussing systems to ensure the peaceful use of outer space.&lt;ref name="inesap"&gt;[http://www.inesap.org/bulletin17/bul17art22.htm inesap.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318143550/http://www.inesap.org/bulletin17/bul17art22.htm |date=2008-03-18 }} Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and International Law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/119/31/IMG/NR011931.pdf?OpenElement UN website] UN Resolution 1148 (XII). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814205448/http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/119/31/IMG/NR011931.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilateral discussions between the United States and USSR in 1958 resulted in the presentation of issues to the UN for debate.&lt;ref name="inesap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghMacWhinney1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nagendra Singh|author2=Edward MacWhinney|title=Nuclear Weapons and Contemporary International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2IfMEpPUIsC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1989|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-247-3637-4|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/747/92/IMG/NR074792.pdf?OpenElement UN website] UN Resolution 1348 (XIII). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022148/http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/747/92/IMG/NR074792.pdf?OpenElement |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the UN created the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] (COPUOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/COPUOS/copuos.html | title = United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space | publisher = United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; COPUOS in turn created two subcommittees, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and the Legal Subcommittee.  The COPUOS Legal Subcommittee has been a primary forum for discussion and negotiation of international agreements relating to outer space.

In 1960 the [[International Astronautical Congress]] met in Stockholm and heard several submissions including a survey of legal opinion on extraterrestrial jurisdiction by Andrew G. Haley.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley (1961) "Survey of Legal Opinion on Extraterrestrial Jurisdiction",  in proceedings of the eleventh [[International Astronautical Congress]], Stockholm 1960, pp 37–92, Springer {{ISBN|978-3-662-37770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 [[Yale University Press]] published ''Law and Public Order in Space'' by [[Myres McDougal]], [[Harold Lasswell]] and Ivan Vlasic.

== International treaties ==
Five international treaties have been negotiated and drafted in the COPUOS :

* The 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the "[[Outer Space Treaty]]").
* The 1968 Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (the "[[Rescue Agreement]]").
* The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (the "[[Liability Convention]]").
* The 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (the "[[Registration Convention]]").
* The 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the "[[Moon Treaty]]").

The outer space treaty is the most widely adopted treaty, with 104 parties.&lt;ref name="unoosa.org"&gt;http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/AC105_C2_2016_CRP03E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue agreement, the liability convention and the registration convention all elaborate on provisions of the outer space treaty.  UN delegates apparently intended{{according to whom|date=January 2011}} that the moon treaty serve as a new comprehensive treaty which would supersede or supplement the outer space treaty, most notably by elaborating upon the outer space treaty's provisions regarding resource appropriation and prohibition of territorial sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journal of Space Law|journal=Journal of Space Law|year=1974|volume=2|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/JSL/Back_issues/JSL%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moon treaty has only 17 parties &lt;ref name="unoosa.org"/&gt; however, and many consider it to be a failed treaty due to its limited acceptance.&lt;ref name="ADL Legal"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Legal|url=http://www.dllegal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is the only nation that has both signed the moon treaty and declared itself interested in going to the moon.  India has not ratified the treaty; an analysis of India's treaty law is required to understand how this affects India legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49688551/International-Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water ("[[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]") banned the testing of nuclear weapons in outer space.

==International principles and declarations==
The five treaties and agreements of international space law cover "non-appropriation of outer space by any one country, arms control, the freedom of exploration, liability for damage caused by space objects, the safety and rescue of spacecraft and astronauts, the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, the notification and registration of space activities, scientific investigation and the exploitation of natural resources in outer space and the settlement of disputes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/treaties.html |title= United Nations Treaties and Principles on Space Law. |author=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs  |date= |work= |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted five declarations and legal principles which encourage exercising the international laws, as well as unified communication between countries. The five declarations and principles are{{citation needed|reason=United Nations Treaties and Principles on Outer Space: Travaux Préparatoires. http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/travaux-preparatoires.html=|date=November 2017}}:

:*The Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space (1963)
:All space exploration will be done with good intentions and is equally open to all States that comply with international law. No one nation may claim ownership of outer space or any celestial body. Activities carried out in space must abide by the international law and the nations undergoing these said activities must accept responsibility for the governmental or non-governmental agency involved. Objects launched into space are subject to their nation of belonging, including people. Objects, parts, and components discovered outside the jurisdiction of a nation will be returned upon identification. If a nation launches an object into space, they are responsible for any damages that occur internationally
:*Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979)  [[File:Apollo 15 flag, rover, LM, Irwin.jpg|thumb|Apollo 15 Moon landing. Jul 26, 1971 – Aug 7, 1971]]The agreement exists to promote the exploration of outer space but to keep the [[moon]] and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] in pristine conditions for the common heritage of man, meaning that no nation may claim [[sovereignty]] over any part of space.

All activities in space are required to be attached to a nation and any damages to other nations equipment or facilities caused by another party must be repaid in full to that nation. Any discovery of a dangerous hazard such as an area that is radioactive must notify the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] and the greater international scientific community immediately.
:All missions in space lasting longer than 60 days must notify the UN [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] and the greater scientific community every 30 days of progress.

:*The Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth Satellites for International Direct Television Broadcasting (1982)
:Activities of this nature must be transpired in accordance with the sovereign rights of States. Said activities should "promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields, assist in educational, social and economic development, particularly in the developing countries, enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States." All States have equal rights to pursue these activities and must maintain responsibility for anything carried out under their boundaries of authority. States planning activities need to contact the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] with details of the undergoing activities.

:*The Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space (1986)
:Fifteen principles are stated under this category. The basic understanding comes from these descriptions given by the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]]:
:(a) The term "remote sensing" means the sensing of the Earth's surface from space by making use of the properties of electromagnetic waves emitted, reflected or :diffracted by the sensed objects, for the purpose of improving natural resources management, land use and the protection of the environment;
:(b) The term "primary data" means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground :from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals, by photographic film, magnetic tape or any other means;
:(c) The term "processed data" means the products resulting from the processing of the primary data, needed to make such data usable;
:(d) The term "analysed information" means the information resulting from the interpretation of processed data, inputs of data and knowledge from other sources;
:(e) The term "remote sensing activities" means the operation of remote sensing space systems, primary data collection and storage stations, and activities in :processing, interpreting and disseminating the processed data.&lt;ref name="Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_51_0122.html|title=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812092122/http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_51_0122.html|archivedate=2011-08-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*The Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992)
:"States launching space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall endeavour to protect individuals, populations and the biosphere against radiological hazards. The design and use of space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall ensure, with a high degree of confidence, that the hazards, in foreseeable operational or accidental circumstances, are kept below acceptable levels..."

:*The Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries (1996)
:"States are free to determine all aspects of their participation in international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. All States, particularly those with relevant space capabilities and with programmes for the exploration and use of outer space, should contribute to promoting and fostering international cooperation on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. In this context, particular attention should be given to the benefit for and the interests of developing countries and countries with incipient space programmes stemming from such international cooperation conducted with countries with more advanced space capabilities. International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned, including, inter alia, governmental and non-governmental; commercial and non-commercial; global, multilateral, regional or bilateral; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development."

== Consensus ==
The [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] and its Scientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees operate on the basis of consensus, ''i.e.'' all delegations from member States must agree on any matter, be it treaty language before it can be included in the final version of a treaty or new items on Committee/Subcommittee's agendas. One reason that the U.N. space treaties lack definitions and are unclear in other respects, is that it is easier to achieve consensus when language and terms are vague.  In recent years, the Legal Subcommittee has been unable to achieve consensus on discussion of a new comprehensive space agreement (the idea of which, though, was proposed just by a few member States). It is also unlikely that the Subcommittee will be able to agree to amend the Outer Space Treaty in the foreseeable future.  Many space faring nations seem to believe that discussing a new space agreement or amendment of the Outer Space Treaty would be futile and time-consuming, because entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation, property rights and other issues relating to commercial activity make consensus unlikely.

== 1998 ISS agreement ==
In addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the United Nations, the nations participating in the [[International Space Station]] have entered into the [[Political and financial aspects of the ISS|1998 Agreement]] among the governments of Canada, Member States of the [[European Space Agency]], Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States concerning cooperation on the Civil International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/reports/1998/IGA.html Space Station Agreement]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement provides, among other things, that [[NASA]] is the lead agency in coordinating the member states' contributions to and activities on the space station, and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own module(s).  The agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution.  This agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the Moon and Mars, where the first off-world colonies and scientific/industrial bases are likely to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law and Space Resources|url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/nasa/spaceresvol4/spacelaw.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National law==
Space law also encompasses national laws, and many countries have passed national space legislation in recent years.  The Outer Space Treaty gives responsibility for regulating space activities, including both government and private sector, to the individual countries where the activity is taking place.  If a national of, or an organization incorporated in one country launches a spacecraft in a different country, interpretations differ as to whether the home country or the launching country has jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/california-startup-accused-of-launching-unauthorized-sa-1823657316|title=California Startup Accused of Launching Unauthorized Satellites Into Orbit: Report [Updated]|first=George|last=Dvorsky|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outer Space Treaty also incorporates the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] by reference, and requires parties to ensure that activities are conducted in accordance with other forms of international law such as [[customary international law]] (the custom and practice of states).

The advent of commercial activities like [[space mining]], [[space tourism]], private exploration, and the development of many commercial spaceports, is leading many countries{{Which|date=January 2011}} to consider how to regulate private space activities.&lt;ref name="Space Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law|url=http://www.dllegal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment, while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law. The developing nations are concerned that the spacefaring nations will monopolize space resources.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Royalties paid to developing countries is one reason the United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], and why some oppose applying the same principles to outer space.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kristina.

== Geostationary orbit allocation ==
Satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] must all occupy a single ring above the equator, approximately 35,800&amp;nbsp;km into space. The requirement to space these satellites apart means that there is a limited number of orbital "slots" available, thus only a limited number of satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries at the same [[longitude]] but differing [[latitudes]]). These disputes are addressed through the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] allocation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.martindale.com/legal-blogs/Legal_Management/b/law_articles/archive/2015/07/16/how-orange-county-attorneys-prosecute-dui-defendants.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt; Countries located at the Earth's equator have also asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ECSL/SEM1691XDYD_0.html|title=Geostationary Orbit. Legal issues|author=esa|work=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably in 1976, when many countries located at the Earth's equator created the [[Bogota Declaration]], in which they asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.

While this field of the law is still in its infancy, it is in an era of rapid change and development.  Arguably the resources of space are infinite.  If commercial space transportation becomes widely available, with substantially lower launch costs, then all countries will be able to directly reap the benefits of space resources.  In that situation, it seems likely that consensus will be much easier to achieve with respect to commercial development and human settlement of outer space. High costs are not the only factor preventing the economic exploitation of space: it is argued that space should be considered as a pristine environment worthy of protection and conservation, and that the legal regime for space should further protect it from being used as a resource for Earth's needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Billings, L.

Telephone numbers in [[Estonia]] follow a [[closed telephone numbering plan]].

All calls inside Estonia are local; trunk codes are not used.

Landline phone numbers have 7 digits, mobile numbers can have either 7 or 8 digits.

Telephone numbers are portable between locations and operators.

[[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] had &lt;code&gt;+7 014&lt;/code&gt; area code.

'''Thomas Bailey''' (1785–1856), was an English [[topographer]] and miscellaneous writer.

== Biography ==
Bailey was born in [[Nottingham]] on 31 July 1785. His education was received partly in a [[day school]] in his native town, and partly in a [[boarding school]] at [[Gillingham, Yorkshire]]. Afterwards he was for some time engaged in business as a [[silk hosiery|silk-hosier]]. 

Politically liberal, he came forward in 1830 as a candidate for the representation of the borough of Nottingham, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1836 he was elected to the [[town council]], and he continued to be a member for seven years. 

In 1845-6 he became proprietor and editor of the ''[[Nottingham Mercury]]'', but his opinions were considered too temperate by his readers. The circulation of the paper declined, and in 1851 the mass of subscribers withdrew in protest at Bailey's views respecting the original error of the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Bill]], and his prophecies of its inevitable failure. In the following year the journal declared bankrupt. 

In 1830, he purchased a mansion at Basford, near Nottingham, where he spent the later years of his life, engaged in literary pursuits and in the formation of a collection of books and engravings. 

He died at Basford on 23 October 1856. His son, [[Philip James Bailey]], is the author of ''Festus'' and of other poems.

'''Tomales Bay''' is a long, narrow inlet of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] in northern [[California]] in the [[United States]]. It is approximately 15 miles (25&amp;nbsp;km) long and averages nearly 1.0 miles (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide, effectively separating the [[Point Reyes Peninsula]] from the mainland of Marin County. It is located approximately 30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[San Francisco]]. The bay forms the eastern boundary of [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]. Tomales Bay is recognized for protection by the [[California Bays and Estuaries Policy]].&lt;ref name="swrcb"&gt;State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974) State of California&lt;/ref&gt; On its northern end it opens out onto [[Bodega Bay]], which shelters it from the direct current of the Pacific. The bay is formed along a submerged portion of the [[San Andreas Fault]].

[[File:Tamales Bay Oysters.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomales Bay oysters]]
Oyster farming is a major industry on the bay. The two largest producers are [[Tomales Bay Oyster Company]] and Hog Island Oyster Company, both of which retail oysters to the public and have picnic grounds on the east shore. Hillsides east of Tomales Bay are grazed by cows belonging to local dairies. There is also grazing land west of the bay, on farms and ranches leased from Point Reyes National Seashore.

The bay sees significant amounts of water sports including sailing, kayaking, fishing and motor boating. Watercraft may be launched on Tomales Bay from the public boat ramp at Nick's Cove, north of Marshall.  There is a $5 fee. The [[sand bar]] at the mouth of Tomales Bay is notoriously dangerous, with a long history of small-boat accidents.

The [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]] (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught here, based on levels of mercury or [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] found in local species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oehha.ca.gov/fish/advisories/tomales-bay|title=Tomales Bay|last=Admin|first=OEHHA|date=2014-12-30|work=OEHHA|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of special interest is the [[bioluminescence]] that can be seen from June to November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluewater.adventureengine.com/portals/vterminal.php?&amp;trip_id=3197 |title=AVAILABILITY SEARCH FOR BIOLUMINESCENCE TOUR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Towns bordering Tomales Bay include [[Inverness, CA|Inverness]], [[Inverness Park, California|Inverness Park]], [[Point Reyes Station, California|Point Reyes Station]], and [[Marshall, California|Marshall]].  Additional hamlets include [[Nick's Cove, California|Nick's Cove]], Spengers, Duck Cove, Shallow Beach, and Vilicichs. [[Dillon Beach, California|Dillon Beach]] lies just to the north of the mouth of the bay, and [[Tomales, California|Tomales]] just to the east.

==History==
The area was once [[Coast Miwok]] territory. Documented villages in the area included ''Echa-kolum'' (south of [[Marshall, California|Marshall]]), ''Sakloki'' (opposite [[Tomales Point]]), ''Shotommo-wi'' (near the mouth of the [[Estero de San Antonio]]), and ''Utumia'' (near Tomales).&lt;ref name="miwok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/california/miwokindianhist.htm|publisher=Access Genealogy|title=Miwok Indian Tribe|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Drake]] is thought to have landed in nearby Drakes Estero in 1579.&lt;ref name="CSP"/&gt; Members of the [[Sebastián Vizcaíno|Vizcaíno Expedition]] found the Bay in 1603, and thinking it a river, named it ''Rio Grande de San Sebastian''.&lt;ref name=Durham&gt;{{cite book |title=Durhams' Place Names of the San Francisco Bay Area |author=David L. Durham |publisher=Word Dancer Press |year=2000 |location=Clovis, California |isbn=1-884995-35-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 19th-century settlements constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] to Tomales Bay.&lt;ref name="Historical Atlas of California"&gt;Historical Atlas of California&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[North Pacific Coast Railroad]] from [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]] was constructed along the east side of the bay in 1874 and extended to the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] until it was dismantled in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, A. Bray ''Narrow Gauge to the Redwoods'' (1974) Trans-Anglo Books {{ISBN|0-87046-010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tomales Bay State Park]] was formed to preserve some of the bay shore; it opened to the public in 1952. Popular units of the park include Heart's Desire Beach and Millerton Point.&lt;ref name="CSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=470|title=Tomales Bay State Park|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ramsar Convention]], signed in 1971, listed Tomales Bay as a [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance|wetland of international importance]].

The Giacomini Wetland Restoration Project, completed in 2008, returned to wetland several hundred acres at the south end of the bay that had been drained for grazing during the 1940s.

The Marconi Conference Center State Historical Park preserves a small hotel built by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in 1913 to house personnel who staffed his transpacific radio station nearby.  The hotel and the associated operations building and employee cottages were built by the J.G. White Engineering Corp under contract to Marconi. [[RCA]] purchased the station from Marconi in 1920. The station was closed in 1939, though other nearby radio stations on the Point Reyes Peninsula still operate today. [[Synanon]], a drug rehabilitation organization, owned it from the early 1960s until 1980, when it was purchased by a private foundation and given to the state in 1984 to operate as a conference center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4788">A '''tropical marine climate''' is a [[tropical climate]] that is primarily influenced by the [[ocean]]. It is usually experienced by [[island]]s and [[coastal]] areas 10° to 20° north and south of the [[equator]]. There are two main seasons in a tropical marine climate: the wet [[season]] and the dry season. The annual rainfall is 1000 to over 1500&amp;nbsp;mm (39 to 59&amp;nbsp;inches).  The temperature ranges from 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 35&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;° to 95&amp;nbsp;°F). The [[trade winds]] blow all year round and are moist, as they pass over warm seas.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Caribbean Environment for CSEC Geography|last=Wilson|first=Mark|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2016|isbn=9780198374565|edition=fifth|location=|pages=114ff|oclc=957691086}}&lt;/ref&gt; These climatic conditions are found, for example, across the [[Caribbean]]; the eastern coasts of [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Queensland]]; and many islands in tropical waters.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hERADwAAQBAJ|title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies for Coastal Communities|last=Filho|first=Walter Leal|date=2017-11-23|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319707037|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=Fiji has a tropical marine climate, with average daily temperatures at Suva ranging from 20.4&amp;ndash;26.5 &amp;deg;C in July to 23.8&amp;ndash;31.0 &amp;deg;C in February}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQlAAAAAQBAJ|title=Coral Reefs of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories|last=Sheppard|first=Charles|date=2013-03-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9789400759657|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=The climate of the Cayman Islands is influenced by their location in the western Caribbean Basin. The islands have a tropical marine climate with two distinct seasons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seasons ==
During the dry season there is less rainfall than in the wet season, but there is little variation in temperature between the two seasons. Tropical marine regions are influenced by [[Anticyclone|anticyclones]] during the dry season and [[Tropical wave|tropical waves]] during the wet season.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26351362|title=Principles of geography for CXC|last=London|first=Norrel A.|last2=Senior|first2=Michael W.|date=1991|publisher=Longman|year=|isbn=9780582039896|edition=second|location=London|pages=|oclc=26351362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem adaptations ==
The ecosystems of the tropical marine climate have to adapt to the dry season. Plants during the dry season must conserve water/moisture. However the extent of the adaptation depends much on the annual rainfall.

[[Hygrophyte|Hygrophytic]] [[ecosystems]] occur when there is a short dry period with a few rain showers. The soil in this ecosystem holds adequate water for plant growth. Most of the tropical marine ecosystems are close to true rain forests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mesophytic ecosystem ===
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2018}}
The mesophytic ecosystem is also known as a semi-evergreen forest. It is found where there is a long dry season that has little rainfall. There is less vegetation than in a rainforest. There are only two tree stories; trees shed their leaves or have very small leaves. This provides the plants a way to conserve moisture.

There are fewer [[epiphyte]]s than a rain forest has as the canopy is dry. In the dry season the ground is covered by leaves that will not decay until the soil is moist. The trees often flower during the dry season and start to grow during the wet season. The soil is usually latasol.

=== Xerophytic ecosystem ===
The xerophytic ecosystem is also known as dry woodland. It is found in areas of [[rain shadow]] in the tropical marine climate. This ecosystem often develops soils that drain quickly.

The dry woodland is very different from the [[rainforest]]. The [[biomass]] is a lot less than a rainforest as there is little rain. The tallest of trees are only 15 to 25 meters high in the dry woodland. Dry woodland trees either have small leaves or shed their leaves. The trees have very thick bark and the trunks are crooked.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Variations ===
[[Mangrove]]s grow in coastal wetlands, which are called hydrophytic ecosystems.  The vegetation at the coast are usually adapted to sandy soil. The [[montane forest]]s and [[elfin woodland]]s grow on the cool, moist, mountainous regions.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Pike and San Isabel National Forests==
In the [[Pike National Forest]] and [[San Isabel National Forest]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]], the upper montane forest is also called the "moist forest", with the mixed coniferous below called "dry forest", and the subalpine forest above called "cold forest".&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Stands may have a shade intolerant ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') overstory, and a shade tolerant Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'') or white fir (''[[Abies concolor]]'') understory.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Cascades Range==
===Lassen Volcanic Park===
In [[Lassen Volcanic Park]] at the southern end of the [[Cascade Range]], the upper montane forest is also known as [[red fir forest]].&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It has less diversity than the mixed coniferous forest below.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It occurs between {{convert|6500|and|8000|ft|m}}, consists of dense stands of red fir ((''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and has little understory and few animals.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; In the western areas that are more open, western white pine ((''[[Pinus monticola]]'') can commonly be found.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') occurs in areas of thin soils.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Summer temperatures are low in the almost total shade of the red fir.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt;

==Sierra Nevada range==

In a whisk broom sensor, a mirror scans across the [[satellite]]’s path ([[ground track]]), reflecting light into a single [[detector]] which collects data one [[pixel]] at a time. The moving parts make this type of sensor expensive and more prone to wearing out. Whisk broom scanners have the effect of stopping the scan, and focusing the detector on one part of the [[swath width]]. Because the detector is only focused on a subsection of the full swath at any time, it typically has a higher resolution than a push broom design for the same size of scan swath.

All sensors aboard the [[Landsat]] series of satellites used the whisk broom design until [[Landsat 8]].&lt;ref name="Shippert" /&gt;

'''Willem Barentsz''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪləm ˈbaːrənts}}; anglicized as '''William Barents''' or '''Barentz''') (c. 1550 – 20 June 1597) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[navigator]], [[cartographer]], and [[Arctic]] [[explorer]]. He went on three expeditions to the far north in search for a [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast passage]]. During his third expedition, the crew was stranded on [[Novaya Zemlya]] for almost a year. Barentsz died on the return voyage in 1597. In the 19th century, the [[Barents Sea]] was named after him.

==Life and career==
Willem Barentsz was born around 1550 on the island [[Terschelling]] in the [[Seventeen Provinces]], present-day [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="godutch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.godutch.com/windmill/newsItem.asp?id=257|title= Historic expedition led by Willem Barentsz nears 400th anniversary|accessdate=8 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barentsz'' was not his [[surname]] but rather his [[Dutch_name#Patronymics|patronymic name]], short for ''Barentszoon'' "[[Barent]]'s son".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNxJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR55&amp;dq=Willem+Barentszoon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Willem+Barentszoon&amp;f=false|title=A True Description of Three Voyages by the North-east Towards Cathay and China: Undertaken by the Dutch in the Years 1594, 1595 and 1596|first=Gerrit|last=De Veer|date=17 July 2017|publisher=Hakluyt Society|accessdate=17 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cartographer by trade, Barentsz sailed to Spain and the Mediterranean to complete an [[atlas]] of the [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean region]], which he co-published with [[Petrus Plancius]].&lt;ref name="godutch"/&gt;

His career as an explorer was spent searching for the [[Northeast passage]], which he reasoned must exist as clear, open water north of [[Siberia]] since the [[Midnight sun|sun shone 24 hours a day]], which he believed would have melted any potential ice.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1993|title= God and the Arctic survivor|journal= [[New Scientist]]|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818674.500-god-and-the--arctic-survivors-without-modern-medicineswindcheaters-or-ski-boots-explorers-still-managed-to--survive-the-arcticwinters-of-400-years-ago--who-was-their-unseen-ally-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First voyage===
[[File:Linschotens nordenkart, 1601 (12067624705).jpg|thumb|Map of Willem Barentsz' first voyage]]

On 5 June 1594, Barentsz left the island of [[Texel]]&lt;ref name="godutch" /&gt; aboard the small&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Philip Frederick. [https://archive.org/details/northwestnorthea00alexrich The North-west and North-east passages], 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; ship ''Mercury'',&lt;ref&gt;Mirsky, Jeannette. ''"To the Arctic!: The Story of Northern Exploration from Earliest Times"'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a group of three ships sent out in separate directions to try to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the Northeast passage above Siberia. Between 23 and 29 June, Barentsz stayed at [[Kildin Island]].

On 9 July,&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Book of Discovery |url= http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=synge&amp;book=discoverybook&amp;story=_contents&amp;PHPSESSID=458b6ee0d |last= Synge|first= J.B.|year= c. 1912|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. After shooting it with a [[musket]] when it tried to climb aboard the ship, the seamen decided to capture it with the hope of bringing it back to Holland. Once leashed and brought aboard the ship however, the bear [[running amok|rampaged]] and had to be killed. This occurred in Bear Creek, Williams Island.

Upon discovering the [[Russian Orange Island|Orange Islands]], the crew came across a herd of approximately 200 [[walrus]]es and tried to kill them with hatchets and pikes. Finding the task more difficult than they imagined, they left with only a few ivory tusks.&lt;ref name="diary" /&gt;

Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]], and followed it northward before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. Although they did not reach their ultimate goal, the trip was considered a success.&lt;ref name="godutch" /&gt;

===Second voyage===
[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a polar bear]]

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] was filled with "the most exaggerated hopes"&lt;ref name="maine" /&gt; on hearing of Barentsz' previous voyage, and named him chief pilot and conductor of a new expedition, which was accompanied by six ships loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref name="lights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/wbarentsz.htm|title=The Northern Lights Route - Willem Barentsz|website=www.ub.uit.no|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting out on 2 June 1595,&lt;ref name="maine" /&gt; the voyage went between the Siberian coast and [[Vaygach|Vaygach Island]]. On 30 August, the party came across approximately 20 [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" with whom they were able to speak, due to a crewmember speaking their language.&lt;ref name="diary" /&gt; 4 September saw a small crew sent to [[States Island]] to search for a type of [[crystal]] that had been noticed earlier.

===Third voyage===

In 1596, disappointed by the failure of previous expeditions, the States-General announced they would no longer [[subsidy|subsidize]] similar voyages – but instead offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the Northeast Passage.&lt;ref name="maine" /&gt;

The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel under the command of Barentsz. They set off on 10 May or 15 May, and on 9 June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]].&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;De Veer, Gerrit. "''The Three Voyages of William Barentsz to the Arctic Regions''" (English trans. 1609).&lt;/ref&gt;

They discovered [[Spitsbergen]] on 17 June, sighting its northwest coast. On 20 June they saw the entrance of a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]]. On 21 June they anchored between Cloven Cliff and Vogelsang, where they "set up a post with the arms of the Dutch upon it." On 25 June they entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', in light of the walrus tusks they found there. The following day, 26 June, they sailed into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], but were forced to turn back because of a shoal, which led them to call the fjord ''Keerwyck'' ("inlet where one is forced to turn back"). On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds they saw there. They sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

The ships once again found themselves at Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement between Barentsz and Van Heemskerk on one side and Rijp on the other. They agreed to part ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed due north.&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt; Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya on 17 July. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he intended to head for the [[Vaigatch Strait]], but became stuck within the many icebergs and floes.&lt;ref name="maine"/&gt;

Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice, along with their young [[cabin boy]].&lt;ref name="discovery" /&gt; After a failed attempt to melt the [[permafrost]], the crew used lumber from their ship to build a 7.8×5.5 metre lodge&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Saved House).

[[File:Barents house inside.jpg|thumb|''Het Behouden Huys'' on Novaya Zemlya]]

Dealing with extreme cold, the crew realised that their socks would burn before their feet could even feel the warmth of a fire – and took to sleeping with warmed stones and cannonballs. In addition, they used the merchant fabrics aboard the ship to make additional blankets and clothing.&lt;ref name="diary" /&gt;

The ship bore salted beef, butter, cheese, bread, [[barley]], peas, beans, [[groats]], flour, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt, beer, wine, brandy, [[hardtack]], smoked bacon, ham and fish. Much of the beer froze, bursting the [[cask]]s. By 8 November [[Gerrit de Veer]], the ships carpenter who kept a diary, reported a shortage of beer and bread, with wine being rationed four days later.&lt;ref name="diary" /&gt;

In January 1597, De Veer became the first person to witness and record the atmospheric anomaly known as the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eh2r.com/mp/data3.html|title= Homage to Gerrit de Veer|accessdate=7 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proving successful at hunting, the group caught 26 [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, and killed a number of polar bears.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, the [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea on 13 June. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts&lt;ref&gt;American Antiquarian Society, "''Transactions and Collections''", 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; only seven days after starting out. It is not known whether Barentsz was buried on [[Severny Island|the northern island of Novaya Zemlya]], or at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic55-4-329.pdf "Search for Barents: Evaluation of Possible Burial Sites on North Novaya Zemlya, Russia"], Jaapjan J. Zeeberg et al., ''Arctic'' Vol. 55, No. 4 (December 2002) p. 329–338&lt;/ref&gt; It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach the [[Kola Peninsula]], where they were rescued by a Dutch merchant vessel commanded by former fellow explorer Jan Rijp. By that time, only 12 crewmen remained. Ultimately, they did not reach Amsterdam until 1 November.&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;Goorich, Frank Boott. "Man Upon the Sea", 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ on whether two men died on the ice floe and three in the boats,&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; or three on the ice floe and two in the boats.&lt;ref name="maine"&gt;De Peyster, John Watts. [https://archive.org/details/dutchatnorthpole00depeuoft The Dutch at the North pole and the Dutch in Maine]. 3 March 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; The young cabin boy had died during the winter months in the shelter.&lt;ref name="discovery" /&gt;{{clear}}

==Excavation and findings==
[[File:Het Behouden.PNG|thumb|The remains of the wooden lodge of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya, sketched by Elling Carlsen in 1871]]

The wooden lodge where Barentsz' crew sheltered was found undisturbed by Norwegian [[seal hunt]]er [[Elling Carlsen]] in 1871. Making a sketch of the lodge's construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a tool chest, clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod and a number of pictures.&lt;ref&gt;De Jonge, J.K.J. ''"Nova Zembla: De voorwerpen door de Nederlandsche Zeevaarders na hunne overwintering aldaar in 1597 achtergelaten en in 1871 door Kapitein Carlsen teruggevonden, beschreven en toegelicht."'', 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a grappling iron, two maps and a handwritten translation of Pet and Jackman's voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]],&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Braat|first= J.|date=December 1984|title= Dutch Activities in the North and the Arctic during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|journal= Arctic|volume= 37|issue= 4|url= http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic37-4-473.pdf|doi=10.14430/arctic2229}}&lt;/ref&gt; after some had initially been held in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barents, Willem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Behouden Finds 1.jpg|thumb|left|Objects found in ''Het Behouden Huys'']]

The amateur archaeologist Miloradovich's 1933 finds are held in the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]] in St. Petersburg. Dmitriy Kravchenko visited the site in 1977, 1979 and 1980 – and sent [[deep sea diving|divers]] into the sea hoping to find the wreck of the large ship. He returned with a number of objects, which went to the Russian Arkangel's Regional Museum. Another small collection exists at the Polar Museum in [[Tromsø]].&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;

In 1992, an expedition of three scientists, a journalist and two photographers commissioned by the ''Arctic Centre'' at the [[University of Groningen]], coupled with two scientists, a cook and a doctor sent by the ''[[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]]'' in [[St. Petersburg]], returned to the site,&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hacquebord|first= Louwrens|date=September 1995|title= In search of Het Behouden Huys: a survey of the remains of the house of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya|journal= Arctic|volume= 48|issue= 3|doi=10.14430/arctic1246|url= http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and erected a commemorative marker at the site of the cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nordictravel.com.au/tourdetailweb.asp?id=314 |title=Nordic Travel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=29 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829090416/http://www.nordictravel.com.au/tourdetailweb.asp?id=314 |archive-date=29 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Barentsz' wintering on the ice floes has become a tourist destination for [[icebreaker]] cruiseships operating from [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/north-pole|title=Quark Expeditions|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015204249/http://quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/north-pole/|archive-date=15 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Monument to Willem Barents, Vardø, Norway.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Barentsz in [[Vardø|Vardø, Norway]].]]
Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and Gerrit de Veer who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last two voyages.

In 1853, the former ''Murmean Sea'' was renamed [[Barents Sea]] in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9013349 Barentsz Sea]." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 5 Dec. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan and Steve Baum. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Barents_Sea ''Barents Sea''. Eds. P.Saundry &amp; C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barentsburg]], the second largest settlement on [[Svalbard]], [[Barentsøya]] (Barents Island) and the [[Barents Region]] were also named after Barentsz.

In the late 19th century, the [[Maritime Institute Willem Barents]] was opened on Terschelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miwb.nl/index.php?db=4&amp;maincat=miwb&amp;cat=miwb&amp;menu=MIWB|title=MIWB - NHL Hogeschool. Vergroot je perspectief.|website=www.miwb.nl|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the Netherlands [[Ship naming and launching|christened]] the ''Willem Barentsz'' Arctic exploration ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= De eerste tocht van de Willem Barentsz naar de Noordelijke IJszee 1878|last= Bruijne|first= Antonius de|author2=Balje, Bastiaan Gerardus |year= 1985|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar published a play written by [[Albert Helman]] about Barentsz' third voyage, although it was never performed.

In 1946, the [[Whaling|whaling ship]] ''Pan Gothia'' was re-christened the ''Willem Barentsz''. In 1953, the second ''Willem Barentsz'' whaling ship was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=De Nederlandsche Maatschappij voor de Walvischvaart |last= Boot|first= W.J.J. |year= 1987|publisher= Bataafsche Leeuw|location= Amsterdam|isbn= 90-6707-129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[protein]] in the molecular structure of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] was named ''Barentsz'', in honour of the explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Barentsz is essential for the posterior localization of oskar mRNA and colocalizes with it to the posterior pole|authors= Van Eeden, F.J.M., Palacios, I.M. &amp; Petronczki, M. &amp; Weston, M.J.D. &amp; St. Johnston, D.|year= 2001|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch filmmaker [[Reinout Oerlemans]] released a film called ''[[Nova Zembla (film)|Nova Zembla]]'' in November 2011. It is the first Dutch 3D feature film.

In 2011, a team of volunteers started building a replica of Barentsz' ship in the Dutch town of [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]]. The plan is having the ship ready by 2018, when the [[Tall Ships' Races]] will visit Harlingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.debarentsz.nl/ Website of the ''Stichting Expeditieschip Willem Barentsz'']&lt;/ref&gt;
