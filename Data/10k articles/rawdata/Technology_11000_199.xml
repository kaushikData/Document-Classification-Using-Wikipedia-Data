[[File:AGARD B standard model.jpg|right|400px|thumb|An AGARD-B model with a body diameter of 115.7 mm]]

'''AGARD-B''' is a [[Standard wind tunnel models|standard wind tunnel model]] (calibration model) that is used to verify, by comparison of test results with previously published data, the measurement chain in a [[wind tunnel]].
Together with its derivative [[#AGARD-C|AGARD-C]] it belongs to a family&lt;ref name="Agardspec2"/&gt; of [[AGARD]] standard wind tunnel models. Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD Wind Tunnel and Model Testing Panel in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], when it was decided to define two standard wind tunnel model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different wind tunnels. The idea was to establish standards of comparison between wind tunnels and improve the validity of wind tunnel tests. 
Among the standard wind tunnel models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic wind tunnels, the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many wind tunnels at a wide range of [[Mach number]]s, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (Mach 8 and above). Therefore, a considerable database of test results is available.

AGARD-B ([[:Image:AGARD-B standard model geometry.png|see figure]]) is a body-wing configuration. All its dimensions are given in terms of the body diameter "D" so that the model can be produced in any scale, as appropriate for a particular wind tunnel. 
The body is an 8.5 diameters long [[solid of revolution]] consisting of a 5.5 diameters long cylindrical segment and a nose with a length of 3 diameters and having a local radius defined by the equation {{nowrap|1=y = x/3 · [1 - 1/9 · (x/D)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1/54 · (x/D)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.

The [[wing]] is a [[delta wing|delta]] in the form of an equilateral triangle with a span of four body diameters. Wing section is a symmetric cylindrical arc with a relative thickness t/c of 4%. [[Leading edge|Leading]] and [[trailing edge]]s of the wing should be rounded with a radius equal to {{nowrap|1=0.002 D}}. However, this specification is unclear. It is obvious that the specified radius can not be applied near the [[Wing tip|wingtips]], or large deformations in the plan form of the wing would occur. In the past, this part of the specification was interpreted in different ways by model designers which led to small differences in shapes of the tested models. The recommended solution&lt;ref name="Hills"&gt;Hills R., [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/AGARD/AG/AGARD-AG-64/AGARD-AG-64.pdf "A Review of Measurements on AGARD Calibration Models"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174434/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/AGARD/AG/AGARD-AG-64/AGARD-AG-64.pdf |date=2014-07-14 }}, AGARDograph 64, Aircraft Research Association Bedford, England, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; is to have the leading- and trailing-edge radii of {{nowrap|1=0.002 D}} at the theoretical root chord and to decrease the radii towards the wing tips proportionally to the local chord.

A support [[sting (fixture)|sting]] to be used with the AGARD-B model was defined as well. The initial specification&lt;ref name="Agardspec1"&gt;Specification for AGARD Wind Tunnel Calibration Models, AGARD memorandum, AGARD, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; of the model called for a sting having a diameter of {{nowrap|1=0.5 D}} and a length of {{nowrap|1=1.5 D}}. In the revised specification&lt;ref name="Agardspec2"/&gt; the length of the sting was changed to {{nowrap|1=3 D}} in order to reduce sting interference, but at that moment a number of wind tunnel tests had already been made. Therefore, published test results&lt;ref name="Hills"/&gt; for the AGARD-B models do not all correspond to theoretical model configuration.

The [[Drag (physics)|drag]] characteristics of the AGARD-B model were found to be somewhat sensitive to the [[boundary layer]] transition on the model. In order to reduce the scatter of results, in some wind tunnel facilities the model was tested with boundary layer transition trips near the leading edges of the wing and the nose of the body. On the other hand, a number of wind tunnel tests was made without fixed transition. Drag results with and without the fixed boundary layer transition differ, which should not be neglected when comparing test results from different wind tunnel laboratories.

In some wind tunnel laboratories, AGARD-B was tested in non-standard configurations, e.g. as a half-model (half-span model).&lt;ref name="jaxa"&gt;Aoki Y., Kanda H., Sato M., Nagai S., Itabashi Y., Nishijima H., Kimura T.[http://airex.tksc.jaxa.jp/pl/dr/AA0064475002/en/64475002.pdf  "AGARD-B Standard Model Tests in JAXA 0.8 m by 0.45 m High Reynolds Number Transonic Wind Tunnel"], JAXA-SP-09-005, Proceedings of the Wind Technology Association 81st meeting, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some free-flight tests of the AGARD-B model were performed. For these tests, the standard geometry was modified by adding, at the rear end of the body, two triangular vertical stabilisers, one on the ventral and one on the dorsal side of the body. Size of the vertical stabilizers was 50% of the wing size, i.e. their span was {{nowrap|1=2.5 D}}.&lt;ref&gt;Piland, R.O., "The Zero-Lift Drag of a 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Delta-Wing-Body Combination (AGARD Model 2) Obtained from Free-Flight Tests Between Mach Numbers 0.8 and 1.7", NACA TN-3081, Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, NACA, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

AGARD-B standard model is intended primarily for the measurement of aerodynamic forces and moments. Test results are most often presented in the form of nondimensional [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#aerodynamic coefficients|aerodynamic coefficients]] in the [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#reference frames|wind axes system]]. Reference area for the calculation of the coefficients is the theoretical wing area {{nowrap|1=S&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; = 4{{sqrt|3}}D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Reference length for the [[Pitching moment#Coefficient|pitching moment coefficient]] {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[mean aerodynamic chord]] (m.a.c.) equal to {{nowrap|1=4{{sqrt|3}}D/3}} while the reference length for the yawing and rolling moment coefficients {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the  [[wing span]] {{nowrap|1=(B&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 D)}}. Moments are reduced to a point in the plane of symmetry of the model, at the longitudinal position of 50% of the m.a.c. [[Drag coefficient]] is presented as forebody drag {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;xf&lt;/sub&gt;}} obtained by subtracting, from the total measured drag {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the base drag {{nowrap|1=C&lt;sub&gt;xb&lt;/sub&gt;}} computed from the measured base pressure on the model.

Some laboratories have selected to test the AGARD-B standard model for periodic checkouts of the quality of measurements in their wind tunnels.&lt;ref name="Damljanovic"&gt;Damljanovic D, Isakovic J. and Rašuo B., [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.C032081 "T-38 Wind-Tunnel Data Quality Assurance Based on Testing of a Standard Model"], [http://arc.aiaa.org/loi/ja Journal of Aircraft], Vol. 50, No. 4 (2013), pp. 1141-1149. doi: 10.2514/1.C032081&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agard38"&gt;Damljanovic D., Vitic A, Vukovic Ð., Isakovic J.,

== AGARD-C ==
[[File:AGARD-C standard model geometry.png|right|400px|thumb|A drawing defining the geometry of the AGARD-C standard model and its sting fixture]]

[[File:AGARD-C standard model.jpg|right|400px|thumb|An AGARD-C model with a body diameter of 115.7 mm. This configuration was assembled by attaching a 1.5-diameters-long body section to the rear end of the AGARD-B model shown in the [[:Image:AGARD B standard model.jpg|figure above]] ]]

At the [[AGARD]] Wind Tunnel and Model Testing Panel meeting in [[Paris]], [[France]], in 1954, it was agreed to add a third model configuration to the family of AGARD calibration models, by extending the body of the AGARD-B by 1.5 diameters and by adding a horizontal and a vertical tail in the [[T-tail]] configuration. The horizontal tail has an area equal to 1/6 of the wing area. Sections of the vertical and horizontal tail are circular arc profiles defined identically to the profile of the wing. Forward of the 1.5 D body extension, the geometry of the AGARD-C model is identical to that of the AGARD-B. Also, the position of the moments reduction point (the aerodynamic centre) is the same as on AGARD-B.

The support [[sting (fixture)|sting]] for the AGARD-C model is identical to the sting for the AGARD-B model, having a length of {{nowrap|1=3 D}} aft of model base and a diameter of {{nowrap|1=0.5 D}}.

The longer body of the AGARD-C model and the existence of the tail make it easier to detect (from anomalies in the wind tunnel test results) if the shock waves reflected from the walls of the wind tunnel test section are passing too close to the rear end of the model. The existence of the tail generally makes this model more sensitive than AGARD-B to flow curvature in the wind tunnel test section.

AGARD-C is primarily used in the transonic wind tunnels and the database of published test results is somewhat smaller than the one for the AGARD-B model.

In order to reduce cost and produce more versatile wind tunnel models, actual designs of AGARD-B and AGARD-C are sometimes realized as an AGARD-B configuration to which a body segment with the T-tail can be attached at the rear end to form the AGARD-C configuration.

[[Image:Maciejowski Tower of Babel.jpg|thumb|right|A high medieval construction site from the [[Maciejowski Bible]].]]
'''''Artes Mechanicae''''' or '''mechanical arts''', are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts [[Artes liberales]]. Also called "servile" and "vulgar",&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cicero's''De Officiis'', Book I, xxlii.&lt;/ref&gt; from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.

==Overview==
[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: 
*''vestiaria'' ([[tailor]]ing, [[weaving]])
*''agricultura'' ([[agriculture]])
*''architectura'' ([[architecture]], [[masonry]])
*''militia''  and ''venatoria'' ([[war]]fare and [[hunting]], Military education, "[[martial arts]]")
*''mercatura'' ([[trade]])
*''coquinaria'' ([[cooking]])
*''metallaria'' ([[blacksmithing]], [[metallurgy]])&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Didascalicon]]'', [[Hugh of St Victor]] (12th century) includes [[navigation]], [[medicine]] and [[theatre|theatrical arts]] instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Hugues de Saint-Victor, ''Libri septem eruditiones didascaliae'', ch.26 (PL 176, col.760): lanificium, armaturum, navigationem, agriculturem, venationem, medicinam, theatricam&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.&lt;ref&gt;See Georges Legoff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'', (Chicago, University of Chicago Press) 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention of Art"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Dr. Larry | year = 2003 | pages = 28–30 |title=[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of the ''Artes Mechanicae'' as applied [[geometry]] was introduced to Western Europe by [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century "mechanic arts" referred to fields of which some are now known as [[engineering]].  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the [[performing arts]] and the [[fine arts]] which were for the upper class of the time, and the [[intelligentsia]].  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, "[[useful arts]]," or "applied arts" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

The most famous usage of the term "mechanic arts" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].

'''BIPU''' (Bioremediation Infield Personnel Unit) is a [[sanitation]] method suitable for [[disaster relief]] and for temporary or isolated locations. It consists of flat-packed plastic panels which fit together to make a box, which is buried in the ground, and a large plastic bag to be placed inside the box. It is quick to set up but also suitable for longer term use if required.[http://www.abc.net.au/newinventors/txt/s1206523.htm]

A [[latrine]], (Western style, or [[Asian Squatting position|squat]] style) pour-flush latrine, is placed over the top. The S-shaped [[water seal (plumbing)|water seal]] improves hygiene, compared to [[pit latrine]]s.

==Background==
The BIPU is manufactured and distributed by Poly Marketing Pty Limited.

'''Blistex''' is an American company that develops, produces, and markets personal care products. It began as a small family company in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blistex.com/about-blistex |title=About Blistex |publisher=Blistex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its focus was to develop and market lip care products in the United States. It then became a private [[company]] based in [[Oak Brook, Illinois|Oak Brook]], [[Illinois]] that primarily manufactures [[lip balm]], lip [[ointment]], and other [[lip]]-related products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imthemoisturizer.com/comparativa-balsamos-labiales |publisher= The Moisturizer | title=Comparativa: bálsamos labiales |accessdate=21 November 2018 |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also produces [[Antipruritic|anti-itch ointments]], moisturizing [[lotions]], the [[Odor-Eaters]] footcare product, and other skin care medications.

The head and guts are removed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |accessdate=30 March 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xteiARU46SQC&amp;pg=PA634|publisher=Springer|title=Food Chemistry|date= 27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[roe]] or [[milt]] remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=30 March 2011|url=http://www.cleysmokehouse.com/buckling.asp|title=Buckling|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706224038/http://www.cleysmokehouse.com/buckling.asp|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be eaten hot or cold.

==Origin==
The word may come from the German ''[[wikt:Bückling|Bückling]]'' or the Swedish ''böckling'', both words denoting a hot-smoked variety of the [[kipper]].

==Bucklings, bloaters and kippers==
Buckling is hot-smoked whole; bloaters are [[Smoking (cooking)#Types|cold-smoked]] whole; kippers are split and gutted, and then cold-smoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1195">A '''bureau à gradin''' is an antique [[desk]] form resembling a [[writing table]] with, in addition, one or several tiers of small drawers and pigeonholes built on part of the desktop surface.  Usually the drawers and pigeonholes directly face the user, but they can also surround three sides of the desk, as is the case for the [[Carlton house desk]] form. A small, portable version is a [[bonheur du jour]].

[[Image:Bureauagradinfrontjpeg20040111.png]][[Image:Bureau a gradin Sideview.PNG|250px]]

In some cases the bureau à gradin has a second tier of drawers under the work surface, and thus looks like an advanced form of the [[bureau Mazarin]] or like a non-enclosed version of the [[cylinder desk]], or the [[tambour desk]].

The '''Bygrave slide rule''' is a [[slide rule]] named for its inventor, Captain Leonard Charles Bygrave of the [[RAF]].  It was used in [[celestial navigation]], primarily in aviation. Officially, it was called the A. M. L. Position Line Slide Rule (A.M.L. for Air Ministry Laboratories).&lt;ref name = vanRiet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in 1920 at the Air Ministry Laboratories at Kensington in London and was produced by Henry Hughes &amp; Son Ltd of London until the mid-1930s. It solved the so-called celestial triangle accurately to about one minute of arc and quickly enough for aerial navigation.  The solution of the celestial triangle used the [[John Napier]] rules for solution of square-angled spherical triangles.  The slide rule was constructed as two coaxial tubes with spiral scales, like the Fuller slide rules, with yet another tube on the outside carrying the cursors.&lt;ref name = vanRiet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, a closely related version was produced in Germany by Dennert &amp; Pape as the HR1, MHR1 and HR2.&lt;ref name = vanRiet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous users ==
[[Sir Francis Chichester]] was a renowned aviator and yachtsman. He used a Bygrave Slide Rule as an aid to navigation during flights in the 1930s, one of which was the first solo flight from New Zealand to Australia in a [[Gipsy Moth]] biplane. He later completed a round the world cruise in his yacht [[Gipsy Moth IV]]. This was the first solo circumnavigation using the [[clipper route]]. Sir Francis Chichester wrote about these exploits in his autobiography, entitled The Lonely Sea and the Sky.&lt;ref name = "Chichester"&gt;{{cite book |title=''The Lonely Sea and the Sky'' |surname=Chichester |publisher=Summersdale Publishers |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''carrel desk''' is a small [[desk]] (usually) featuring high sides meant to visually isolate its user from any surroundings either partially or totally.&lt;ref name="Kiyo, Sige"/&gt;

== Description ==
Carrel desks are most often found in [[Academic library|academic libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Designing and space planning for libraries : a behavioral guide|author1= Aaron Coben|author2= Elaine Coban|publisher= R. R. Bowker Co|year= 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most carrel desks are rectangular in shape. Above the main desktop area there is often a shelf for books.&lt;ref name="Kiyo, Sige"&gt;{{Cite book|title= 図書館の家具と用品|trans-title= Library Supplies &amp; Furniture|language= Japanese|series= 図書館の仕事シリーズ|date= November 20, 1970|edition= 1|editor1= Kiyohide Jinno|editor2= Sigeru Takeuchi|publisher= Japan Libray Association|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the seat is integrated with the carrel desk. Unlike the [[cubicle desk]], carrel desks usually have no file drawers or other facilities. Since the late 1990s, some carrel desk designs provide [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC power]] and [[Ethernet]] receptacles for students using [[laptop computer]]s.&lt;ref name="Joan M. Reitz"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dictionary for library and information science|author= Joan M. Reitz|publisher= Libraries Unlimited|year= 2004|isbn= 1-56308-962-9|page= 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[school desk]], the carrel desk is normally produced and sold in large quantities for an institutional market. They are made to stand alone or to be grouped together, with or without common sides or walls.

The word carrel can also refer to a small isolated "study room" in [[public library|public libraries]] and on university campuses;&lt;ref name="Joan M. Reitz"/&gt; usually the room has a lockable door to which the user is granted the key on request. Carrels usually contain a desk (not necessarily one described as above), shelving and a [[Light fixture|lamp]].&lt;ref name="Joan M. Reitz"/&gt; Carrels are generally quite popular at universities and are therefore usually quickly occupied. This becomes especially true during mid-term examinations and [[final exam|finals]]. They have the advantage of power for a laptop (and often internet port) as well as generally being quieter than in the main library building. Carrels are also often used as temporary storage for books and materials the user is not finished with while they are at lectures or labs.

Carrels originated in [[monastery|monasteries]] to help contain the cacophony of roomfuls of [[monk]]s reading aloud, as was the early practice.&lt;ref&gt;Dom Le Clerq, Love of Learning and the Desire for God, trans. Catherine Misrahi (New York: Fordham University Press, 1961) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrels are first recorded in the 13th century at Westminster Abbey, London, on the garth side of the North Walk, though they probably existed from the late years of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Marshall Pratt, Westminster Abbey: Its Architecture, History and Monuments, Volume 2. Duffield (1914), p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica.  On line.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:DGPS Reference Station.jpg|thumb|Choke ring antenna at a [[Differential GPS|DGPS]] Reference Station]]&lt;/div&gt;
A '''choke ring antenna''' is a particular form of [[omnidirectional antenna]] for use at high frequencies.  It consists of a number of conductive [[concentric]] cylinders around a central antenna.  Due to its delicate construction, it is often enclosed in a protective cover or [[radome]] when placed outside and exposed to the elements.  

Choke ring antennas are notable for their ability to reject [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] signals fading from a source.  Since the path that a signal takes from a transmitter to receiver can be used to measure the distance between the two, this makes it highly suited for [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[radar]] applications.  In a GPS ground-based receiver, a choke ring antenna can provide millimeter precision measurements&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trimble.com/Infrastructure/Trimble-Choke-Ring-Antenna.aspx - Catalog page for a Trimble choke ring antenna.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[surveying]] and geological measurement applications.

The choke ring design originated at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.javad.com/jns/technology/Single-Depth%20Low-Multipath%20Choke%20Ring.html - A basic description of choke ring antenna benefits and limitations.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">'''External Machine Interface''' ('''EMI'''), an extension to '''Universal Computer Protocol''' ('''UCP'''), is a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] primarily used to connect to [[short message service centre]]s (SMSCs) for [[mobile telephone]]s.  The protocol was developed by [[CMG (company)|CMG]] Wireless Data Solutions, now part of [[Mavenir]].
==Syntax==

A typical EMI/UCP exchange looks like this :

  ^B01/00045/O/30/66677789///1//////68656C6C6F/CE^C
  ^B01/00041/R/30/A//66677789:180594141236/F3^C

The start of the [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] is signaled by ^B (STX, hex 02) and the end with ^C (ETX, hex 03).  Fields within the packet are separated by / characters.

The first four fields form the mandatory header.   the third is the ''operation type'' (O for operation, R for result), and the fourth is the ''operation'' (here 30, "short message transfer").

The subsequent fields are dependent on the operation.  In the first line above, '66677789' is the recipient's address ([[telephone number]]) and '68656C6C6F' is the content of the message, in this case the [[ASCII]] string "hello".  The second line is the response with a matching transaction reference number, where 'A' indicates that the message was successfully acknowledged by the SMSC, and a timestamp is suffixed to the phone number to show time of delivery.

The final field is the [[checksum]], calculated simply by summing all bytes in the packet (including slashes) and taking the 8 [[least significant bit]]s from the result.

The full specification is available on the LogicaCMG website developers' forum, but registration is required.

== Technical limitations ==

The two-digit ''transaction reference number'' means that an entity sending text messages can only have 100 outstanding messages (per session); this can limit performance, but only over a slow network and with incorrectly configured applications on one's SMSC (for example one session, with number of windows greater than 100). In practice it does not have any impact on delivery throughput.

The EMI UCP documentation specifies a default alphabet of [[ITU T.50 | IRA]] (eq ASCII on 7bit). In practice users default to the [[GSM_03.38|GSM-7]] alphabet, which is almost the same as ASCII on 7 bit, except for a few characters - for example '_' (underline).

== Alternatives ==

* [[Short message peer-to-peer protocol]] (SMPP) also provides [[Short message service|SMS]] over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]].
* [[CIMD|Computer Interface for Message Distribution (CIMD)]] developed by [[Nokia]]

The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is a global knowledge and technical assistance program administered by the World Bank. Its mission is to assist low- and middle-income countries to increase know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth.
 
Since its inception in 1983, ESMAP has supported more than 800 energy-sector activities that promote poverty reduction, economic growth and low carbon development in over 100 countries.

'''FOCUS AREAS'''
 
''Energy Security''
To help ensure long-term energy security, countries are looking closely at renewable energy, efficiency practices and technologies, diversification of supply, and improved sector performance. ESMAP assists its clients to carry out energy assessments and develop strategies to enhance sector planning, regulation, and governance.
 
''Energy Access''
About 1.4 billion of the world’s people still lack access to electricity, and poor households spend US$20 billion a year on low-quality, fuel-based lighting. Respiratory diseases are widespread among the 2.7 billion people who still rely on biomass for cooking, with women and children hit the hardest. ESMAP supports initiatives to reduce energy poverty by expanding access to modern, safe, affordable and sustainable energy services. ESMAP’s energy access work covers electrification and household energy needs in rural areas and for the urban poor.
 
''Climate Change''
Climate change will directly affect energy resource endowments, infrastructure, and transportation, as well as energy demand. ESMAP assists client countries to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation options into energy sector planning. ESMAP also supports the scale-up of renewable energy through resource assessments, strategy development, and policy and institutional development.

==History==
ESMAP was established in 1983 in response to the global [[energy crisis]] of the late 1970s, and the impact this was having on the economies of oil-importing developing countries. ESMAP has since operated in over 100 countries through more than 800 activities covering a broad range of energy issues.

==Role==
Starting in Fiscal Year 2014, ESMAP transitioned to a three-year business plan cycle.  This Business Plan sets out ESMAP’s objectives, priorities, strategies, and resource requirements for FY2014‐16 (i.e., July 2013 to June 2016). It draws on experience gained in implementing the previous Business Plan (ESMAP Strategic Business Plan 2008‐2013), consultations with the Consultative Group of donors, advice from the Technical Advisory Group, conclusions and recommendations of the External Evaluation of ESMAP conducted in 2011‐2012, and lessons learned from the annual ESMAP Portfolio Review.
 
Looking ahead, in the context of a rapidly changing global energy landscape, the primary objective for the international community is to achieve progress on the triple challenge of providing increased energy supply and security, eliminating energy poverty, and mitigating and adapting to climate change. Clearly, this can only be achieved with transformative changes in the design and management of national and regional energy systems and global efforts.

The proposed Business Plan will be based on the following principles:
 
Help shape the future.
Measure results and demonstrate impacts.
Provide value for money.
Ensure relevance to the Bank’s country sector dialogue and lending operations.
Working across sectors.
Scaling‐up to respond to increased client demand.
Increase support to low‐income countries, while maintaining engagement with middle‐income countries; and
Strengthen cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral development agencies

==Activities==
ESMAP's current work program comprises activities broken down into three broad categories: [[clean energy]], [[Energy poverty|energy access]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

==Governance==
ESMAP is governed by a Consultative Group (CG) made up of representatives from contributing donors and chaired by the Director of the Sustainable Energy Department of the World Bank, on behalf of the Vice President of the Sustainable Development Network. The CG meets annually to review the strategic directions of ESMAP, its achievements, and its use of resources and funding requirements.

An '''enhanced geothermal system''' ('''EGS''') generates [[geothermal electricity]] without the need for natural [[convection|convective]] hydrothermal resources. Until recently, geothermal power systems have exploited only resources where naturally occurring heat, water, and rock [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] are sufficient to allow energy extraction.&lt;ref name="utilization"&gt;{{Citation | last = Lund | first = John W. | date =June 2007 | title =Characteristics, Development and utilization of geothermal resources | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =28 | issue =2 | pages = 1–9 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull28-2/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by far most of geothermal energy within reach of conventional techniques [[Hot dry rock geothermal energy|is in dry and impermeable rock]].&lt;ref name="Duchane"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Duchane | first1 = Dave | last2 = Brown | first2 = Don | date =December 2002 | title =Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Energy Research and Development at Fenton Hill, New Mexico | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =23 | issue =4 | pages = 13–19 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull23-4/art4.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; EGS technologies enhance and/or create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock (HDR) through 'hydraulic stimulation'.
{{Renewable energy}}

==Overview==
When natural cracks and pores do not allow economic flow rates, the [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] can be enhanced by pumping high-pressure cold water down an [[injection well]] into the rock. The injection increases the fluid pressure in the naturally fractured rock, triggering shear events that enhance the system's permeability. As long as the injection pressure is maintained, a high matrix permeability is not required, nor are [[hydraulic fracturing proppants]] required to maintain the fractures in an open state.  This process is termed hydro-shearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pierce| first = Brenda | title = Geothermal Energy Resources| publisher = National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) | date = 2010-02-16| url = http://www.narucmeetings.org/Presentations/NARUC%20Pierce%20Geothermal%20presentation.pdf| format = PowerPoint| accessdate = 2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps to differentiate it from [[Hydraulic fracturing|hydraulic tensile fracturing]], used in the oil and gas industry, which can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cichon| first = Meg | title = Is Fracking for Enhanced Geothermal Systems the Same as Fracking for Natural Gas?| publisher = RenewableEnergyWorld.com  | date = 2013-07-16| url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/07/is-fracking-for-enhanced-geothermal-systems-the-same-as-fracking-for-natural-gas| accessdate = 2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water travels through fractures in the rock, capturing the rock's heat until forced out of a second borehole as very hot water. The water's heat is converted into [[electricity]] using either a [[steam turbine]] or a [[binary power plant system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/egs_animation.html&lt;/ref&gt; All of the water, now cooled, is injected back into the ground to heat up again in a [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop]].

EGS technologies can function as baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day. Unlike hydrothermal, EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep [[granite]] covered by a {{convert|3|-|5|km}} layer of insulating sediments that slow heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.org.au/events/conferences-and-workshops/australiachina/raham.pdf 20 slide presentation inc geothermal maps of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; An EGS plant is expected to have an economical lifetime of 20-30 years using current technology.&lt;ref name="INEL"/&gt;

EGS systems are currently being developed and tested in [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Switzerland]].  The largest EGS project in the world is a 25-[[megawatt]] demonstration plant currently being developed in [[Cooper Basin]], Australia.  Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;MW.

==Research and development==

===Australia===
The Australian government has provided research funding for the development of Hot Dry Rock technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/energy%20programs/cei/acre/gdp/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2007, then Australian opposition environmental spokesperson and former [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts]] [[Peter Garrett]]  announced that if elected at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian Federal Election]], the [[Australian Labor Party]] would use taxpayer money to subsidise putting the necessary drilling rigs in place. In an interview, he promised:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are some technical difficulties and challenges there, but those people who are keen on getting Australia into geothermal say we've got this great access to resource and one of the things, interestingly, that's held them back is not having the capacity to put the drilling plants in place. And so what we intend this $50 million to go towards is to provide one-for-one dollars. Match [[Australian dollar|$1]] from us, $1 from the industry so that they can get these drilling rigs on to site and really get the best sites identified and get the industry going."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2007/s1938273.htm "Garrett discusses Labor's stance on climate change"], ''Lateline'', 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===European Union===
The EU's EGS R&amp;D project at [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]], France, has recently connected its 1.5&amp;nbsp;MW demonstration plant to the grid. The Soultz project has explored the connection of multiple stimulated zones and the performance of triplet well configurations (1 injector/2 producers).&lt;ref&gt;See French Wikipedia: [[:fr:Soultz-sous-Forêts|Soultz-sous-Forêts]] — Soultz is in the Alsace région of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Induced seismicity in Basel]] led to the cancellation of the EGS project there.

The Portuguese government awarded, in December 2008, an exclusive license to Geovita Ltd to prospect and explore geothermal energy in one of the best areas in continental Portugal. An area of about 500 square kilometers is being studied by Geovita together with the Earth Sciences department of the University of Coimbra's Science and Technology faculty, and the installation of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is foreseen.

==== United Kingdom ====
Cornwall is set to host a 3MW demonstration project, based at the Eden Project, that could pave the way for a series of 50-MW commercial-scale geothermal power stations in suitable areas across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title =Tories pledge support for deep geothermal energy projects  | work =New Energy Focus  | publisher =www.newenergyfocus.com  | date =May 15, 2009  | url =http://newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco.py/view_item?listid=1&amp;listcatid=32&amp;listitemid=2641&amp;section=Carbon%2CIndustry%2COn-site%20%26%20Micro  | accessdate =2009-06-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title =Geothermal power plant that could run 5,000 British homes to be built in Cornwall  | work =Daily Mail  | publisher =Associated Newspapers Ltd | date =June 2, 2009  | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1190107/Geothermal-power-plant-run-5-000-British-homes-built-Cornwall.html  | accessdate =2009-06-11 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Early days — Fenton Hill====
{{main|Hot dry rock geothermal energy}}
The first EGS effort — then termed Hot Dry Rock — took place at Fenton Hill, New Mexico with a project run by the federal Los Alamos Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tester|2006|pp=4–7 to 4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first attempt to make a deep, full-scale EGS reservoir.

The EGS reservoir at Fenton Hill was first completed in 1977 at a depth of about 2.6&amp;nbsp;km, with rock temperatures of 185 C. In 1979 the reservoir was enlarged with additional hydraulic stimulation and was operated for about 1 year. The results demonstrated that heat could be extracted at reasonable rates from a hydraulically stimulated region of low-permeability hot crystalline rock. In 1986, a second reservoir was prepared for initial hydraulic circulation and heat extraction testing. In a 30-day flow test with a constant reinjection temperature of 20 C, the production temperature steadily increased to about 190 C, corresponding to a thermal power level of about 10 MW. Due to budget cuts, further study at Fenton Hill was discontinued.

==== Working at the edges—using EGS technology to improve hydrothermal resources ====
EGS funding languished for the next few years, and by the next decade, US efforts focused on the less ambitious goal of improving the productivity of existing hydrothermal resources. According to the  fiscal year 2004 Budget Request to Congress from DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,
&lt;ref name=FY2004DOE&gt;
{{Cite conference

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|
EGS are engineered reservoirs that have been created to extract heat from economically unproductive geothermal resources. EGS technology includes those methods and equipment that enhance the removal of energy from a resource by increasing the productivity of the reservoir. Better productivity may result from improving the reservoir’s natural permeability and/or providing additional fluids to transport heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FY2004DOE|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In fiscal year 2002, preliminary designs for five projects employing EGS technology were completed and the Coso Hot Springs geothermal field at the US Naval Weapons Air Station in China Lake, California was selected for full-scale development. Two additional projects were selected for preliminary analysis at Desert Peak in Nevada and Glass Mountain in California. Funding for this effort totaled $1.5 million. The effort was continued in 2003 with an additional $3.5 million.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FY2004DOE|2003|pp=131–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, The US Department of Energy ([[USDOE]]) issued two [[Funding Opportunity Announcement]]s (FOAs) related to enhanced geothermal systems. Together, the two FOAs offered up to $84 million over six years.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOE followed up with another FOA in 2009, of stimulus funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act for $350 million, including $80 million aimed specifically at EGS projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== FORGE ====
In February 2014, the Department of Energy announced the intent to establish "a dedicated subsurface laboratory called the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/news_detail.html?news_id=21286 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324225912/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/news_detail.html?news_id=21286 |archivedate=2015-03-24 |date=February 21, 2014 |title=DOE Announces Notice of Intent for EGS Observatory |author=Geothermal Technologies Office |publisher=Department of Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to investigate and develop enhanced geothermal technology. In August 2016, it was announced that the proposed sites had been narrowed to two (in Utah and Nevada), expected to be reduced to one the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-29-million-investment-enhanced-geothermal-systems-efforts|title=Energy Department Announces $29 Million Investment in Enhanced Geothermal Systems Efforts|last=|first=|date=Aug 31, 2016|website=|publisher=Department of Energy|location=Washington, DC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2018, the selected site will host the FORGE laboratory, which will provide annual solicitations for research to be performed there.

==Induced seismicity==
{{Main|Induced seismicity}}
Some induced seismicity is inevitable and expected in EGS, which involves pumping fluids at pressure to enhance or create permeability through the use of hydro-shearing and hydraulic fracturing techniques. Hydro-shear stimulation methods seek to expand and extend the connectivity of the rock's existing fractures to create a better fluid network for the transfer of heat from the rock to the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tester|2006|pp=4–5 to 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tester|2006|pp=8–9 to 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismicity events at the Geysers geothermal field in California have been strongly correlated with injection data.&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0t19709v The Impact of Injection on Seismicity at The Geysers Geothermal Field&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[induced seismicity in Basel]] merits special mention; it led the city (which is a partner) to suspend the project and conduct a seismic hazard evaluation, which resulted in the cancellation of the project in December 2009.&lt;ref name=NYTswiss&gt;{{Citation

  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/science/earth/11basel.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Australian government, risks associated with "hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes, and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring" and "should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the Hot Rock geothermal energy resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA11478.pdf |title=Induced Seismicity and Geothermal Power Development in Australia |author=Geoscience Australia |date= |publisher=Australian Government |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143551/http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA11478.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the risks of induced seismicity vary from site to site and should be considered before large scale fluid injection is begun.

==CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; EGS==
The Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence at the University of Queensland has been awarded [[AUD]] 18.3 million for EGS research, a large portion of which will be used to develop CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; EGS technologies.

Research conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories examined the use of [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], instead of water, as the geothermal working fluid, with favorable results. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has numerous advantages for EGS:
:#Greater power output
:#Minimized parasitic losses from pumping and cooling
:#Carbon sequestration
:#Minimized water use
:#CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a much lower tendency to dissolve minerals and other substances than water, which greatly reduces scaling and corrosion of system components
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is, however, much more expensive and somewhat more difficult to work with than water.

==EGS potential in the United States==
[[Image:Geothermal energy methods.png|thumb|right|[[Geothermal power]] technologies.]]
A 2006 report by [[MIT]],&lt;ref name="INEL"/&gt; and funded by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], conducted the most comprehensive analysis to date on the potential and technical status of EGS. The 18-member panel, chaired by Professor Jefferson Tester of MIT, reached several significant conclusions:
# Resource size: The report calculated the United States total EGS resources from 3–10&amp;nbsp;km of depth to be over 13,000&amp;nbsp;[[joule|zettajoules]], of which over 200&amp;nbsp;ZJ would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2,000&amp;nbsp;ZJ with technology improvements — sufficient to provide all the world's current energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Tester | first=Jefferson W. ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]) | title=The Future of Geothermal Energy – Impact of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) on the United States in the 21st Century| date= | year=2006 | publisher=Idaho National Laboratory | location=Idaho Falls | isbn=0-615-13438-6 | pages= | url = http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf| format = 14MB PDF | accessdate=2007-02-07 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that total geothermal resources, including hydrothermal and geo-pressured resources, to equal 14,000 ZJ — or roughly 140,000 times the total U.S. annual primary energy use in 2005.
# Development potential: With an R&amp;D investment of $1 billion over 15 years, the report estimated that 100&amp;nbsp;GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more could be installed by 2050 in the United States. The report further found that "recoverable" resources (accessible with today's technology) were between 1.2–12.2&amp;nbsp;TW for the conservative and moderate recovery scenarios respectively.
# Cost: The report found that EGS could be capable of producing electricity for as low as 3.9 cents/kWh. EGS costs were found to be sensitive to four main factors:
## Temperature of the resource
## Fluid flow through the system measured in liters/second
## Drilling costs
## Power conversion efficiency

Luftwaffe SIS).&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7sNVKDp-yiJQVMyMVJDNm9BcGs/edit|title=IF-175 Searbourne Report Vol XIII |publisher=TICOM |format=PDF |access-date=11 March 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alvarez |first=David |date=9 January 2008 |title=Diplomatic solutions: German foreign office cryptanalysis, 1919–1945 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850609608435314 |journal=International Journal of Intelligence and Counter Intelligence |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=169–185 |doi=10.1080/08850609608435314 |access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
During [[World War I]] he served as a volunteer. Later he studied [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] at various German universities, finally specializing in Philology. Using his language skills, he started work in an export business. Eventually moving abroad for several years, but returned in the summer of 1935, when he was offered a position as an [[interpreter]] with the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|German Air Ministry]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Military Work==
Between July and September 1935, he undertook training near [[Kladow]], near [[Berlin]] in [[Morse code|Morse]] [[Telegraphy]] ([[Wireless telegraphy]]), German cryptographic procedures and [[radio]] communications. In October 1935, he posted to a fixed intercept station of the Army at [[Stuttgart]] until January 1936. During his time there, he translated plain-language radio messages from French Army and Air Force. In addition, he was employed on evaluation and traffic analysis. Between March and April 1936, he was ordered to a two months maneuver employed as an airborne radio operators with KG254 in [[Kitzingen]]. His grade during this time was [[Officer candidate]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

===First Success===
From May to October 15 he succeeded in breaking the [[Multiple encryption|recipherment]] used in conjunction with a French 3 digit code, the basis of which had already been largely reconstructed. The recipherment was one with a number-letter cipher table. After the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he solved many 4-alphabetic [[Substitution cipher]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

On the 15th October, Voegele was transferred to a new Luftwaffe Intercept Station (Codename:W-15) ([[Stadelheim Transmitter]]) close to [[Munich]], where he translated [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

===Chi-Stelle===
On the 1st January 1937, he was assigned to the newly created cipher bureau (German: [[Chi-Stelle]]) within Referat K and made Chief of all cryptanalytic work ([[Cryptanalysis]]). He was assigned as an assistant, [[Edward Von Lingen]] who had learned [[Red Army|Russian Army]] cryptanalysis while at the German Army intercept station in [[Treuenbrietzen]]. When Voegele joined Chi-Stelle it consisted of 12 people.

During the remainder of the year, Voegele worked on Spanish cyphers as part of monitoring the Republicans in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He also worked on several Czechoslovakian bigraphic procedures ([[Polygraphic substitution]]), and on breaking the Czechoslovakian Air Force [[Transposition cipher|double-transposition]], where the message count only amounted to 10-25 messages per day.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

Voegele was known to have worked on a number of cyphers during the course of the war. These included the Government Telegraph Code, India Code, Syko, the RAF 4-digit code, Aircraft Movement Code in Autumn 1942, Bomber Code in Winter 1942, January 1943, Slidex in May 1943,  Aircraft Reporting Code from July 1943, UCO Weather Code from May 1944 and Weather Codes throughout the war. Typex was attempted by Voegele in the early 1940s.
 
Little was known about Ferdinand Voegele after the end of the war.

'''Fredrik Rosing Bull''' (25 December 1882 – 7 June 1925) was an [[information technology]] pioneer, known for his work on improved [[punched card]] machines.

Bull was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (Oslo, Norway).  In 1907 he finished his studies in civil engineering at the Technical School of Kristiania ([[Technical School of Kristiania|Kristiania Tekniske Skole]]).&lt;ref name=hio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iu.hio.no/~ulfu/historie/bull/index.html|title=Fredrik Rosing Bull |first=Ulf |last=Uttersrud |publisher=Høgskolen i Oslo|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he was hired as a technical inspector for the insurance company Storebrand, where he developed an interest for [[punched card]] machines technology and began developing one of his own. In 1919 he obtained a patent for the machine, and in 1921 he prepared a team that took over the implementation of the machine at the company where Bull worked at that time, [[Storebrand]]. This team provided several new ideas for improving the Bull machine, rendering it superior to [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith's]] device - the precursor to the IBM punched card machine - in use at that time. Bull continued to develop his ideas, improving the machine, which became a success throughout Europe. He was diagnosed with cancer at an early age and died in 1925 when he was 42 years old. His patents were later sold in 1931 and constituted the basis for the founding of the French company [[Groupe Bull]], a large information technology company operating in over 100 countries.

== Family ==
Fredrik Bull was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (the present-day Oslo) to [[Ole Bornemann Bull (physician)|Dr. Ole Bornemann Bull]] (1842–1916) and his first wife [[Marie Cathrine Lund]] (1843–1884).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bull, Anders Henrik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Anders Krogvig|Krogvig, Anders]] |editor3=[[Gerhard Gran|Gran, Gerhard]]|edition=1|first=Georg|last=Brochmann|authorlink=Georg Brochmann|year=1925|volume=2|pages=374|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ole Bull was a renowned eye doctor. He collaborated with [[Gerhard Armauer Hansen]] who discovered ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'', the causative agent of [[leprosy]], while investigating the effects of leprosy on the eyes. He is also known for having developed a method to determine the degree of sensation of color.

Fredrik was raised in a large family. He was the eighth of fifteen children. The Bull family had a passion for technology and science:  all of Fredrik's older brothers were engineers. His brother [[Anders Henrik Bull]] is known for his studies in wireless [[radiotelegraphy]].

== Education ==
Fredrik Rosing Bull began his studies in civil engineering at the reputable [[Technical School of Kristiania]] in 1904 and graduated in 1907.&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;  He scored some of the best marks of class.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Storebrand ==
In 1916 he was hired as a technical inspector at the insurance company [[Storebrand]] where he came into contact with the [[tabulating machine]]s of those days.&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;

The [[punched card]]s and the [[tabulating machine]]s were initially developed by the U.S. engineer [[Herman Hollerith]] and were used for first time in Norway by [[Statistics Norway]] in 1894.

Fredrik Bull was sent abroad to study Hollerith's systems, returning with the conviction that Hollerith's systems were expensive and unstable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} He was convinced that he could develop a device that was cheaper and more efficient than Hollerith's. As a result, Bull convinced his employer, Storebrand, to pay him an advance of $10,000 to develop a new machine.  The terms of the deal required the advance to be repaid in full if the machine was not successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Bull's plan was to use electromagnetic technology like Hollerith, but with a considerable number of improvements. The use of 45 column [[punched card]]s enabled the machine to read the information while making contact through the holes. This method allowed faster processing of the information. The existing machines in use at that time required significant manual intervention to operate.  Bull made several improvements to automate processing such as standardization of punched-cards and pre-selection.

== Bull's first machine ==
Bull needed almost 2 years to turn his ideas into a finished product.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The machine was presented to the [[Storebrand]] directors at his workshop on 12 January 1921 and subsequently purchased for the sum of 20,000&amp;nbsp;pounds on 21 January 1921. The machine was not a success because it was not as efficient, stable and reliable as expected. However, it was in operation until 1926.&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;

Around the same time Bull contacted an old friend named [[Reidar Knutsen]] from high school in [[Nordstrand, Norway|Nordstrand]],  who headed the company A/S Oka. Through Reidar he met [[Knut Andreas Knutsen]], Reidar's younger brother, who was an engineer, and he and Bull began collaborating.

== The Bull machine ==
On 31 July 1919 Bull obtained a patent for his design. The patent describes in detail his idea of a programmable [[tabulating machine]]. The new machine itself was not completed until 1923 and was referred to as a 'ordering, recording and adding machine'.  After its initial success Bull  undertook the production of new copies of his T-30 machine, adding improvements as he went. Several insurance companies in Denmark showed interest in the technology.

Fredrik then signed a contract the Oka company led by [[Reidar Knutsen]], which assumed the costs of manufacturing and marketing. The production of these machines was in a precision workshop in [[Oslo|Kristiania]].&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;

The Bull machine used [[punched card]] of 45 columns, with round holes and a rotating adder. His machine was substantially better than its competition, [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith]] and Powers, through the mechanism of [[punched card]] pre-selection.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The machine proved a success and received very good reviews and publicity{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The key factors for success were:  the technical quality of the machine,the ease of use, the new pre-selection technology, the cost savings and the opportunity for users to avoid [[IBM]]'s monopoly and purchase their own equipment instead of renting it.

== Other patents ==
Bull continued working on improvements for the machine and also in developing new machines such as a sorting machine and a new [[tabulating machine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Some of the notable improvements were: the change of switches that controlled the entry of [[punched card]]s and the expansion device in larger scale.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The reading device was the most critical part of the machine. Built with electrical conductors or springs, [[punched card]]s were introduced, the springs passed through the holes producing contact. The springs only passed through the holes of the [[punched cards]], causing the information to be recorded. He obtained the ideas for this machine by stealing the notes of Henrik Hartzner, his Danish partner.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} One of the main problems of this method was the low durability of the material of the cards, which meant that the method did not always work the right way. Another major problem was the dust that entered the holes of the contacts. Finally, one of the biggest problems Bull and Knutsen had to face was that because of the contacts, sparks were created causing the machine to crash frequently. All these details were being constantly improved.

Production of Bull machines was rather slow. In 1921 there was a production of 2 machines, 2 in 1922, 2 in 1923, 4 to 1924 and 6 in 1925, distributed among companies in Norway, Denmark ([[Hafnia (company)|Hafnia]] as a notable client), Finland and Switzerland. There were constant problems with the machines; Knut Andreas Knutsen was continuously traveling to these countries for repair and modifications at client sites.&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;

== Illness and death ==
In the summer of 1924 Bull was diagnosed with [[cancer]], a disease that ended his life on 7 June 1925 when Bull was only 42 years old.

Despite the diagnosis in the summer of 1924, Bull continued to work until his condition worsened in the fall of that year.  In the last few days he shared his latest ideas with Knutsen. Bull's patent rights were acquired by Oka, where Knutsen, loyal to the ideas of Bull, continued the improvement of the machine and the expansion of the company. Knutsen focused on new designs to record tabulation results on paper forms, sorted numerically and alphabetically. He was the first to use printing wheel methods.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Groupe Bull ==
The years following Bull's death, 1926, 1927 and 1928 were years of difficulty but also of joys and surprises. The machines installed and leased to Swiss companies had attracted great interest in Switzerland. In 1927, the Belgian [[Emile Genon]] bought the patents to operate in the European continent (excluding Scandinavia). In 1928 he got in agreement with the Swiss company [[HW Egli]] in order to produce Bull machines. Production began in 1929.&lt;ref name=hio /&gt;

Later [[Emile Genon|Genon]], aware of the improvements Knutsen was bringing in Scandinavia also tried to improve on his patents, the technology of the vertical sorting machine and printing. He finally hired Knutsen who was given the place of chief engineer of HW Egli. This was accepted by Knutsen with the condition of the company to moving to France where there was more to reach the market. So, in 1931 [[HW Egli - Bull]] based in Paris was founded. Two years later, in 1933, the company underwent a reorganization and suffered a name change, [[Compagnie des Machines Bull]], the current [[Groupe Bull]]. Knutsen continued as chief engineer until his retirement in 1958.

The 2014 convention in [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Brekeley]] attracted more than 700 Iranian [[high-tech]] executives and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="EETimes 2010"&gt;{{cite web | last=Merritt | first=Rick  | title=Entrepreneurs Seek Bridge to Iran | website=[[EE Times]] | date=2014-09-08  | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323799 | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2015 convention in [[Berlin]] is called "the largest gathering of Iranians outside the country in more than three decades".&lt;ref name="The Washingtion Times 2015"&gt;{{cite web| last=Sands | first=David R. | title=U.S. allies not waiting for Iran’s sanctions to come down | website=[[The Washington Times]] | date=2015-05-27 | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/27/us-rivals-not-waiting-for-irans-sanctions-to-come-/ | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was held from June 4-6, 2015 at the new Berlin CityCube convention center. The event included 117 sessions with 163 speakers, and 1,040 registered participants from 35 countries. [[Dave McClure]], one of 2015 attendees, counts the large population of Iran and its educated population as potential for startups in the country.&lt;ref name="Dehghan"/&gt; The official final and detailed [http://ibridges.org/ibridge-berlin-2015-report/ report] of the iBridge Berlin was released by organizer in October 2015.

The convention is also implicitly aimed at bridging the gap in [[international relations]]hip between Iran and western countries,&lt;ref name="Burrows"&gt;{{cite web | last=Burrows | first=Mathew J. | title=Diversity Is America's 21st Century Strength | website=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=2014-08-20 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mathew-j-burrows/diversity-is-americas-21s_b_5695593.html | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially at the time of diplomatic negotiations between Iran and western countries on [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="Dehghan"/&gt;

The next iBridge will be held on December 8-10, 2016 in Barcelona, Spain.

'''Information and communication technology in agriculture''' ('''ICT in agriculture'''), also known as '''[[e-agriculture]]''', is developing and applying innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture. ICT in agriculture offers a wide range of solutions to some agricultural challenges. It is seen as an emerging field focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. In this context, ICT is used as an umbrella term encompassing all information and communication technologies including devices, networks, mobiles, services and applications; these range from innovative Internet-era technologies and sensors to other pre-existing aids such as fixed telephones, televisions, radios and satellites. E-agriculture continues to evolve in scope as new ICT applications continue to be harnessed in the agriculture sector. More specifically, e-agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture. Provisions of standards, norms, methodologies, and tools as well as development of individual and institutional capacities, and policy support are all key components of e-agriculture.

== Recognition and application ==
E-agriculture is one of the action lines identified in the declaration and plan of action of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS). The "Tunis Agenda for the Information Society," published on 18 November 2005 and emphasizes the leading facilitating roles that UN agencies need to play in the implementation of the Geneva Plan of Action. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([[FAO]]) has been assigned the responsibility of organizing activities related to the action line under C.7 ICT Applications on E-Agriculture.

Many ICT interventions have been developed and tested around the world, with varied degrees of success, to help agriculturists improve their livelihoods through increased agricultural productivity and incomes, and reduction in risks. Some useful resources for learning about e-agriculture in practice are the World Bank’s e-sourcebook ICT in agriculture – connecting smallholder farmers to knowledge, networks and institutions (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictinagriculture.org/|title=World Bank’s e-sourcebook ICT in agriculture – connecting smallholder farmers to knowledge, networks and institutions (2011)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=9 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320081526/http://www.ictinagriculture.org/|archivedate=20 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq078e/aq078e.pdf|title=ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3557e/i3557e.pdf|title=Information and communication technologies for sustainable agriculture (2013)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Success stories on information and communication technologies for agriculture and rural development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4622e.pdf|title=Success stories on information and communication technologies for agriculture and rural development|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented many cases of use of ICT in agriculture.



The FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5564e.pdf|title=FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide|date=20 May 2016|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by the [http://www.fao.org Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)] and the [http://www.itu.int International Telecommunication Union (ITU)] with support from partners including the   [http://www.cta.int Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)] as a framework for countries in developing their national e-agriculture strategy/masterplan.

Some of the countries who are using the FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide to develop their national e-agriculture strategy are [[Bhutan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Philippines]], [[Fiji]] and [[Vanuatu]]. The guide provides a framework to engage broader stakeholders in the development of national e-agriculture strategy.

==Wireless technologies==
[[Wireless]] technologies have numerous applications in agriculture.  One major usage is the simplification of [[closed-circuit television]] camera systems; the use of wireless communications eliminates the need for the installation of [[coaxial cable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agricamera.co.uk/wireless-camera-systems|title=Wireless Camera Systems|publisher=AgriCamera|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Positioning System (GPS) ==
[[File:GPS Receivers 2007.jpg|thumb|GPS Receivers]] In agriculture, the use of the [[Global Positioning System]] provides benefits in [[Geofencing|geo-fencing]], [[Map making|map-making]] and [[surveying]]. GPS receivers dropped in price over the years, making it more popular for civilian use. With the use of GPS, civilians can produce simple yet highly accurate digitized map without the help of a professional [[cartographer]].

In [[Kenya]], for example, the solution to prevent an elephant bull from wandering into farms and destroying precious crops was to tag the elephant with a device that sends a text message when it crosses a geo-fence. Using the technology of [[SMS]] and GPS, the elephant can roam freely and the authorities are alerted whenever it is near the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/11/tech/main4515365.shtml|title=Kenya Uses Text Messages To Track Elephant|date=11 February 2009|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic information systems==
[[Geographic information system]]s, or [[Geographic information system|GiS]], are extensively used in agriculture, especially in [[Precision agriculture|precision farming]]. Land is mapped digitally, and pertinent geodetic data such as topography and contours are combined with other statistical data for easier analysis of the soil. GIS is used in decision making such as what to plant and where to plant using historical data and sampling.

==Computer-controlled devices (automated systems)==

[[File:DeLaval milking station.jpg|thumb|DeLaval milking station]] [[Automatic milking]] systems are computer controlled stand alone systems that milk the dairy cattle without human labor. The complete automation of the milking process is controlled by an [[agricultural robot]], a complex herd management software, and specialized computers. Automatic milking eliminates the farmer from the actual milking process, allowing for more time for supervision of the farm and the herd. Farmers can also improve herd management by using the data gathered by the computer. By analyzing the effect of various [[Fodder|animal feeds]] on milk yield, farmers may adjust accordingly to obtain optimal milk yields. Since the data is available down to individual level, each cow may be tracked and examined, and the farmer may be alerted when there are unusual changes that could mean sickness or injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automaticmilking.nl/|title=EU-Project Automatic milking|date=20 February 2008|publisher=Wageningen UR|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220145319/http://www.automaticmilking.nl/|archivedate=20 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smartphone mobile apps in agriculture==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The use of mobile technologies as a tool of intervention in agriculture is becoming increasingly popular.  Smartphone penetration enhances the multi-dimensional positive impact on sustainable poverty reduction and identify accessibility as the main challenge in harnessing the full potential (Silarszky et al., 2008) in agricultural space.  The reach of smartphone even in rural areas extended the ICT services beyond simple voice or text messages. Several smartphone apps are available  for agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and farm machinery.

==RFID==

[[File:Swiss cow ear with eartags.jpg|thumb|Swiss cow ear with eartag and RFID]] The Veterinary Department of [http://www.moa.gov.my/web/guest/home Malaysia's Ministry of Agriculture] introduced a livestock-tracking program in 2009 to track the estimated 80,000 cattle all across the country. Each cattle is tagged with the use of  [[RFID|RFID technology]] for easier identification, providing access to relevant data such as: bearer's location, name of breeder, origin of livestock, sex, and dates of movement. This program is the first of its kind in Asia, and is expected to increase the competitiveness of Malaysian livestock industry in international markets by satisfying the regulatory requirements of importing countries like United States, Europe and Middle East. Tracking by RFID will also help producers meet the dietary standards by the [[halal]] market. The program will also provide improvements in controlling disease outbreaks in livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidnews.org/2009/04/06/malaysia-begins-rfid-enabled-livestock-tracking-program|title=Malaysia begins RFID-enabled livestock tracking program|date=6 April 2009|publisher=RFIDNews|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frost.com/sublib/display-market-insight-top.do?id=203619979|title=RFID in Malaysia – Tracing the ROI|last=Sebastian|first=Richard|date=7 June 2010|publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Union of Food Science and Technology''' ('''IUFoST''') ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|j|uː||f|ɒ|s|t}} {{respell|EYE|yoo-fost}}) is the global scientific organization and voice for food science and technology representing more than 200,000 food scientists and technologists from over 70 countries. It is a voluntary, non-profit association of national food science organizations. IUFoST is a full scientific member of the established in 1962, devoted to the advancement of,&lt;ref&gt;(ICSU) [[International Council for Science]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of only 31 scientific unions worldwide and the only global representative of food science and technology to notable organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations, [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[CODEX Alimentarius]] and [[International Life Sciences Institute]] (ILSI).

==IUFoST's Mission and Principles==

IUFoST's vision is to '''Strengthen Global Food Science and Technology for Humanity'''.

IUFoST's mission is to promote international co-operation and information exchange, to provide education and training to food scientists and technologists around the world and to promote professionalism and profession organization among food scientists and technologists.

==Background==
The feasibility of establishing an international organization of food scientists and technologists dedicated to the nutritional needs of the people of the world was informally explored during the First International Congress of Food Science and Technology (1962) held in London. The President of the Congress was Lord Rank who crystallised informal discussions that had already been taking place among a number of food scientists from around the world when he stated in his presidential message: "If the potentialities of ... food science and technology are to ... culminate and nutritionally adequate, then there must be international collaboration." From the Congress emerged the International Committee of Food Science and Technology.

The work of this Committee culminated in the formal inauguration of the International Union of Food Science and Technology during the Third International Congress of Food Science and Technology convened in 1970 in Washington, DC, USA. The 1970 meeting in Washington, DC, USA was referred to as "SOS/70" with SOS referring to Science and Survival.

==NATO's Involvement in the Conception of IUFoST==
In 1960, several British scientific societies and the UK Government organised a conference in London in recognition of the Centenary of the 1860 Food and Drugs Act (UK). It was also the 150th anniversary of Appert's publication on the preservation of foods in sealed containers.

In the week prior to the Food and Drugs conference, Professor John Hawthorn convened a symposium on Recent Advances in Food Science at the Glasgow Royal College of Science and Technology, which later metamorphosed into Strathclyde University. [The proceedings, edited by Professor Hawthorn and a colleague J. Muil Leitch, were published in 1962 by Butterworths]. The Glasgow symposium, to which food scientists from many nations were invited, was financed by a substantial grant from the Office of the Science Adviser to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO. During the 1950s and 1960s NATO evinced a significant interest in food technology. The food and nutrition research laboratory in Toronto, of which I was director, carried out an extensive study for NATO on the bulk storage of food grains examining alternative methods conducive to stockpiling at dispersed sites.

One evening following dinner during the Glasgow symposium, Professors Hawthorn and EC Bate-Smith invited a group to meet to discuss the concept of an international food science society. The discussion was splendidly stimulated by Professor Hawthorn's supply of malt whiskey from a Hebridean distillery. The group included Emil Mark and George Stewart from Davis, California, a fellow Canadian Bill Geddes, Dean of Agricultural Biochemistry at the University of Minnesota, Professor H D Kay from the dairy research institute at Reading, Tim Anson, an American employed with the Lever Organisation. Sadly I am the last survivor of that Glasgow group.

The notion of international scientific societies was not unique. ICSU, its predecessor and the supporting family of national academies and scientific unions had existed since 1919. The Glasgow group was of the opinion, however, that the time was ripe to create an international food science society, since several national food science and technology institutes were in existence. Our British hosts undertook to pursue the idea and the result was the food science congress convened in London in 1962, the first of the series of which China will be the host to the 14th.

The subsequent history of IUFoST is amply recorded in the archives, but perhaps not everyone is aware of NATO's early intervention.

==The Budapest Declaration==
In response to a shift in research focus among food scientists and technologists towards combating chronic hunger problems in the less developed world, IUFoST released its ‘Budapest Declaration’ during its 7th General Assembly in Budapest, Hungary, 1995. Referencing the Joint FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition (Rome, 1992) and its World Declaration on Nutrition, IUFoST declared its determination to minimize hunger and to reduce all forms of malnutrition throughout the world. To do this, IUFoST declared its commitment to work with all other organisations to ensure sustained nutritional well-being for all people in a peaceful, just and environmentally safe world. The declaration further recognised the central role of food science and technology in ensuring the year-round availability of the quantity and variety of safe and wholesome foods necessary to meet the nutritional needs of the world's growing population. This declaration would guide IUFoST’s working policy for the next fifteen years.

==The Cape Town Declaration==
During 2010’s 13th General Assembly of IUFoST in Cape Town, South Africa, the IUFoST General Assembly adopted the '''"Cape Town Declaration"''' setting out its commitments to food safety, food security and food science education. It recognized the previous work that had been conducted since the Budapest Declaration while outlining a policy for IUFoST future work with the global food science and technology industry.

==Membership==
Membership in the International Union of Food Science and Technology is open to all nations on the basis of one representative body from each nation or defined territory. IUFoST represents more than 200,000 food scientists and technologists worldwide through its Adhering Bodies. This also includes regional groups in Western Africa (WAAFoST) West African Association of Food Science and Technology, Europe (EFFoST) &lt;ref&gt;European Federation of Food Science and Technology (EFFoST)&lt;/ref&gt; European Federation of Food Science and Technology, Asia (FIFSTA) '''The Federation of the Institutes of Food Science and Technology in ASEAN''' and Latin America/Caribbean (ALACCTA) Latin American and the Caribbean Association of Food Science and Technology.

==Governance Structure==
The General Assembly develops and controls IUFoST policies and actions. The Governing Council sets the objectives for the Term of Office and The Board implements strategies to achieve the objectives. The Scientific Council maintains the scientific standard and integrity of IUFoST activities.
IUFoST formed the '''International Academy of Food Science and Technology''' ('''IAFoST'''), to recognise individuals with outstanding leadership in food science and technology. IAFoST is a learned society composed of elected members - Fellows - from all parts of the world.
IUFoST's Regional Groupings, '''EFFoST''' (Europe), '''ALACCTA''' (Latin America), '''WAAFoST''' (West Africa) and '''FIFSTA''' (South East Asia) are an integral part of the organization. Standing Committees and Disciplinary Groupings comply with the IUFoST Constitution and they are guided by the General Assembly.

==Programmes and Achievements: IUFoST Missions consist of==
• Delivering '''educational programmes''', student scholarships and opportunities for young scientists, including distance learning, which is currently being developed for Sub-Saharan Africa. IUFoST pilot projects are underway in Sub-Saharan Africa providing distance learning modules to food industry middle managers without formal qualifications. These modules are conducted with local advisors/mentors and prepared by international experts. Courses have been created from basic to advanced learning levels in themes like Food Safety, Quality Assurance including HACCP, Shelf Life of Foods, Packaging, Food Laws and Regulations, Food Hygiene, Food Freezing, Practical Human Nutrition, Minimal Processing. IUFoST is also a leader and advises in international programming for food science and technology courses worldwide workshops and training in all aspects of food science and technology worldwide.

• '''Providing scientific expertise''' by providing experts for short courses and workshops, and organizing conferences and symposia, in partnership with our Adhering Bodies and regional groupings, on important current issues such as food safety, security, traceability, and [[food defense]] by working directly with organizations on a consultant basis. For example, IUFoST has been working with the relevant Chinese Ministries, by invitation and under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, China to present the latest authoritative international perspectives on food safety issues in a series of high level meetings in Beijing. IUFoST has also been assisting member countries in advising their national governments in areas of food legislation when requested.

• '''Providing global leadership''' through IUFoST’s biennial World Food Congresses, guidelines for professional conduct in the food science industry, provision of core curricula and accreditation expertise and scientific information bulletins on currently important topics such as obesity, nanotechnology, biotechnology. These bulletins are used by governments, industry and academia worldwide.

 As the global food science and technology organization IUFoST has special consultative status with FAO. Similarly IUFoST works closely with related departments in the World Health Organisation, United National International Development Organisation (UNIDO), and many other international organisations in the course of 'strengthening food science and technology for humanity'
• Stimulating '''exchange of knowledge''' in the international food science and technology community through the electronic magazine "The World of Food Science," the annual review of the state of global food science and technology, textbooks, world congress review papers and the Hunger Handbook applying food science and technology to improve nutrition and promote national development.
IUFoST publishes the core food science and technology textbook for food science and technology, "Food Science and Technology", published by Wiley-Blackwell.

The goal of '''braille uniformity''' is to unify the [[braille]] alphabets of the world as much as possible, so that literacy in one braille alphabet readily transfers to another.&lt;ref name=Unesco54&gt;{{cite web|title=International Meeting on Braille Uniformity|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000711/071103eb.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|year=1953|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unification was first achieved by a convention of the ''International Congress on Work for the Blind'' in 1878, where it was decided to replace the mutually incompatible national conventions of the time with the French values of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]], both for languages which use Latin-based alphabets and, through their Latin equivalents, for languages which use other scripts. However, the unification did not address letters beyond these 26, leaving French and German Braille partially incompatible, and as braille spread to new languages with new needs, national conventions again became disparate. A second round of unification was undertaken under the auspices of [[UNESCO]] in 1951, setting the foundation for international braille usage today.

==Numerical order==
[[File:Final braille.png|thumb|An early braille chart, displaying the numeric order of the characters]]
Braille arranged his characters in decades (groups of ten), and assigned the 25 letters of the French alphabet to them in order. The characters beyond the first 25 are the principal source of variation today.

In the first decade, only the top four dots are used; the two supplementary characters have dots only on the right. These patterns are repeated for the second decade, with the addition of a diacritic at dot 3; for the third, at dots 3 and 6; for the fourth, at 6; and for the fifth decade, by duplicating the first decade within the lower four dots.

==Unification of 1878==
Braille is in its origin a numeric code. [[Louis Braille]] applied the characters in numerical order to the French alphabet in alphabetical order. As braille spread to other languages, the numeric order was retained and applied to the local script. Therefore, where the alphabetical order differed from that of French, the new braille alphabet would be incompatible with French Braille. For example, French was based on a 25-letter alphabet without a ''w''. When braille was adopted for English in the United States, the letters were applied directly to the [[English alphabet]], so that braille letter of French ''x'' became English ''w'', French ''y'' became English ''x'', French ''z'' English ''y'', and French ''ç'' English ''z''. In the United Kingdom, however, French Braille was adopted without such reordering. Therefore, any English book published in braille needed to be typeset separately for the United States and the United Kingdom. Similarly, the letters [[Arabic Braille|Egyptian Arabic Braille]] were assigned their forms based on their nearest French equivalents, so that for example Arabic ''d'' had the same braille letters as French ''d''. For [[Algerian Braille|Algerian Arabic Braille]], however, the braille characters were assigned to the Arabic alphabet according to the Arabic alphabetical order, so that Algerian ''d'' was the same character as Egyptian ''h''. Thus an Arabic book published in Algeria was utterly unintelligible to blind Egyptians and vice versa.

In addition, in other alphabets braille characters were assigned to print letters according to frequency, so that the simplest letters would be the most frequent, making the writing of braille significantly more efficient. However, the letter frequencies of German were very different from those of English, so that frequency-based German braille alphabets were utterly alien to readers of frequency-based [[American Braille]], as well as to numerically based German, English, and French Braille.

The 1878 congress, convening representatives from France, Britain, Germany, and Egypt, decided that the original French assignments should be the norm for those countries:
:"[Due to] the tendencies in America and Germany to re-arrange the Braille alphabet [to fit their own alphabetical orders], the Congress decided ... that it should be adopted ... with the values of its symbols unaltered from those of the original French."&lt;ref&gt;Unesco, 1953, p 25&lt;/ref&gt;
Gradually the various reordered and frequency-based alphabets fell out of use elsewhere as well.

This decision covered the basic letters of the French alphabet at the time; ''w'' had been appended with the extra letters, so the 26 letters of the Basic Latin alphabet are slightly out of numeric order:

For non-Latin scripts, correspondences are generally based, where possible, on their historical connections or phonetic/transcription values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148088eb.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Greek γ ''gamma'' is written {{Braille cell|1245|type=text}} ''g'', as it is romanized, not {{Braille cell|14|type=text}} ''c'', as it is ordered in the alphabet or as it is related historically to the Latin letter ''c''. Occasional assignments are made on other grounds, such as Greek ω ''omega'', which is written {{Braille cell|2456|type=text}} ''w'', as in [[beta code]] and internet chat alphabets, due to the graphic resemblance of Latin ''w'' and Greek ''ω''.

The 1878 congress only succeeded in unifying the basic Latin alphabet. The additional letters of the extended [[French braille]] alphabet, such as {{bc|⠯}}, are not included in the international standard.  The French {{bc|⠯}}, for example, corresponds to print {{angbr|ç}}, whereas the {{bc|⠯}} in English and German braille transcribes {{angbr|&amp;}}, and the {{bc|⠯}} in Hungarian and Albanian braille is {{angbr|q}}.

===Alphabets limited to grade-1 braille===
{{anchor|Grade 1 braille}}Languages that in print are restricted to the letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin script]] are generally encoded in braille using just the 26 letters of grade-1 braille with their French/English values, and often a subset of those letters.  Such languages include:
:[[Bemba language|Bemba]], [[Chewa language|Chewa]] (Nyanja), [[Dobuan language|Dobuan]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]],&lt;ref&gt;Greenlandic Braille also recognizes the additional letters of [[Danish Braille]], found in loan words or proper names.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huli language|Huli]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Luvale language|Luvale]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]],&lt;ref&gt;Swahili also uses the apostrophe in ''ng’''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swazi language|Swazi]], [[Tok Pisin]], [[Tolai language|Tolai]] (Kuanua), [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]].&lt;ref name="unesco3"&gt;[http://www.pharmabraille.com/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=122064 World Braille Usage], UNESCO, 2013&lt;br&gt;All of these alphabets use traditional English Braille punctuation and formatting, except for Greenlandic, which follows [[Danish Braille]] conventions.&lt;!--Unesco 2013 reports Malaysian Braille (but not Indonesian) uses a parenthesis, {{bc|2356}}, for the virgule, but this is not confirmed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In these languages, print digraphs such as ''ch'' are written as digraphs in braille too.

[[Philippine Braille|Languages of the Philippines]] are augmented with the use of the accent point with ''n'', {{bc|4|n}}, for ''ñ''.  These are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], and [[Bicol language|Bicol]]; ''Ethnologue'' reports a few others.

[[Zambian Braille|Languages of Zambia]] distinguish ''ñ/ŋ/ng’'' {{IPA|[ŋ]}} from ''ng'' {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} with an apostrophe, as in Swahili Braille:  {{bc|n|g|3}} ''ng’'' vs {{bc|n|g}} ''ng''.  These are [[Lozi language|Lozi]], [[Kaonde language|Kaonde]], [[Lunda language|Lunda]], and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]]. [[Ganda language|Ganda]] (Luganda) may be similar.&lt;ref&gt;Unesco (2013) claims Ganda Braille has a different point for ''ŋ'', {{bc|n|g|1}}, but that would make it a homograph with ''nga''.  It may thus be a copy error for the apostrophe used in Swahili and Zambia.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnologue'' 17 reports braille use for [[Mossi language|Mòoré]] (in Burkina Faso), [[Rwanda language|Rwanda]], [[Rundi language|Rundi]], [[Zarma language|Zarma]] (in Niger), and [[Luba-Sanga language|Luba-Sanga]], but provides few details.

==Congress of 1929==
In 1929 in Paris, the American Foundation for Overseas Blind sponsored a conference on harmonizing braille among languages which use the Latin script, which had diverged in the previous decades.

==Congresses of 1950–1951==
When additional letters are needed for a new braille alphabet, several remedies are used. 
# They may be borrowed from an existing alphabet; French–German {{bc|type=t|ä}} ''ä'', {{bc|type=t|ö}} ''ö'', and {{bc|type=t|ü}} ''ü'', for example, are widely used where a language had need of a second a-, o-, or u-vowel. Likewise, the values of English contracted ("Grade 2") {{bc|type=t|ch}} ''ch'', {{bc|type=t|sh}} ''sh'', and {{bc|type=t|th}} ''th'' are widely used for similar sounds in other languages.
# An otherwise unused letter may be reassigned. For example, [[Tibetan Braille]], which is based on German Braille, reassigns {{bc|type=t|c}} ''c'', {{bc|type=t|q}} ''q'', {{bc|type=t|x}} ''x'', and {{bc|type=t|y}} ''y'', which are redundant in German.
# In the case of [[diacritic]]s in the print alphabet, a point may be added to the base letter in braille. [[Latvian Braille]], for example, adds dot 6 to indicate a diacritic, at the cost of abandoning several international assignments.
# New letters may be invented by modifying a similar letter. Modification may be done through moving the letter (thus {{bc|type=t|en}} and {{bc|type=t|in}} for a second ''e'' or ''i'' vowel), stretching the letter (again, {{bc|type=t|ch}} and {{bc|type=t|st}} for ''e''- and ''i''-like vowels), or rotating or reflecting it. The latter is quite common, producing such pairs as {{bc|type=t|s}} ''s'' – {{bc|type=t|wh}} ''sh'' and {{bc|type=t|n}} ''n'' – {{bc|type=t|ed}} ''ny''. See [[Hungarian Braille]] for an alphabet which has exploited a pattern of mirror images, and [[Thai Braille]] for the series {{bc|type=t|v}} บ ''b'', {{bc|type=t|ç}} ป ''p'', {{bc|type=t|p}} ผ ''ph&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', {{bc|type=t|th}} พ ''ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

A regional UNESCO conference on braille uniformity for southern Asia took place in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001478/147828eb.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a conference with global scope the following year. The 1951 congress found many conflicting braille assignments:

:"Most Asian and African languages contain more letters or sounds than Roman had equivalents for, [and] they had to find some way of representing them. Most of the designers of Braille spoke English and some of them turned to the contractions of English Braille to find signs which would provide precedents for local letter values ... But beyond these again, many non-European alphabets included letters for which no Braille precedent had been created. Arbitrary signs had to be allotted to them, with the consequence that even throughout these traditional Brailles only limited uniformity was achieved."&lt;ref&gt;Unesco, 1953, pp 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The congress recognized the role of English contracted braille in establishing a partial international standard, and recommended that alphabets follow existing conventions as much as possible.

===Common extended correspondences===
The following assignments include common secondary vowels and consonants: Whenever a second ''a-'' or ''d-''based letter is needed in an alphabet, use of the same secondary braille letter is common. Additional alternative letters are used in some braille alphabets. English [[grade 2 braille]] correspondences are given below for recognition; these are often the basis of international usage.

Each version of the system includes an intelligent ''brick'' computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and [[Lego]] parts from the [[Lego Technic|Technic]] line to create the mechanical systems.

Since creation, there have been four generations of the Mindstorms platform: the original Robotics Invention System, NXT, NXT 2.0, and EV3. With each platform release, the motor and sensor capabilities expanded. The latest system, [[Lego Mindstorms EV3]], was released on September 1, 2013. Some robot competitions use this set, such as the [[FIRST Lego League]] and the [[World Robot Olympiad]].

== History ==
The hardware and software roots of the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System kit go back to a programmable brick prototype created at the [[MIT Media Lab]] in 1987, based on the [[Lego Logo|Lego/LOGO programming environment]]. A second prototype series was developed in the mid-1990s before the final device was released in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/10/mindstorms|title=Lego Mindstorms: A History of Educational Robots|last=|first=|date=2015-04-10|website=Hack Education|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/papers/magical-machines.pdf|title=To Mindstorms and Beyond: Evolution of a Construction Kit for Magical Machines|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MIT Media Laboratory|format=PDF|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first visual programming environment was called LEGOsheets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/systems/legosheets/Home.html|title=LEGOsheets|publisher=LEGOgang|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it was created by the [[University of Colorado]] in 1994 based on [[AgentSheets]].

Mindstorms is named after the book ''[[Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas]]'' by [[Seymour Papert]].&lt;ref name="wired_2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/the_origins_of_/|title=The Origins of Mindstorms|author=[[Jim Bumgardner|Bumgardner, Jim]]|first=|date=29 March 2007|work=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221044013/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/the_origins_of_/|archivedate=2013-12-21|dead-url=|accessdate=1 October 2013|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robotics Invention System==

===RCX===
[[Image:LegoMindstormsRCX.jpg|thumb|First-generation RCX programmable brick.]] 
The first generation of Lego Mindstorms was built around a brick known as the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers). It contains an 8-bit [[Renesas Technology|Renesas]] (then a part of [[Hitachi]]) [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]] [[microcontroller]] as its internal [[central processing unit|CPU]]. It included 32K of RAM to store the firmware and user programs. The brick is programmed by [[upload]]ing a program (written in one of several available [[programming language]]s) from a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Classic Mac OS|Mac]] computer to the brick's RAM via a special infrared ([[infrared|IR]]) interface. After the user starts a program, an RCX-enabled Mindstorms creation can function independently on its own, acting on internal and external stimuli according to the programmed instructions. Also, two or several more RCX bricks can communicate with each other through the IR interface, enabling inter-brick cooperation or competition. In addition to the IR port, the system includes three sensor input ports and three motor output ports (which can also be used to drive other electrical devices such as lamps and so forth). A built-in [[LCD]] can display the battery level, the status of the input/output ports, which program is selected or running, and other information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Version 1.0 RCX bricks feature a power adapter jack to allow continuous operation instead of the limited operation time when using batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power adapter jack was removed. Power adapter equipped RCX bricks are popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling [[Lego train|Lego model trains]]. In the latter context, the RCX needs to be programmed with [[Digital Command Control]] (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.

The IR interface on the RCX is able to communicate with Spybots, Scout Bricks, Lego Train, and the NXT (using a third-party infrared link sensor.) The RCX 1.0 IR receiver [[carrier frequency]] is 38.5&amp;nbsp;kHz, while the RCX 2.0 IR carrier frequency is 76&amp;nbsp;kHz. Both versions can transmit on either frequency. The [[carrier signal]] is generated by one of the RCX's internal timers. The RCX communicates with a computer using a [[Serial port|Serial]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] IR tower. The tower is supported by Windows 98, Me, and XP (32-bit). A patch is available for hyper-threading/multi-core CPUs. There is no formal support for Windows Vista (32-bit), but there are reports of correct functionality. The USB tower does not work on a 64-bit OS unless a 32-bit OS is used in conjunction with a virtual machine.  The serial tower works normally under 64-bit Windows 7 using a third-party USB-to-serial adapter.{{contradict-inline|date=April 2015}}

All versions of the RCX have a unique number printed on it, necessary for technical support and used as the ID number of the RCX for your Lego Mindstorms account on the now-defunct Lego Mindstorms RCX website. The first RCX produced is marked "000001" and was on display at the Mindstorms 10th Anniversary event.&lt;ref name="First_RCX"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brickjournal/3079324996/in/set-72157610670686416/|title=DSC03489.jpg|author=|date=|website=flickr.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lego camera===
The Lego camera on its own is technically not a robotic toy; rather, it is a normal [[webcam]] (a [[Logitech]] [[QuickCam]] Web) packaged into a Lego shell. Being a normal webcam, the Lego camera is, unlike most Mindstorms products, not programmable and is only usable connected to a PC or some other device that supports [[USB]] webcams.

The Lego camera is meant to be used with the included Vision Command software which can also interface with an RCX and thus enables creating robots with "vision". The software is capable of detecting different lightings, motion, and colors. It can also be used with any other software that uses a webcam. The webcam is capable of recording up to 30 frames per second. It also contains a microphone to record sound for videos.

===4.5V PC interface===
The first programmable Lego product was released in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Date gotten from the Bricklink data catalog and confirmed from the printed text on a copy of the product box.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Dacta released an Apple IIe interface card&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=9767-1#T=S&amp;O=%7B%22rpp%22:%2250%22%7D|title=BrickLink - Set 9767-1 : Lego Interface Card and Cable for TC Logo - Apple IIe and Apple IIGS [Educational &amp; Dacta:Technic:Supplemental] - BrickLink Reference Catalog|first=|last=BrickLink|date=|website=www.bricklink.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; set and an IBM-PC-compatible ISA interface card&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=9771-1#T=S&amp;O=%7B%22rpp%22:%2250%22%7D|title=BrickLink - Set 9771-1 : Lego Interface Card and Cable for TC Logo - IBM compatible [Educational &amp; Dacta:Technic:Supplemental] - BrickLink Reference Catalog|first=|last=BrickLink|date=|website=www.bricklink.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; set, each coming with a ribbon cable. The control panel included six non-reversible 4.5V output ports, three reversible 4.5V output ports (each using the power lines from their two adjacent non-reversible ports), two 4.5V input ports, and one continuous 4.5V output port. It also features a manual-override stop-button. Using programs running on the host computer, the user could create stationary programmable robotic Lego inventions using the older 4.5V system. The 4.5V PC Interface was superseded by the 9V-based Dacta Control Lab in 1995.

===Technic control center===

The  control center (1990) was the first programmable standalone Lego product, in the sense of being able to store sequence-based programs and run them. It featured three output ports and manual control, and it was only capable of storing linear sequences of manual input plus timing information. It could store up to two programs at once.

The manual controls could be used to independently control the three motors. To record a program; the controller had to be put in programming mode, and then any manual control would be recorded to the program. Pauses could also be included in a program. When the recording was done, the controller could successfully recall and execute any manual action done during the recording. The executing program could be set to loop infinitely.

Compared to the later programmable controllers, the Technic control center is extremely simple and can only barely be called programmable.

===Dacta Control Lab===
Released in 1995, the Dacta Control Lab was the first Lego product to feature the sensors used in later 9V-based automated Lego products. The control lab was a datalogger, which featured four passive input ports, four active input ports, eight controllable 9V output ports, and one continuous output port. It also featured a manual-override stop-button. The control panel connected to a computer using a serial-port with a specially designed adapter cable and a supplied computer-program allowed the user to conditionally program the outputs. This allowed for robotic operation of mostly stationary Lego inventions. The Control Lab superseded the old 4.5V PC interface from 1989, which was the first fully programmable Lego interface.

The connectors of the early sensors were color-coded according to their type. Active sensors had blue connectors and Passive sensors had yellow connectors. Later Pbricks kept the color-coding for the input ports, but the later sensors dropped the color-coding of the connectors (using black connectors instead). The early touch-sensors were also of a different kind and shape compared to the later touch-sensors. Most notably, instead of featuring a removable cable, the cable was fixed just like the other sensors. These early sensors also featured longer cables.

The Control Lab was designed for schools and educational use and was as a result not available to the mass market. It was later replaced by the RCX and the educational release of the Robot Invention System which allowed for mobile inventions in addition to stationary inventions.

===Cybermaster===
[[Image:cybermaster.jpg|thumb|Lego Cybermaster]]
Cybermaster was mainly sold in Europe and Australia/New Zealand and was available for a short time in the United States via the Lego Club magazines.
It was aimed at an older audience as an early attempt of merging with robotics and Lego.

The brick shares many, especially software, features with the RCX but differs in appearance and technical specifications: one output (plus two built-in) and four sensors.

* It uses [[radio frequency|RF]] (27&amp;nbsp;MHz R/C band) instead of IR for communication.
* It has two built-in motors with integrated [[tachometer]]s and [[speedometer]]s.
* It is limited to passive sensors (a simple [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D]] with internal pull-up resistors).
* The sensors shipped with it are color-coded and have internal resistors in their open state (allowing the Pbrick to sense which sensor is attached to which port).
* It has a fixed firmware (so it cannot be upgraded or replaced).
* It has limited RAM for programs (395 bytes){{clarify|date=May 2015}} and only one program slot.

Despite its obvious limitations it has a number of advantages over its 'big brother', the RCX.

* The RF link has greater range and is omnidirectional.
* The built-in tachometer and speedometer sensors on the internal motors provides the same function as the external rotation sensor to the RCX, but without using up sensor ports.

This makes it very useful for various mobile platforms and performing advanced motion/positioning tasks.

It talks the same protocol as the RCX but cannot communicate directly to it (due to IR vs RF) but with a repeater (a computer with 2 serial ports and a simple program) they can communicate indirectly.

===Codepilot===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:code_pilot.gif|thumb|right|150px|Codepilot]] --&gt;
Sold as part of the Barcode Truck kit.
This unit was the first programmable brick (or Pbrick).
It features a single motor, a single touch sensor and a light sensor.
It is programmed by setting it to 'learn' and using the light sensor to feed barcoded commands. The command set is very limited.
Since barcode is just a series of variances in light, this form of command entry was dubbed VLL (Visual Light Link) and has been used in several later Lego models.

===Scout===
Lego also released a blue computer called the ''Scout'', which has 2 sensor ports, 2 motor ports (plus one extra if linked with a Micro Scout using a [[fiber optic cable]]), and a built in light sensor, but no PC interface. It comes with the Robotics Discovery Set. The Scout can be programmed from a collection of built-in program combinations. In order to program the Scout, a user must enable "power mode" on it. The Scout can store one program.

The Scout is based on a [[Toshiba]] microcontroller with 32KB of ROM and 1KB of RAM, where about 400 bytes are available for user-programs. Due to the extremely limited amount of RAM, many predefined subroutines were provided in ROM. The Scout only supports passive external sensors, which means that only touch, temperature and other unpowered sensors can be used. The [[analog-to-digital converter]]s used in the Scout only have a resolution of 8 bits in contrast to the 10-bit converters of the RCX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210104326/http://mindstorms.lego.com/products/rds/hackers.asp|title=ROBOTICS DISCOVERY SET - INFO FOR HACKERS|date=10 February 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a plan for Lego to create a booster set that allows you to program the Scout from a computer with a software such as RCX code. However, due to the complexity of this project, it was abandoned.

The RCX can control the Scout brick using the "Send IR Message" program block. The RCX does all of the controlling, and therefore can be programmed with the PC, while the Scout accepts commands. The Scout brick must have all of its options set to "off".

====Micro Scout====
The Micro Scout was added as an entry level to Lego robotics.
It is a very limited Pbrick with a single built-in light sensor and a single built-in motor.
It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from [[Toshiba]].

The unit was sold as part of the Droid Developer Kit (featuring [[R2-D2]]) and later the Darkside Developer Kit (featuring an [[AT-AT|AT-AT Imperial Walker]]).

===Spybotics===
{{Main|Lego Spybotics}}
Spybotics is a robotics package. It consists of four colour-coded robots called Spybots, a programming language with which to control the Spybots, and ten simulated missions.

===Programming language===
Lego Mindstorms' programming is command box programming, rather than code programming.

;Lego-supplied languages
* NXT-G Code (come with the box sold at retail vendors)
* ROBOLAB  
;Popular third-party languages
* There are many 3rd party programming languages out there. However, the following includes the most common ones: 
* ROBOTC: C-Based Programming Language with an Easy-to-Use Development Environment.
* [[Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio|Microsoft Robotics]]:  from Microsoft Developers Studio; you need to download the plug-ins online.

==Lego Mindstorms NXT==
{{Main|Lego Mindstorms NXT}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lego Mindstorms NXT Sensors Motors.jpg|thumb|right|The NXT motors, sensors and 'intelligent brick.']] --&gt;

Lego Mindstorms NXT is a programmable [[robotics]] kit released by [[Lego]] in July 2006, replacing the first-generation LEGO Mindstorms kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&amp;contentid=17278&amp;countrycode=2057&amp;yearcode=&amp;archive=false|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708131613/http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&amp;contentid=17278&amp;countrycode=2057&amp;yearcode=&amp;archive=false|archivedate=2009-07-08 |title=What’s NXT? LEGO Group Unveils LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Robotics Toolset at Consumer Electronics Show |work=Press Release |publisher=LEGO Company |location=LAS VEGAS |date=4 January 1986 |accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The kit consists of 577 pieces, including: 3 servo motors, 4 sensors ([[Ultrasonic sensors|ultrasonic]], sound, [[Touch switch|touch]], and [[Photodetector|light]]), 7 connection cables, a [[USB]] interface cable, and the NXT Intelligent Brick. The Intelligent Brick is the "brain" of a Mindstorms machine. It lets the robot autonomously perform different operations. The kit also includes NXT-G, a graphical programming environment that enables the creation and downloading of programs to the NXT. The software also has instructions for 4 robots; Alpha-Rex (a humanoid),Tri-Bot (a car), Robo-Arm T-56 (a robotic arm), and Spike (a scorpion)

==Lego Mindstorms NXT Educational Version==
This is the educational version of the NXT set from Lego Education, which is made for school use.  Software is sold separately, and the Education Resource Set for the best use. It includes a light sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a sound sensor, three lamps and a pair of touch sensors.  The first set consists of about 400 pieces, and the extra set consists of about 600 pieces.  The Education Version is most suited for those who have older versions of Mindstorms sets around, mostly thanks to its three converter cables. It costs about US$410.00 with the Bluetooth Dongle.

==Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0==
{{Main|Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0}}
The [[Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0]] was launched on 5 August 2009. It contains 619 pieces (includes sensors and motors), two Touch Sensors, an [[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] Sensor, and  introduced a new Color Sensor. The NXT 2.0 uses Floating Point operations whereas earlier versions use Integer operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Use in education ==
Mindstorms kits are also sold and used as an educational tool, originally through a partnership between Lego and the [[MIT Media Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="mit_2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/programmable-brick/|title=The MIT Programmable Brick|last=|first=|date=13 February 1998|work=Epistemology and Learning Group|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025132815/http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/programmable-brick/|archivedate=2005-10-25|dead-url=|accessdate=1 October 2013|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=135|title=Programmable Bricks|last=|first=|date=|work=Projects|publisher=MIT Media Lab|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090205/http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=135|archivedate=2013-10-21|dead-url=|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational version of the products is called ''Lego Mindstorms Education EV3 '', and comes with the ROBOLAB [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based programming software, developed at [[Tufts University]]&lt;ref name="tufts_robolab"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Erwin, Ben|author2=Cyr, Martha|author3=Rogers, Chris|year=2000|title=LEGO Engineer and RoboLab: Teaching Engineering with LabVIEW from Kindergarten to Graduate School|url=http://ceeo.tufts.edu/documents/journal/1999bemccr.pdf|journal=International Journal of Engineering Education|volume=16|issue=3|pages=181–192|quote=For the past 6 years, faculty members at Tufts University have developed two different software packages between LabVIEW and Lego data acquisition systems. These packages allow us to teach engineering with both Lego bricks and LabVIEW to students from 5 to 50 years old. The versatility of the hardware and software allow a wide variety of possibilities in what students can build and programÐfrom robots and remote sensing devices to kinetic sculptures. As students design and build their projects, they are motivated to learn the math and science they need to optimise their project. Both college students and kindergartners respond to this motivator. In the paper, we explain how we designed software to complement these projects in allowing automation and animation. The software uses LabVIEW, extending its capabilities to kindergartners and Lego bricks. Finally, we will show how we have used LabVIEW and Lego data acquisition to teach elementary school science, freshman engineering, instrumentation and experimentation, and how college seniors and graduate students have used both the hardware and software to solve various data acquisition problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[National Instruments]] [[LabVIEW]] as an engine. In addition, the shipped software can be replaced with third party firmware and/or programming languages, including some of the most popular ones used by professionals in the embedded systems industry, like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. One of the differences between the educational series, known as the "Challenge Set", and the consumer series, known as the "Inventor Set", is that it includes another touch sensor and several more gearing options. However, there are several other standouts between the two versions that one may not recognize unless doing a side by side analysis of what each offers. The version sold through LEGO Education is designed for a deeper level of learning or teaching that often happens in a classroom or school setting. The LEGO Education version comes with support called the Robot Educator.  This includes 48 tutorials to walk the learner through the basics of coding to more sophisticated and complex concepts such as data logging. This resource to support the learner and/or educator are not included in the retail version of Mindstorm. It's always a good idea to reach out to a LEGO Education consultant to inquire of other differences as there are several more. The retail version was designed for more of a home/toy use vs the educator model was designed to support deeper learning with extra resources and pieces to do so. This is why the LEGO Education Mindstorm contains more sensors and parts than the retail version.

==Community==
There is a strong community of professionals and hobbyists of all ages involved in the sharing of designs, programming techniques, creating third-party software and [[Dexter Industries|hardware]], and contributing of other ideas associated with Lego Mindstorms. The Lego Mindstorms system/website  is organized much like a [[wiki]], harnessing the creative potential and collaborative efforts of participants. [[Lego Group|Lego]] also encourages [[sharing]] and [[peering]] by making software code available for downloading and by holding various contests and events.

{{Expand Japanese|美白|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Japanese lady shoulder in Tōkyō.jpg|thumb|right|Shoulder of a woman from [[Tokyo]], showing her pale skin tone]]
{{nihongo|'''''Bihaku'''''|美白}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "beautifully white" which was coined in the early 1900s with the emergence of [[skin whitening]] products and cosmetics. Even in ancient Japanese Haiku there have been numerous references to this.

== Summary ==
Although [[skin tone]] differs based on a person's [[Race (human classification)|racial background]], those with fair skin have difficulty maintaining{{clarify|date=September 2018}} skin tone due to melanin production. In Japan the [[Physical attractiveness|preference]] for skin that is white and free of blemishes has been documented since at least the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), as in books like ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Hitotsubashi University|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294433|volume=30|number=2|year=1998|journal=Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies|title=THE USE OF RACE AND RACIAL PERCEPTIONS AMONG ASIANS AND BLACKS: THE CASE OF THE JAPANESE AND AFRICAN AMERICANS }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an old proverb {{nihongo|"white skin covers the seven flaws"|色の白いは七難隠す|iro no shiroi wa shichinan kakusu}} which refers to a white-skinned woman being beautiful even if her features are not attractive. 

The cultural fallout of [[Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan]] (1895–1945) has resulted in Taiwanese women becoming consumers of Japanese skin whitening products in the 20th century. [[Mainland China]] has also become a large market for ''bihaku'' products from companies like [[Shiseido]], [[Shu Uemura]] and [[SK-II]] in the 21st century. Further expansion into pan-Asian markets may be represented by [[Girls' Generation]] partnership with [[Dior]] in 2011 to advertise their lightening cream, appealing to [[Korean Wave]] culture consumers.&lt;ref name="Pan"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Beautiful White: An Illumination of Asian Skin-Whitening Culture|first=Elysia|last=Pan|date=April 2003|publisher=Duke University|pages=23, 27-30, 38, 50-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihaku products are highly popular among mature women. They are also popular with teenage girls and those in their twenties who desire to look like pop singers, such as [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], and are promoted in numerous youth fashion magazines such as ''[[Popteen]]'' and ''S Cawaii!''. Bihaku products are also prevalent and a key item in numerous youth subcultures such as [[gyaru]] and ageha girls. An opposition to the idea of fair skin beauty grew with the gyaru subculture called "[[ganguro]]" in the 1990s although died out by the end of the 2000s.

== Method ==
The popular method of ''bihaku'' is to use cosmetics that stop the production of melanin. Traditionally ''[[uguisu no fun]]'' was used to lighten and balance skin tone although today it is considered a luxury item. The most popular products often contain [[sake]] and [[rice bran]] which contain [[kojic acid]].

For skin whitening cosmetics for use by the public, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] has recognized a combination of [[active ingredient]]s. These are mainly [[arbutin]] and [[kojic acid]].&lt;ref name="Pan"/&gt; Other ingredients include [[Vitamin C]] derivatives, [[tranexamic acid]] and ten-odd other types. Many of these active ingredients work through inhibiting  [[catechol oxidase]]. Some types of [[BB cream]], VIORIS products are also said to have skin whitening effects which contributes to the popularity of the cream in Asian markets.

As for other methods of skin whitening, other decolorizing chemicals can be used. Aesthetic skin decolorizing surgeries can also be performed, but excessive cleansings can cause a number of problems, such as facial inflammation, but in the 2000s this is in decline. Historically, [[Uguisu no fun|the droppings]] of the {{nihongo|Japanese bush-warbler|鴬|uguisu}} have been used as an ingredient in face-washes for whitening skin.

'''Louisa Margaret Dunkley''' (28 May 1866 &amp;ndash; 10 March 1927) was an Australian [[telegraphist]] and labor organizer who successfully campaigned for the right for women to obtain equal pay for equal work in the Australian commonwealth public service.

==Biography==
Louisa Margaret Dunkley was born in Richmond, [[Melbourne]], Australia. She was the daughter of William James Dunkley, a boot importer, and Mary Ann Regan, both from London, England.  She was educated at Catholic girls schools.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080395b.htm Biography - Louisa Margaret Dunkley - Australian Dictionary of Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She began to work for the Postmaster-General's Department in 1882.  She studied [[telegraphy]], passing the Public Service Examination on 11 June 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207772154 |title=PUBLIC SERVICE EXAMINATIONS |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Star]] |volume=XXXII, |issue=176 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=28 July 1887 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to become an operator in 1888, working in the Melbourne metropolitan post and telegraph offices. In 1890 she qualified as a telegraphist and was promoted to a position in the Chief Telegraph Office. While working as a telegraphist in the early 1890s, she became aware of the unequal pay and working conditions of the female operators. Learning of efforts by women telegraphists in [[New South Wales]] to achieve equality in pay and status, she formed a committee to advocate for similar improvements in the Post and Telegraph Department of Victoria.  While her efforts resulted in pay increases for the women operators, they did not achieve equality with the male operators, and the resulting controversy resulted in her being transferred to a remote post office.

In 1900, Dunkley and other operators established the [[Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association]] in order to advocate for equal pay and working conditions. Mrs. Webb, a [[postmistress]], was elected president, and Dunkley was elected vice president and spokesperson (1900–1904). She was elected as a delegate to a conference of telegraphists in Sydney in October 1900, and there presented her case for equality under the new Commonwealth Public Service conditions. While some at the conference opposed her, she was able to secure the support of Parliament, and, as a result, a provision for equal pay for female telegraphists and postmistresses was included in the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1902. The Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association continued to exist within the Australian Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Association, first as a state association and then a state branch of the federal body, until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0648b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louise_Dunkley_marries_Edward_Kraegen.png|right|Newspaper clipping of the marriage notice for Edward Kraegen and Louisa Dunkley]] On 23 December 1903, Dunkley married Edward Charles Kraegen, in Oakleigh, Victoria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article82410361 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |volume=XXIII, |issue=9003 |location=Western Australia |date=18 March 1904 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; secretary of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Post and Telegraph associations (1885–1904), and left the Post and Telegraph service.  The couple had a daughter born in 1904, and a son born in 1906. Louisa Margaret Dunkley Kraegen died on 10 March 1927, in Longueville, Sydney, and is buried in Northern Suburbs Cemetery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Image:Parquetry Table.JPG|thumb|In contrast, this [[Tilt-top table]] is veneered in a [[parquetry]] pattern by Isaac Leonard Wise, circa 1934.]]

'''Marquetry''' (also spelled as '''marqueterie'''; from the French ''marqueter'', to varigate) is the art and [[craft]] of applying pieces of [[wood veneer|veneer]] to a structure to form decorative patterns, designs or pictures. The technique may be applied to [[case furniture]] or even seat furniture, to decorative small objects with smooth, veneerable surfaces or to freestanding pictorial panels appreciated in their own right.

Marquetry differs from the more ancient craft of [[inlay]], or [[intarsia]], in which a solid body of one material is cut out to receive sections of another to form the surface pattern.  The word derives from a Middle French word meaning "inlaid work".

== Materials ==
The veneers used are primarily woods, but may include bone, ivory, turtle-shell (conventionally called "[[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]]"), [[mother-of-pearl]], [[pewter]], [[brass]] or fine metals. Marquetry using colored [[Straw marquetry|straw]] was a specialty of some European spa resorts from the end of the 18th century. Many exotic woods as well as common European varieties can be employed, from the near-white of [[Buxus|boxwood]]&lt;ref&gt;Boxwood turns golden-tan as it ages.&lt;/ref&gt; to the near-black of [[ebony]], with veneers that retain stains well, like [[sycamore]], dyed to provide colors not found in nature.

The French cabinet maker [[Andre-Charles Boulle]] (1642–1732) specialized in furniture using metal and either wood or [[tortoiseshell]] together, the latter acting as the background.
 
The simplest kind of marquetry uses only two sheets of veneer, which are temporarily glued together and cut with a fine saw, producing two contrasting panels of identical design, (in French called ''partie'' and ''contre-partie'', "part" and "counterpart").

[[Image:Marquetry-TwoLovers.JPG|thumb|Two Lovers – example of sand-shading and shellac-inking]]
Marquetry as a modern craft most commonly uses knife-cut veneers. However, the knife-cutting technique usually requires a lot of time. For that reason, many marquetarians have switched to [[fretsaw|fret]] or scroll saw techniques. Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown gummed tape (IE as the moistened glue dries it causes the tape to shrink and so the veneer pieces are pulled closer together), [[PVA glue]] and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine abrasive paper always backed by a sanding block. Either ordinary varnish, special varnishes, modern polyurethane -oil or water based- good waxes and even the technique of [[French polish]] are different methods used to seal and finish the piece.

Sand shading is a process used to make a picture appear to be more three-dimensional.  A piece of veneer to be incorporated into a picture is partially submerged into hot sand for a few seconds.

Another process is engraving fine lines into a picture and filling them with a mixture of [[India ink]] and [[shellac]].

== History ==
Furniture inlaid with precious woods, metals, glass and stones is known from the ancient world and Roman examples have been recovered from the first century sites of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] demonstrating that the technique was highly advanced&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/249232]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The revival of the technique of veneered marquetry had its inspiration in 16th century [[Florence]] and at [[Naples]]  ultimately from classical inspiration. Marquetry elaborated upon Florentine techniques of inlaying solid marble slabs with designs formed of fitted marbles, jaspers and semi-precious stones. This work, called ''opere di commessi'', has medieval parallels in Central Italian  "[[Cosmati]]"-work of inlaid marble floors, altars and columns. The technique is known in English as [[pietra dura]], for the "hardstones" used: [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[cornelian]], [[lapis lazuli]] and colored marbles. In Florence, the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Chapel of the Medici at San Lorenzo]] is completely covered in a colored marble facing using this demanding jig-sawn technique.

}}
Techniques of wood marquetry were developed in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] and other Flemish centers of luxury [[Cabinet making|cabinet-making]] during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the [[Gobelins manufactory|royal manufactory of the Gobelins]], charged with providing furnishings to decorate [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and the other royal residences of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming [[Pierre Golle]] and his son-in-law, [[André-Charles Boulle]], who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (''[[ébéniste]]s'') and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing ''tortoiseshell'' and brass with pewter in [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] or intricately foliate designs. ''Boulle'' marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully matched quarter-sawn veneers sawn from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with [[gilt-bronze]] mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like [[Bernard van Risenbergh]], [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and [[Simon-François Oeben]]. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by [[Jean Henri Riesener]] in the 1770s and 1780s.  The ''[[Bureau du Roi]]'' was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.

Marquetry was not ordinarily a feature of furniture made outside large urban centers. Nevertheless, marquetry was introduced into [[Restoration style|London furniture]] at the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, the product of immigrant Dutch 'inlayers', whose craft traditions owed a lot to Antwerp. Panels of elaborately scrolling "seaweed" marquetry of box or holly contrasting with walnut appeared on table tops, cabinets, and long-case clocks. At the end of the 17th century, a new influx of French [[Huguenot]] craftsmen went to [[London]], but marquetry in England had little appeal in the anti-French, more Chinese-inspired high-style English furniture (mis-called 'Queen Anne') after ''ca'' 1720. Marquetry was revived as a vehicle of [[Neoclassicism]] and a 'French taste' in London furniture, starting in the late 1760s. Cabinet-makers associated with London-made marquetry furniture, 1765–1790, include [[Thomas Chippendale]] and less familiar names, like [[John Linnell 18th C Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer|John Linnell]], the French craftsman Pierre Langlois, and the firm of [[Ince and Mayhew|William Ince and John Mayhew]].

[[Image:Silas Kopf Tangram Table.JPG|thumb|right|Modern marquetry: a [[tangram]] table by [[Silas Kopf]], with [[trompe l'oeil]] images of paper and brush made entirely of different shades of flat veneer]] 
Although marquetry is a technique separate from inlay, English marquetry-makers were called "inlayers" throughout the 18th century. In Paris, before 1789, makers of veneered or marquetry furniture (''ébénistes'') belonged to a separate guild from chair-makers and other furniture craftsmen working in solid wood (''menuisiers'').

Tiling patterning has been more highly developed in the Islamic world than anywhere else, and many extraordinary examples of inlay work have come from Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and [[Khatam|Iran]].  &lt;!--this was inlay rather than marquetry?:Also, mention should be made that the Egyptian Pharaohs also commissioned works that decorated funerary objects.--&gt; 

At [[Tonbridge]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], England, souvenir "Tunbridge wares"&amp;mdash; small boxes and the like&amp;mdash; made from the mid-18th century onwards, were veneered with panels of minute wood mosaics, usually geometric, but which could include complicated subjects like landscapes. They were made by laboriously assembling and gluing thin strips and shaped rods, which then could be sliced crossways to provide numerous mosaic panels all of the same design.

Marquetry was a feature of some centers of German cabinet-making from c. 1710. The craft and artistry of [[David Roentgen]], Neuwied, (and later at Paris as well) was unsurpassed, even in Paris, by any 18th-century marquetry craftsman.

Marquetry was not a mainstream fashion in 18th-century Italy, but the neoclassical marquetry of [[Giuseppe Maggiolini]], made in Milan at the end of the century is notable.

The classic illustrated description of 18th century marquetry-making was contributed by [[André Jacob Roubo|Roubo]] to the ''Encyclopédie des Arts et Métiers,'' 1770. The most thorough and dependable 20th-century accounts of marquetry, in the context of Parisian cabinet-making, are by [[Pierre Verlet]].

== New techniques ==
[[Image:Marquetry cabinet tasmanian woods.jpg|thumb|right|Modern marquetry cabinet made from [[Tasmanian]] timbers.]]
During the 80s [[:fr:Georges Vriz|Georges Vriz]] developed a technique called technique VRIZ, layering two veneer layers on top of each other and sanding through the top one, to the point of fiber transparency. This has been used mainly in France, by professionals and marquetry students of the [[École Boulle]]. With its technique, Georges Vriz promoted a resurgence of the marquetry he called RENAISSANCE. He launch the contemporary marquetry. In the US the technique has been used at the American School of French Marquetry by one of the teachers, artist Patrice Lejeune. The school staff is also proposing a new name for it: "Given that 'piercing' is an unfortunate mistake in the veneering world, we chose to use the word "Fusion" instead, by which term the artist expresses his intention of sanding through the veneer as a decorative, textural effect, not as a mistake."
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:VRIZ - Espace 200 x 240 cm.jpg|VRIZ - Espace (200x240 cm)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Patrice Lejeune again uses a technique he calls "sprinkling": using waste - sawdust, shavings, scrapings etc. - as pigments to create a range of effects. Arguably this is no longer marquetry in the pure sense, since it spills over into textured painting, even collage to some extent. This technique also was invented by Georges Vriz, who employed it on a series of large panels exhibited in Paris at the arency. It has been used mainly in France by professionals and students of the École de la Bonne Graine in 1996.

[[High tech|Cutting-edge tech]] has also been applied to marquetry. Among these is [[laser cutting]], where the design is drawn or imported as a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] or [[Vector graphics|vector]] file and each piece is cut separately; each different species of wood-and thickness-may need a specific adjustment of the beam power; the offset will determine the gap between the pieces. In some cases, the beam will leave a dark edge due to the high heat required by the process.

The '''Ministry of Science and Technology''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''وزارت سائنس و ٹیکنالوجی'''}}}}, abbreviated as '''MoST''') is a [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Cabinet]]-level [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Government of Pakistan]] concerned with [[science and technology in Pakistan]] and in general, Pakistan's science policy, planning, co-ordination and directing of efforts to initiate and launch scientific and technological programs as well as projects aimed at economic development. The ministry is coordinated by the Federal Minister for Science and Technology and is headquartered in [[Islamabad]].

==Mission==
The Ministry of science and Technology is the national focal Ministry and enabling arm of the Government of Pakistan for planning, co-ordination and directing efforts to initiate and launch scientific and technological programs and projects aimed at economic development of the country. The Ministry is working on the national agenda to have a sound and sustainable Science and technological research base which would lead to the socio-economic development of the country and to achieve the vision for a better Pakistan.

The principle agenda of the MoST is building Pakistan's technological competence in the 21st century by leap forging into new markets, develop a larger pool of human resource for [[reverse brain drain]] and integrate the soft technology infrastructure into hard modern technological base, strengthen technology institutions, effective S &amp; TR governance and enhance the capacity if indigenous innovation systems.

==Science Advisers==
In 1950, the office of Science Adviser was created by former Prime minister [[Liaqat Ali Khan]] who sent an invitation to [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] to emigrate to Pakistan. An office was set up in Prime minister Secretariat and Siddiqui served as its first Science Adviser. In 1959, [[President of Pakistan|Military dictator]] of [[Pakistan]] and then-known as [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Pakistan Army]], Field Marshal [[Field Marshal Ayub Khan|Ayub Khan]] moved the office in Presidential Residence. World-renowned scientist Dr. [[Abdus Salam]] was appointed as science adviser to the President, who continued as Science Adviser to Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's democratic regime. The post was colloquially known as "''President's Science Adviser''" till Pakistan's political system was shifted back to Parliamentary democracy system through a constitutional amendment, passed by the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] in 1974. The post was renamed as "Prime minister's Science Adviser".

In Pakistan, a Science Adviser is a prestigious and an important tier in Pakistan's science circle. A science adviser is a chief and principal adviser to the [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] with a full status of [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Federal Cabinet minister]]. A science adviser advises the Prime minister on the effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs and also mandate to supervise the government-led science and technology and engineering projects in the government agencies and departments. As of today, the director of this office is colloquially known as the "''Prime minister's Science Adviser''".

[[Image:SIM Concept2006.jpg|thumb|265px|[[Space Interferometry Mission]] conceptual picture]]

Multiple [[satellite]] imaging is the process of using multiple [[satellites]] to gather more information than a single satellite so that a better estimate of the desired source is possible. So something that cannot be seen with one [[telescope]] might be visible with two or more telescopes.

==Background==
[[Interferometry]] is the process of combining waves in such a way that they constructively interfere. When two or more independent sources detect a signal at the same given frequency those signals can be combined and the result is better than each one individually. An overview of [[Astronomical interferometer]]s and a [[History of astronomical interferometry]] can be referenced from their respective pages.

The [[NASA]] [[Origins Program]] was created in the 1990s to ultimately search for the origin of the [[universe]]. The theory that the [[Origins Program]] is based on is: since light travels at a constant speed until it is absorbed by something; there is still light that was part of the first light ever created traveling about the universe and ultimately some of that light is coming in the general direction of Earth. So a satellite system capable of collecting light from the beginning of the [[universe]] would be able to tell us more about where we came from.

There is also the constant search for life in other worlds. A satellite system using the interferometric technologies mentioned above would be able to have a much higher resolution than any of the current deep space imaging systems. A space systems{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} also reduces the amount of [[:wikt:interference|interference]] due to lack of an [[atmosphere]].

==Future==

[[Image:Terrestial Planet Finder Interferometer.jpg|thumb|265|[[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] conceptual image by T. Herbst]]

[[NASA]] is currently focused on the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] and has reduced current funding for scientific unmanned space exploration in favor of human exploration. These budget cuts have slowed the multiple satellite imaging development but it continues. While [[Project Prometheus]] and other scientific missions have ended other projects such as [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] continue.

[[File:Noisemakers.jpg|thumb|Some noisemakers, also suitable for children]]
A '''noisemaker''' is something intended to make a loud [[noise in music|noise]], usually for fun.  The word may refer to:
* [[Pea whistle]]
* [[Air horn]], a device composed of a pressurized air source coupled to a horn, designed to create an extremely loud noise
* [[Fireworks]], such as [[firecrackers]], [[bottle rocket]]s, [[bang snap]]s and others
* [[Party horn]], a paper tube often flattened and rolled into a coil, which unrolls when blown into, producing a horn-like noise
* [[Ratchet (instrument)|Ratchets]], an orchestral musical instrument played by percussionists. See also [[derkach]] and [[rapach]].
* [[Siren (noisemaker)]]
* [[Vuvuzela]], a plastic horn that produces a loud monotone note
* the [[Recorder_(educational_uses)#Unconventional_uses|head joint of the recorder]] which is used as a noisemaker
* [[Couesnophone]]
* [[Groan Tube]]
* [[Moo box]]
* [[Pop Toob]]
* [[Whirly tube]]

Noisemakers are popular with children as '''toy musical instruments'''. They can be perfectly included in loud [[rhythm band]]s.

'''Operation Ivy Bells'''  was a joint [[United States Navy]], [[CIA]], and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) mission whose objective was to place [[Telephone tapping|wire tap]]s on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Submarine communications cable|underwater communication lines]] during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman2010"/&gt;

==Background==
During the Cold War, the United States wanted to learn more about Soviet [[submarine]] and missile technology, specifically [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] test and [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|nuclear first strike]] capability.

In the early 1970s the U.S. government learned of the existence of an undersea communications cable in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], which connected the major Soviet Pacific Fleet naval base at [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] to the Soviet [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]'s mainland headquarters at [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name="SontagDrew2000" /&gt;{{rp|172}} At the time, the Sea of Okhotsk was claimed by the Soviet Union as [[territorial waters]], and was strictly off limits to foreign vessels, and the Soviet Navy had installed a network of sound detection devices along the seabed to detect intruders. The area also saw numerous surface and subsurface naval exercises.

==Installation==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
Despite these obstacles, the potential for an intelligence coup was considered too great to ignore, and in October 1971 the United States sent the purpose-modified submarine {{USS|Halibut|SSGN-587}} deep into the Sea of Okhotsk. Funds for the project were diverted secretly from the [[deep-submergence rescue vehicle]] (DSRV) program and the modified submarines were shown with fake DSRV simulators attached to them. These were early diver lock outs. Divers working from the ''Halibut'' found the cable in {{convert|400|ft|abbr=on}} of water and installed a {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} long device, which wrapped around the cable without piercing its casing and recorded all communications made over it. The large recording device was designed to detach if the cable was raised for repair.

The tapping of the Soviet naval cable was so secret that most sailors involved did not have the [[security clearance]] needed to know about it.  A cover story was thus created to disguise the actual mission: It was claimed that the spy submarines were sent to the Soviet naval range in the Sea of Okhotsk to recover the Soviet [[SS-N-12|SS-N-12 ''Sandbox'']] supersonic anti-ship missile (AShM) debris so that countermeasures could be developed.

Although created as a cover story, this mission was actually carried out with great success: U.S. Navy divers recovered all of the SS-N-12 debris, with the largest debris no larger than 6&amp;nbsp;inches, and a total of more than 2 million pieces.  The debris was taken back to the U.S. and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory reconstructed the AShM based on these pieces, and at least one sample was also [[reverse engineered]].  They discovered that the SS-N-12 AShM was guided by [[radar]] only, and the [[infrared]] (IR) guidance previously suspected did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage|last=Sontag, Drew, and Drew|first=Sherry, Christopher, and Annette Lawrence|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=1999|isbn=0-06-103004-X|location=New York, NY|pages=188|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the samples built, countermeasures were successfully developed and deployed.

==Use==
Each month, divers retrieved the recordings and installed a new set of tapes. The recordings were then delivered to the NSA for processing and dissemination to other U.S. intelligence agencies. The first tapes recorded revealed that the Soviets were so sure of the cable's security that the majority of the conversations made over it were unencrypted. The eavesdropping on the traffic between senior Soviet officers provided invaluable information on naval operations at [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]], the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet's]] primary nuclear submarine base, home to [[Yankee-class submarine|Yankee]] and [[Delta-class submarine|Delta]] class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.&lt;ref name=SontagDrew2000 /&gt;{{rp|188}}

Eventually, more taps were installed on Soviet lines in other parts of the world, with more advanced instruments built by [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]]'s [[Bell Laboratories]] that were nuclear-powered and could store a year's worth of data.&lt;ref name=SontagDrew2000 /&gt;{{rp|189}} Other submarines were used for this role, including {{USS|Parche|SSN-683}}, {{USS|Richard B. Russell|SSN-687}}, and {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575}}. The ''Seawolf'' was almost lost during one of these missions—it was stranded on the bottom after a storm and almost had to use its self-destruct charges to scuttle the ship with her crew.&lt;ref name="friedman1994" /&gt;

==Compromise==
[[Ronald Pelton]], a 44-year-old veteran of the NSA, was fluent in Russian and considered{{by whom|date=April 2016}} to be a highly skilled communications analyst/specialist, but very bad at personal finance.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Hostile toward the agency and dissatisfied with his position, Pelton was $65,000 in debt and filed for [[personal bankruptcy]] just three months before he resigned.  With only a few hundred dollars in the bank, Pelton walked into the Soviet embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] in January 1980 and offered to sell what he knew to the [[KGB]] for money.

No documents were passed from Pelton to the Soviets, as he had an extremely good memory.  He reportedly received $35,000 from the KGB for the intelligence he provided from 1980 to 1983, and for the intelligence on the Operation Ivy Bells, the KGB gave him $5,000. The Soviets did not immediately take any action on this information. However, in 1981, surveillance satellites showed Soviet warships, including a salvage vessel, anchored over the site of the tap in the Sea of Okhotsk.  USS ''Parche'' was dispatched to recover the device, but her divers were unable to find it and it was concluded that the Soviets had taken it.  It remains unclear why it took the Soviets so long, although a plausible explanation is that it was used to feed disinformation to U.S. defense intelligence.{{or|date=April 2016}}

In July 1985, [[Vitaly Yurchenko]], a KGB colonel who was Pelton's initial contact in Washington, D.C., defected to the United States and provided the information that eventually led to Pelton's arrest.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2010" /&gt;

{{asof|1999}}, the recording device captured by the Soviets was on public display at the [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Moscow|Great Patriotic War museum]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="cambell1999" /&gt;

[[File:Payatas-Dumpsite Manila Philippines02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Plastic pollution|Plastic waste]] on the mounds of garbage in the [[Philippines]].]]
Plastic bags cause many minor and major ecological and environmental issues. The most general issue with plastic bags is the amount of waste produced. Many plastic bags end up on streets and subsequently pollute major water sources, rivers, and streams.

Even when disposed of properly, they take many years to [[decompose]] and break down, generating large amounts of [[garbage]] over long periods of time. If not disposed of properly the bags can pollute [[waterways]], clog [[Sewerage|sewers]] and have been found in oceans affecting the [[habitat]] of [[animals]] and [[marine creatures]].&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

Two primary kinds of direct damage to wildlife are entanglement and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/trash_that_kills.pdf|title=Marine litter – trash that kills|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife animals or birds can become entangled. When the animals or birds are entangled they drown or cannot fly due to entanglement.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasticwastesolutions.com/plastic-litter/#Plastic%20Waste%20and%20Wildlife|title=Plastic Waste and Wildlife|website=Plastic Waste Solutions|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic bags are often [[ingested]] by animals because they cannot distinguish whether it is food or not. As a result, it clogs their intestines which results in death by starvation.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"/&gt; Plastic bags can block drains, trap birds and kill livestock. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has estimated that over 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags. In India, an estimated number of 20 cows die per day as a result of ingesting plastic bags and having their digestive systems clogged by the bags. It is also very common across Africa to have sewers and drain systems clogged by bags which cause severe cases of malaria due to the increased population of mosquitoes that live on the flooded sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.de/search?client=opera&amp;q="Getting+Friendly+Environment"+"The+Dell+Challenge"&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=Getting Friendly Environment|publisher=The Dell Challenge|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "white pollution" has been coined in China to describe the local and global effects of discarded plastic bags upon the environment.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=China's biggest plastic bag maker closes after ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/china.plasticbags|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=27 February 2008|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight plastic bags are also blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for flowers by animals affecting their diet. Plastic bags break down, but they never biodegrade. As a result, any toxic additives they contain—including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers—will be released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiener|first=Robert|title=Plastic Pollution|journal=CQ Global Researcher|date=1 July 2010|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plastic bags that get dumped in the Pacific Ocean would all eventually end up in the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. 80% of the plastic waste comes from land while the rest of the 20% comes from oil platforms and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts|url=http://garbagepatch.net/greatpacificoceangarbagepatchfacts/|website=Garbage Patch – The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other pollution issues|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large amount of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean could be eaten up by marine animals, and this will end up blocking up their breathing passages and digestive systems. Plastic bags not only stay in the Great Pacific garbage patch, they can be washed back up to shore in beaches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garces|first1=Diego|title=A staggering amount of waste – much of which has only existed for the past 60 years or so – enters the oceans each year.|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/pollution/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====

Plastic bags were banned in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland on 1 March 2005 after a 120-day grace period that the government had given to the public to get rid of their stocks. The Ministry of Trade and Industries announced the cabinet decision in a decree titled: "Banning importation, production and use of plastic bags in the country". The bags had been nicknamed "the Hargeysa flower", as many of them ended up being blown around and getting stuck in trees and shrubs, posing a danger to livestock because the animals that feed on the leaves often ingest the bags accidentally. In 2015 the ban was repeated by Presidential Decree No. #JSL/M/XERM/249-3178/042015, again providing for a 120 days grace period to get rid of stocks. To ensure the implementation of the ban, the government constituted enforcement teams in 2016 to conduct special drives which launch probes into business stalls. At least 1000 men and women in uniform deployed into the main markets and shopping malls. The government announced fines against violators who continue selling plastic bags in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/53210/somalia-somaliland-bans-use-plastic-bags Somaliland bans use of plastic bags], IRIN News, 1 March 2005.

==== South Africa ====
Plastic bags were a major concern in [[South Africa]] before the bag levy was introduced in 2004. The bags were never banned, but a levy was introduced, payable by the plastic bag manufacturer. The thicker plastic bags are levied and although this move initially caused outrage with consumers and an initial decline in volumes, consumers use has continually increased to several billion plastic shopping bags every year. http://www.econrsa.org/papers/p_papers/pp18.pdf  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080404-plastic-bags.html|title=

==== China ====
A total plastic bag ban on ultra thin plastic bags and a fee on plastic bags was introduced in [[China]] on 1 June 2008. This came into effect because of the problems with sewerage and general waste. One 2009 survey suggests that plastic bag use fell between 60 and 80% in Chinese supermarkets, and 40 billion fewer bags were used. However, first hand accounts clearly indicate, the ban has seen limited success, and that the use of plastic bags remains prevalent. Street vendors and smaller stores, which make up a significant portion of retail in China, do not abide by the policy in part due to difficulties of enforcing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/3158| title=China's bag ban, one year later| date=10 July 2009| author=Shi Jierui| publisher=China Dialogue| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong ====
[[Hong Kong]] forbids retailers from giving plastic bags under a certain thickness and for free.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt; A 50 cent plastic bag levy was implemented on 1 April 2015 across Hong Kong.

==== India ====
In 2002, [[India]] banned the production of plastic bags below 20&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness to prevent plastic bags from clogging of the municipal drainage systems and to prevent the cows of India ingesting plastic bags as they confuse it for food.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=plastic pollution: cow eating a plastic bag, near the Ganges River, Allahabad, India, 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/136513/A-cow-eating-a-plastic-bag-discarded-by-Hindu-devotees|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, enforcement remains a problem.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has also passed regulation to ban all polythene bags less than 50 microns on 18 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Thickness of Plastic Carry Bags Increased from 40 to 50 Microns|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=138144|publisher=Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor implementation of this regulation, regional authorities(states and municipal corporations), have had to implement their own regulation.

==== Myanmar ====
In 2009, plastic bag factories in [[Rangoon]] were ordered by local authorities to stop production by the end of November or face heavy punishment, as the [[Burmese government]] looked to ban plastic bags. Rangoon was thus following in the footsteps of central Burma's [[Mandalay]] and the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], both of which had eliminated plastic bags.

==== Portugal ====

Portugal has implemented a plastic bag tax amounting to 10 cents (€) on single-use carrier bags, which led to a reduction of 90% in their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/plastic-bag-use-plummets-a-year-after-tax-introduction/37473|title=Plastic bag use plummets a year after tax introduction|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many retailers started selling thicker (reusable) plastic bags, which are not subject to the tax, for the same amount. Before the Portuguese government implemented this plastic bag tax, some supermarkets in Portugal had already implemented a 2 cent (€) fee on each plastic bag.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09640568.2010.490054 |title=The influence of a voluntary fee in the consumption of plastic bags on supermarkets from Madeira Island (Portugal) |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=883–889 |year=2010 |last1=Luís |first1=Idalina Perestrelo |last2=Spínola |first2=Hélder }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In Madeira Island where supermarkets implemented this bag fee, there was a 64% reduction in plastic bag consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Romania ====
A law was introduced in 2006 (law 578/2006) - and was later modified in 2011 (law 1032/2011) – that puts a mandatory tax on non-biodegradable plastic bags. The modification in 2011 reduced the tax on plastic bags and was regarded by some as a step backwards from environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://legestart.ro/ecotaxa-pe-pungi-si-sacose-pentru-cumparaturi| title=Ecotaxa pe pungi şi sacoşe pentru cumpărături| date=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
{{See also|Environmental movement in Switzerland|Waste management in Switzerland}}

In 2016, the two largest chains of supermarkets in Switzerland, the [[Federation of Migros Cooperatives]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], announced that they will progressively stop to distribute free plastic bags (at the check-out).&lt;ref name=Guillaume&gt;{{fr}} Michel Guillaume, "L'économie suisse promet de verdir", ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 26 September 2016, page 4. Published on-line as [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/25/leconomie-suisse-promet-verdir-malgre-rejet-linitiative "L'économie suisse promet de verdir malgré le rejet de l'initiative"] on 25 September 2016 (page visited on 26 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Both distributors announced that they will not make money with paid bags, but that profits from their sale will be invested in environmental projects.&lt;ref name=RTS/&gt;

[[Migros]] previously tested the measure in the [[Canton of Vaud]] since 2013: they reduced the number of plastic bags distributed by ninety percent (and saved 100,000 [[Swiss francs|francs]] per year).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{fr}} Michael West, "Environnement. « Petits prix pour grands effets »", ''Migros magazine'', number 39, 29 September 2016, page 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Migros will be the first to introduce the measure across the country, on 1 November 2016 (the bags will be made with recycled plastic and cost 0.05 [[Swiss francs]] each).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt; [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]] plans to introduce this in 2017.&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.rts.ch/info/economie/8036213-chez-coop-et-migros-les-sacs-jetables-vont-desormais-couter-5-centimes.html "Chez Coop et Migros, les sacs jetables vont désormais coûter 5 centimes"], [[Radio télévision suisse]], 22 September 2016 (page visited on 25 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====

The [[Climate Change Act 2008]] served as the legislative framework for the regulation of plastic bags in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241#fullreport|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Wales introduced a legal minimum charge of 5 pence for almost all single use bags in October 2011. Paper and biodegradable bags are included in the charge as well as plastic bags, with only a few specific exemptions – such as for unpackaged food or medicine supplied on an [[NHS Wales|NHS]] prescription.
[[Value added tax|VAT]] raised from the charge is collected by the government. Retailers are asked to pass the rest of the proceeds on to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retailers|url=http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/?lang=en|work=Carrier bag charge Wales|publisher=Crown|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 2012 statistics released by the Welsh Government suggested that carrier bag use in Wales had reduced 96% since the introduction of the charge.&lt;ref name="bigfatbags.co.uk"/&gt;

=====Northern Ireland=====
[[Northern Ireland]] introduced a 5 pence levy on almost all single use bags on 8 April 2013. The levy will be extended to reusable carrier bags with a retail price of less than 20 pence from 19 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Direct Bag Levy|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/baglevy|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland|publisher=NI Direct|date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as data from a number of retailers indicate that reusable bag sales have increased by 800% since the introduction of the levy on single use bags.
The proceeds of the levy (£4.17m in 2013/14) are paid to the Department of the Environment
and used to fund local environmental projects and enforce the levy.
Official statistics for the Northern Ireland levy show that the number of single use bags dispensed fell from around 300 million in 2012/13 to 84.5 million in 2013/14 – a reduction of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Bag Levy Annual Statistics 2013/14|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/carrier_bag_levy_-_annual_statistics_2013-14.pdf|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland Statistics|publisher=DOE NI|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland=====
A five pence minimum charge for single-use carrier bags came into force in [[Scotland]] on 20 October 2014.
The proceeds of the charge can be used by the retailers as they see fit,&lt;ref name=independent-scot&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/scotlands-5p-carrier-bag-charge-comes-into-effect-9806706.html|title=Scotland's 5p carrier bag charge comes into effect|author=Natasha Culzac|date=20 October 2014|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although retailers are encouraged to pledge to donate proceeds to "good causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carrierbagchargescotland.org.uk/|accessdate=2015-10-21|title=Home – Carrier Bag Charge Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge is not exclusive to plastic bags, and includes [[biodegradable]] bags, such as paper.&lt;ref name=independent-scot /&gt; Bags for unpackaged food, loose seeds, soil-contaminated goods, axes, knives or blades; drugs or medical appliances; small packaged uncooked fish, meat or poultry; aquatic animals; purchases made in [[Airport security|aerodrome security restricted areas]]; or goods bought on board a ship, train, aircraft, coach or bus are exempt from the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2014/161/schedule/paragraph/1/made|title=The Single Use Carrier Bags Charge (Scotland) Regulations 2014|article=1|articletype=Schedule|accessdate=2015-10-21|year=2014|number=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====England=====
[[England]] was the last country in the United Kingdom to adopt the 5 pence charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34346309|title=The 5p plastic bag charge: All you need to know|last=Howell|first=Dominic|date=2016-07-30|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the levy taking effect on 5 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-09-16/5p-carrier-bag-fee-will-cost-families-1-5-billion-over-next-10-years/|title=5p carrier bag fee 'will cost families £1.5 billion' over next 10 years|work=ITV News|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the introduction of plastic bag regulations, various retailers participated in voluntary actions to reduce plastic bag consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00749.x |title=Plastic bag politics: Modifying consumer behaviour for sustainable development |journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=168–174 |year=2009 |last1=Ritch |first1=Elaine |last2=Brennan |first2=Carol |last3=MacLeod |first3=Calum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the UK, the English charge does not apply to paper bags or bags made from other natural materials. As with the other nations, [[Value added tax|VAT]] raised on sales will be collected by the Government. Retailers can choose how the money raised from bag sales is used. The Government publishes information yearly on the scheme, encouraging retailers to donate the proceeds to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34346309|title=The 5p plastic bag charge: All you need to know|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=2016-07-30|last1=Howell|first1=Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carrier bags: why there's a charge |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-why-were-introducing-the-charge/carrier-bags-why-theres-a-5p-charge |publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 6 months, 640 million plastic bags were used in seven major supermarkets in England, raising £29.2 million for good causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=BBC News:Plastic bag use plummets in England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36917174 |publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] |date=30 July 2016 |accessdate=30 July 2016|newspaper=BBC News |last1=Morelle |first1=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; England reported to have distributed 0.6 billion single-use bags during the first half year of the charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carrier-bag-charge-summary-of-data-in-england-for-2015-to-2016/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-charge-data-in-england-for-2015-to-2016|title=Single-use plastic carrier bags charge: data in England for 2015 to 2016 – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7 billion fewer than were distributed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/2015_carrier_bag_figures|title=WRAP announces new carrier bag figures {{!}} WRAP UK|date=2015-07-22|website=www.wrap.org.uk|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote the growth of new businesses in England, retailers with fewer than 250 employees are exempt from the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents to the exemption of small retailers argued that this exemption would diminish the environmental impact of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/plasticbagsgvtresponse/|title=Plastic bags: Government response – News from Parliament|website=UK Parliament|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this criticism, in the UK government has announced plans to extend the charge to all retailers and double the charge to 10p.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42630898|title=5p plastic bag charge set to be extended|date=11 January 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/plastic-bag-charge-to-double-to-10p-and-will-also-affect-smaller-retailers-11481388|title=Plastic bag charge to 'double to 10p and will also affect smaller retailers'|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''
*{{Smallsup|1}} The City of Fort Collins, Colorado passed a 5¢ fee on single-use bags on 19 August 2014, and repealed it on 21 October 2014.
*{{Smallsup|2}} Although the state of Hawaii does not ban plastic bags, all of its local jurisdictions do, effectively banning them statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens Group Pushes City Council to Repeal Disposable Shopping Bag Fee|url=http://fighttheplasticbagban.com/2014/10/23/citizens-group-pushes-city-council-to-repeal-disposable-shopping-bag-fee/#more-2535|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Smallsup|3}} On June 22, 2018, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that a bag ban implemented by Laredo, TX was in violation of state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Supreme Court strikes down Laredo's plastic bag ban, likely ending others|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/22/texas-supreme-court-rules-bag-bans/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent letters to 11 other Texas cities with bag bans telling them that such bans were now illegal and unenforceable. On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Austin to end its bag ban after Texas Supreme Court ruling|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/07/03/report-austin-end-its-bag-ban-after-texas-supreme-court-ruling/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== California =====
Californians voted in November 2016 to approve state legislation banning plastic bags statewide in Propositions [[California Proposition 67 (2016)|67]] and [[California Proposition 65 (2016)|65]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13551320/science-issues-election-2016-measures-climate-energy-health-marijuana|title=10 science issues at stake in the 2016 election|first=Alessandra|last=Potenza|date=7 November 2016|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 local laws with similar or tougher regulations will remain and supersede the statewide legislation.

{{main|Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia}}
Although the nation does not ban lightweight bags, the states of [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]], along with some cities have independently banned the bag.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Coles Bay, Tasmania]] was the first location in Australia to ban the bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to its lightweight bag ban in October 2008. It is estimated that 400 million bags are saved each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Australia and Queensland banned them on 1 July 2018 and Victoria has announced it will introduce a ban in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/new-laws-and-changes-that-will-affect-australia-from-january-1-2018-and-beyond/news-story/85825f4092834190a292a828aacb7c3d|title=New laws that will affect Australia|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-06/plastic-bags-banned-in-queensland-cash-for-cans-and-bottles/8876620|title=Plastic bag ban gets green light in Queensland|date=6 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year|title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags next year|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004,&lt;ref name="bag problems" /&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
In 2018, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]] pledged to phase out single-use plastic bags within a year's time. New Zealand is one of the highest producers of urban waste in the developed world, per capita, according to OECD data. Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] and Associate Environment Minister [[Eugenie Sage]] made the announcement on 10 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/363798/government-pledges-mandatory-phase-out-of-plastic-bags|title=Government pledges mandatory phase-out of plastic bags|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2018|date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Argentina ====

In 2012, the [[Buenos Aires]] [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|city government]] allowed [[supermarkets]] to charge for plastic bags in order to discourage their use, which is said to have reduced their use by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El gobierno porteño anunció que desde 2017 se prohibirán bolsas plásticas en los súper|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201609/161475-bolsas-plasticas-supermercados-ciudad-gobierno-porteno.html|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the city announced a full ban on the distribution of plastic bags in supermarkets and hypermarkets, commencing 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adiós a un clásico: desde 2017, no habrá más bolsas de plástico en los súper porteños|url=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Adios-clasico-bolsas-plastico-portenos_0_1643235849.html|website=Clarin|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polémica por la prohibición de bolsas en los comercios porteños|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1934273-polemica-por-la-prohibicion-de-bolsas-en-los-comercios-portenos|website=La Nacion|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Colombia ====
[[Colombia]] plans to reduce the use of plastic bags by 80% by the year 2020, and completely eliminate their use by the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-apunta-eliminacion-completa-del-uso-de-bolsas-articulo-601904|title=Colombia apunta a la eliminación completa del uso de bolsas plásticas en 2025|publisher=|date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 2016, the [[Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development (Colombia)|Ministry of Environment]] passed a resolution banning plastic bags under 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/economia/sectores/desapareceran-las-bolsas-plasticas-en-colombia/16562134|title=Las bolsas plásticas pequeñas tienen los días contados en Colombia – Sectores – El Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|publisher=|date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uruguay ====
Legislation banning non-biodegradable bags and applying a charge to biodegradable bags has been passed by the government of Uruguay but is yet to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/senado-aprobo-ley-bolsas-plasticas-trata.html|title=Senado aprobó la ley sobre el uso de bolsas plásticas, ¿de qué se trata?|first=|last=ElPais|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different methods of phase-out ==
Two of the most popular methods of phasing out lightweight plastic bags have been outlined above, including both fees and bans. The fee strategy is said to have all of the same results in plastic bag reduction as a plastic bag ban, with the additional benefit of creating a new revenue source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa |last1=Skumatz |first2=Dana |last2=D'Souza |date=November 2016 |title=Bag ban basics |journal=Plastics Recycling Update |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=16–19 |url=https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2016/12/08/bag-ban-basics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastic bag fee method also protects consumer choice, which the ban does not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Recycling of plastic bags can be another method of phase-out. However, a big issue with recycling is that only 5% of plastic bags make it to recycling facilities to begin with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even when bags are brought to these recycling bins and facilities, they often fly out of these bins or recycling trucks and end up as litter on the streets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Momentum for Plastic Bag Bans Spreading; Recycling Programs Earn Mixed Reviews |journal=Solid Waste Report |volume=45 |issue=8 |date=April 25, 2014 |pages=5–6 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/95763387/momentum-plastic-bag-bans-spreading-recycling-programs-earn-mixed-reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with recycling is that different bags are made from different yet aesthetically similar types of plastics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bags can be either made of bioplastics or biodegradable plastics, and if accidentally combined in a compost, the bioplastics could contaminate the biodegradable composting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These bags can also jam recycling equipment when mixed with other types of plastic, which can be costly to repair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Costs of repairs rounded out to be about $1 million per year in San Jose, California.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals can also engage in advocacy local officials and local merchants. With the rise in eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;https://travel.usnews.com/features/why-ecotourism-is-booming&lt;/ref&gt; and green travel, there are many opportunities to say no to plastic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theluckystraw.com/blogs/news/9-popular-languages-say-no-thank-you-to-single-use-plastics | title=Say "No to Plastic" in 9 Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:EAW KF850s + SB1000s (Blacklight Party).jpg|thumb|right|200px|This photo illustrates some of the professional [[sound reinforcement system]] equipment which is sold or rented at pro audio stores. Each stack of speakers in this setup consists of two EAW SB1000 slanted baffle [[subwoofer]]s (each contains two 18" drivers) and two EAW KF850 full-range cabinets for the mid and high frequencies.]]
A '''professional audio store''' is a [[retail]] business that sells, and in many cases rents, [[sound reinforcement system]] equipment and [[PA system]] components used in music concerts, live shows, dance parties and speaking events. This equipment typically includes [[microphone]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, electronic [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb and compression effects), [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]], [[subwoofer]]s and [[audio console]]s (mixers).&lt;ref&gt;http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=118464&amp;CVD=118471&amp;CPV=334310&amp;CST=01012012&amp;CLV=5&amp;MLV=5 &lt;/ref&gt; Some professional audio stores also sell [[sound recording]] equipment, [[DJ]] equipment, lighting equipment used in [[nightclub]]s and concerts and video equipment used in events, such as [[video projector]]s and screens. Some professional audio stores rent "backline" equipment used in rock and pop shows, such as [[stage piano]]s and [[bass amplifier]]s. While professional audio stores typically focus on selling new merchandise, some stores also sell used equipment, which is often the equipment that the company has previously rented out for shows and events.
==Terminology==
Professional audio stores are also called "pro audio stores", "pro sound stores", "sound reinforcement" companies, "PA system companies" or "audio-visual companies", with the latter name being used when a store supplies a significant amount of video equipment for events, such as video projectors and screens. Stores often use the word "professional" in their name or the description of their store, to differentiate their stores from consumer [[electronics store]]s, which sell consumer-grade [[loudspeaker]]s, [[home cinema]] equipment, and amplifiers, which are designed for private, in-home use.

==Products==
[[File:Various-microphones.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Pro audio stores carry a range of microphones that can be used for different live sound and recording applications.]]
Pro audio stores carry a range of [[microphone]]s used in live sound and recording, including specialized mics such as drum mics. Stores typically carry wireless systems which enable microphones and electric instruments to be played without cables. Recording gear includes audio interfaces, studio monitors, audio recorders, studio subwoofers, analog-digital and digital-analog converters, studio power amplifiers and duplication equipment. Live sound equipment includes sound reinforcement system [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, monitor speakers, power amplifiers and subwoofers. Headphone equipment includes studio and DJ headphones, [[headphone amplifier]]s and headphone mixers. [[Audio console]]s include live sound mixers, powered mixers (which have a built-in power amplifier), unpowered mixers and digital mixers. Signal processing gear includes [[DI box]]es, crossovers and a range a
of electronic effects, which are typically [[rackmount]]able units, including: [[microphone preamplifier]]s, electronic vocal processors, exciters, equalizers, compressors and limiters, feedback suppressors and [[noise gate]]s. Some stores also sell audio software, such as DAW software, signal processing software and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]].

==Other products==
While some pro audio stores only sell audio equipment, others also sell products in other categories that are used in [[rock concert]]s and [[DJ]] events, such as portable stages, [[stage light]]s, [[par can]]s and light stands. Some stores sell coloured lights, lasers and strobe lights which flash, change colours and/or move according to the beat of the music; these lights are used in [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]] dance events. Some stores also sell [[fog machine]]s, which are used in dances, concerts and theatre productions, often to enhance the appearance of the lighting and laser effects. Some pro audio stores sell a range of [[DJ]] equipment, such as direct drive turntables, record cartridges and styli, DJ CD players and DJ mixers.

==Other services==
Some professional audio stores sell the services of [[audio engineer]]s, audio technicians and delivery personnel who can deliver and set up professional sound equipment and/or oversee the audio mixing of the different instruments and voices during a show or event. Some professional audio stores offer paid [[consulting]] services on professional audio issues. These consultants can come to a customer's venue, which may be a [[nightclub]], [[church (building)|church]], [[conference center]], [[auditorium]] or [[stadium]], assess its professional audio needs, and recommend the types of components–speaker enclosures, mixing boards, microphone types, and so on–that would best suit this venue and the customer's budget.

A '''progressive scan DVD player''' is a [[DVD player]] that can produce video in a [[progressive scan]] format such as [[480p]] ([[NTSC]]) or [[576p]] ([[PAL]]).  Players which can output resolutions higher than 480p or 576p are often called [[Video scaler|upconverting]] DVD players.

Before [[High-definition television|HDTV]]s became common, players were sold which could produce 480p or 576p.  TVs with this feature were often in the upper price range of a manufacturer's line.  To utilize this feature, a TV or other display with a progressive scan input was needed. HDTVs usually have a progressive scan input; progressive scan inputs are less common on [[Standard-definition television|standard definition TVs]] (often called SDTVs.)

Some players have a feature called "[[3:2 pulldown]] detection" or "inverse [[telecine]]" which attempts to better handle the artifacts which result from differing film and video rates in conjunction with [[interlaced]] scanning of the film. However most line doublers used in these players are not able to achieve the anticipated inverse telecine functionality, refer to [[line doubler]] for details.

Progressive scan output can not use connections intended for [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d video, such as [[composite video]] (single [[RCA connector|RCA]] terminated cable) and [[S-Video]] ([[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]] terminated cable).  The following connection methods are common for using progressive scan:
* [[VGA_connector|VGA]] (analog)
* [[SCART]] (using analog [[RGB color model|RGB-video]] in [[PAL]] areas)
* [[Component Video]] (using three cables terminated with RCA connectors)
* [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] (Most recent methods, supported by many newer HDTVs)

Listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]], Racal was a diversified company, offering products including [[voice logger]]s and data recorders, [[point of sale]] terminals, laboratory instruments and military electronics, including radio and radar. At its height it was the third largest British electronics firm; it operated throughout 110 countries worldwide and employed over 30,000 people. It was the parent company of [[Vodafone]], before the mobile telephony provider was sold in 1991.

Racal was purchased by [[Thomson-CSF]] (now [[Thales Group]]) in 2000, thereby giving the French firm access to the lucrative UK defence and armaments market.

==Foundation==
Racal was created in 1950 as Racal Ltd, the name being derived from the names of the partners, Raymond Brown and George Calder Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.skywaves.ar88.net/commrx/RACAL/RA17.htm | title = RA 17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130613130113/http://www.skywaves.ar88.net/commrx/RACAL/RA17.htm | archivedate= 13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Harrison]] joined the company as employee number 13 as an accountant,&lt;ref name=TelgObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4781816/Sir-Ernest-Harrison.html|title=Sir Ernest Harrison|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=29 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114130651/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4781816/Sir-Ernest-Harrison.html|archivedate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5761640.ece|title=Sir Ernest Harrison: chairman of Racal Electronics|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=29 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/20/ernest-harrison-obituary|title=Sir Ernest Harrison|work=The Guardian|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=29 June 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Brewerton|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329100621/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/feb/20/ernest-harrison-obituary|archivedate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later held the positions of chief buyer, personnel director and contract negotiator.

The first factory was located in [[Isleworth]], west London. On outgrowing this site it moved to [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]], Berkshire in 1954, enticed by a 99-year lease at four shillings and sixpence per square foot – and no rent reviews.&lt;ref name=Salbu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salbu.co.za/salbu/eth.html|title=Britain's High Priest of Shareholder Value|author=Jim Levi|publisher=salbu.co.za|accessdate=29 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728034812/http://www.salbu.co.za/salbu/eth.html|archivedate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Racal had won a [[Royal Navy]] contract to build and supply a variant of the American [[Collins Radio|Collins]] Model 51-J Radio Receiver, they were not granted a licence to build these sets by Collins Inc. This meant that Racal had to design and build a radio receiver from scratch. After almost bankrupting the company due to a £40,000 overspend,&lt;ref name=Salbu/&gt; the result was the 'RA17' – in production from 1955 to at least 1973 – designed in co-operation with [[Trevor Wadley]] and using his ''[[Wadley Loop]]'' circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://televideo.ws/wadley.html | title = The Wadley Drift Cancelling Loop | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131208233902/http://televideo.ws/wadley.html | archivedate= 8 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racal under Harrison==
Harrison joined the company board in 1958, and as deputy managing director from 1961 helped Racal to obtain a [[London Stock Exchange|Stock Market]] listing.&lt;ref name=TimesObit/&gt; Harrison became chairman in 1966, when co-founder Ray Brown was lured away by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref name=TimesObit/&gt;

===Major deals&lt;ref name=TelgObit/&gt;===
* Negotiation of a [[British Army]] battlefield radio contract (initially [[Larkspur radio system|Larkspur]], later part of [[Clansman (military radio)|Clansman]]) which secured the future of Racal
* Led the merger between Racal and [[British Communications Corporation]], that bolstered Racal's radio business
* Bought Decca in 1980 in competition from [[General Electric Company plc]], the rival British company led by [[Arnold Weinstock|Lord Weinstock]]
* Buying the [[British Rail Telecommunications]] network, to form the basis of Racal Telecom
* Creation and spin-out of [[Vodafone]]
* Stopping the proposed takeover by Williams Holdings by demerging [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]
* Investing in [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] company [[Camelot Group]]
* Selling Racal Telecom to [[Global Crossing]]
* Selling Racal's remaining defence and industrial electronics divisions to [[Thomson-CSF]] of France for £1.8&amp;nbsp;billion

Under Harrsion, £1,000 invested in Racal in 1961 would have been worth £14.5million when he retired in 2000. Harrison received an estimated £25&amp;nbsp;million from the sale of Racal in 2000, and is estimated to have died with an accumulated total wealth of £40million.&lt;ref name=TimesObit/&gt;

===Decca Radar===
In 1979, Racal bought [[Decca Radar]] forming Racal-Decca. Racal-Datacom conducted business in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.sperrymarine.northropgrumman.com/products/radars/#Sperry%20Marine%20Radar%20History | title = Sperry Marine | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120215213137/http://www.sperrymarine.northropgrumman.com/Products/Radars | archivedate= 15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vodafone===
{{main|Vodafone}}
In 1980, Harrison agreed a deal with [[Lord Weinstock]] of [[General Electric Company plc]] to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battlefield radio technology. Briefing the head of Racal's military radio division [[Gerry Whent]] to drive the company into commercial mobile radio, Whent visited GE's factory in [[Virginia]], USA in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/02/19/45500/obituary-sir-ernest-harrison.htm|title=Obituary: Sir Ernest Harrison|author=Richard Wilson|publisher=electronicsweekly.com|date=19 February 2009|accessdate=29 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916224834/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/02/19/45500/obituary-sir-ernest-harrison.htm|archivedate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Racal's newly formed subsidiary Racal Strategic Radio Ltd under CEO Whent, won one of two UK cellular telephone network licences; the other going to [[British Telecom]]&lt;ref name="aprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.321mobile.com/category/mobile-phone-profiles/|title=A Profile of World Leader Vodafone|date=2 November 2006|accessdate=2 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902223914/http://www.321mobile.com/category/mobile-phone-profiles/|archivedate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/d139r2.21Pc.b.htm|title=Vodafone Group Public Ltd Co|accessdate=2 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422024846/http://www.secinfo.com/d139r2.21Pc.b.htm|archivedate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network, known as Racal Vodafone was 80% owned by Racal, with [[Millicom]] with 15%, and the [[Hambros Bank|Hambros Technology Trust]] 5% respectively.  Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/527754.stm |work=''BBC News''| title=The rapid rise of Vodafone | date=4 February 2000 | accessdate=27 May 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415132539/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/527754.stm | archivedate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited in 1985.&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt; On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics bought out the minority shareholders of Vodafone for GB£110&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison|last=Eadie|title=Racal pays £110&amp;nbsp;million to own Vodafone|work=The Times|date=30 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, 20% of Racal Telecom was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5037/is_198808/ai_n18322200 Upwardly mobile: Racal and Vodafone] The Economist, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This would lead to the situation where Racal Electronics was valued at less than its shareholding in Racal Telecom. Harrison demerged Racal Telecom in October 1991, forcing a positive valuation on the rest of Racal (colloquially known in the [[City of London]] as "the rump"). Vodafone would later become the largest mobile network in the world and the highest valued company on the [[FTSE 100]]. Immediately following the demerger, [[Williams Holdings]] launched a [[takeover]] bid for Racal. The bid, valued at £740m, failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/News-opinion-and-commentary/How-high-a-price-can-Racal-bring-Racal-effort-seen-to-avert-a-takeover-British-concerns-plans-includ.html How high a price can Racal bring?] ''The New York Times'', 1991 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229132959/http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/News-opinion-and-commentary/How-high-a-price-can-Racal-bring-Racal-effort-seen-to-avert-a-takeover-British-concerns-plans-includ.html |date=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racal Vadic===
The company marketed modems under the name Racal-Vadic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine 
|magazine=PC Magazine  |publisher=Ziff-Davis |date=26 April 1988
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_woML1VTJcEC |title=Racal-Vadic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the first to offer 2400 baud modems in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Computerworld |date=7 June 1982 |title=The VA440
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LaqX2JB6_UC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another name it used was Racal-Milgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.zypcom.com |title=Zypcom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chubb Security===
In 1984, Racal bought [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]], a security company that manufactured safes and locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/apr/17/11|title=Chubb in takeover talks|last=Macalister|first=Terry|date=2003-04-17|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Chubb was demerged from Racal and was subsequently taken over by Willams Holdings in 1997 for £1.3bn.

===Racal Telecoms===
Racal re-established a telecoms division with a major government contract in 1988 and the acquisition of [[British Rail Telecommunications]] in 1995. This division of the former nationalised industry owned telecoms infrastructure laid across the rail network.

===Racal Instrumentation===
Consisted of Racal Recorders (Hythe, Southampton) and Racal Instruments (Burham, near Slough). Racal acquired Thermionic Products in 1967, creating Racal Thermionics, renamed Racal Recorders in 1977.

===National Lottery===
{{main|Camelot Group}}
In 1994, [[Camelot Group]] won the franchise to operate the UK National Lottery, Racal had a 22.5% share. After one of the founder shareholders, GTECH, was bought out by Camelot this stake increased to 26.67% which Thales continues to hold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/25/newsid_2502000/2502883.stm Camelot wins UK lottery race] BBC News, 25 May 1994 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023215525/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/25/newsid_2502000/2502883.stm |date=23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break-up===
In 1995, Racal expanded its defence businesses with the acquisition of the Thorn Sensors Group from [[Thorn EMI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Navy-International-95/RACAL-BUYS-THORN-EMI-SENSORS.html Racal buys Thorn Emi Sensors] Janes, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, all of Racal defence businesses were reorganised under Racal Defence Electronics Ltd into Racal Radar Defence Systems, Racal Radio and Racal Thorn.

In October 1999, Racal decided to sell its telecoms business to the American communications group, [[Global Crossing]], for £1bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/471221.stm Racal sells telecoms division] BBC News (12 October 1999).

Then in January 2000 [[Thomson-CSF]] announced a bid for the Company: Racal became '''Thomson-CSF Racal plc''' and later part of '''Thales plc''' with the renaming of the larger [[Thomson-CSF]] to [[Thales Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601877.stm Thomson-CSF seals Racal deal] BBC News (13 January 2000) Accessed 20 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030410000253/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601877.stm |date=10 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Racal Acoustics Ltd was acquired by [[Esterline]] Technologies, and has become part of their Communications Systems platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esterline.com/NewsnbspPressCenter/tabid/208/EntryId/4300/Esterline-to-Acquire-UK-Based-Racal-Acoustics-a-Leading-Provider-of-Ruggedized-Military-Communications-Equipment.aspx Esterline to Acquire UK-Based Racal Acoustics, a Leading Provider of Ruggedized Military Communications Equipment] Esterline (22 Dec 2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26675">'''Reflectometry''' uses the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of [[wave]]s at [[interface (matter)|surfaces and interfaces]] to detect or characterize objects.

There are many different forms of reflectometry. They can be classified in several ways: by the used radiation (electromagnetic, ultrasound, particle beams), by the geometry of wave propagation (unguided versus wave guides or cables), by the involved length scales (wavelength and [[penetration depth]] versus size of the investigated object), by the method of measurement (continuous versus pulsed, polarization resolved, ...), and by the application domain.

== Used radiation ==

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] of widely varying wavelength is used in many different forms of reflectometry:
* [[Radar]] and [[Lidar]]: Reflections of electromagnetic pulses are used to detect the presence and to measure the location and speed of objects like aircraft, missiles, ships, cars.
* Characterization of Semiconductor and Dielectric Thin Films: Analysis of reflectance data utilizing the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi Bloomer dispersion equations]] can determine the thickness, [[refractive index]], and [[Complex index of refraction|extinction coefficient]] of thin films utilized in the [[semiconductor]] industry.
* [[X-ray reflectometry]]: is a surface-sensitive analytical technique used in chemistry, physics, and materials science to characterize surfaces, thin films and multilayers.
Propagation of electric pulses in [[electric cable|cable]]s is used to detect and localize defects in electric wiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 =M.K. | last1=Smail |first2 =T. |last2=Hacib |first3=L. |last3=Pichon |first4=F. |last4=Loete |title =Detection and Location of Defects in Wiring Networks Using Time-Domain Reflectometry and Neural Networks  | journal =IEEE Transactions on magnetics|year = 2011 | volume = 47| issue = 5 | pages = 1502–1505 | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.2010.2089503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 =C.  |last1 =Furse |first2 = R. |last2 = Haupt |title = Down to the wire: The hidden hazard of aging aircraft wiring |journal = IEEE Spectrum | year = 2001 | volume = 38 | issue = 2 |pages = 35–39 |doi = 10.1109/6.898797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] reflectometry: A [[transducer]] generates [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves which propagates until it reaches the interface between the propagation medium and the sample. The wave is partially reflected at the interface and partially transmitted into the sample. The waves reflected at the interface travel back to the transducer, then the [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] of a sample is determined by measuring the [[amplitude]] of the wave reflected from the propagation medium/sample interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = D.J. | last1 = McClements | first2 = P. | last2 =Fairley | title =Ultrasonic pulse echo reflectometer | journal = Ultrasonics | year = 1990| volume = 29 | issue = 1 |pages = 58–62 |doi = 10.1016/0041-624X(91)90174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the reflected wave, it is possible to determine some properties of the sample that is desired to characterize. Applications include [[medical ultrasonography]] and [[nondestructive testing]].

[[Neutron reflectometry]]: is a [[neutron diffraction]] technique for measuring the structure of [[thin film]]s, similar to the often complementary techniques of X-ray reflectivity and [[ellipsometry]]. The technique provides valuable information over a wide variety of scientific and technological applications including [[Particle aggregation|chemical aggregation]], [[polymer]] and [[surfactant]] [[adsorption]], structure of thin film [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] systems, biological membranes.

== Skin reflectance ==
In anthropology, reflectometry devices are often used to gauge [[human skin color]] through the measurement of skin reflectance. These devices are typically pointed at the upper arm or forehead, with the emitted waves then interpreted at various percentages. Lower frequencies represent lower skin reflectance and thus darker pigmentation, whereas higher frequencies represent greater skin reflectance and therefore lighter pigmentation.&lt;ref name="JablonskiChaplin2000"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jablonski, N. G., and G. Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2000|volume=39|issue=1|page=57|url=http://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/jablonski-lab/research/JablonskiLabskin.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2017|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different reflectometry techniques ==
Many techniques are based on the principle of reflectometry and are distinguished by the type of waves used and the analysis of the reflected signal. Among all these techniques, we can classify the main but not limited to:
* In [[time-domain reflectometry]] (TDR), one emits a train of fast pulses, and analyzes the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected pulses.
* Frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR):&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = B.J. | last1 = Soller | first2 = D.K. | last2 =Gifford |first3 = M.S. | last3 = Wolfe |first4 = M.E. |last4 = Froggatt  | title =High resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry for characterization of components and assemblies | journal = Optics Express | year = 2005| volume = 13 | issue = 2 |pages = 666–674 |doi = 10.1364/OPEX.13.000666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=C. |last1=Furse |first2=You |last2=C.C. |last3=Dangol |first3=R |last4=Nielsen |first4=M. |last5=Mabey |first5=G. |last6=Woodward \first6=R. |title=Frequency-Domain Reflectometery for on-Board Testing of Aging Aircraft Wiring |journal=IEEE Transactions on electromagnetic compatibility |volume=45 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=306–315 |doi=10.1109/TEMC.2003.811305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this technique is based on the transmission of a set of stepped-frequency sine waves from the sample. As for the TDR, these waves propagate until the sample and are reflected back to the source. Several types of FDR exist and are commonly used in radar applications or characterization of cables/wires. The signal analysis is focused rather on the changes in frequency between the incident signal and the reflected signal.
* [[Ellipsometry]] is the polarization-resolved measurement of light reflections from thin films.

==Conferences and trade shows==
SEMI was founded in 1970 as an association of semiconductor production equipment vendors.&lt;ref name=Zura&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ppzNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA66-PA2|title=Industrial Communication Technology Handbook, Second Edition|first=Richard|last=Zurawski|date=26 August 2014|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, most companies in the semiconductor industry exhibited at the Wescon Show on the west coast and the [[IEEE]] show on the east coast. Wishing to organize a show dedicated to semiconductor production equipment, 55 companies met in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] and agreed to found a new association, originally called Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute.&lt;ref name=EETimes2003&gt;{{cite web|title=William Hugle, Silicon Valley pioneer and SEMI founder, dies at age 76|url=http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1265533|publisher=EE Times|accessdate=2014-10-15|date=November 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[SEMICON]] show was held in 1971 at the [[San Mateo Fairgrounds]] in California, which featured “semiconductor processing equipment, materials, and service firms.”&lt;ref name=Zura/&gt; It featured 80 exhibitors and attracted 2,800 visitors.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Industry Timeline|url=http://www.semi.org/en/About/ctr_025819|publisher=SEMI|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the first [[SEMICON East]] show was held in [[New York City]], with 120 exhibitors participating. This was followed by [[SEMICON Europa]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] (1975) and [[SEMICON Japan]] in Tokyo (1977), which attracted more than 200 exhibitors and 4,500 visitors.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Through this and other activities, the organization grew from a domestic organization to one with an international focus.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=UOL_4j25XKIC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Applied Ergonomics|first1=D.|last1=Alexander|first2=R.|last2=Rabourn|date=2 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this focus was to work with governments to reduce trade barriers and develop “a sympathetic regulatory climate”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=7f4Skkf13U0C&amp;pg=PA116|title=Agents of Influence|first=Pat|last=Choate|date=5 July 1990|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its member organizations—companies that sold equipment and materials to firms that produce microprocessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Semiconductor-industry-expects-slow-recovery-2898955.php|title=Semiconductor industry expects slow recovery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today SEMI organizes and produces nearly 100 technology showcases, trade shows, conferences and special events per year in all of the major manufacturing regions of the world. They include trade shows in China, Japan, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, North America, and Europe, as well as executive conferences, technical programs, and standards meetings.&lt;ref name=Events&gt;{{cite web|title=Events and Tradeshows|url=http://www.semi.org/en/EventsTradeshows|publisher=SEMI|accessdate=2014-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019061916/http://www.semi.org/en/EventsTradeshows|archivedate=2014-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CaliEcon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6hB1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|title=Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative|first1=National Research|last1=Council|first2=Division on Engineering and Physical|last2=Sciences|first3=National Materials and Manufacturing|last3=Board|first4=Committee on Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative: Phase|last4=II|date=20 January 2014|publisher=National Academies Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also has technical education programs, and a weekly email newsletter.

==SEMI standards==
The SEMI Standards program was established in 1973 using proceeds from the [[SEMICON West|west coast SEMICON show]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b3N9-l8WXCMC&amp;pg=PT11|title=CleanRooms|first=|last=PennWell|date=1 April 2008|publisher=PennWell|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first initiative, following meetings with silicon suppliers, was a successful effort to set common wafer diameters to be used in silicon manufacturing. This standardization helped the industry avoid a wafer shortage from 1973 to 1974, that had previously been anticipated. The standards would become internationally utilized over the years, through partnerships with the ASTM, the DIN, and other national standards organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wWjrX5s-HUgC&amp;pg=PA12|title=Semiconductor Processing: A Symposium|first=Dinesh C.|last=Gupta|date=5 July 1984|publisher=ASTM International|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these standards, there were more than two thousand different specifications for silicon and by 1975 80% of all silicon wafers met with the SEMI standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zceIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|title=Pathways to Industrialization and Regional Development|first1=Allen J.|last1=Scott|first2=Michael|last2=Storper|date=27 September 2005|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published annually as the Book of SEMI Standards.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt; With three new standards published annually in the mid-2000s, the book was eventually replaced with a CD-ROM,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and now standards are available online on an annual subscription basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iti.co.uk/semi-s2-evaluations/|title=Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) Standards Services - Technology International (Europe) Ltd|website=www.iti.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, over 800 SEMI standards and safety guidelines are available to address all aspects of automated fabs. The standards are developed and maintained by over 3,600 volunteer experts representing more than 700 companies, working in 23 technical committees and 200 task forces.&lt;ref name=StdOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of the SEMI International  Standards Program |url=http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/file_attach/SEMI%20Standards%20Overview%202011Jul12%20v8.pdf |publisher=SEMI |accessdate=2014-10-15 |date=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019134206/http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/file_attach/SEMI%20Standards%20Overview%202011Jul12%20v8.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile standards include wafer dimensions and materials, factory efficiency and reliability, equipment interfaces, and environmental, health and safety standards.&lt;ref name=StdOverview/&gt;

The four main equipment communication standards are the SECS-I (which stands for SEMI Equipment Communication Standards) established in 1978 that deals with communication protocol and physical definitions, the SECS-II established in 1982 that deals with message format, the GEM established in 1992 that refines the SECS-II, and the HSMS that supersedes SECS-I established in 1994.&lt;ref name=Zura/&gt; The organization also provides safety and ergonomics guidelines, the first of which was the SEMI S2 developed in 1993, followed by the SEMI S8 in 1995.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

==Market research reports==
SEMI provides market research reports for the semiconductor equipment, materials, and LED industries.&lt;ref name=CaliEcon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://californiananoeconomy.org/content/semiconductor-equipment-and-materials-international-0|title=Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International - California in the NanoEconomy|website=californiananoeconomy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[Book-to-bill ratio|billing data]] is considered an important leading indicator of demand trends and is closely watched within the industry and by semiconductor market analysts and investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10274340/1/chip-equipment-orders-show-strength.html|title=Chip Equipment Orders Show Strength|first=Alexei|last=Oreskovic|date=17 March 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also releases the World Fab Forecast.&lt;ref name=SE&gt;{{cite web|url=https://semiengineering.com/the-week-in-review-manufacturing-165/|title=The Week In Review: Manufacturing -Semiconductor Engineering|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunications]] and [[electronics]], a '''self-clocking signal''' is one that can be decoded without the need for a separate [[clock signal]] or other source of [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]]. This is usually done by including embedded synchronization information within the signal, and adding constraints on the coding of the data payload such that false synchronization can easily be detected.

Most [[line code]]s are designed to be self-clocking.

==Isochronicity and anisochronicity==
If a clock signal is embedded in the data transmission, there are two possibilities: the clock signals are sent at the same time as the data ([[isochronous]]), or at a different time ([[anisochronous]]).

===Isochronous self-clocking signals===
If the embedded clock signal is isochronous, it gets sent simultaneously with the data. Below is an example signal, in this case using the [[Manchester code]] self-clocking signal. The data and clock cycles can be thought of as "adding up" to a combination, where both the clock cycle and the data can be retrieved from the transmitted signal.

[[Image:Manchester_encoding_both_conventions.svg]]

===Asynchronous self-clocking signals===
Asynchronous self-clocking signals do not combine clock cycles and data transfer into one continuous signal. Instead, the transmission of clock cycles and data transmission is modulated. Below is an example signal used in [[asynchronous serial communication]], where it is made clear that the information about the clock speed is transmitted in a different timeframe than the actual data.

[[Image:Puerto serie Rs232.png]]

==Implementations==
Example uses of self-clocking signal protocols include:
*[[Isochronous]]
**[[Manchester code]], where the clock signals occur at the transition points.
**[[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy]] signals
**[[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation]]
**[[4B5B]]
**[[8b/10b encoding]]
**[[HDLC]]
**[[Modified Frequency Modulation]]
*[[Anisochronous]]
**[[Morse code]]
**[[Asynchronous start-stop]]

Most of these codes can be seen as a kind of [[Run Length Limited]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE

|quote=A detailed description is furnished of the limiting properties of runlength limited sequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; code. Those constraints on "runs" of zeros and "runs" of ones ensure that transitions occur often enough to keep the receiver synchronized.

Such self-clocking signals can be decoded correctly into a stream of bits without [[bit slip]].
To further decode that stream of bits and decide which bit is the first bit of a byte, often a [[self-synchronizing code]] is used.

== Analog examples ==
[[Amplitude modulation]] – [[modulation|modulating]] a signal &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt; by changing the amplitude of a carrier wave, as in:
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = M(t) \cdot \cos(\omega_c t),&lt;/math&gt;
is self-clocking, as the zero crossings serve as a [[clock pulse]].

One may consider this clock pulse redundant information, or at least a wasteful use of channel capacity, and duplex the channel by varying the phase, as in [[polar modulation]], or adding another signal that is 90° out of phase (a sine wave), as in [[quadrature modulation]]. The result is to send twice as many signals over the channel, at the cost of losing the clock, and thus suffering signal degradation in case of [[clock drift]] (the analog equivalent of bit drift).

This demonstrates how encoding clocking or synchronization in a code costs channel capacity, and illustrates the trade-off.

The '''static induction thyristor''' ('''SIT''', '''SITh''') is a [[thyristor]] with a buried gate structure in which the gate electrodes are placed in n-base region. Since they are normally on-state, gate electrodes must be negatively biased to hold off-state.
it has low noise, low distortion, high audio frequency power capability. The turn-on and turn-off times are very short, typically 0.25 microseconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15216">'''Superconducting logic''' refers to a class of [[logic circuit]]s or [[logic gate]]s that use the unique properties of [[superconductor]]s, including zero-resistance wires, ultrafast [[Josephson junction]] switches, and quantization of magnetic flux (fluxoid). Superconducting computing is a form of [[Cryogenic processor|cryogenic computing]], as superconductive electronic circuits require cooling to [[cryogenic]] temperatures for operation, typically below 10&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]. Often '''superconducting computing''' is applied to [[quantum computing]], with an important application known as [[superconducting quantum computing]].

Superconducting digital logic circuits use single flux quanta (SFQ), also known as [[magnetic flux quantum|magnetic flux quanta]], to encode, process, and transport data. SFQ circuits are made up of active Josephson junctions and passive elements such as inductors, resistors, transformers, and transmission lines. Whereas voltages and capacitors are important in semiconductor logic circuits such as [[CMOS]], currents and inductors are most important in SFQ logic circuits. Power can be supplied by either [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]], depending on the SFQ logic family.

== Fundamental concepts ==
The primary advantage of superconducting computing is improved power efficiency over conventional [[CMOS]] technology.  Much of the power consumed, and heat dissipated, by conventional processors comes from moving information between logic elements rather than the actual logic operations.  Because superconductors have zero electrical [[Resistance (electricity)|resistance]], little energy is required to move bits within the processor.  This is expected to result in power consumption savings of a factor of 500 for an [[Exascale computing|exascale computer]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA610103|title=An Initial Look at Alternative Computing Technologies for the Intelligence Community|last=Joneckis|first=Lance|last2=Koester|first2=David|date=2014-01-01|website=|publisher=Institute for Defense Analyses|pages=15–16, 24–25, 47–50|access-date=2016-04-22|last3=Alspector|first3=Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, in 2014 it was estimated that a 1&amp;nbsp;exa[[FLOPS]] computer built in CMOS logic is estimated to consume some 500 megawatts of electrical power.&lt;ref name="Kogge2011"&gt;Kogge P (2011). [http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/nextgeneration-supercomputers/0 "The tops in flops"], IEEE Spectrum, vol. 48, pp. 48–54, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Superconducting logic can be an attractive option for ultrafast CPUs, where switching times are measured in picoseconds and operating frequencies approach 770&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name="Courtland2011"&gt;Courtland R (2011). [http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/superconductor-logic-goes-lowpower "Superconductor Logic Goes Low-Power"], IEEE spectrum, 22 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes2013"&gt;Holmes DS, Ripple AL, Manheimer MA (2013). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6449287 "Energy-efficient superconducting computing—power budgets and requirements"], IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond., vol. 23, 1701610, June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since transferring information between the processor and the outside world does still dissipate energy, superconducting computing was seen as well-suited for communications-intensive tasks where the data largely stays in the cryogenic environment, rather than [[big data]] applications where large amounts of information are streamed from outside the processor.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

As superconducting logic supports standard digital machine architectures and algorithms, the existing knowledge base for CMOS computing will still be useful in constructing superconducting computers.  However, given the reduced heat dissipation, it may enable innovations such as [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|three-dimensional stacking]] of components.  However, as they require [[Inductor|inductors]], it is harder to reduce their size.  As of 2014, devices using [[niobium]] as the superconducting material operating at 4 [[Kelvin|K]] were considered state-of-the-art.  Important challenges for the field were reliable cryogenic memory, as well as moving from research on individual components to large-scale integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Josephson junction count]] is a measure of superconducting circuit or device complexity, similar to the [[transistor count]] used for semiconductor integrated circuits.

== History ==
Superconducting computing research has been pursued by the U. S. [[National Security Agency]] since the mid-1950s. However, progress could not keep up with the [[Moore's law|increasing performance]] of standard CMOS technology.  As of 2016 there are no commercial superconducting computers, although research and development continues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/will-the-nsa-finally-build-its-superconducting-spy-computer|title=Will the NSA Finally Build Its Superconducting Spy Computer?|last=Brock|first=David C.|date=2016-04-24|website=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the mid-1950s to early 1960s focused on the [[cryotron]] invented by [[Dudley Allen Buck]], but the liquid-helium temperatures and the slow switching time between superconducting and resistive states caused this research to be abandoned.  In 1962 [[Brian Josephson]] established the theory behind the [[Josephson effect]], and within a few years IBM had fabricated the first Josephson junction.  By the mid 1970s IBM had constructed a [[superconducting quantum interference device]] using these junctions, mainly working with [[lead]]-based junctions and later switching to lead/niobium junctions.  However, the program was shut down in 1983 because the technology was not considered competitive with standard semiconductor technology.  The Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] funded a superconducting research effort from 1981 to 1989 that produced the [[ETL-JC1]], which was a 4-bit machine with 1,000 bits of RAM.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 1983, [[Bell Labs]] created niobium/[[Aluminium oxide|aluminum oxide]] Josephson junctions that were more reliable and easier to fabricate.  In 1985, the [[Rapid single flux quantum]] logic scheme, which had improved speed and energy efficiency, was developed by researchers at [[Moscow State University]].  These advances led to the United States' Hybrid Technology Multi-Threaded project, started in 1997, which sought to beat conventional semiconductors to the petaflop computing scale.  The project was abandoned in 2000, however, and the first conventional petaflop computer was constructed in 2008.  After 2000, attention turned to [[superconducting quantum computing]].  The 2011 introduction of [[reciprocal quantum logic]] by Quentin Herr of [[Northrop Grumman]], as well as energy-efficient rapid single flux quantum by Hypres, were seen as major advances.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The push for [[exascale computing]] beginning in the mid-2010s, as codified in the [[National Strategic Computing Initiative]], was seen as an opening for superconducting computing research as exascale computers based on CMOS technology would be expected to require impractical amounts of electrical power.

== Conventional computing techniques ==
Despite the names of many of these techniques containing the word "quantum", they are not necessarily platforms for [[quantum computing]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

===Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) ===
{{Main|Rapid single flux quantum}}[[Rapid single flux quantum]] (RSFQ) superconducting logic was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Likharev1991"&gt;Likharev KK, Semenov VK (1991). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=80745 "RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub-terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems"], IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 1, No. 1, March 1991, pp. 3-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Information is carried by the presence or absence of a single flux quantum (SFQ). The [[Josephson junction]]s are [[critically damped]], typically by addition of an appropriately sized shunt resistor, to make them switch without a hysteresis. Clocking signals are provided to logic gates by separately distributed SFQ voltage pulses.

Power is provided by bias currents distributed using resistors that can consume more than 10 times as much static power than the dynamic power used for computation. The simplicity of using resistors to distribute currents can be an advantage in small circuits and RSFQ continues to be used for many applications where energy efficiency is not of critical importance.

RSFQ has been used to build specialized circuits for high-throughput and numerically intensive applications, such as communications receivers and digital signal processing.

Josephson junctions in RSFQ circuits are biased in parallel. Therefore, the total bias current grows linearly with the Josephson junction count. This currently presents the major limitation on the integration scale of RSFQ circuits, which does not exceed a few tens of thousands of Josephson junctions per circuit.

===LR-RSFQ===

Reducing the resistor (R) used to distribute currents in traditional RSFQ circuits and adding an inductor (L) in series can reduce the static power dissipation and improve energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Yamanashi2007"&gt;Yamanashi Y, Nishigai T, and Yoshikawa N (2007). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2007.898608 "Study of LR-loading technique for low-power single flux quantum circuits"], IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond., vol.17, pp.150–153, June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ortlepp2011"&gt;Ortlepp T, Wetzstein O, Engert S, Kunert J, Toepfer H (2011).

===Low Voltage RSFQ (LV-RSFQ)===

Reducing the bias voltage in traditional RSFQ circuits can reduce the static power dissipation and improve energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Tanaka2012"&gt;Tanaka M, Ito M, Kitayama A, Kouketsu T, Fujimaki A (2012). [http://iopscience.iop.org/1347-4065/51/5R/053102/ "18-GHz, 4.0-aJ/bit Operation of Ultra-Low-Energy Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum Shift Registers"], Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 51 053102, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanaka2013"&gt;Tanaka M, Kitayama A, Koketsu T, Ito M, Fujimaki A (2013).

===Energy-Efficient Single Flux Quantum Technology (ERSFQ/eSFQ)===

Efficient rapid single flux quantum (ERSFQ) logic was developed to eliminate the static power losses of RSFQ by replacing bias resistors with sets of inductors and current-limiting Josephson junctions.&lt;ref name="Mukhanov2011"&gt;Mukhanov OA (2011). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5682046 "Energy-Efficient Single Flux Quantum Technology"], IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, vol.21, no.3, pp.760-769, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirichenko2011"&gt;DE Kirichenko, S Sarwana, AF Kirichenko (2011). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5688194 "Zero Static Power Dissipation Biasing of RSFQ Circuits"], IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, vol.21, no.3, pp.776-779, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ) logic is also powered by direct current, but differs from ERSFQ in the size of the bias current limiting inductor and how the limiting Josephson junctions are regulated.&lt;ref name="Volkmann2013"&gt;Volkmann MH, Sahu A, Fourie CJ, and Mukhanov OA (2013). [http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-2048/26/1/015002/ "Implementation of energy efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ) digital circuits with sub-aJ/bit operation"], Supercond. Sci. Technol. 26 (2013) 015002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL)===

Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL) was developed to fix some of the problems of RSFQ logic. RQL uses [[reciprocal pairs]] of SFQ pulses to encode a logical '1'. Both power and clock are provided by multi-phase [[alternating current]] signals. RQL gates do not use resistors to distribute power and thus dissipate negligible static power.&lt;ref name="QHerr2011"&gt;Herr QP, Herr AY, Oberg OT, and Ioannidis AG (2011). [http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/109/10/10.1063/1.3585849 "Ultra-low-power superconductor logic"], J. Appl. Phys. vol. 109, pp. 103903-103910, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major RQL gates include: [[AndOr]], [[AnotB]], Set/Reset (with nondestructive readout), which together form a universal logic set and provide memory capabilities.&lt;ref name="Oberg2011"&gt;Oberg OT (2011).

===Adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (AQFP)===

{{Main|Quantum flux parametron}}Adiabatic Quantum flux parametron (AQFP) logic was developed for energy-efficient operation and is powered by alternating current.&lt;ref name="Takeuchi2013"&gt;Takeuchi N, Ozawa D, Yamanashi Y and Yoshikawa N (2013).

== Quantum computing techniques ==
{{Main|Superconducting quantum computing}}

Superconducting quantum computing is a promising implementation of [[quantum information]] technology that involves nanofabricated [[superconducting]] [[electrode]]s coupled through [[Josephson effect|Josephson junctions]]. As in a superconducting electrode, the phase and the charge are [[Cannonical conjugate variables|conjugate variables]]. There exist three families of superconducting qubits, depending on whether the charge, the phase, or neither of the two are good quantum numbers. These are respectively termed [[charge qubit]]s, [[flux qubit]]s, and hybrid qubits.

'''Thinking Electronic Industrial Co., Ltd.''' ('''THINKING'''; {{zh|c=興勤電子工業股份有限公司|p=Xìngqín Diànzǐ Gōngyè Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī}}) ([http://mis.twse.com.tw/Best5_new.html?StkNo=2428 TWSE：2428]) is one of the major circuit protection component manufacturer in [[Taiwan]]. It was established in 1979 and the headquarters are in [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan.

==Locations==
THINKING manufactures products in [[Kaohsiung]]. More production facilities in [[China]] include [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangsu]], [[Hubei]] and [[Jiangxi]].

==Products and services==
Started from ceramic material than extended to polymer and metal, THINKING developed series of products to protect electronic circuit from damaged by over current, [[overvoltage]] or overheat. Portfolio includes NTC ([[negative temperature coefficient]]) and PTC ([[positive temperature coefficient]]) [[thermistors]], [[temperature sensor]] probes, [[varistors]], ESD ([[electrostatic discharge]]) suppressors, and polymer [[resettable fuse]]s (also known as [[PPTC]]).

==Market position==
It is well known as NTC Thermistor and varistor manufacturer in Taiwan, as well as the first publicly listed cooperation in Taiwan's protective component industry. With the PC industry rising from the 1980s in Taiwan, its NTC thermistor is adapted as the [[inrush current limiter]] in [[switched-mode power supply]] to suppress the [[inrush current]] when power supply turns on, and the varistor protects the circuit from damaged by surge current occasionally occurred in the electricity network. This earns THINKING a role in the [[supply chain]] of the [[switched-mode power supply]] industry and listed into top 1,000 manufacturers in Taiwan by the press.

'''Steam power''' developed slowly over a period of several hundred years, progressing through expensive and fairly limited devices in the early 17th century, to useful pumps for [[mining]] in 1700, and then to Watt's improved [[steam engine]] designs in the late 18th century. It is these later designs, introduced just when the need for practical power was growing due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], that truly made steam power commonplace.

==Development phases==

===Early examples===
*1st century AD – [[Hero of Alexandria]] describes the [[Aeolipile]], as an example of the power of heated air or water. The device consists of a rotating ball spun by steam jets; it produced little power and had no practical application, but is nevertheless the first known device moved by steam pressure. He also describes a way of transferring water from one vessel to another using pressure. The methods involved filling a bucket, the weight of which worked tackle to open temple doors, which were then closed again by a deadweight once the water in the bucket had been drawn out by a vacuum caused by cooling of the initial vessel.
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1125}}|event= In [[Reims]], according to [[William of Malmesbury]], an organ was powered by heated water.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1551}}|event= [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]] describes a [[steam turbine]]-like device for rotating a spit.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1601}}|event= [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] performs experiments on using steam to create pressure or a vacuum, building simple fountains similar to a [[percolator]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1606}}|event= [[Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont]] receives a patent for a steam-powered device for pumping water out of mines.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1615}}|event= [[Salomon de Caus]], who had been an engineer and architect under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], publishes a book showing a device similar to that of Porta.&lt;ref name="Thurstonpp"&gt;Thurston, pp 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1629}}|event= [[Giovanni Branca]] suggests using a steam [[turbine]] device similar to that described by Taqi al-Din but intended to be used to power a series of pestles working in mortars.&lt;ref name="Thurstonpp" /&gt;}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1630}}|event= [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]] is granted a patent for various steam applications, although no description is given and the patent also covers a number of unrelated inventions. He refers to a "fire engine", and this term is used for many years.}}

===Development of a practical steam engine===
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1663}}|event= [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquis of Worcester]], publishes a selection of his inventions. One is a new sort of steam pump, essentially two devices like de Caus', but attached to a single boiler. A key invention is the addition of cooling around the containers to force the steam to condense. This produces a partial vacuum inside the chambers, which is used to draw a volume of water into the containers through a pipe, thus forming a pump. He builds one of very large size into the side of [[Raglan Castle]], apparently the first "industrial scale" steam engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Thurston| first=Robert| title=A History of the Growth of the Steam-Engine| publisher=D. Appleton and Company| place=New York, New York| year=1878 | pages=19–24| postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has plans to build them for mining, but dies before he can set up his company.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1680}}|event= [[Christiaan Huygens]] publishes memoirs describing a [[gunpowder]] engine that drives a piston. It is historically notable as the first known description of a piston engine.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1698}}|event= [[Thomas Savery]] introduces a steam pump he calls the Miner's Friend.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp 31-41&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost certainly a direct copy of Somerset's design. One key improvement is added later, replacing the cold water flow on the outside of the cylinder with a spray directly inside it. A small number of his pumps are built, mostly experimental in nature, but like any system based on suction to lift the water, they have a maximum height of 32 feet (and typically much less). In order to be practical, his design can also use the pressure of additional steam to force the water out the top of the cylinder, allowing the pumps to be "stacked", but many mine owners were afraid of the high risk of explosion and avoided this option. (Savery engines were re-introduced in the 1780s to recirculate water to water wheels driving textile mills, especially in periods of drought).}}

Many have Watt condensers added after the patent expires (see below).  Several dozen improved [[Savery]] engines are also built.}}

===Watt's engine===
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1765}}|event= [[James Watt]] invents the separate condenser, the key being to relocate the water jet, (which condenses the steam and creates the vacuum in the Newcomen engine) inside an additional cylindrical vessel of smaller size enclosed in a water bath; the still-warm condensate is then evacuated into a hot well by means of a suction pump allowing the preheated water to be returned to the boiler. This greatly increases thermal efficiency by ensuring that the main cylinder can be kept hot at all times, unlike in the Newcomen engines where the condensing water spray cooled the cylinder at each stroke. Watt also seals the top of the cylinder so that steam at a pressure marginally above that of the atmosphere can act on top of the piston against the vacuum created beneath it.}}

*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1769}}|event= [[James Watt]] is granted a patent on his improved design. He is unable to find someone to accurately bore the cylinder and is forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.  The engine performed poorly, due to the cylinder being out of round, allowing leakage past the piston. However, the increase in efficiency is enough for Watt and his partner [[Matthew Boulton]] to license the design based on the savings in coal per year, as opposed to a fixed fee.  It would take Watt ten years in total to get an accurately bored cylinder.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Hornblower's design is more efficient than Watt's single-acting designs, but similar enough to his double-acting system that [[Boulton and Watt]] are able to have the patent overturned by the courts in 1799.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1782}}|event=  First Watt rotative engine, driving a flywheel by means of the [[sun and planet gear]] rather than a crank, thus avoiding [[James Pickard]]'s patent.  Watt secures further patents in this year and 1784.}}
*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1783}}|event= Watt builds his first "double acting" engine, which admits steam so as to alternately act on one side of the piston then on the other, and the introduction of his [[parallel motion]] linkage allows the transmission of the power of the piston motion to be transmitted to the beam on both strokes. This change enables use of a flywheel imparting steady rotary motion controlled by a [[Centrifugal governor|governor]], thus making it possible for the engine to drive machinery in non speed critical applications like milling, breweries and other manufacturing industries.  Because the centrifugal governor alone had poor response to load changes, Watt's engine was not suitable for cotton spinning.}}

Since memory, computation, and communication are handled in each of the 4096 neurosynaptic cores, TrueNorth circumvents the [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann-architecture]] bottleneck and is very energy-efficient, consuming 70 [[milliwatts]] with a power density that is 1/10,000th of conventional microprocessors.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/how-ibm-got-brainlike-efficiency-from-the-truenorth-chip How IBM Got Brainlike Efficiency From the TrueNorth Chip&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SyNAPSE]] chip operates at lower temperatures and power because it only draws power necessary for computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml|title=Cognitive computing: Neurosynaptic chips|date=11 December 2015|publisher=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vacuum fryer''' is a [[deep-frying]] device housed inside a [[vacuum]] chamber.

Vacuum fryers are fit to process low-quality [[potato]]es that contain higher sugar levels than normal, as they frequently have to be processed in spring and early summer before the potatoes from the new [[harvest]] become available. With vacuum frying it is easier to maintain natural colors and flavours of the finished product. Due to the lower [[temperature]]s applied (approx. {{convert|130|°C|°F}}), the formation of suspected [[carcinogen]] [[acrylamide]] is significantly lower than in standard atmospheric fryers, where the frying temperature is approx. {{convert|170|°C|°F}}. The [[fat]] absorption of the products is also reported to be lower than in atmospheric fryers. In South East Asia (mainly [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]]) batch type vacuum fryers are mainly used for the production of fruit chips. However, these machines are only appropriate for relatively small production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granda|first=C.|last2=Moreira|first2=R.g.|last3=Tichy|first3=S.e.|date=2004-10-01|title=Reduction of Acrylamide Formation in Potato Chips by Low-temperature Vacuum Frying|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=E405–E411|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous vacuum fryers==
For larger production quantities, continuous vacuum fryers are available. In these installations, the [[vacuum]] [[frying pan]] is installed in a [[stainless steel]] vacuum tube. The infeed of the raw product is carried out through a rotary [[airlock]].
Depending on the application, the frying pan itself is designed to meet the different product specifications. A transport belt takes the finished product out of the fryer and towards the outfeed system. A lock chamber at the exit of the vacuum tube prevents air from entering the vacuum zone, and a belt system takes the product from one zone to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311024700/http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-11|title=91C-19 Vacuum frying of potato chips|date=2012-03-11|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airfryervergelijken.nl/|title=Airfryer, gezonder frituren - alle informatie op airfryervergelijken.nl|website=Airfryervergelijken.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vacuum is created by [[vacuum pump]]s, and the whole system is controlled by a [[programmable logic controller]].

In batch fryers, the frying oil has to be replaced quite often as it is sensitive to temperature changes. Continuous vacuum fryers lead to a longer lifetime of the frying oil and therefore lower the production costs. Vacuum fryers can also reduce oil content in fried foods. The amount of reduced oil content, usually 1–3%, depends on the type of vacuum fryer.&lt;ref&gt; Journal of Food Engineering
