{{nihongo|'''''Aerobiz'''''|エアーマネジメント 大空に賭ける||"Air Management: Ōzora ni Kakeru"}} is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] [[game console]]s, released in 1992 by [[Koei]].&lt;ref name=MobyGames&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerobiz Game Information|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/aerobiz|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also released for the [[FM Towns]], [[PC-9800 Series|PC-9801]] and [[X68000]] computer platforms in Japan.

As [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of a budding international [[airline]], the player has a limited amount of time to expand their business to become the industry leader against three other airlines (either [[artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled or human opponents). The player has an amount of control over how their airline develops, such as the name, investments, what routes to fly, plane purchases, and other various aspects, while at the mercy of world events such as politics (for instance, if the player runs his or her airline out of Moscow, he or she can initially only buy Soviet planes and will have a harder time negotiating with Western nations&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.29&lt;/ref&gt;) and natural disasters. The player can also get the company involved in peripheral businesses such as [[hotel]]s and shuttle services.&lt;ref name=MobyGames/&gt; Once [[Perestroika]] is initiated, then the Cold War restrictions no longer apply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel ''[[Aerobiz Supersonic]]'' was released in August 1994 for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis. The player is presented with a wider variety of options in nearly everything, but the game play is much the same. Another sequel known as ''Air Management '96'' was released only in Japan for the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Management '96 Game Information|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/air-management-96|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Aerobiz features two timeframes to play the game through: 1963 to 1995, and 1983 to 2015. After selecting the timeframe, the players then choose a city for their airline's headquarters. This allows a certain amount of handicapping: some cities, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]], start the player with many airplanes and a large amount of money; others, such as [[Lima]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Honolulu]], start the player with only a couple of airplanes and a small amount of money. The players then select a difficulty level, which affects the number of passengers, world events (and the reactions of the passengers to those world events), and the win conditions. A charter system of independent airlines can have their shares bought or sold on the stock market; owning at least 51% of the company makes it eligible to be assimilated into the main airline.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay is superficially straightforward: players negotiate for access slots at each airport, buy airplanes, then open routes and start business. After each player has made their desired moves, the game shows any world events that affect the players (for instance, a labor strike will delay shipments of aircraft from that company, while the Olympic Games will boost traffic worldwide, particularly to the host city). The game then shows the results of direct competition between airlines flying the same routes, then the quarterly results of sales, expenses, profits, and passengers flown. After the January–March quarter of every year, it also shows annual results. There are elements of enhancing airline service, such as improving the convenience of arrivals/departures, along with reductions in fare, improving the quality of service along with advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.36-37, 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is won by the first player to achieve the win conditions: link all 22 cities and carry a certain number of passengers (between 2.5 million and 4.5 million, based on difficulty level), all while remaining profitable. If a player goes for four quarters with a negative balance, the company is declared bankrupt and offered reorganization. If the game goes for 32 years (128 turns) without any player meeting the win conditions, the game is called a loss.

''[[MegaTech]]'' magazine said the game had massive potential, and that "strategy buffs will cream over it".

===Scenarios===
; Scenario 1
: This scenario starts in 1963 with the intense competition for the airlines heating up with aircraft that can fly for longer distances without re-fueling. All airlines are desperately trying to cross the long [[Pacific Ocean]] in the quest for intercontinental superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;
; Scenario 2
: This scenario starts in 1983 with the [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic airplane]] become the hottest topic in the airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amado Boudou''' ({{IPA-es|aˈmaðo βuˈðu}}; born 19 November 1962) is an Argentine businessman and politician who served as the [[Vice President of Argentina]] from 2011 to 2015. He was previously [[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Minister of the Economy]] from 2009 to 2011.

In August 2018, following a [[Boudougate|lengthy investigation]], he was convicted of corruption. He was then sentenced to five years and ten months in prison, and banned for life from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentina's former Vice-President Amado Boudou jailed for corruption |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45104286 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Amado Boudou was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1962. His father, also named Amado, was born to a [[French Argentine|French immigrant]] from [[Aveyron]] named ''Aimé'', and this became a nickname for both.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1149568-quien-es-amado-boudou|title=¿Quién es Amado Boudou?|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the ocean-front city of [[Mar del Plata]] and enrolled in the [[National University of Mar del Plata]], where he received a degree in economics, in 1986; described by acquaintances as a sociable type and fond of the bass guitar, he helped produce a number of rock concerts in Mar del Plata in his days as a student, including a festival attended by 15,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.consejo.org.ar/Cv05/boudou_amado.htm Amado Boudou: curriculum vitae] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou attended graduate courses in economics and was awarded a master's degree in economics by a private institution, the [[Universidad del CEMA|Argentine Macroeconomic Studies Center]] (CEMA), which is well-known locally for its support of [[neo-liberal]] and [[free market]] policies.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; Boudou was then brought in as a salesman by Venturino Ehisur S.A. (a local sanitation services company). Following his role in securing a number of lucrative hospital contracts for the company, he was named general manager in 1992 of their government contracts office. The company closed, however, when one of its top municipal clients terminated the contract in 1995.&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/10/25/noticia_0015.html ''Perfil'' (25 October 2008)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then co-founded Ecoplata S.A., another sanitation services firm, and acted as its project manager; Ecoplata was awarded sanitation contracts by the resort cities of [[Villa Gesell]] and [[Pinamar]].&lt;ref name=cv /&gt; He married Daniela Andriuolo in 1993, but they were divorced five years later; they had no children.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;

Boudou entered public service in 1998, when he was named to the Comptroller's Office of the National Social Security Administration ([[ANSES]]) by Economy Minister [[Roque Fernández]] (a fellow CEMA alumnus),&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; and in February 2001, he was named that office's general manager. The election of [[Justicialist Party]] candidate Juan Pablo de Jesús as Mayor of the sea-side [[La Costa Partido|La Costa District]] resulted in Boudou's appointment as Finance Secretary for the popular resort district, which the policy maker accepted.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

The Finance Secretary subscribed to the 2005 Federal Housing Plan promulgated by President [[Néstor Kirchner]], a decision which made La Costa eligible for 486 low-income housing units. The contract, awarded to local builder Cantera FC in May 2005 for nearly US$10&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; was followed by Boudou's return to the ANSES, in January 2006.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; The Cantera FC contract resulted in an administrative debacle, however, when the builder abandoned the works in June 2007, having by then received over US$7&amp;nbsp;million in payments (for which the Mayor never initiated litigation).&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

== National policy maker ==
Returned to the ANSES by its Director, [[Sergio Massa]], Boudou was named its Financial Director (a post second only to the director's in importance), and oversaw the voluntary conversion of several million private pension accounts to the ANSES' aegis when this choice was made available in December 2006. He was appointed its Director in October 2008, after Massa's promotion to the powerful post of Presidential Cabinet Chief.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

Boudou's appointment coincided with President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]'s controversial decision to transfer loss-plagued private [[pension funds]]' assets of nearly US$30&amp;nbsp;billion to the ANSES, citing the cost of subsidizing 77% of the funds' beneficiaries and the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2008|international crisis]] on the government's ability to obtain financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/10/20/elpais/p-01785008.htm "Analizan cambios profundos en el sistema de jubilación privada"] ''Clarín'' (20 October 2008) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ruling [[Front for Victory]]'s defeat in the June 2009 [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|mid-term elections]], Economy Minister [[Carlos Rafael Fernández]] tendered his resignation to the President, effective 7 July, and was replaced by the ANSES Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/07/07/um/m-01954438.htm "Tras la dura derrota electoral, Cristina cambia medio Gabinete"], ''Clarín'' (7 July 2009) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout from the international, [[2008 financial crisis]] later forced the left-wing Argentine government of President [[Cristina Kirchner]] to seek domestic financing for growing public spending, as well as for [[foreign debt]] service obligations. These policies and ongoing [[capital flight]] put further pressure on the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]'s ability to finance debt service obligations, and the president ordered a US$6.7&amp;nbsp;billion account opened at the Central Bank for the latter purpose in December 2009, implying the use of the Central Bank's [[foreign exchange reserve]]s, and drawing direct opposition from the institution's President, [[Martín Redrado]]; Redrado was ultimately forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/22/um/m-02125286.htm "Aníbal Fernández: 'Redrado no entra más al Banco Central'"], ''Clarín'' (22 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou presented a [[Debt restructuring|debt swap]] package on 3 May 2010, for the holders of over US$18&amp;nbsp;billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 [[Argentine debt restructuring]] prepared by former Economy Minister [[Roberto Lavagna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp ''Los Andes'' (3 May 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/63mtJIrUB?url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp |date=8 December 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Holdout problem|holdouts]] include numerous [[vulture fund]]s which had eschewed the 2005 offer, and had instead resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds. These disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in New York and, indirectly, to reduced Argentine access to international credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/12/um/m-02118566.htm "Embargaron fondos del Central en EE.UU. y el Gobierno volvió a denunciar maniobras desestabilizadoras"], ''Clarín'' (12 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 Boudou compared Candelaria de la Sota and Martín Kanenguiser, journalists from ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' and ''[[La Nación]]'', with the people cleaning the gas chambers during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313281 Agresión de Boudou a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanenguiser requested clarification, but Boudou instead defended his statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314013 La agresión de Boudou a periodistas fue un agravio para toda la sociedad] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attack was condemned by the FOPEA (an organization of journalists), members of the legislature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314035 Críticas a Boudou por la agresión a dos periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[DAIA]].&lt;ref name="daia"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313539 Unánime rechazo al ministro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAIA accused him of trivializing the holocaust, and Congressman [[Eduardo Amadeo]] demanded his resignation;&lt;ref name="daia" /&gt; Boudou later stated that this was a badly chosen metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314115 "Se trató de una metáfora inadecuada", dijo Boudou tras la agresión a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economy Minister announced his bid for the office of [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]] in December 2010 as a candidate in the [[Front for Victory]] primaries ahead of the 2011 race; hoping to solidify his base among the country's influential trade unions, he made the announcement at the headquarters of SMATA (the machinists' and auto workers' union).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html ''El Argentino'': Boudou lanza su precandidatura a Jefe de Gobierno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723093419/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html |date=23 July 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Senator [[Daniel Filmus]] was nominated in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1375035-elecciones-en-la-capital-reunion-en-olivos-para-definir-candidatos|title=Filmus-Tomada, la fórmula kirchnerista para la Capital|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial and conviction ===
{{Main|Boudougate}}
The vice president faced accusations of [[influence peddling]] in 2012 regarding contracts awarded by the Economy Ministry to Ciccone Printing for the supply of 100 peso bills, license plates, and other government issues. The controversy arose following statements made by the ex-wife of Ciccone executive Alejandro Vanderbroele to the effect that Boudou was his [[Sleeping partner|silent partner]] in the firm. It was alleged that [[César Guido Forcieri]], who had previously worked under Boudou, had made the connection between the two men. Pursuant to prosecutor Carlos Rívolo's request and following news that the [[Puerto Madero]] condominium rented by Boudou was owned by a friend of Vanderbroele who had, moreover, borrowed funds from Boudou, Judge Daniel Rafecas ordered the residence searched for proof of business associations between Vanderbroele and the vice president;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Allanaron-Amado-Boudou-Puerto-Madero_0_676132617.html|title=Operativo judicial en un departamento de Boudou|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; a receipt for one month of [[homeowner association]] dues owed by the condominium's owner, Fabián Carosso, and paid instead by Vanderbroele was located in the search on 4 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/04/04/politica-16779-otra-operacion-de-clarin-vandenbroele-no-pago-expensas-de-boudou.php|title=Otra operación de Clarín: Vandenbroele no pagó expensas de Boudou|work=Info News|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an August 2013 judicial ruling ordering prosecutors to provide evidence of wrongdoing, and their subsequent failure to do so, on 11 September a Federal Court granted a motion by Boudou's attorneys that would allow them to file for a [[Nolle prosequi|dismissal of charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/Guio-judicial-a-Boudou-podria-pedir-su-sobreseimiento-en-el-caso-Ciccone-20130911-0025.html|title=Guiño judicial a Boudou: podría pedir su sobreseimiento en el caso Ciccone|work=Perfil|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, indicted on [[Bribery#Forms of bribery|passive bribery]] and influence peddling charges by Judge Ariel Lijo on 27 June 2014; Boudou appealed the indictment on 10 July, alleging [[malicious prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/164256/vp-amado-boudou-files-appeal-against-corruption-indictment|title=VP Amado Boudou files appeal against corruption indictment|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boudou is also being investigated for several other offenses and/or crimes, and is a defendant in a total of ten cases in the Federal Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/politica/Boudou-suma-diez-causas-en-la-Justicia-federal-20140629-0053.html Boudou suma diez causas en la Justicia federal], Perfil, 29 June 2014 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Captain Charles Robert George Innes Ker, Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford''' (born 18 February 1981), is a British aristocrat.

==Biography==
Lord Bowmont is the eldest son and [[heir apparent]] of the [[Guy Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe|10th Duke of Roxburghe]] and his first wife, the former Lady Jane Meriel Grosvenor, daughter of the [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster|5th Duke of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Tom O'Sullivan, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/mar/12/rich.life11 The young elite 11-20], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle was [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; He was educated at [[Eton College]] and the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He attended the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], passed out in December 2004, and has served with the [[Blues and Royals]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and [[Iraq]].

He will inherit [[Floors Castle]] and 60,000 acres around the [[Cheviot Hills]] and the [[River Tweed]] as well as [[hotel]]s in the area, leading up to an estimated wealth of £100 million.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; In February 2003, he was caught travelling on the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] without paying the £1 fare.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/02/07/ndodge07.xml |title=''Daily Telegraph'', 7 February 2003 - Student heir to £70m dodges £1 rail fare |accessdate=25 July 2011 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Andrew |last=Haldenby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055244/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F02%2F07%2Fndodge07.xml |archivedate=11 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/2753825.stm| title = ''BBC News'', 12 February 2003 - Marquess pays up after dodging fare| accessdate = 25 July 2011 | date=12 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to pay a £10 fine rather than take the case to court and risk appearing on "losers' posters" displayed around the city, naming people who had been caught travelling without tickets.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Personal life==
On 22 July 2011, he married [[The Honourable]] Charlotte Susanna Aitken (b. 15 February 1982), eldest daughter of [[Maxwell Aitken, 3rd Baron Beaverbrook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/marriages/136119/the-marquis-of-bowmont-and-cessford-and-the-hon-charlotte-aitken| title = Telegraph Announcements - The Marquis of Bowmont and Cessford and the Hon Charlotte Aitken| accessdate = 25 July 2011 | location=London| work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple split and sued for divorce in June 2012, less than a year after the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2157059/Dukes-son-Charlie-ends-marriage-year.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chiefship of Clan Innes===
The present Duke of Roxburghe is heir to the chiefship of the Clan Innes (Clann Innis, '''not''' ''Mac Aonghuis'' or Clan MacInnes); however, since he bears the surname Innes-Ker, the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] will not recognise him as chief of the name Innes.

'''Cone Mills Corporation''' was a world leader in [[textile manufacturing]] of [[corduroy]], [[flannel]], [[denim]] and other [[cotton]] fabrics for most of the 20th century. The company was based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] and its mills were mostly in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. The company was known as the world's largest producer of [[denim]].&lt;ref name="LLC"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cone-Mills-LLC-Company-History.html Cone Mills LLC - company history]; [http://www.secinfo.com/dMX7.21u.d.htm Cone Mills Corporation current report 2003 Form 8-K News Release]; [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D71430F930A35751C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all All About/Denim; The Appeal of Blue -- Now Red or Green -- Jeans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/39/Cone-Mills-Corporation.html Cone Mills Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Cone Mills Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; It was disestablished in 2004.

==Early history==
[[File:Proximity White Oak plant Greensboro.jpg|right|thumb|One of the first company cotton mill plants, ca. 1900]]

The Cone family history begins in 1845 when Herman Kahn (1828–1897), a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish-German]] [[immigrant]], and his sister’s family left their home in [[Bavaria, Germany]] for a new life in the United States. Herman changed the spelling of his last name from ''Kahn'' to "Cone" almost immediately upon arrival in the United States to become more [[United States|American]].&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Cone and his brother-in-law Jacob Adler started a [[dry goods]] business in the German-speaking [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] town of [[Jonesboro, Tennessee]]. Cone &amp; Adler sold the usual items like groceries, hats, boots, and shoes. An exception to this was that they also sold ready-to-wear clothing, unusual in the antebellum South where most clothing was made at home.&lt;ref name = "Noblitt-p5"&gt;Noblitt, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman met Helen Guggenheimer (1838–1898) in one of his business traveling trips to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] in the early part of the 1850s. She was also from Germany and was Jewish. In 1856, when Helen was eighteen,  they got married.&lt;ref name = "Noblitt-p5"/&gt; Their first child was [[Moses H. Cone]], born in 1857, founder of Proximity Manufacturing Company (original name for the Cone Mills [[Business|enterprises]]). Their next was Ceasar, born in 1859, the co-founder.

The family showed in the [[American Civil War|pre-Civil War]] 1860 census that their real estate holdings and personal property holdings were an impressive $29,365. By 1861 they closed their business because of the war and put their money instead into real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, the family sold some of their real estate to reopen their retail business under the name ''Adler, Cone, and Shipley.''
[[File:Division of Cone Mills with mill village 1914.jpg|thumb|left|A division of Cone Mills with a mill village, ca. 1914]]
They engaged in the [[barter]] system to trade goods, since cash was then very scarce. They traded their goods for textiles and then resold these in the [[Southern United States|South]] for cash. Many times they just took credit on personal property and land. They foreclosed on many of the debts owed them, acquiring hundreds of acres of real estate in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 the family, who at this point was fairly wealthy, moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and started a wholesale grocery business called ''Guggenheimer, Cone &amp; Company.'' The family at this point had seven children, five boys and two girls, Claribel and Etta, who gained a reputation as the art-collecting [[Cone sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This business owned by several relative members was ultimately disbanded in 1873 and Herman went into business with his eldest sons, Moses and Ceasar. This new firm was called ''H. Cone &amp; Sons.'' The two eldest, Moses and Ceasar, worked with their father in his grocery business while in their teens traveling the [[Southern United States|Southeast]] as "drummers" (traveling salesmen). The brothers took and bartered orders from southern merchants for their father's [[Product (business)|wares]]. By 1876 the business had expanded to include tobacco and leather goods.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Interior of a cotton mill 1909.jpg|thumb|Interior of a North Carolina cotton mill, ca. 1909]]
In 1887, Moses and Ceasar Cone invested $50,000 in the C. E. Graham Mill Manufacturing Company of [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. They manufactured cotton [[Tartan|plaid]]s. In 1893 the mill became Asheville Cotton Mills. In 1888, the brothers invested in Salisbury Cotton Mills of [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. They also invested in Minneola Manufacturing Company of [[Gibsonville, North Carolina]]. In 1891, Moses and Ceasar Cone established the Cone Export &amp; Commission Company. The selling agent for southern textiles was called a "plaid trust" by its competitors.&lt;ref name="LLC" /&gt; Chartered in New Jersey, the company's headquarters were located in [[New York City]] and Moses served as its president. In 1893, the Cone brothers then built one of the first textile [[finishing (textiles)|finishing]] plants in the South, called Southern Finishing &amp; Warehouse Company.

Moses Cone built his first denim manufacturing plant in Greensboro in 1895. The plant was called the Proximity Cotton Mills because of its location to the nearby cotton fields.&lt;ref name="LLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="print"&gt;[http://www.proximityhotel.com/history.htm The History of Proximity Cotton Mill and Proximity Print Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225052403/http://www.proximityhotel.com/history.htm |date=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the mills "Brother Moses" and "Brother Ceasar" built a facility to serve as the company's headquarters. Ceasar was its first president.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;[http://www.blowingrock.org/mosescone.html Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cone family, many of whom later were involved in Moses and Ceasar's enterprises, included Carrie (1861–1927), Monroe (1862–1891), Claribel (1864–1929), Albert (1866–1867), Solomon (1868–1939), Sydney M. (1869–1939), Etta (1870–1949), Julius W. (1872–1940), Bernard M. (1874–1956), Clarence N. (1876–1929), and Frederick W. (1878-1944).

== Turn of the century ==
[[File:White Oak Mills Greensboro NC 1909.jpg|thumb|White Oak Mills in Greensboro, North Carolina, ca. 1909]]
In 1899 Moses and Ceasar partnered with Emanuel and Herman Sternberger of South Carolina to build a [[flannel]] production plant called Revolution Mills. In 1905 under Proximity Manufacturing Company the Cone brothers built White Oak Cotton Mills in Greensboro. By 1908 it was the world's largest producer of denim.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ep6FZsDQyJMC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=phil+noblitt+cone+mill&amp;sig=wQ_IS8Zc7x4yCKvpklFOAV322LA#PPA18,M1 A Mansion in the Mountains by Philip Noblitt - page 18]&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy-duty blue denim manufactured by the mills controlled by Moses gave him the reputation of being "the Denim King."&lt;ref&gt;Renour, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualblueridge.com/parkway_tour/parks/293_0/ Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation - The Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]; [http://www.metronc.com/article/?id=419 MetroMagazine's NC Business Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510093512/http://www.metronc.com/article/?id=419 |date=2006-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has produced the denim fabric for [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss &amp; Company]] since 1915. They are the exclusive supplier in recent years of the fabric for Levi's brand 501 jeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_May_15/ai_19421835 Cone Mills Corporation chooses BPCS Client/Server version 6.0 to streamline order fulfillment process]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 the company opened Proximity Print Works.&lt;ref name="print" /&gt; This plant was one of the earliest color cloth printing facilities in the [[Southern United States]]. In 1927 the company acquired Cliffside Cotton Mills (manufacturer of [[terry cloth]]) and Haynes Plant (producer of [[chambray]]). By 1929 they had acquired Holt-Granite Puritan Mills Company of [[Haw River, North Carolina]]. They then acquired the [[corduroy]] producing Tabardrey Manufacturing Company. By 1932 the Cone company had gained controlling stock of Eno Cotton Mills of [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]].  They bought the Florence Mills of [[Forest City, North Carolina]] in 1941 and also its subsidiary called American Spinning Company of [[Greenville, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="LLC" /&gt;

== Company changes name ==
In 1945 the company merged all its separate mill properties into the Proximity Manufacturing Company. The manufacturing companies, mills, and various subsidiaries owned by the Cones underwent a major reorganization in which the separate business operations of Proximity Manufacturing Company (including Proximity Cotton Mills, Proximity Print Works, White Oak, and Granite), the Cliffside Mills (including the Cliffside and Haynes plants), the Florence Mills (including American Spinning Company), Minneola Manufacturing Company, Salisbury Cotton Mills, Tabardrey Manufacturing Company, and Cone Export &amp; Commission Company, were all reorganized.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;

Then in 1948 another major merger occurred. Revolution Mills and Proximity Manufacturing Company was consolidated and named Cone Mills Corporation. In 1950 the company announced a merger with the twill and drill manufacturer Dwight Manufacturing Company of Alabama. The following year it purchased the company outright, being the same year the Corporation went public trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;

Cone Mills Corporation in 1952 purchased the Union Bleachery of Greenville, South Carolina. They then gained the first license for the [[Sanforization|sanforizing]] process granted in the United States.&lt;ref name="LLC" /&gt;

== Involvement with other organizations ==
[[File:Cone Memorial YMCA.jpg|thumb|Cone Memorial YMCA &lt;br /&gt; ( White Oak Branch )]]
Cone Mills Corporation was involved with Cone Memorial YMCA (the White Oak, Proximity, and segregated branches), Camp Herman, night school, and employment of nurses. They built housing near their mills, both boarding houses and single family homes. Stores sold dairy products and meat was produced on company farms.  The company built a school and donated land for churches for each village. The company also instituted a Welfare Office.&lt;ref name="print" /&gt;

They were also involved with state and regional cotton and textile associations, the Mill Workers Mutual Benefit Association, and Summit Avenue Building Company. The company was also associated with the Cone Country Club and founded the [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]].&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;

From 1958 to 1969 they were involved with the annual [[Miss North Carolina|Miss North Carolina Pageant]]. The company provided fabric for wardrobes that were given to each year's winner. They also provided fabric for the presentation gown that each winner wore to represent North Carolina in the annual [[Miss America Pageant]].&lt;ref name="inventory"&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/c/Cone_Mills_Corporation.html Inventory of the Cone Mills Corporation Records, 1858-1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

== White Oak Closure ==
ITG ([[International Textile Group]]), parent company of Cone Denim, announced in 2017 that after more than 110 years of continuous production its White Oak mill in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] will cease operations. The company worked closely with its White Oak customers to fulfill all orders and meet customer needs over the coming months, including transitioning styles to its other global platforms as ITG continues to be headquartered in [[Greensboro, NC]] with ten manufacturing operations across the U.S., Mexico and China. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportswear-international.com/news/stories/Closure-Sad-denim-days-ITV-and-Cone-Denim-White-Oak-facility-to-close-down-13734|title=Closure: Sad denim days: ITV and Cone Denim’s White Oak facility to close down|work=sportswear-international.com|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/westernbonime/2017/11/26/tellason-denim-and-america-why-the-white-oaks-closure-matters/#1fc23abf254d|title=Tellason, Denim And America, Why The White Oaks Closure Matters|last=Bonime|first=Western|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the mill closed, it was the last large scale denim mill to shut in the USA, meaning you could no longer get American made selvedge denim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.heddels.com/2017/10/cone-mills-close-white-oak-plant-last-american-selvedge-denim-mill/|title=Cone Mills to Close White Oak Plant, Last American Selvedge Denim Mill|date=2017-10-18|work=Heddels|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the last denim made at White Oak was given to the artist Ian Berry, who is known for his work with denim, to make the 'Secret Garden' at the [[Children's Museum of the Arts|Childrens museum of the arts]]  in New York. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cmany.org/blog/view/look-inside-secret-garden-ian-berry/|title=A look inside The Secret Garden by Ian Berry - Children's Museum of the Arts New York|work=Children's Museum of the Arts New York|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mymodernmet.com/ian-berry-denim-art-secret-garden/|title=Artist Creates “Secret Garden” with the Last Denim Made in the USA|date=2018-01-15|work=My Modern Met|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/denim-ian-berry-secret-garden-01-14-2018/|title=ian berry transforms last spool of denim into a secret garden of whimsy|date=2018-01-14|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.selvedge.org/blogs/selvedge/the-secret-garden|title=The Secret Garden|work=Selvedge Magazine|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company comes to an end ==

The textile companies and plants owned and operated in full or in part by the Cone family were Revolution Cotton Mills, Asheville Cotton Mills, Minneola Manufacturing Company, Salisbury Cotton Mills, Cliffside Mills, Eno Cotton Mills, Granite Finishing Works, Tabardrey Manufacturing Company, Florence Mills, John Wolf Textiles, Olympic Products, and American Spinning Company.&lt;ref name="LLC" /&gt;

The company went private again in 1983 with the threat of a [[corporate takeover|takeover]] by Western Pacific Industries. At the time the company had twenty-one plants and 10,800 employees. The company then had a value of $385 million.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F12F63A5D0C738FDDA80994DB484D81 Cone Mills planning to go private]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Cone Mills Corporation filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection. By 2004, all of Cone's assets had been acquired by W. L. Ross and Company and were then combined with what remained of [[Burlington Industries]] to form [[International Textile Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voyle.net/Nano%20Textiles/Textiles-2004-001.htm International Textile Group Completes Integration of Burlington and Cone]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Cone Mill Villages ==

Mill villages were company-owned towns, built from scratch by textile mills to house their factory workers and their families.  In the early 1900s, Cone Mills Inc. built five self-sufficient villages to serve its Greensboro factories.  These villages included churches, schools, [[baseball]] fields, community centers, and company stores in addition to houses that were leased to mill workers.  At their peak, the Cone mill villages covered {{convert|450|acre|ha}} and housed 2,675 workers in about 1,500 houses.  A separate mill village, East White Oak, housed [[African-American]] workers.  Thousands of workers and their families made their lives in these “towns within a town” until the company began selling the houses (sometimes to workers) in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Covington, Howard E., Jr. (2008).

'''Cost accounting''' is the process of recording, classifying, analyzing, summarizing, and allocating costs associated with a process, and then developing various courses of action to control the costs. Its goal is to advise the [[management]] on how to optimize business practices and processes based on cost efficiency and capability. Cost accounting provides the detailed cost information that management needs to control current operations and plan for the future.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books ?id=G9msXSOdIa8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cost+accounting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G30wUc1mwZzQBaiTgdgJ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cost%20accounting&amp;f=false |title=Principles of Cost Accounting - Edward J. Vanderbeck - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since managers are making decisions only for their own organization, there is no need for the information to be comparable to similar information from other organizations. Instead, information must be relevant for a particular environment. Cost accounting information is commonly used in [[financial accounting]] information, but its primary function is for use by managers to facilitate making decisions.

==Origins==
All types of businesses, whether service, manufacturing or trading, require cost accounting to track their activities.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Cost accounting has long been used to help managers understand the [[cost]]s of running a business. Modern cost accounting originated during the [[industrial revolution]], when the complexities of running a large scale business led to the development of systems for recording and tracking costs to help business owners and managers make decisions.

In the early industrial age, most of the costs incurred by a business were what modern accountants call "[[variable cost]]s" because they varied directly with the amount of production. Money was spent on labor, raw materials, power to run a factory, etc. in direct proportion to production. Managers could simply total the variable costs for a product and use this as a rough guide for decision-making processes.

Some costs tend to remain the same even during busy periods, unlike variable costs, which rise and fall with volume of work. Over time, these "[[fixed cost]]s" have become more important to managers. Examples of fixed costs include the depreciation of plant and equipment, and the cost of departments such as maintenance, tooling, production control, purchasing, quality control, storage and handling, plant supervision and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kapalan publishing UK. Pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, these costs were of little importance to most businesses. However, with the growth of railroads, steel and large scale manufacturing, by the late nineteenth century these costs were often more important than the variable cost of a product, and allocating them to a broad range of products led to bad decision making. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions about products and pricing.

For example: A company produced railway coaches and had only one product. To make each coach, the company needed to purchase $60 of raw materials and components, and pay 6 laborers $40 each. Therefore, total variable cost for each coach was $300. Knowing that making a coach required spending $300, managers knew they couldn't sell below that price without losing money on each coach. Any price above $300 became a contribution to the fixed costs of the company. If the fixed costs were, say, $1000 per month for rent, insurance and owner's salary, the company could therefore sell 5 coaches per month for a total of $3000 (priced at $600 each), or 10 coaches for a total of $4500 (priced at $450 each), and make a profit of $500 in both cases.

== Cost accounting vs financial accounting==
{{see also|Financial accounting}}
*Financial accounting computes the current or accounting period status and results, in the form of Profit and Loss, Account, and Balance Sheet. Cost Accounting computes the cost of production/service in a rigorous manner and facilitates cost control and cost reduction.
*Financial accounting reports the results and position of business to  government, creditors, investors, and external parties. Cost Accounting is an internal reporting system for an organization’s own management for decision making.
*In financial accounting, cost classification is based on type of transactions, e.g. salaries, repairs, insurance, offices, travel, stores etc. In cost accounting, classification is based on functions, activities, products, process and on internal planning and control and information needs of the organization.
*Financial accounting aims at presenting ‘true and fair’ view of  transactions,  profit and loss for a period and Statement of financial position (Balance Sheet) on a given date.  It aims at computing ‘true and fair’ view of the cost of production/services offered by the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cost and Management Accounting. Intermediate|publisher=ICA|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost accounting is analysis based and may combine objective and subjective assessment of the costs contributing to a standard result

== Types of cost accounting ==
The following are different cost accounting approaches:
* [[Standard cost accounting]]
* [[Activity-based costing]]
* [[Resource consumption accounting]]
* [[Throughput accounting]]
* [[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costing]]
* [[Environmental accounting]]
* [[Target costing]]

==Elements of cost accounting ==

Basic cost elements are:
# [[Raw Material]]
# [[Manual labor]]
# [[expenses]] and other [[Operating cost|overhead]]

* Material
** Direct material
** Indirect material
* Labor
** Direct labor
** Indirect labor
* [[Operating cost|Overhead]] (Variable/Fixed)
** Production or works overhead including factory staff
** Administration overhead including office staff
** Sales overhead including production and maintenance of cataloges, advertising (development and purchases), exhibitions, sales staff, cost of money
** Distribution overhead
** Maintenance and repair including office equipment and factory machinery
** Supplies
** Utilities including gas, electric, water, sewer, and municipal assessments 
** Other variable expenses
** Salaries/payroll including wages, pensions, and paycheck deductions (e.g., NI and PAYE in the UK, FICA in the US)
** [[Occupancy]] (rent, mortgage, property taxes)
** Depreciation  (durable goods including machinery and office equipment)
** Other fixed expenses

These categories are flexible and sometimes overlapping. For example, in some companies, machine cost is segregated from overhead and reported as a separate element altogether, and payroll costs are sometimes separated form other production costs.

==Classification of costs==
Classification of cost means, the grouping of costs according to their common characteristics. The important ways of classification of costs are:
# By Nature or Traceability: Direct Costs and [[Indirect costs]]. Direct Costs are Directly attributable/traceable to [[Cost object]]. Direct costs are assigned to Cost Object.  Indirect Costs are not directly attributable/traceable to Cost Object. Indirect costs are allocated or apportioned to cost objects.
# By Functions: production,administration, selling and distribution, R&amp;D.
# By Behavior: fixed, variable, semi-variable. Costs are classified according to their behavior in relation to change in relation to production volume within given period of time. Fixed Costs remain fixed irrespective of changes in the production volume in given period of time. Variable costs change according to volume of production. Semi-variable costs are partly fixed and partly variable.
# By control ability: controllable, uncontrollable costs. Controllable costs are those which can be controlled or influenced by a conscious management action. Uncontrollable costs cannot be controlled or influenced by a conscious management action.
# By normality: normal costs and  abnormal costs. Normal costs arise during routine day-to-day business operations. Abnormal costs arise because of any abnormal activity or event not part of routine business operations. E.g. costs arising of floods, riots, accidents etc.
# By Time: [[Historical costs]] and predetermined costs. Historical costs are costs incurred in the past. Predetermined costs are computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements. Example: Standard Costs.
# By Decision making Costs: These costs are used for managerial decision making.And these are :- 
*[[Marginal costs]]: Marginal cost is the change in the aggregate costs due to change in the volume of output by one unit.
*Differential costs: This cost is the difference in total cost that will arise from the selection of one alternative to the other.
*Opportunity costs: It is the value of benefit sacrificed in favor of an alternative course of action.
*Relevant cost: The relevant cost is a cost which is relevant in various decisions of management.
*Replacement cost: This cost is the cost at which existing items of material or fixed assets can be replaced. Thus this is the cost of replacing existing assets at present or at a future date.
*Shutdown cost:These costs are the costs which are incurred if the operations are shut down and they will disappear if the operations are continued.
*Capacity cost: These costs are normally fixed costs. The cost incurred by a company for providing production, administration and selling and distribution capabilities in order to perform various functions.
*Sunken cost: cost already incurred
* Other costs

==Standard cost accounting==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=quality|date=July 2018}}
{{main|Standard cost accounting}}
In modern cost account of recording historical costs was taken further, by allocating the company's fixed costs over a given period of time to the items produced during that period, and recording the result as the total cost of production. This allowed the ''full cost'' of products that were not sold in the period they were produced to be recorded in inventory using a variety of complex accounting methods, which was consistent with the principles of [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|GAAP]] (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). It also essentially enabled managers to ignore the fixed costs, and look at the results of each period in relation to the "standard cost" for any given product.

:For example: if the railway coach company normally produced 40 coaches per month, and the fixed costs were still $1000/month, then each coach could be said to incur an Operating Cost/overhead of $25 =($1000 / 40). Adding this to the variable costs of $300 per coach produced a full cost of $325 per coach.

This method tended to slightly distort the resulting unit cost, but in mass-production industries that made one product line, and where the fixed costs were relatively low, the distortion was very minor.

:For example: if the railway coach company made 100 coaches one month, then the unit cost would become $310 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 100)). If the next month the company made 50 coaches, then the unit cost = $320 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 50)), a relatively minor difference.

An important part of standard cost accounting is a [[Variance analysis (accounting)|variance analysis]], which breaks down the variation between actual cost and standard costs into various components (volume variation, material cost variation, labor cost variation, etc.) so managers can understand ''why costs were different from what was planned'' and take appropriate action to correct the situation.

==The development of throughput accounting==
{{main|Throughput accounting}}

As business became more complex and began producing a greater variety of products,
the use of cost accounting to make decisions to maximize profitability came into question. Management circles became increasingly aware of the [[Theory of Constraints]] in the 1980s, and began to understand that "every production process has a limiting factor" somewhere in the chain of production. As business management learned to identify the constraints, they increasingly adopted [[throughput accounting]] to manage them and "maximize the ''throughput dollars''" (or other currency) from each unit of constrained resource.
Throughput accounting aims to make the best use of scarce resources(bottle neck) in a (JIT) Just in time environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kapalan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical Formula ===

''''''
:&lt;math&gt;\text{throughput accounting ratio} = \frac{\text{return}}{\text {factory hours}}&lt;/math&gt;
(20/10)

==Activity-based costing==
{{main|Activity-based costing}}
[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) is a system for assigning costs to products based on the activities they require. In this case, activities are those regular actions performed inside a company.&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; "Talking with customer regarding invoice questions" is an example of an activity inside most companies.

Companies may be moved to adopt ABC by a need to improve costing accuracy, that is, understand better the true costs and profitability of individual products, services, or initiatives. ABC gets closer to true costs in these areas by turning many costs that standard cost accounting views as indirect costs essentially into direct costs. By contrast, standard cost accounting typically determines so-called indirect and overhead costs simply as a percentage of certain direct costs, which may or may not reflect actual resource usage for individual items.

Under ABC, accountants assign 100% of each employee's time to the different activities performed inside a company (many will use surveys to have the workers themselves assign their time to the different activities). The accountant then can determine the total cost spent on each activity by summing up the percentage of each worker's salary spent on that activity.

A company can use the resulting activity cost data to determine where to focus their operational improvements. For example, a job-based manufacturer may find that a high percentage of its workers are spending their time trying to figure out a hastily written customer order. Via (ABC) Activity based costing, the accountants now have a currency amount pegged to the activity of "Researching Customer Work Order Specifications". Senior management can now decide how much focus or money to budget for resolving this process deficiency. [[Activity-based management]] includes (but is not restricted to) the use of activity-based costing to manage a business.

While (ABC) Activity based costing may be able to pinpoint the cost of each activity and resources into the ultimate product, the process could be tedious, costly and subject to errors.

As it is a tool for a more accurate way of allocating fixed costs into product, these fixed costs do not vary according to each month's production volume. For example, an elimination of one product would not eliminate the overhead or even direct labor cost assigned to it.Activity based costing (ABC) better identifies product costing in the long run, but may not be too helpful in day-to-day decision-making.

== Integrating EVA and Process Based Costing ==

Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012).&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Mocciaro Li Destri A., Picone P. M. &amp; Minà A. (2012), Bringing Strategy Back into Financial Systems of Performance Measurement: Integrating EVA and PBC, Business System Review, Vol 1., Issue 1. pp.85-102.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the Economic Value Added criteria with Process Based Costing (PBC). The EVA-PBC methodology allows us to implement the EVA management logic not only at the firm level, but also at lower levels of the organization. EVA-PBC methodology plays an interesting role in bringing strategy back into financial performance measures.

==Lean accounting==
{{main|Lean accounting}}

[[Lean accounting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|journal=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed in recent years to provide the accounting, control, and measurement methods supporting [[lean manufacturing]] and other applications of lean thinking such as healthcare, construction, insurance, banking, education, government, and other industries.

There are two main thrusts for Lean Accounting. The first is the application of lean methods to the company's accounting, control, and measurement processes. This is not different from applying lean methods to any other processes. The objective is to eliminate waste, free up capacity, speed up the process, eliminate errors &amp; defects, and make the process clear and understandable.
The second (and more important) thrust of Lean Accounting is to fundamentally change the accounting, control, and measurement processes so they motivate lean change &amp; improvement, provide information that is suitable for control and decision-making, provide an understanding of customer value, correctly assess the financial impact of lean improvement, and are themselves simple, visual, and low-waste. Lean Accounting does not require the traditional management accounting methods like [[standard costing]], activity-based costing, variance reporting, cost-plus pricing, complex transactional control systems, and untimely &amp; confusing financial reports. These are replaced by:
* lean-focused performance measurements
* simple summary direct costing of the value streams
* decision-making and reporting using a ''box score''
* financial reports that are timely and presented in "plain English" that everyone can understand
* radical simplification and elimination of transactional control systems by eliminating the need for them
* driving lean changes from a deep understanding of the value created for the customers
* eliminating traditional budgeting through monthly sales, operations, and financial planning processes (SOFP)
* value-based pricing
* correct understanding of the financial impact of lean change

As an organization becomes more mature with lean thinking and methods, they recognize that the combined methods of lean accounting in fact creates a lean management system (LMS) designed to provide the planning, the operational and financial reporting, and the motivation for change required to prosper the company's on-going lean transformation.

==Marginal costing==
{{see also|Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis|Marginal cost}}

The cost-volume-profit analysis is the systematic examination of the relationship between selling prices, sales, production volumes, costs, expenses and profits. This analysis provides very useful information for decision-making in the management of a company. For example, the analysis can be used in establishing sales prices, in the product mix selection to sell, in the decision to choose marketing strategies, and in the analysis of the impact on profits by changes in costs. In the current environment of business, a business administration must act and take decisions in a fast and accurate manner. As a result, the importance of cost-volume-profit is still increasing as time passes.

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN''

A relationship between the cost, volume and profit is the contribution margin. The contribution margin is the revenue excess from sales over variable costs. The concept of contribution margin is particularly useful in the planning of business because it gives an insight into the potential profits that a business can generate. The following chart shows the income statement of a company X, which has been prepared to show its contribution margin:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Sales || $1,000,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $600,000
|-
| Contribution Margin || $400,000
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $100,000
|}

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN RATIO''

The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage. The contribution margin ratio, which is sometimes called the profit-volume ratio, indicates the percentage of each sales dollar available to cover fixed costs and to provide operating revenue. For the company Fusion, Inc. the contribution margin ratio is 40%, which is computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Contribution Margin Ratio} = (\text{Sales - Variable Costs}) / \text{Sales}&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution margin ratio measures the effect on operating income of an increase or a decrease in sales volume. For example, assume that the management of Fusion, Inc. is studying the effect of adding $80,000 in sales orders. Multiplying the contribution margin ratio (40%) by the change in sales volume ($80,000) indicates that operating income will increase $32,000 if additional orders are obtained. To validate this analysis the table below shows the income statement of the company including additional orders:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Sales || $1,080,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $648,000 (1,080,000 x 60%)
|-
| Contribution Margin || $432,000 (1,080,000 x 40%)
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $132,000
|}

Variable costs as a percentage of sales are equal to 100% minus the contribution margin ratio. Thus, in the above income statement, the variable costs are 60% (100% - 40%) of sales, or $648,000 ($1,080,000 X 60%). The total contribution margin $432,000, can also be computed directly by multiplying the sales by the contribution margin ratio ($1,080,000 X 40%).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Craig Stapleton was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Katherine Histed Hall and Benjamin Franklin Stapleton Jr. His grandfather, [[Benjamin F. Stapleton]], was a politician who served five terms as mayor of [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="treasurer"&gt;{{cite news | title = Businessman Stapleton to Run for Colorado Treasurer | publisher = Denver Business Journal | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/04/06/daily21.html | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | first=Ed | last=Sealover | date=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his secondary school education at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and a B.A. (magna cum laude) from [[Harvard University]]. He received his M.B.A. from [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name="officialbio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ambassador Craig Roberts Stapleton | publisher = United States Department of State | url = http://france.usembassy.gov/ambassador/default.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Dorothy Walker Stapleton, is a [[cousin chart|first cousin]] of former [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[George H.W. Bush]].

===Career===
He served as President of [[Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies|Marsh and McLennan Real Estate Advisors of New York]] from 1982 until 2001. From 1989 to 1998 Stapleton co-owned the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[baseball]] team with [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="officialbio"/&gt; He has served on the [[board of directors]] for several companies including [[Allegheny Properties]], [[Metro PCS]], [[TB Woods]] and [[Winston Partners]].&lt;ref name="officialbio"/&gt; In July 2009, he became a co-owner of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref name="ambassadorsbio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Craig R. Stapleton | publisher = Council of American Ambassadors | url = http://www.americanambassadors.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Members.view&amp;memberid=319 | accessdate = 2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the administration of George H.W. Bush, Stapleton sat on the Board of the [[Peace Corps]]. He served as ambassador to the [[Czech Republic]] from August 2001 to December 2003.&lt;ref name="statedep"&gt;{{cite web | title = Craig Robert Stapleton | publisher = Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State | url = https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/stapleton-craig-robert | accessdate = 2017-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was the [[Connecticut]] State Chairman for the [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-[[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] reelection campaign. In June 2005 he was appointed ambassador to France and served until January 29, 2009.&lt;ref name="statedep"/&gt; He is a member of [[CERGE-EI]] Foundation supporting economic education in transition and developing countries.

In 2007 he recommended to the Bush administration that they wage a trade war on European crops, due to European resistance to [[genetically modified foods]] such as [[MON 810]], thus denying a key US export.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite news | title = WikiLeaks: U.S. Wanted Trade War Over GM Crops | publisher = CBS News | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/04/world/main7211185.shtml | accessdate = 2011-01-04 | date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ambassador Stapleton goes on to write, quote, "Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term, since we should not expect an early victory," he wrote."

Stapleton made an appearance on the [[Food Network]] show, ''[[The Next Iron Chef]]'' in 2007. The final three chefs remaining in the competition each prepared a three-course American-themed dinner for the ambassador and 20 guests. The competition took place in the ambassador's official residence.&lt;ref name="ironchef"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Lead and Inspire | series = The Next Iron Chef | serieslink = The Next Iron Chef | airdate = 2007-11-04 | season = 1 | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
He and his wife live in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and have two adult children; his son [[Walker Stapleton]] was elected [[Colorado State Treasurer]] in [[Colorado elections, 2010|2010]].

'''David Wallace''' (October 6, 1908 &amp;ndash; October 6, 1974 in [[Taormina]], Sicily), was hired in 1955 by [[Ford Motor Company]] as manager of product planning and merchandising its protégé{{clarify|date=May 2015}} car debuting in 1957. At the end the name chosen was [[Edsel]].

Given the responsibility of researching potential names and being frustrated by conventional research, Wallace secured the aid of poet [[Marianne Moore]] who did not disappoint with such suggestions as Mongoose Civique, Resilient Bullet, Andante con Moto and Utopian Turtletop among others.   The entire correspondence was later reproduced in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (April 13, 1957, pp 130–136).  It was up to Wallace to inform Miss Moore of Ford’s final choice which he did in this pungent letter:

''November 8, 1956

''Dear Miss Moore,

''Because you were so kind to us in our early and hopeful days of looking for a suitable name, I feel a deep obligation to report on events that have ensued.

''And I feel I must do so before the public announcement of same come Monday, November 19.

''We have chosen a name out of the more than six thousand-odd candidates that we gathered. It has a certain ring to it.   It fails somewhat of the resonance, gaiety, and zest we were seeking.  But it has a personal dignity and meaning to many of us here. Our name, dear Miss Moore, is—Edsel.

''I hope you will understand.

''Cordially,

''David Wallace,''

''Special Products Division (The New Yorker, April 17, 1957, p 136)''

Wallace later wrote of his experiences with Ford Motor Co. in Automotive Quarterly, "Something went wrong. History had never witnessed anything like it before.  More money was spent in its launching than any other previous product offered upon the consumer market anywhere – a quarter of a billion dollars.  It was to be the most perfectly conceived automobile the world had ever seen – every part of its planning guided by public opinion polls, motivational research, Science.  It did not work out that way…"  (Automobile Quarterly, 1975, Vol. XIII, No. 2, “Naming the Edsel”, p.&amp;nbsp;182-191)

In contract law, a typical drop dead date example is the contract for the baking of a birthday cake, where it is implied that a late delivery will constitute a material breach.

In German and Swiss Law, this is called a "Fixgeschäft".

'''Ella Lyman Cabot''' (1866–1934) was an educator, author and lecturer. She was born into a prominent [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] family in Boston and was the fourth of seven children. Her parents, Ella (Lowell) Lyman and Arthur Theodore Lyman, owned a family estate in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

==Education==
Cabot was educated in Boston private schools and attended [[Radcliffe College]] as a special student from 1889 to 1891 and took graduate courses at [[Harvard College]] from 1897 to 1903.

==Career==
In 1897, Cabot began her career as an educator of ethics and applied psychology. She taught at Boston private schools and at [[Pine Manor Junior College]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] as well as directed Sunday school at [[King's Chapel]].

Cabot served on the governing boards of Radcliffe College from 1902 to 1934, and on the [[Massachusetts Board of Education]] from 1905 to 1934. Among the numerous other organizations in which she held office were the Women's Education Association of Massachusetts, the Unitarian Sunday School Association, the Unitarian Temperance Society, and the National Religious Education Association.

Cabot also published seven books on ethics and childhood education between 1906 and 1929, a privately printed three-volume biography of her parents, and many articles and pamphlets.

==Family and personal life ==
On October 26, 1894,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua02998 "Cabot, Richard C. (Richard Clarke), 1868-1939. Papers of Richard Clarke Cabot : an inventory,"] Harvard University archives. Accessed Jan. 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; she married Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] (1868–1939), physician and professor of medicine and social ethics at Harvard. The Cabots made their home first on Marlborough St. in Boston and then on [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]] in Cambridge. They also spent time in [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]], and at the Cabot family house in [[North East Harbor, Maine]], and camped on Spruce Island, [[Saranac, New York]], during many summers. They decided to not have children.

Richard Clarke Cabot and Ella Lyman Cabot were both prolific letter-writers. Their lifelong correspondence, from the beginning of their courtship in 1888 through the year of Cabot's death, documents her ambivalent feelings about leaving her own family to accept Richard's proposal of marriage, and their initial disagreement about having children. The letters also clearly show their nearly fifty years of shared religious and philosophical inspiration, and their emotional reliance upon each other. During the last 15 years of Cabot's life the correspondence consists largely of birthday and Christmas letters.

Cabot's correspondence with friends attests to the intimate and supportive relationships she had with some women, notably Ada Pierce McCormick, a Radcliffe classmate and god-daughter of Richard who remained a close friend for more than 30 years, and Cabot's cousin Mary Pratt Sears, a lifelong friend with whom Cabot corresponded from the age of 13. This portion of Series III also contains letters, some to both Cabot and Richard, from a wide variety of friends and acquaintances; some are personal, and others are about charitable donations, lecture invitations, and board meetings.

She died from [[lung cancer]] in the fall of 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Crenner, Christopher. ''Private Practice: In the Early Twentieth-Century Medical Office of Dr. Richard Cabot'' (JHU Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

ERT is currently available for some lysosomal storage diseases: [[Gaucher's disease|Gaucher disease]], [[Fabry disease]], [[Mucopolysaccharidosis|MPS I]], [[Hunter syndrome|MPS II (Hunter syndrome)]], [[Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome|MPS VI]] and [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT does not correct the underlying genetic defect, but it increases the concentration of the enzyme that the patient is lacking.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT has also been used to treat patients with [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) resulting from an adenosine deaminase deficiency ([[Adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA-SCID]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17300989|year=2007|author1=Booth|first1=C|title=Management options for adenosine deaminase deficiency; proceedings of the EBMT satellite workshop (Hamburg, March 2006)|journal=Clinical Immunology|volume=123|issue=2|pages=139–47|last2=Hershfield|first2=M|last3=Notarangelo|first3=L|last4=Buckley|first4=R|last5=Hoenig|first5=M|last6=Mahlaoui|first6=N|last7=Cavazzana-Calvo|first7=M|last8=Aiuti|first8=A|last9=Gaspar|first9=H.

Other treatment options for patients with enzyme or protein deficiencies include [[substrate reduction therapy]], [[gene therapy]], and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone-marrow derived stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;]]

== History ==

ERT was developed in 1964 by Christian de Duve and Roscoe Brady.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Neufeld|first1= E. F. |date=2006|chapter=Chapter 10: Enzyme replacement therapy – a brief history|veditors= Mehta A, Beck M, Sunder-Plassmann G|title= Fabry  Disease: Perspectives from 5 Years of FOS|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford PharmaGenesis|isbn= 978-1-903539-03-3|pmid= 21290685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading work was done on this subject at the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta by Mark J. Poznansky and Damyanti Bhardwaj, where a model for enzyme therapy was developed using rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02783734|pmid= 6395807|year= 1984|author1= Poznansky|first1= M. J.|title= Enzyme-albumin polymers. New approaches to the use of enzymes in medicine|journal= Applied biochemistry and biotechnology|volume= 10|pages= 41–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERT was not used in clinical practice until 1991, after the FDA gave [[orphan drug]] approval for the treatment of Gaucher disease with [[Alglucerase]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  ERTs were initially manufactured by isolating the therapeutic enzyme from human placenta.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  The FDA has now approved ERTs that are derived from other human cells, animal cells (i.e. Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells), and plant cells.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Medical uses ==
[[Lysosomal storage disease]]s are fatal group of diseases and a main application of ERT.  [[Lysosome]]s are cellular organelles that are responsible for the metabolism of many different macromolecules and proteins.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=111–113|doi=10.4161/cib.20373|pmc=3376041|year=2012|author1=Weiss|first1=N|title=Cross-talk between TRPML1 channel, lipids and lysosomal storage diseases|journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology|volume=5|issue=2|pmid=22808310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They use enzymes to break down macromolecules, which are recycled or disposed.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; As of 2012, there are 50 lysosomal storage diseases, and more are still being discovered.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Lysosomal Storage Disorders – NORD (National Organization For Rare Disorders)". ''NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)''. Apr. 2017, from https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lysosomal-storage-disorders/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  These disorders arise because of genetic mutations that prevent the production of certain enzymes used in the lysosomes.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  The missing enzyme often leads to a build-up of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] within the body.  This can result in a variety of symptoms, many of which are severe and can affect the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;  Increasing the concentration of the missing enzyme within the body has been shown to improve the body's normal cellular metabolic processes and reduce substrate concentration in the body.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

ERT has also been successful in treating severe combined immunodeficiency caused by an adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=26684479|year=2016|author1=Tartibi|first1=H. M.|title=A 24-Year Enzyme Replacement Therapy in an Adenosine-deaminase-Deficient Patient|journal=Pediatrics|volume=137|issue=1|pages=e20152169|last2=Hershfield|first2=M. S.|last3=Bahna|first3=S. L.|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-2169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a fatal childhood disease that requires early medical intervention.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  When the enzyme adenosine deaminase is deficient in the body, the result is a toxic build-up of metabolites that impair [[lymphocyte]] development and function.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  Many ADA deficient children with SCID have been treated with the polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) enzyme.  This is a form of ERT that has resulted in healthier, longer lives for patients with ADA-SCID.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

== Administration ==
ERT is administered by IV infusion.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27384562|pmc=4964441|year=2016|author1=Coutinho|first1=M. F.|title=Less is More: Substrate Reduction Therapy for Lysosomal Storage Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1065|last2=Santos|first2=J. I.|last3=Alves|first3=S|doi=10.3390/ijms17071065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, infusions occur every week or every two weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  For some types of ERT, these infusions can occur as infrequently as every four weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Complications ==
ERT is not a cure for lysosomal storage diseases, and it requires lifelong IV infusions of the therapeutic enzyme.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This procedure is expensive; in the United States, it may cost over $200,000 annually.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; The distribution of the therapeutic enzyme in the body ([[biodistribution]]) after these IV infusions is not uniform.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The enzyme in less available to certain areas in the body, like the bones, lungs, brain.  For this reason, many symptoms of lysosomal storage diseases remain untreated by ERT, especially neurological symptoms.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Additionally, the efficacy of ERT is often reduced due to an unwanted immune response against the enzyme, which prevents metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

== Other treatments for enzyme deficiencies ==
Substrate reduction therapy is another method for treating lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  In this treatment, the accumulated compounds are inhibited from forming in the body of a patient suffering from a lysosomal storage disease.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The accumulated compounds are responsible for the symptoms of these disorders, and they form via a multi-step biological pathway.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Substrate reduction therapy uses a small molecule to interrupt this multi-step pathway and inhibit the biosynthesis of these compounds.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This type of treatment is taken orally.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  It does not induce an unwanted immune response, and a single type of small molecule could be used to treat many lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; Substrate reduction therapy is FDA approved and there is at least one treatment available on the market.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

Gene therapy aims to replace a missing protein in the body through the use of [[Vectors in gene therapy|vectors]], usually [[viral vector]]s.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;"How does gene therapy work? - Genetics Home Reference." U.S. National Library of Medicine. April 18, 2017, from https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/procedures.&lt;/ref&gt;  In gene therapy, a gene encoding for a certain protein is inserted into a vector.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; The vector containing the therapeutic gene is then injected into the patient.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  Once inside the body the vector introduces the therapeutic gene into host cells, and the protein encoded by the newly inserted gene is then produced by the body's own cells.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  This type of therapy can correct for the missing protein/enzyme in patients with lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is another treatment for lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt; HSCs are derived from bone-marrow.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Domen, J., Wagers, A., &amp; Weissman, I. "Bone Marrow (Hematopoietic) Stem Cells." April 19, 2017, from https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/2006chapter2.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have the ability to mature into the many cell types that comprise blood, including red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;  Patients suffering from enzyme deficiencies often undergo HSC transplantations in which HSCs from a healthy donor are injected.  This treatment introduces HSCs that regularly produce the deficient enzyme since they have normal metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26604151|year=2016|author1=Biffi|first1=A|title=Gene therapy for lysosomal storage disorders: A good start|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=25|issue=R1|pages=R65–75|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatment is often used to treat the central nervous system of patients with some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt;

'''Fritz Kaiser''' (born 22 March 1955 in [[Mauren]], [[Liechtenstein]]) is a wealth management entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist from the Principality of Liechtenstein. He is married to Birgit and has four children. He is co-founder and executive chairman of [[Kaiser Partner]], a wealth management firm that provides [[family office]] and wealth management services to private wealth owners and their advisors. Kaiser is an advocate for responsible wealth management and is well known for his innovation in this field. Specifically, in 2011, he won the [[Spear’s Magazine]] "Wealth Management Innovator of the Year" award for the successful instigation and development of the [[‘Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility’]] (LDF), a vehicle which promotes tax compliance by assisting UK taxpayers in the declaration of previously untaxed assets. He also co-founded the [[Mentor Foundation]], a leading international NGO voice of drug abuse prevention.

==Personal life==
Fritz Kaiser is married and has four children. In 1976 he represented Liechtenstein in Judo at the Montreal Olympics and he has retained an interest in sport throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Sports-Reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/fritz-kaiser-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017135553/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/fritz-kaiser-1.html |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df=dmy }}, Sports-reference.com, Athlete Finder.

==Career==
Fritz Kaiser completed a commerce degree (Handelsakademie) in Feldkirch, Austria and began his business career in 1977 at [[Präsidial-Anstalt]], one of the leading trust firms in Liechtenstein. In 1982 he established his own business, the [[Fritz Kaiser Group]] (FKG), providing wealth management services to private wealth owners, entrepreneurs and internationally famous personalities from the worlds of sport and art. Kaiser continued to pursue this interest in financial services through his purchase of the [[Diners Club]] credit card business in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. He served as a member of the Diners Club International Strategic Council at its licensor [[Citibank]], who he sold the company to in 1999. 
In 1995, Fritz Kaiser became co-owner of the Swiss Formula One racing team [[Sauber]], of which he was chairman from 1997-1999. During his F1 partnership time he successfully secured a contract with Red Bull in 1995, negotiated the Malaysian petroleum company [[PETRONAS]] as the main sponsor and engineering joint venture partner and developed the engine partnership with Ferrari. In 1999 he sold his share in the team to his partners, Peter Sauber and Dietrich Mateschitz (from [[Red Bull]])."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02204.html], 'Kaiser Leaves Sauber', www.grandprix.com.

In more recent years, Kaiser has worked to promote the cause of responsible wealth management with Kaiser Partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaiserpartner.com/], Kaiser Partner Media Center. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in Kaiser Partner===
Kaiser Partner, the international wealth management firm of which Fritz Kaiser is currently Executive Chairman, is founded on the principle of responsibility in wealth management. Kaiser Partner comprises several companies which provide integrated wealth management solutions including private banking, fund administration, financial advisory, family office, trust and asset management services. 
At the heart of the services offered by Kaiser Partner is Fritz Kaiser’s belief that it is the duty of wealth management firms to help families and their advisors responsibly grow and preserve private wealth. To support this mantra, Kaiser Partner runs a Responsible Investing blog which discusses global developments relating to sustainable and ethical investing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://responsible-investing-blog.com/?lang=en], Responsible Investing Blog, Kaiserpartner.com. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private Wealth Council===
Kaiser Partner is also affiliated with the [[Private Wealth Council]] which was founded by Fritz Kaiser during the Annual Meeting of the [[World Economic Forum]] 2004 in [[Davos]]. It is an independent, international forum bringing together private wealth owners, experts and thought leaders from across the world to address issues pertaining to the responsible use of private wealth. Since 2008, the Private Wealth Council has published the findings of its work in its international publication Responsible Wealth Review.
In the first issue, Al Gore, the former US Vice-President who now champions environmental issues, laid out nine drivers of global change which influence responsible wealth ownership. In an [[e-Financial News]] article from 2009, Kaiser commented that ‘If you understand the drivers of change and navigate on the right side of change then you have a better chance of being a successful long-term investor rather than just another gambler in the market’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2009-02-24/fritz-kaiser-responsible-wealth-crusader], 'Fritz Kaiser Responsible Wealth Crusader', Efinancialnews.com. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility==
Well known for his commitment to compliance and responsibility, in 2008 Fritz Kaiser was invited to join the Liechtenstein Governments' Advisory board for the initiative "Futuro" to help set the direction for the future of the Liechtenstein financial centre. He headed the Liechtenstein task force to develop a solution for the financial centre in collaboration with The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the outcome of which was a unique pledge of transparency to the OECD, called the Liechtenstein Declaration. 
With many clients in the global offshore markets struggling to find fair solutions for untaxed funds, Kaiser instigated a solution with the UK government known as the [[Liechtenstein disclosure facility|Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility (LDF)]]. This agreement would assist UK citizens with non-declared assets in their disclosure, making them HMRC compliant for a minimum penalty. This was clearly an attractive offering for those with offshore accounts, but its success could not have been predicted. UK taxpayers recognized that this was a non-discriminatory solution which could facilitate long-term wealth preservation and compliance.     
It was for this work that Fritz Kaiser and his colleague, former [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] lawyer Philip Marcovici, won the [[Spear’s Magazine]] Award for ‘Wealth Management Innovator of the Year 2011’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spearswms.com/wm-awards/27972/spears-wealth-management-awards-2011-winners.thtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301042010/http://www.spearswms.com/wm-awards/27972/spears-wealth-management-awards-2011-winners.thtml |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, 'Spears Wealth Management Awards 2011 Winners', spearswms.com.

[[File:Piec krepa.JPG|thumb|Industrial furnace from 1907.]]

A '''furnace''' is a device used for high-temperature heating. The name derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''fornax'', which means [[oven]]. The heat energy to fuel a furnace may be supplied directly by fuel [[combustion]], by electricity such as the [[electric arc furnace]], or through [[induction heating]] in [[induction furnace]]s.

In [[American English]] and [[Canadian English]] usage, the term ''furnace'' refers to the [[house]]hold heating systems based upon a central furnace, otherwise known either as a [[boiler]], or a [[heater]] in British English. ''Furnace'' may also be a synonym for [[kiln]], a device used in the production of [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]].

In [[British English]], a ''furnace'' is an [[industry|industrial]] furnace used for many things, such as the [[Resource extraction|extraction]] of [[metal]] from [[ore]] ([[smelting]]) or in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and other chemical plants, for example as the heat source for [[fractional distillation]] columns. The term ''furnace'' can also refer to a direct fired heater, used in boiler applications in chemical industries or for providing heat to [[chemical reaction]]s for processes like cracking, and is part of the standard [[English language|English]] names for many metallurgical furnaces worldwide.

==Categories==
Furnaces can be classified into four general categories, based on efficiency and design.

===Natural draft===

[[File:Lamneck-central-heating-gas-furnace-cutaway-diagram.png|thumb|left|140px|alt=A cutaway diagram of a Lamneck central heating gas furnace.|Diagram of natural draft gas furnace, early 20th century.]]The first category of furnaces are natural draft, atmospheric burner furnaces.  These furnaces consisted of cast-iron or riveted-steel heat exchangers built within an outer shell of brick, masonry, or steel. The heat exchangers were vented through brick or masonry chimneys. Air circulation depended on large, upwardly pitched pipes constructed of wood or metal. The pipes would channel the warm air into floor or wall vents inside the home. This method of heating worked because [[Natural convection|warm air rises]].

The system was simple, had few controls, a single automatic gas valve, and no blower. These furnaces could be made to work with any fuel simply by adapting the burner area. They have been operated with wood, coke, coal, trash, paper, natural gas, fuel oil as well as whale oil for a brief period at the turn of the century. Furnaces that used solid fuels required daily maintenance to remove ash and [[Clinker (waste)|"clinkers"]] that accumulated in the bottom of the burner area. In later years, these furnaces were adapted with electric blowers to aid air distribution and speed moving heat into the home. Gas and oil-fired systems were usually controlled by a thermostat inside the home, while most wood and coal-fired furnaces had no electrical connection and were controlled by the amount of fuel in the burner and position of the fresh-air damper on the burner access door.

===Forced-air===

The second category of furnace is the forced-air, atmospheric burner style with a cast-iron or sectional steel heat exchanger. Through the 1950s and 1960s, this style of furnace was used to replace the big, natural draft systems, and was sometimes installed on the existing gravity duct work. The heated air was moved by blowers which were belt driven and designed for a wide range of speeds. These furnaces were still big and bulky compared to modern furnaces, and had heavy-steel exteriors with bolt-on removable panels. Energy efficiency would range anywhere from just over 50% to upward of 65% [[Annual fuel utilization efficiency|AFUE]]. This style furnace still used large, masonry or brick chimneys for flues and was eventually designed to accommodate air-conditioning systems.

===Forced draft===

The third category of furnace is the forced draft, mid-efficiency furnace with a steel [[heat exchanger]] and multi-speed blower.  These furnaces were physically much more compact than the previous styles.  They were equipped with combustion air blowers that would pull air through the heat exchanger which greatly increased fuel efficiency while allowing the heat exchangers to become smaller.  These furnaces may have multi-speed blowers and were designed to work with central air-conditioning systems.[[File:Condensing furnace diagram.png|thumb|250px|A condensing furnace]]

===Condensing===

The fourth category of furnace is the high-efficiency, or condensing furnace.  High-efficiency furnaces can achieve from 89% to 98% fuel efficiency. This style of furnace includes a sealed combustion area, combustion draft inducer and a secondary [[heat exchanger]].  Because the heat exchanger removes most of the heat from the exhaust gas, it actually condenses water vapor and other chemicals (which form a mild acid) as it operates.  The vent pipes are normally installed with PVC pipe versus metal vent pipe to prevent corrosion. The draft inducer allows for the exhaust piping to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure.  The most efficient arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces include PVC piping that brings fresh combustion air from the outside of the home directly to the furnace.  Normally the combustion air (fresh air) PVC is routed alongside the exhaust PVC during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location. High efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25% to 35% fuel savings over a 60% [[Annual fuel utilization efficiency|AFUE]] furnace.

=== Furnace types ===

====Single-stage====
A single-stage furnace has only one stage of operation, it is either on or off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7R76DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2024&amp;dq=%C2%A0A+single-stage+furnace+has+only+one+stage+of+operation,+it+is+either+on+or+off&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim0NXVorHVAhUJj1QKHQWvD4EQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0A%20single-stage%20furnace%20has%20only%20one%20stage%20of%20operation,%20it%20is%20either%20on%20or%20off&amp;f=false|title=Home Repair Wisdom &amp; Know-How: Timeless Techniques to Fix, Maintain, and Improve Your Home|last=Homebuilding|first=Fine|date=2017-05-09|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=9780316362887|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is relatively noisy, always running at the highest speed, and always pumping out the hottest air at the highest velocity.

One of the benefits to a single-stage furnace is typically the cost for installation. Single-stage furnaces are relatively inexpensive since the technology is rather simple.

====Two-stage====
A two-stage furnace has to do two stage full speed and half (or reduced) speed. Depending on the demanded heat, they can run at a lower speed most of the time. They can be quieter, move the air at less velocity, and will better keep the desired temperature in the house.

====Modulating====
A modulating furnace can modulate the heat output and air velocity nearly continuously, depending on the demanded heat and outside temperature. This means that it only works as much as necessary and therefore saves energy.

==Heat distribution==
The furnace transfers heat to the living space of the building through an intermediary distribution system. If the distribution is through hot water (or other fluid) or through steam, then the furnace is more commonly called a [[Boiler#Hydronic boilers|boiler]]. One advantage of a boiler is that the furnace can provide hot water for bathing and washing dishes, rather than requiring a separate [[water heater]]. One disadvantage to this type of application is when the boiler breaks down, neither heating nor domestic hot water are available.

[[File:Octopus-style-heating-furnace-Snow-Hill-Maryland-USA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photo of an "octopus"-type hot-air furnace in a basement.|"Octopus" furnace with oil burner.]]Air convection heating systems have been in use for over a century.  Older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below, through air return registers in the floor, and the lesser density of warmed air causes it to rise in the ductwork; the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed 'gravity-fed'. The layout of these 'octopus’ furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts.

[[File:Gasfurnace.jpg|thumb|right|135px|alt=A photo of a modern forced-air gas furnace with associated ductwork nearby.|Forced-air gas furnace, design circa 1991.]]By comparison, most modern "warm air" furnaces typically use a [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] to circulate air to the rooms of house and pull cooler air back to the furnace for reheating; this is called [[forced-air]] heat. Because the fan easily overcomes the [[Friction|resistance]] of the ductwork, the arrangement of ducts can be far more flexible than the octopus of old. In American practice, separate ducts collect cool air to be returned to the furnace. At the furnace, cool air passes into the furnace, usually through an air filter, through the blower, then through the heat exchanger of the furnace, whence it is blown throughout the [[building]]. One major advantage of this type of system is that it also enables easy installation of central [[air conditioning]], simply by adding a cooling coil at the outlet of the furnace.

Air is circulated through [[Duct (HVAC)|ductwork]], which may be made of sheet metal or plastic "flex" duct, and is insulated or uninsulated. Unless the ducts and [[Plenum space|plenum]] have been sealed using mastic or foil duct tape, the ductwork is likely to have a high leakage of conditioned air, possibly into unconditioned spaces. Another cause of wasted energy is the installation of ductwork in unheated areas, such as attics and crawl spaces; or ductwork of air conditioning systems in attics in warm climates.

== Home furnaces ==
{{main article|Central heating}}A home furnace is a [[major appliance]] that is permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement, which may be [[air]], [[steam]], or hot [[water]]. Heating appliances that use steam or hot water as the fluid are normally referred to as a residential steam boiler or residential hot water boiler.  The most common [[fuel]] source for modern furnaces in North America and much of Europe is [[natural gas]]; other common fuel sources include [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] (liquefied petroleum gas), [[fuel oil]] and in rare cases [[coal]] or [[wood]]. In some areas [[electrical resistance]] heating is used, especially where the cost of electricity is low or the primary purpose is for air conditioning.

Modern high-efficiency furnaces can be up to 98% [[Thermal efficiency|efficient]] and operate without a chimney, with a typical gas furnace being about 80% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vdxw6PLk-msC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=high+efficiency+furnace+98%25&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNhPOMoPDQAhWJjVQKHTEGBUYQ6AEILTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=high%20efficiency%20furnace%2098%25&amp;f=false|title=Practical Heating Technology|last=Johnson|first=Bill|last2=Standiford|first2=Kevin|date=2008-08-28|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=141808039X|location=|pages=116|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste gas and heat are mechanically ventilated through PVC pipes that can be vented through the side or roof of the house. Fuel efficiency in a gas furnace is measured in [[Annual fuel utilization efficiency|AFUE]] (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency).

==Metallurgical furnaces==
[[File:The Manufacture of Iron -- Filling the Furnace.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Manufacture of Iron -- Filling the Furnace'', an 1873 [[wood engraving]]]]
In [[metallurgy]], several specialized furnaces are used. These include:
*Furnaces used in [[smelter]]s, including:
** The [[blast furnace]], used to [[redox|reduce]] [[iron ore]] to [[pig iron]]
** [[Steelmaking]] furnaces, including:
*** [[Puddling furnace]]
*** [[Reverberatory furnace]]
*** [[Bessemer converter]]
*** [[Open hearth furnace]]
*** [[Basic oxygen furnace]]
*** [[Electric arc furnace]]
*** [[Electric induction furnace]]
*Furnaces used to remelt metal in [[foundry|foundries]].
*Furnaces used to reheat and [[heat treatment|heat treat]] metal for use in:
** [[Rolling mill]]s, including [[tinplate]] works and [[slitting mill]]s.
** [[Forge]]s.
*[[Vacuum furnace]]s&lt;!-- Found at [[WP:DEP]], probably needs to be sorted into some category of furnaces? --&gt;

==Industrial furnaces==
{{main article|Industrial furnace}}
[[File:furnace2-en.svg|thumb|336x336px|Schematic diagram of an industrial process furnace]]

An industrial furnace or direct fired heater, is an equipment used to provide heat for a process or can serve as [[chemical reactor|reactor]] which provides heats of reaction. Furnace designs vary as to its function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air. However, most process furnaces have some common features.

Fuel flows into the [[Gas burner|burner]] and is burnt with air provided from an air blower. There can be more than one burner in a particular furnace which can be arranged in cells which heat a particular set of tubes. Burners can also be floor mounted, wall mounted or roof mounted depending on design. The flames heat up the tubes, which in turn heat the fluid inside in the first part of the furnace known as the radiant section or [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]. In this chamber where combustion takes place, the heat is transferred mainly by [[radiant energy|radiation]] to tubes around the [[fire]] in the chamber.

'''Huntingdon Life Sciences''' ('''HLS''') is a [[contract research organisation]] (CRO) founded in 1951 in Cambridgeshire, England. It has two laboratories in the United Kingdom and one in the United States. With over 1600 staff, it is now the largest non-clinical CRO in Europe.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrow.com/multimedia/archive/00068/DS239_68757a.pdf |title=AGROW'S 30 LEADING CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Huntingdon Life Sciences, [[Harlan (company)|Harlan Laboratories]], GFA, NDA Analytics and LSR associates merged into [[Envigo]].

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and is now in private ownership. Prior to this, the latest Annual Report (2008) showed that the company had revenues of $US242.4m and an Operating Profit of 14.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQbXuxCXzquQ | work=Bloomberg | title=LSR Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HLS is the third-largest non-clinical CRO in the world, it is probably better known to the general public as the target of a high-profile [[animal rights]] campaign. The campaign, in the main, has been orchestrated by the animal rights group [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC).&lt;ref name="SHAC website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net |title=SHAC website |publisher=Shac.net |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
HLS has two facilities in the UK ([[Huntingdon]], Cambridgeshire and Eye, Suffolk), one in the USA ([[East Millstone, New Jersey]]) and an office in Japan (Tokyo).

==History==
Huntingdon Life Sciences was founded in the UK in 1951 as Nutrition Research Co. Ltd., a commercial organisation that initially focused on [[nutrition]], [[veterinary]], and [[biochemical]] research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House in the town of Huntingdon, Cambs, UK; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station (just over a mile away). It then became involved with [[pharmaceuticals]], [[food additives]], and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd. The company benefited in the early 1960s from increased government regulatory testing requirements, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1964 it was acquired by the U.S. medical supply firm of Becton Dickinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/92/Huntingdon-Life-Sciences-Group-plc.html |title=HLS Group |publisher=Reference for Business |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1983, [[Becton Dickinson]] created Huntingdon Research Centre PLC. It then offered four million [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs) for sale at $15 each, representing the company's entire interest in Huntingdon. In 1985, as it began to expand its operations, the company changed its name to Huntingdon International Holdings plc. In that year it established Huntingdon Analytical Services Inc. to conduct business in the United States.

To augment its CRO business, Huntingdon acquired Minnesota's Twin City Testing Laboratory Inc. and affiliated companies in 1985, followed by the acquisition of Nebraska Testing Corporation in 1986; Travis Laboratories and Kansas City Test Laboratory Inc. in 1989; and Southwestern Laboratories, Inc. in 1990. Huntingdon also diversified its operations, primarily in the United States, becoming involved in engineering and environmental services.

In 1987, HLS purchased Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc., and then in 1988 bought Empire Soils Investigations Inc., Chen Associates Inc., and Asteco Inc. In 1988 HLS was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in 1989 obtained a listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1990 Huntingdon acquired the St. Louis branch of Envirodyne Engineers Inc. and Whiteley Holdings Ltd. And in 1991 it acquired Austin Research Engineers, Inc., followed by Travers Morgan Ltd.

By the early 1990s, Huntingdon was organised into three business groups: the Life Sciences Group, the Engineering/Environmental Group, and the Travers Morgan Group, which offered engineering and environmental consulting services outside of the United States. However, only the Life Sciences Group showed long-term promise. Travers Morgan was allowed to lapse into insolvency, control passed into other hands, and Huntingdon wrote off the investment. In 1995 the engineering and environmental businesses were sold to Maxim Engineers Inc. of Dallas, Texas.

To bolster its CRO business and reinforce its U.S. presence, Huntingdon in 1995 acquired the toxicology business of Applied Biosciences International for $32.5 million in cash, plus the Leicester Clinical Research Centre. The deal not only included a U.S. laboratory located near [[Princeton, New Jersey]], it brought with it two British facilities as well. In 1997 Huntingdon International Holdings changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group. The U.K. subsidiary, Huntingdon Research Centre, changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd., while the U.S. business operated as Huntingdon Life Sciences Inc.

In 2002, HLS moved its financial centre to the [[United States]] and incorporated in [[Maryland]] as Life Sciences Research.

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and once again is in private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;BusinessWire: Life Sciences Research, Inc. Announces Consummation of Going Private Transaction [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091124006124/en/Life-Sciences-Research-Announces-Consummation-Private-Transaction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core industries==
HLS provides [[Contract Research Organisation]] services in pre-clinical and non-clinical biological safety evaluation research. As with other major CROs operating in this business area, its major business is serving the pharmaceutical industry. However, more than a third of its business comes from non-pharmaceutical sources, the most important of which is the [[crop protection]] industry which accounts for around 60% of their non-pharmaceutical business.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"/&gt;

==Staff numbers==
The latest available public figures from 2008 show that HLS employs more than 1600 staff across all of its facilities. They break down as:&lt;ref&gt;HLS Annual Report 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of animals==
HLS uses animals in the biomedical research it conducts for its customers. The most recent numbers released state that in the UK around 60,000 animals are used annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html Huntingdon Life Sciences website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227223520/http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is broken down by species:

==Controversy==
Huntingdon is criticised by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] groups for using animals in research, for instances of [[animal abuse]] and for the wide range of substances it tests on animals, particularly non-medical products. It is claimed by SHAC that 500 animals died every day at HLS (182,500 a year),&lt;ref name="SHAC website 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net/news/2011/august/26-27.html |title=&gt;&gt; Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty |publisher=SHAC |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure at odds with HLS' published numbers.

Huntingdon's labs were infiltrated by [[undercover]] animal rights [[activists]] in 1997 in the UK and in 1998 in the US.

In 1997, film secretly recorded inside HLS in the UK by [[BUAV]] and subsequently broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television as "It's a Dog's Life", showed serious breaches of animal-protection laws, including a [[beagle]] puppy being held up by the scruff of the neck and repeatedly punched in the face, and animals being taunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |title=Small World TV |publisher=Small World TV |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308224555/http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory technicians responsible were suspended from HLS the day after the broadcast. All three were later dismissed.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4276376/The-men-who-stood-up-to-animal-rights-militants.html The men who stood up to animal rights' militants], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the men seen hitting and shaking dogs were found guilty under the Animals Act of 1911 of "cruelly terrifying dogs." It was the first time laboratory technicians had been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK. HLS admitted that the technicians' behaviour was deplorable and a new management team was introduced the following year which, according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "introduced greater openness and new training methods."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

In 1998, an undercover investigator for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) used a camera hidden in her glasses to make 50 hours of videotape of the HLS laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. She also made four 90-minute audiotapes, photocopied 8,000 company documents, and copied the company's client list. According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, [[Alan Staple]], said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/science/tough-tactics-in-one-battle-over-animals-in-the-lab.html|title=Tough Tactics In One Battle Over Animals In the Lab|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=24 March 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HLS obtained a "gagging order" in the US that prevents PETA from publicising or talking about any of the information that they discovered. The order also prevented PETA from communicating with the American Department of Agriculture, which had been going to investigate the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2465/is_2_31/ai_71634854/ |title=Seeing Is Believing - cruelty to dogs at Huntingdon Life Sciences, The Ecologist,March, 2001. |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests and intimidation===
The [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC) campaign is based in the UK and US, and has aimed to close the company down since 1999. According to its website, the campaign's methods are restricted to non-violent [[direct action]], as well as [[lobbying]] and demonstrations. It targets not only HLS itself, but any company, institution, or person allegedly doing business with the laboratory, whether as clients, suppliers, or even disposal and cleaning services, and the employees of those companies.

Despite its stated non-violent position, SHAC members have been convicted of crimes of violence against HLS employees. On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging [[arson]] and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child.&lt;ref name=Piercy125&gt;Piercy, Nigel. ''Market-Led Strategic Change: A Guide to Transforming the Process of Going to Market''. Butterworth-Heinemann 2002, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; HLS managing director [[Brian Cass]] was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades,&lt;ref name=Piercy125/&gt; and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1494924.stm Jail for lab boss attacker], BBC News, 16 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Another businessman with links to HLS was attacked and knocked unconscious adjacent to a barn his assailants had set alight.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

Both SHAC and [[Animal Liberation Front]] activists have engaged in [[harassment]] and [[intimidation]], including issuing hoax bomb threats and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=288432003 Counting the cost of fear], Scotland on Sunday, 9 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'' cites as an example the sending of 500 letters to the neighbours of a company manager who did business with HLS; the letter contained an unsupported allegation that the man was a paedophile, with police having to inform all 500 households that the allegations were false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html "The Animals of Hatred"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629082805/http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html |date=29 June 2006 }}, ''Daily Mail'', 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 seven of SHAC's senior members were described by prosecutors as "some of the key figures in the Animal Liberation Front" and found guilty of conspiracy to blackmail HLS.&lt;ref name="TimesYeoman"&gt;Fran Yeoman [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5391798.ece "Extremists face long jail sentences after blackmail conviction"], ''The Times'', 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of campaign===
The campaign against HLS led to its share price crashing, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] closing its bank account, and the British government arranging for the [[Bank of England]] to give them an account.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 2000, HLS was dropped from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because of its [[market capitalization]] had fallen below NYSE limits.&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, Will. [http://www.counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html "Green is the New Red"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408094959/http://counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html |date=8 April 2007 }}, ''Counterpunch'', 4 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
{{Expand section|reason= The government of the day responded to the 1997 investigative work, and additional responses were made before 2006|date=August 2012}}
From 2006, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reports, the British Government took the decision to tackle "the problem of animal rights extremism."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt; On 1 May 2007, a police campaign called ''Operation Achilles'' was enacted against SHAC, a series of raids involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,517875-2,00.html "Britain's other war on terror"], Spiegel online, 19 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 32 people linked to the group were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 "Animal rights extremism – police arrest 32 people"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074535/http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit press release, 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and seven leading members of SHAC, including [[Greg Avery]], were found guilty of blackmail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92cf1796-93d2-11dd-b277-0000779fd18c.html "Activists in live testing trial deny blackmail"], ''[[Financial Times]]'' 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Police estimated in 2007 that, as a consequence of the operation, "up to three quarters of the most violent activists" were jailed. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' writes that the number of attacks on HLS and their business declined drastically but "the movement is by no means dead."&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17066">'''Inventory management software''' is a [[software system]] for tracking [[inventory]] levels, orders, [[sales]] and deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/operations/inventory/article21852.html|last= Lesonsky|first=Rieva|title=Tracking Inventory|publisher=''Entrepreneur Magazine''|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used in the [[manufacturing]] industry to create a [[work order]], [[bill of materials]] and other production-related documents. Companies use inventory management software to avoid product [[overstock]] and outages. It is a tool for organizing inventory [[data]] that before was generally stored in hard-copy form or in [[spreadsheet]]s.

==Features==
Inventory management software is made up of several key components working together to create a cohesive inventory of many organizations' systems.  These features include:

===Reorder Point===
Should inventory reach a specific threshold, a company's inventory management system can be programmed to tell managers to reorder that product. This helps companies avoid running out of products or tying up too much capital in inventory.

===Asset tracking===
When a product is in a [[warehouse]] or store, it can be tracked via its [[barcode]] and/or other tracking criteria, such as [[serial number]], lot number or revision number. Systems. for Business, Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd ed.  Nowadays, inventory management software often utilizes [[barcode]], [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID), and/or [[wireless]] tracking technology.

===Service management===
Companies that are primarily service-oriented rather than product-oriented can use inventory management software to track the cost of the materials they use to provide services, such as cleaning supplies. This way, they can attach prices to their services that reflect the total [[cost]] of performing them.

===Product identification===
Barcodes are often the means whereby data on products and orders are inputted into inventory management software. A [[barcode reader]] is used to read barcodes and look up information on the products they represent.  [[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tags and [[wireless]] methods of product identification are also growing in popularity. 

Modern inventory software programs may use QR codes or NFC tags to identify inventory items and smartphones as scanners.{{cn|date=July 2016}} This method provides an option for businesses to track inventory using barcode scanning without a need to purchase expensive scanning hardware.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

=== Inventory optimization ===
A fully automated demand forecasting and inventory optimization system to attain key inventory optimization metrics such as:
* Reorder point: the number of units that should trigger a replenishment order{{cn|date=December 2015}}
* Order quantity: the number of units that should be reordered, based on the reorder point, stock on hand and stock on order{{cn|date=December 2015}}
* Lead demand: the number of units that will be sold during the lead time{{cn|date=December 2015}}
* Stock cover: the number of days left before a [[stockout]] if no reorder is made{{cn|date=December 2015}}
* Accuracy: the expected accuracy of the forecasts{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==History==
The [[Universal Product Code]] (UPC) was adopted by the grocery industry in April 1973 as the standard barcode for all grocers, though it was not introduced at [[retailing]] locations until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almyta.com/Inventory_Management_History_4.asp|last=Dolinsky|first=Anton|title=Inventory Management History Part Four|publisher=Almyta Systems|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped drive down costs for inventory management because retailers in the United States and Canada didn't have to purchase multiple barcode readers to scan competing barcodes. There was now one primary barcode for grocers and other retailers to buy one type of reader for.

In the early 1980s, [[personal computer]]s began to be popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1981.htm|last=Polsson|first=Ken|title=Chronology of Personal Computers – 1981|publisher=Polsson's WebWorld|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This further pushed down the cost of barcodes and readers. It also allowed the first versions of inventory management software to be put into place. One of the biggest hurdles in selling readers and barcodes to retailers was the fact that they didn't have a place to store the information they scanned. As computers became more common and affordable, this hurdle was overcome. Once barcodes and inventory management programs started spreading through [[grocery store]]s, inventory management by hand became less practical. Writing inventory data by hand on paper was replaced by scanning products and inputting information into a computer by hand.

Starting in the early 2000s, inventory management software progressed to the point where businesspeople no longer needed to input data by hand but could instantly update their database with barcode readers.

Also, the existence of [[cloud computing|cloud]] based business software and their increasing adoption by businesses mark a new era for inventory management software.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Now they usually allow integrations with other business backend processes, like accounting and [[online sales]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Purpose==
Companies often use inventory management software to reduce their carrying costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/economic_order_quantity.htm|last=Piasecki|first=Dave|title=Optimizing Economic Order Quantity – Carrying Costs|publisher=Inventoryops.com|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is used to track products and parts as they are transported from a vendor to a warehouse, between warehouses, and finally to a retail location or directly to a customer.

Inventory management software is used for a variety of purposes, including:
* Maintaining a balance between too much and too little inventory.
* Tracking inventory as it is transported between locations.
* Receiving items into a warehouse or other location.
* Picking, packing and [[shipping]] items from a warehouse.
* Keeping track of product sales and inventory levels.
* Cutting down on product [[obsolescence]] and spoilage.
* Avoiding missing out on sales due to out-of-stock situations.

==Manufacturing uses==
Manufacturers primarily use inventory management software to create work orders and bills of materials. This facilitates the manufacturing process by helping manufacturers efficiently assemble the tools and parts they need to perform specific tasks. For more complex manufacturing jobs, manufacturers can create multilevel work orders and bills of materials, which have a timeline of processes that need to happen in the proper order to build a final product. Other work orders that can be created using inventory management software include reverse work orders and auto work orders. Manufacturers also use inventory management software for tracking assets, receiving new inventory and additional tasks businesses in other industries use it for.

==Advantages of ERP inventory management software==
There are several advantages to using inventory management software in a business setting.

===Cost savings===
A company's inventory represents one of its largest investments, along with its [[workforce]] and locations. Inventory management software helps companies cut [[expense]]s by minimizing the amount of unnecessary parts and products in [[Warehouse|storage]]. It also helps companies keep lost sales to a minimum by having enough stock on hand to meet demand.

===Increased efficiency===
Inventory management software often allows for automation of many inventory-related tasks.  For example, software can automatically collect data, conduct [[calculations]], and create records.  This not only results in time savings, cost savings, but also increases business efficiency.

===Warehouse organization===
[[File:Visualizing Inventory in a Small Warehouse.png|thumb|As businesses move away from pen and paper processes to automated solutions, visibility becomes a key factor in inventory management.|343x343px]]Inventory management software can help [[distributors]], [[wholesale]]rs, manufacturers and retailers optimize their warehouses. If certain products are often sold together or are more popular than others, those products can be grouped together or placed near the delivery area to speed up the process of picking. 
By 2018, 66% of warehouses "are poised to undergo a seismic shift, moving from still prevalent pen and paper processes to automated and mechanized inventory solutions. With these new automated processes, cycle counts will be performed more often and with less effort, increasing inventory visibility, and leading to more accurate fulfillment, fewer out of stock situations and fewer lost sales. More confidence in inventory accuracy will lead to a new focus on optimizing mix, expanding a selection and accelerating inventory turns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tradegecko.com/recent-study-shows-66-warehouses-plan-expand-technology-investments-2018/|last=Lu | first=Clara | title=Recent Study Shows that 66% of Warehouses Plan to Expand Technology Investments by 2018 | publisher= TradeGecko Blog  | date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Updated data===
Up-to-date, [[real-time data]] on inventory conditions and levels is another advantage inventory management software gives companies. Company executives can usually access the software through a [[mobile device]], [[laptop]] or PC to check current inventory numbers.  This automatic updating of inventory records allows businesses to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventorysystemsoftware.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/3-advantages-inventory-management-software/|title=3 Advantages of Using Inventory Management Software|last=Lockard|first=Robert|date=29 November 2010|publisher=Inventory System Software Blog|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data security===
With the aid of restricted user rights, company managers can allow many employees to assist in inventory management. They can grant employees enough information access to receive products, make orders, transfer products and do other tasks without compromising company [[security]]. This can speed up the inventory management process and save managers' time.

===Insight into trends===
Tracking where products are stocked, which suppliers they come from, and the length of time they are stored is made possible with inventory management software. By analysing such data, companies can control inventory levels and maximize the use of warehouse space. Furthermore, firms are more prepared for the demands and supplies of the market, especially during special circumstances such as a peak season on a particular month. Through the reports generated by the inventory management software, firms are also able to gather important data that may be put in a model for it to be analyzed.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Disadvantages of ERP inventory management software==
The main disadvantages of inventory management software are its cost and complexity.

===Expense===
Cost can be a major disadvantage of inventory management software.  Many large companies use inventory management software, but small businesses can find it difficult to afford it. Barcode readers and other hardware can compound this problem by adding even more cost to companies. The advantage of allowing multiple employees to perform inventory management tasks is tempered by the cost of additional barcode readers. Use of smartphones as QR code readers has been a way that smaller companies avoid the high expense of custom hardware for inventory management.

===Complexity===
Inventory management software is not necessarily simple or easy to learn. A company's management team must dedicate a certain amount of time to learning a new system, including both software and hardware, in order to put it to use. Most inventory management software includes [[training manual]]s and other information available to users. Despite its apparent complexity, inventory management software offers a degree of stability to companies. For example, if an IT employee in charge of the system leaves the company, a replacement can be comparatively inexpensive to train compared to if the company used multiple programs to store inventory data.

== Benefits of cloud inventory management software ==
The main benefits of a cloud inventory management software include:

=== Real-time tracking of inventory ===
For startups and SMBs, tracking inventory in real time is very important. Not only can business owners track and collect data but also generate reports. At the same time, entrepreneurs can access cloud-based inventory data from a wide range of internet-enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, as well as traditional desktop PCs. In addition, users do not have to be inside business premises to use web-based inventory program and can access the inventory software while on the road.

=== Cut down hardware expenses ===
Because the software resides in the cloud, business owners do not have to purchase and maintain expensive hardware. Instead, SMBs and startups can direct capital and profits towards expanding the business to reach a wider audience. Cloud-based solutions also eliminate the need to hire a large IT workforce. The service provider will take care of maintaining the inventory software.

=== Fast deployment ===
Deploying web based inventory software is quite easy. All business owners have to do is sign up for a monthly or yearly subscription and start using the inventory management software via the internet. Such flexibility allows businesses to scale up relatively quickly without spending a large amount of money.

=== Easy integration ===
Cloud inventory management software allows business owners to integrate with their existing systems with ease. For example, business owners can integrate the inventory software with their eCommerce store or cloud-based accounting software. The rise in popularity of 3rd party marketplaces, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]] and [[Shopify]], prompted cloud-based inventory management companies to include the integration of such sites with the rest of a business owner's retail business, allowing one to view and control stock across all channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tamebay : Blog :    Brightpearl adds Amazon integration|url = http://tamebay.com/2013/04/brightpearl-adds-amazon-integration.html|website = tamebay.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/99540053/amazon-australia-opens--but-only-limited-goods-ship-to-new-zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhanced Efficiency ===
Cloud inventory systems increase efficiency in a number of ways. One is real-time inventory monitoring. A single change can replicate itself company-wide instantaneously. As a result, businesses can have greater confidence in the accuracy of the information in the system, and management can more easily track the flow of supplies and products – and generate reports. In addition, cloud-based solutions offer greater accessibility.

=== Improved Coordination ===
Cloud inventory programs also allow departments within a company to work together more efficiently. Department A can pull information about Department B's inventory directly from the software without needing to contact Department B's staff for the information. This inter-departmental communication also makes it easier to know when to restock and which customer orders have been shipped, etc. Operations can run more smoothly and efficiently, enhancing customer experience. Accurate inventory information can also have a huge impact on a company's bottom line. It allows you to see where the bottlenecks and workflow issues are – and to calculate break-even points as well as profit margins.

== Disadvantages of cloud inventory management software ==

=== Security and privacy ===
Using the cloud means that data is managed by a third party provider and there can be a risk of data being accessed by unauthorized users.

=== Dependency ===
Since maintenance is managed by the vendor, users are essentially fully dependent on the provider.

=== Decreased flexibility ===
Depending on the cloud service provider, system and software upgrades will be performed based on their schedule, hence businesses may experience some limitations in flexibility in the process.

=== Integration ===
Not all on-premises systems or service providers can be synced with the cloud software used.

'''Leopold Stanisław Kronenberg''' (born 24 March 1812 in [[Warsaw]], died 5 April 1878 in [[Nice]]) was a Polish banker, investor, and financier, and a leader of the 1863 [[January Uprising|January uprising]] against the [[Russian Empire]].

== Family ==
Kronenberg came from a wealthy family of Jewish rabbis. His father [[Samuel Eleazar Kronenberg]] (1773–1826) was a native of [[Wyszogród]] who led a small bank in Warsaw. His mother was Tekla, ''née'' Levi (1775–1848).

Kronenberg had seven siblings: Ludwik, Rozalia, Stanislaw Solomon, Dorota (the mother of [[Seweryn Loewenstein]]), Maria, [[Henryk Andrzej Kronenberg|Henryk Andrzej]], and [[Władysław Alfons Kronenberg|Władysław Alfons]].

After graduating from high school in Warsaw, Kronenberg studied at the University of Technology in Hamburg and at the [[University of Berlin]]. Having finished his studies in 1832, he returned to Poland and took up conducting business. In 1846 he converted from Judaism to Protestantism.

He married Ernestyna Rozalia Leo (1827–93), daughter of [[Leopold August Leo]], a prominent Polish Jew who had converted to Lutheranism. They had six children:  [[Stanisław Leopold Kronenberg|Stanisław Leopold]] (1846–94), entrepreneur; [[Władysław Edward Kronenberg|Władysław Edward]] (1848–92), musician and philanthropist; [[Leopold Julian Kronenberg|Leopold Julian]] (1849–1937), banker; Tekla Julia (1851–52); Maria Róża (1854–1944)—wife of Karol Zamoyski, and subsequently of [[Gustaw Taube]]—hostess of a famous Warsaw literary salon; and Rozalia (born 1857), wife of [[Aleksander Orsetti]].

== Business ==
From 1839 to 1860, having obtained the concession of the tobacco monopoly in the Kingdom of Poland, Kronenberg amassed a considerable fortune which he used to develop the country's economy: sugar industry, construction of railways, commercial activities, and banking sectors. He was also involved in the rural economy by participating in the work of the Agricultural Society. In 1859, Leopold Kronenberg made his entry into the world of the press by buying the newspaper ''Gazeta Codzienna'', renamed in 1861 as ''Gazeta Polska''. It was a magazine with a liberal-democratic tint, whose editor was [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]].

Kronenberg financially supported the [[January Uprising|January uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. After the failure of this revolt, he became a representative of the "white" faction that favored a compromise with the Russians. In 1870, Kronenberg founded [[Bank Handlowy]], the commercial bank of Warsaw, and in 1875 he founded the [[Warsaw School of Economics]].  He also founded the Credit Corporation of Warsaw, Industrial Cashier, Warsaw Fire Insurance Company, Coal Mine Association and Metallurgical Works.

He was a shareholder in mining, metallurgical and sugar companies. He built many sugar factories, and in 1870 was the initiator of the establishment of the Warsaw Sugar Factory Association. He was a member of the National Debt Relief Commission, the Industrial Council of the Government Commission for Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Poland. He was a member of the board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Senior Merchants' Assembly, the chairman of the Warsaw-Tiraspol Railway Management Board. He was the president of the Warsaw Philanthropic Society.

Between 1868 and 1871, he built in Warsaw a monumental home, Kronenberg Palace, which burned in September 1939 and was dismantled in the 1960s.

Kronenberg died in 1878 in Nice. He was buried in the Kronenberg family chapel at the Evangelical-Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw.

'''The Mob Museum''', officially the '''National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement''', is a history museum located in [[Downtown Las Vegas|Downtown]] [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Opened on February 14, 2012, the Mob Museum is dedicated to featuring the artifacts, stories, and history of [[organized crime]] in the [[United States]], as well as the actions and initiatives by law enforcement to prevent such crimes. The museum is housed in the former [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]], which was built in 1933 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The museum is located on Stewart Avenue, two blocks north of [[Fremont Street]], the main artery of the downtown casino district.

Developed under the creative direction of Dennis Barrie, co-creator of the [[International Spy Museum]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the museum is governed by a non-profit board, the "300 Stewart Avenue Corporation," in partnership with the City of Las Vegas. The museum is dedicated to the contentious relationship between organized crime and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] within the historical context of Las Vegas and the entire United States.

[[File:Las Vegas Mob Museum 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the Museum]]

==History==
In 2000, the federal government sold the former post office and federal courthouse to the city for $1, with stipulations that the building be restored to its original look and be used for a cultural purpose.&lt;ref name="friess"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friess|first=Steve|title=Stimulus Money for a Mob Museum. Got a Problem?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10mob.html|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]], himself a former Mob defense attorney, had the idea for a mob museum in 2002.&lt;ref name="friess" /&gt;  The idea faced early opposition from [[Italian-American]] groups, while being supported by the [[FBI]], including the former head agent in Las Vegas, Ellen Knowlton, who joined as president of the museum's board.&lt;ref name="friess" /&gt;

The project budget was estimated at $50 million, including $26 million for restoring the building.&lt;ref name="friess" /&gt; Funding included federal, state, and local grants.&lt;ref name="friess" /&gt; Goodman generated controversy by suggesting that federal [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus money]] could be used for the museum.&lt;ref name="friess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ayres|first=Chris|title=Mayor of Las Vegas Oscar Goodman plans museum to the Mob|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5533170.ece|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum opened February 14, 2012 to the public at 2:00 PM. (The morning and day before were reserved for press and dignitary ceremonies.) Admission for adults starting at $19.95; starting at $13.95 for Nevada residents. As of July 2018, prices are $26.95 for adults, $20.95 for seniors and $16.95 for children with varying prices for other specific categories, groups and packages. NV Adult is $16.95

==Exhibits==

The centerpiece of the Mob Museum is the second floor courtroom, which was the location of one of fourteen national [[Kefauver Committee]] hearings to expose organized crime held in 1950 and 1951. The museum also acquired the brick wall where the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rackl|first=Lori|title=Vegas mayor bets new museum will be a hit|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/travel/3735909-502/vegas-mayor-bets-new-museum-will-be-a-hit.html|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other exhibits focus on Mob violence, casino money skimming operations, and wiretapping by law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morrison|first=Jane Ann|title=What will be on Mob Museum's cutting room floor?|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/what-will-be-on-mob-museum-s-cutting-room-floor_-89319867.html|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2018, a new exhibit called Organized Crime Today was added to the first floor following a major renovation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Where Mobsters Start Fresh with The Mob Museum's Ashley Miller| url=https://trending.virginholidays.co.uk/las-vegas/interview-the-mob-museum-las-vegas| publisher=Virgin Holidays| accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-guided tour commences on the third floor where the actual wall of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre is on display, accessible by elevator or stairs, and winds its way down to the second and first floors. Visitors can watch a film about the history of Organized Crime (beginning around the time of the passing of Prohibition). The main part of the exhibition consists of Mob-related photos with captions explaining the significance of the particular images, but also what individuals/events they were connected to.

[[File:Las Vegas Mob Museum Wall of Mobsters.JPG|thumb|left|Wall of Mobsters]]
The museum offers a wide array of thematically oriented sections addressing the Mob's involvement in  illegal activities such as gambling, drugs, prostitution or bootlegging and the efforts of the law enforcement to counteract and eliminate those criminal operations. Additionally the visitor is able to view some uniquely disturbing, otherwise rarely accessible material, for example the photographs of victims of the most famous murders credited to the Mafia (appropriately named "Mob's Greatest Hits"; these are quite graphic in nature, because they show the actual corpses of the deceased), as well as pictures and short biographies of the most popular and notorious gangster personalities. A special Wall located near the exit depicts images of all the actors, who portrayed well-known Mobsters in movies or series. A significant number of exhibits are interactive; there are also several stations situated throughout the museum, where relevant film footage is played on a loop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deesultimatereviews.com/the%20mob%20museum.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a gift shop on the first floor. Using photos, text, displays, interactive techniques, hands-on exhibits, and other first-class museum methods, the visitor learns about the history of organized crime, Prohibition and the business opportunity it provided.  Visitors learn about Las Vegas' first casinos, [[Howard Hughes]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the origins of the FBI, [[Al Capone]], [[Eliot Ness]], and much more.  A visitor can sit in a replica electric chair, listen to actual wire taps, train in a use of force training simulator and explore an interactive crime lab exhibit related to forensic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mob Museum|url=https://themobmuseum.org/case-files/the-exhibits/|website=The Mob Museum: the Exhibits|publisher=The Mob Museum|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolaes van Loo''' (1607 &amp;ndash; 1641), was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] brewer from Haarlem, best known today for his portrait by [[Frans Hals]].

==Biography==
[[File:WLANL - hajeka - Brouwerij "De Drie Lelien".jpg|thumb|Detail of a grisaille painting of the family brewery called ''De Drie Lelien'', by [[Jacob Matham]] in 1627. It could be either Nicolaes or his father standing in the doorway.]]
He was born in Haarlem as the oldest son of the brewer [[Johan Claesz Loo]] and Margriet Akersloot. Their family brewery was situated in the Vissersbocht on the [[Spaarne]] river and was called ''De Drie Lelien''. Nicolaes' brother [[Cornelis van Loo|Cornelis]] became mayor of Haarlem and his sister Risje married the son of the mayor of Delft, [[Florens Pieter van der Houff]]. Nicolaes was destined to inherit the family business, and in expectation of a merger with another local brewery, in 1640 he married [[Aletta Hannemans]], the rich widow of the brewer [[Jacob Pietersz Olycan]], but he died the following year, leaving his widow to carry on the business without him.

[[File:Decauville paul1626r3.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]
'''Paul Decauville''' (1846–1922) was a [[France|French]] engineer and businessman. He was also [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Evry-Petit Bourg and [[Senate (France)|senator]] from [[Seine-et-Oise]].

He is the founder of a manufacturing company that bears his name ([[Decauville]], established in 1875), producing industrial railways, locomotives, and cars.  By extension, the name is also used for his invention of a narrow gauge track railway system, the Decauville system, through the vast business acumen of its promoter.  His name was also used for a subsidiary, [[Voitures automobiles Decauville]], producing early automobiles. Decauville's name is further associated with the towns of [[Corbeil-Essonnes]] and [[Evry, Essonne]], on whose territories the company Decauville erected its factories, which he directed until 1885.

He founded a construction company in 1910 to exploit the patents it had obtained. This company, ''Comptoir d'outillage et de matériel à air comprimé'' (''Commercial establishmen for tools and compressed air equipment''), survived until the late 1980s. Another of his companies, ''Emidecau'', specializing in hydraulic presses, still exist.

In politics, Paul Decauville was [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Evry-Petit Bourg from 1881 to 1892. He was also Senator of Seine-et-Oise from 1890 to 1900, member of the Board of Customs, Secretary from 1897 to 1899. After leaving Paris, Paul Decauville served as mayor of the town of Saint-Léger (Manche).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15944">'''Pedro Moura Costa''' (born 1963, in Brazil) is an entrepreneur involved in environmental finance with a focus on the international efforts for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Of particular relevance, he was the founder and President of [[Ecosecurities|EcoSecurities]] Group Plc., one of the leading project developers for the international carbon markets, and has written widely about the policy and science of climate change mitigation, including contributions to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) reports.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, “[http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=292 IPCC]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USP, “[http://www.iea.usp.br/cienciasambientais/climatechangeandsouthamerica.pdf USP]”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Pre-Kyoto carbon emission reduction initiatives ==

Moura Costa’s involvement with the carbon emission reduction sector started in 1991, with the development of two of the first carbon forestry projects worldwide, namely the Innoprise-Face Foundation Rainforest Rehabilitation Project and the Innoprise-New England Power Reduced Impact Logging Project, both in Sabah, Malaysia. Moura Costa served as Senior Project Officer for Innoprise between 1991 and 1995, involved with both these projects.&lt;ref&gt;“EcoSystems Marketplace, [http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=3582&amp;section=home&amp;eod=1 EcoSystems Marketplace]”&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of ‘[[joint implementation]]’ of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction projects (also called "carbon offset projects") was launched at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED, “the Earth Summit”), the early carbon offset projects of the 1990s suffered from a lack of specialised services to support them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University, “[http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/about/pifs/symposia/fcfs/2010-fcfs-briefing-materials/moura-costa_gidebook.pdf Harvard University]”&lt;/ref&gt; One service of particular importance is that of independent verification of [[carbon offsets]], as offsets are dependent on proving a shift of behaviour in relation to a baseline (this shift is referred as "additionality", in the sector).

Moura Costa identified the absence of independent verification services as one of the limiting factors to the growth of the carbon market at that time, and in 1996 he developed the first carbon offset verification service worldwide, which was licensed to the Swiss certification company [[SGS S.A.|SGS]] (Société Générale de Surveillance). The first client for this certification service was the Costa Rican National GHG Mitigation Programme, developed by [[MINAE|OCIC]] (Costa Rican Office on Joint Implementation).&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC documents, “[http://unfccc.int/kyoto_mechanisms/aij/activities_implemented_jointly/items/2087.php UNFCC documents]”&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (see below), independent certification of carbon emission reductions became a mandatory requirement under the rules of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (i.e., the carbon credits of this mechanism are called CERs, meaning [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s).

To pursue the work with SGS and the government of Costa Rica, Moura Costa created [[Ecosecurities|EcoSecurities]], a company specialised in the development of greenhouse gas mitigation projects.

== Contribution to the CDM and carbon trading ==

EcoSecurities was founded in January 1997 by Moura Costa and environmental economist Marc Stuart&lt;ref&gt;EcoSecurities Annual Report 2006, “[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Assets/24031/annual%20report2006.pdf  EcoSecurities Annual Report 2006]”&lt;/ref&gt; to provide "environmental finance solutions". Twelve months later, in December 1997 the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was signed creating binding commitments for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions among industrialised countries. It also created the [[Flexible Mechanisms|Flexibility Mechanisms]], [[Joint Implementation]] and the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM), that enabled the creation and use of carbon credits from greenhouse gas emission reduction projects. Carbon trading gradually evolved from being a niche environmental activity to becoming a global market that in 2010 mobilised over €120 billion, including trades under the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] and the UN flexibility mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Commodities Now magazine, 2010, “[http://www.commodities-now.com/news/power-and-energy/1685-global-carbon-market-worth-121bn-in-2010.html Commodities Now magazine]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2010,  "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCARBONFINANCE/Resources/State_and_Trends_of_the_Carbon_Market_2010_low_res.pdf The World Bank]”&lt;/ref&gt;

As carbon markets evolved, Moura Costa was particularly interested in making investors and analysts incorporate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on company valuations. In 1999, he co-ordinated the development of the carbon trading component of Australian Plantation Timber, a forestry investment fund, the first time ‘carbon value’ was included in an investment prospectus. Gradually, investor awareness of climate and environmental issues increased, and as a result of that (and contributing to this trend) a series of companies in the carbon market sector floated on stock exchanges in 2004-2006.

The adoption of binding emission reduction commitments by the Kyoto Protocol created a positive environment for more carbon offset project development companies to be created worldwide.  Benefitting from an early mover advantage, EcoSecurities rapidly expanded and established a significant market share.&lt;ref&gt;EcoSecurities Annual Report 2007, “[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Assets/24029/annual%20report2007.pdf EcoSecurities Annual Report 2007]”&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, EcoSecurities listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] (AIM) raising capital for its expansion, one of the first companies in this sector to be listed. As President and COO, Moura Costa coordinated the expansion of the company, from 30 to 300 employees, establishing the firm’s offices in 28 countries worldwide. In 2007, the company raised a second round of capital from the stock markets, and attracted [[Credit Suisse]] as a strategic partner.&lt;ref&gt;EcoSecurities Annual Report 2008, “[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Assets/25232/annual_report_2008.pdf EcoSecurities Annual Report 2008]”&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period he was involved with EcoSecurities, from 1997 to 2009, the company developed more than 450 CDM projects in over 40 countries and, between them, using over 20 different technologies.&lt;ref&gt;EcoSecurities Annual Report 2008, “[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Assets/25232/annual_report_2008.pdf EcoSecurities Annual Report 2008]”&lt;/ref&gt; The company was a pioneer in many aspects of the sector, including the development of the first project registered by the CDM (the NovaGerar landfill project in Brazil), and the first project to receive CERs (a small-hydro project in Honduras). With a view to broadening its reach, he led the company to develop new divisions focused on specialised technologies related to greenhouse gas abatement.  Among them, EcoMethane, a division specialised in the creation of projects for the collection and destruction of methane from landfill sites, and a division for the development of N2O abatement projects, focusing on nitric acid factories. Moura Costa was also the fund manager of the EcoSecurities-[[Standard Bank]] Carbon Facility, which invested in projects on behalf of the Government of Denmark&lt;ref&gt;GreenTech Malaysia review of carbon funds, &gt;“[http://www.cdm.greentechmalaysia.my/resources/cdm-buyers/private-carbon-funds.aspx GreenTech Malaysia review of carbon funds]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powergen Worldwide, “[http://www.powergenworldwide.com/index/display/articledisplay/203930/articles/power-engineering/business/ecosecurities-and-standard-bank-announce-denmark-carbon-facility.html Powergen Worldwide]”&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, EcoSecurities also run similar funds on behalf of the governments of Austria and Japan.

In April 2009, Moura Costa resigned from EcoSecurities to conduct a take-over bid to acquire control of the company, together with Brazilian investment group [[BTG Pactual|BTG]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, 2009, “[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/02/btscenes-us-ecosecurities-guanabara-idUKTRE5812HV20090902 Reuters]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Point Carbon, 2009, “[http://www.pointcarbon.com/news/corporatepolicy/1.1132286 Point Carbon]”&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an international competition for the acquisition of the company&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 2009, “[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/543e8dd8-544b-11de-a58d-00144feabdc0.html Financial Times]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Finance Online, 2009, “[http://www.carbon-financeonline.com/index.cfm?section=lead&amp;action=view&amp;id=12310 Carbon Finance Online]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, 2009, “[http://www.bloomberg.co.jp/apps/news?pid=90970900&amp;sid=a2K1L_BI1aec Bloomberg]”&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2009 EcoSecurities was acquired by [[JP Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, 2009, “[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aE7Wv0zCOg2c Bloomberg]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, “[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/15/us-jpmorgan-ecosecurities-idUKTRE58D37020090915 Reuters]”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of BVRio Environmental Exchange in Brazil ==

In 2011, Pedro and his brother Mauricio Moura Costa founded [[BVRio Environmental Exchange]] (Bolsa Verde do Rio de Janeiro), an organisation based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the mission to develop market mechanisms to facilitate compliance with environmental laws.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times 2011, "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0e443a46-298f-11e1-a066-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3k2jxTPyU Financial Times]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valor Economico 2011, " [http://www.valor.com.br/empresas/2933954/bolsa-verde-do-rio-estreia-com-o-foco-em-reserva-legal Valor Economico]"&lt;/ref&gt; BVRio was developed in partnership with the Rio de Janeiro State Government, and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro and its board includes the participation of Funbio ([[:pt:Fundo Brasileiro para a Biodiversidade|Brazilian Fund for the Biodiversity]]), FBDS (Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development), and CEBDS (the Brazilian chapter of the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]).

Through BVRio, Pedro has helped to create markets for different environmental assets including Forest Legal Reserve Credits, Consolidation of Conservation Areas, and Reforestation Credits to support compliance with the new Brazilian Forest Law;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times 2012, "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/60b19182-42ef-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3k2jxTPyU Financial Times]"&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse Logistics Credits to support the implementation of the Brazilian National Solid Waste Legislation;&lt;ref&gt;Valor Economico 2013, "[http://www.valor.com.br/brasil/3526784/bvrio-negociara-credito-de-logistica Valor Economico]"&lt;/ref&gt; and traceable responsible commodities, to promote the sourcing of legal and/or sustainably produced forest and agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Legality Alliance,"[http://www.forestlegality.org/document-library FLA]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition for its role in developing innovative mechanisms for environmental objectives, BVRio won the 2013 Katerva Awards&lt;ref&gt;Katerva Awards, "[http://www.katerva.net/nominees/2013/economy/bolsa-verde-do-rio-de-janeiro Katerva]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore Foundation, "[https://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2014/02/26/bvrio-wins-katerva-awards-in-the-economics-category Moore]"&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 BVRio was nominated a "Climate Action Leader" by the [[R20 Regions of Climate Action]].&lt;ref&gt;Avina Foundation, "[http://www.avina.net/por/7059/bvrio-ganha-titulo-de-climate-action-leader-pela-rede-r20/ Avina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180830/http://www.avina.net/por/7059/bvrio-ganha-titulo-de-climate-action-leader-pela-rede-r20/ |date=2015-09-23 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution to environmental policy and science ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PMouracosta Nobel prize.png|thumb]] --&gt;
Dr Moura Costa has a PhD from [[University of London]] and has published widely in the subjects of environmental finance, [[carbon trading]], GHG mitigation science and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Climate Policy website, “[http://www.oxfordclimatepolicy.org/publications/moura-costa.shtml Oxford Climate Policy website]”&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many of his articles have focused on scientific aspects of the design of the Clean Development Mechanism, such as discussions on leakage, additionality, monitoring and verification, permanence, and carbon forestry.

The [[European Union]] (EU) '''directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (2005/0127/COD)''' was a proposal from the European Commission for a [[European Union directive|directive]] aimed "to supplement [[Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights|Directive 2004/48/EC of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (Civil enforcement)]]" (''Source: Justification for the proposal, COM(2005) 276 final, July 12, 2005''). The directive was proposed on July 12, 2005 by the [[Commission of the European Communities]].

Being the second directive on the enforcement of "intellectual property rights", it is commonly called '''IPRED2''' (Second Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive). The first directive on the enforcement of Intellectual property rights, Directive 2004/48/EC deals with civil enforcement of intellectual property rights ("IPRED1"). IPRED1 was hastily passed before the [[Enlargement of the European Union#Madrid European Council Criteria|Fifth Enlargement of the European Union]] of May 1, 2004 and did originally include criminal sanctions provisions, but this rather controversial part was omitted in order to be able to meet the deadline of May 1, 2004.

As announced in Official Journal C 252 of 18 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:252:0007:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission decided to withdraw the proposal for a directive. Criminal sanctions for enforcement of intellectual property rights are therefore not currently formally proposed, even if it is part of the [[EU acquis]] since the [[Lisbon Treaty]].

==Subject matter==

This proposed directive incriminates infringements of intellectual property rights. It deals with intentional infringements on a commercial scale or aiding, abetting or inciting to the infringements.

===Community IP Rights===

The proposed directive applies to "such intellectual property rights as are provided for in Community legislation and/or national legislation in the Member States". No definition is provided in the original draft&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005PC0276(01):EN:NOT&lt;/ref&gt; and in that form, the Directive would apply to any intellectual property right. Subsequent readings of the Directive have included clarifications. Examples of such expressly included rights are ''sui generis'' rights of database makers or trademark rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/JURI_Tabled_Amendments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===

The Directive, in its first draft, includes patent violation, traditionally a civil issue. This would possibly have far-reaching consequences for the EU economy as the risk of criminal prosecution for violating patents when new products or new functions are included is great.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/gerloff/blog/ipred2_universally_unloved&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, traditionally, a large majority of all patent disputes are settled out of court before civil infringement disputes continue. The bill also includes a provision which would allow intellectual property holders to assist the police in an investigation, which cedes great power from the state to a patent-holder to threaten rivals with imprisonment, rather than a civil suit alone.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"&gt;http://www.fipr.org/copyright/ipred2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament has, in subsequent reading, excluded patents from the scope of the Directive.

===Consumers===

The Directive applies to ''willful, commercial or intentional'' violations of trademark or copyright laws.&lt;ref name="Article 1"&gt;Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment that would have limited the directive to commercial activity done with the intent to earn a profit was rejected. Instead, consumers will be criminally liable if their behavior is not for ''personal and not for profits purposes'' and was done for the purpose of obtaining ''an economic advantage''.

==Criticism==

According to some, IPRED2 does not seem to be a particularly well drafted Directive.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of amendments passed and adopted in subsequent readings is unusual, as is evident from the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5263692&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions, usually contained in the preamble or the beginning articles, were missing until subsequent readings. Originally about commercial piracy and counterfeit goods only, in its present form it includes any violation of Intellectual Property rights.&lt;ref name="Article 1"/&gt;

The criticism voiced by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]],&lt;ref name="eff.org"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005174.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]],&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/FFII_Analysis?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Law Society of England and Wales,&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"&gt;http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/secure/file/157008/e:/teamsite-deployed/documents//templatedata/Internet%20Documents/Non-government%20proposals/Documents/ipcriminalsanctions310806.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0&lt;/ref&gt; and others includes:

*The original proposal did not explain the terms it was using. The definitions section (Article 1) was only added in the subsequent readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222010703/http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The scope of the Directive is too wide (Article 2). The draft directive still applies to a broader range of intellectual property infringements than commercial piracy and counterfeiting. As a result, it is far broader than the current international standard for criminal IP enforcement — the 1994 TRIPs agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_01_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Patents have recently been taken out of the scope but many other IP rights have not. Some of the latter are poorly suited to criminal regulation (such as database rights or conditional access to pay TV regimes).&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;
*The inclusion of aiding, abetting or inciting (Article 3) puts businesses at unnecessary risk of criminal liability.&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"/&gt;
*The sanctions provisions (Article 4) has been hastily put together and contains draconian measures poorly suited to intellectual property infringements.&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation.&lt;ref name="eff.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005139.php&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] (FFII), it is impossible not to violate [[software patent]]s, and the IPRED 2 directive threatens most of Europe's software developers with imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown authors, [http://wiki.ffii.org/Ipred2Pr060512En ''EU Commission proposes to criminalise European software industry''], Cooperative Web Editing System (wiki) at FFII. Consulted on February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] wrote a letter to EU Commissioner Frattini with a thorough legal analysis of the proposed directive, concluding that the subject-matter of the proposed directive definitely falls outside the [[European Community]]’s competence (as defined in the EU treaties).&lt;ref&gt;Monika Ermert, [http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0 ''EU IP Enforcement Directive Questioned On Procedure''], Intellectual Property Watch, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This page describes several aircraft that are alleged in media reports to have been used in the practice of [[extraordinary rendition]], the extralegal transfer of prisoners from one country to another.

==N313P==
[[File:Premier Executive Transport Services Boeing 737-700 KvW.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737-700]] of PETS in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] on 11 January 2003.]]
'''N313P''' was a tailnumber assigned to a [[Boeing 737]] that the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported on Tuesday, February 6, 2007, flew from [[Tashkent]] to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] on September 21, 2003, and then to [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]] in [[Poland]], landing at 9 p.m. "It stayed on the ground for 57 minutes before taking off for [[Baneasa Airport]] in [[Bucharest, Romania]], an airport that, according to the [[Marty Report]], 'bears all the characteristics of a detainee transfer or drop-off point,'" states author Tom Hundley on page 14 of the ''Tribune''. The 737 then continued on to [[Rabat, Morocco]], and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], the Marty Report said. In 2004 the plane was used to render LIFG leader [[Abdel Hakim Belhaj]] and his wife Fatima Bouchar to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Special report: Rendition ordeal that raises new questions about secret trials |author=Ian Cobain |journal=The Guardian |date=8 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The registered owners of both planes [Boeing 737, N313P, and Gulfstream V, N379P] appear to be [[CIA]] [[front companies]]. Previous attempts by the ''Tribune'' to contact the owners produced a trail of non-existent people at unlikely addresses, or law firms that did not want to discuss the nature of their interest in aviation. Both planes have been involved in rendition cases documented by the ''Tribune'', other media and [[European Union|EU]] investigators," states the [[Chicago]] Tribune on page 14.&lt;ref name="Hundley, Tom 2007, page 1, 14"&gt;Hundley, Tom, "Remote Polish airstrip holds clues to secret CIA flights", ''Chicago Tribune'', Tuesday, February 6, 2007, Volume 160, Number 37, page 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==N379P==
'''N379P''' was a tailnumber assigned to a [[Gulfstream V]] executive jet. The aircraft has been reported in several press sources as a [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] prisoner transport, also known as "[[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo]] Bay Express". The craft has been reported to being used to transport suspected [[terrorism|terrorists]] to undisclosed locations for either [[extraordinary rendition]] or into the [[CIA prison system]]. It has been the subject of criminal complaints&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/cia/documents/complaint-Tim-Hourigan-US-aircraft-Shannon.pdf "Criminal Complaint", ''Statewatch'']&lt;/ref&gt; and parliamentary inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;[//debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=FOJ20051220.xml&amp;Ex=All&amp;Page=2 "Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised)", ''Irish Government Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs'', December 20, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an in-depth investigation into the worldwide network of detention and interrogation facilities employed in the [[War on Terror]], by the British [[The Guardian|Guardian]] newspaper, (March 2005):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,1284,1440836,00.html "One Huge US Jail", ''The Guardian'', March 19, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We were able to chart the toing and froing of the private executive jet used at [an abduction in Sweden] partly through the observations of plane-spotters posted on the web and partly through a senior source in the Pakistan [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Inter Services Intelligence agency]] (ISI). It was a Gulfstream V Turbo, tailfin number N379P; its flight plans always began at an airstrip in Smithfield, North Carolina, and ended in some of the world's hot spots. It was owned by [[Premier Executive Transport Services]], incorporated in [[Delaware]], a [[Front company|brass plaque company]] with nonexistent directors, hired by American agents to revive an old CIA tactic from the 1970s, when agency men had kidnapped [[South American]] criminals and flown them back to their own countries to face trial so that justice could be rendered. Now "rendering" was being used by the Bush administration to evade justice.

[[Robert Baer]], a CIA case officer in the [[Middle East]] until 1997, told us how it works. "We pick up a suspect or we arrange for one of our partner countries to do it. Then the suspect is placed on civilian transport to a third country where, let's make no bones about it, they use [[torture]]. If you want a good interrogation, you send someone to [[Jordan]]. If you want them to be killed, you send them to [[Egypt]] or [[Syria]]. Either way, the U.S. cannot be blamed as it is not doing the heavy work."}}

===Background===
The first media mention of N379P was six weeks after September 11, 2001, when, according to the ''Chicago Tribune,'' a Pakistani newspaper reported that a student at the [[University of Karachi]] and a citizen of [[Yemen]], had been seen being forced onto the plane at [[Jinnah International Airport]] by Pakistani security officers on the morning of October 23, 2001. The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported on the aircraft again on February 6, 2007, stating that N379P departed [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] July 27, 2003, and flew to [[Frankfurt, Germany]] according to FAA records. The FAA then records the Gulfstream taking off from [[Tashkent, Uzbekistan]] on July 31, 2003, bound for [[Glasgow, Scotland]], and then return to Dulles. The ''Tribune'' then states that Polish aviation records indicate that N379P landed at [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]], a remote airfield at [[Szczytno|Szymany]], Poland, at 2:58&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 30, 2003, after a flight from Afghanistan. How the aircraft moved from Frankfurt to Tashkent remains unreported.&lt;ref name="Hundley, Tom 2007, page 1, 14"/&gt; The Szymany airport is located southwest of the [[Stare Kiejkuty (base)|Stare Kiejkuty]] intelligence base in northern Poland.

The executive jet with the tail number N379P was again brought to public attention by [[TV4 AB|Swedish TV4's]] documentary, ''Det brutna löftet'' ("The broken promise"), aired May 17, 2004. The documentary claimed that the expulsion of two men, [[Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery]] - ordered by the Cabinet - to Egypt on December 18, 2001, was carried out by hooded U.S. agents. The plane booked by the [[SÄPO|Swedish Security Police]] (SÄPO) was cancelled when another plane arrived - N379P - a [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream V]] executive jet supplied by the firm ([[Premier Executive Transport Services]], Inc.) which works exclusively for the U.S. Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11976-2004Jul24.html|title=A Secret Deportation Of Terror Suspects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agiza and al-Zery were arrested and brought to Bromma airport in Stockholm where Swedish police handed them over to hooded operatives. The two prisoners had their clothes cut from their bodies by scissors, without their hand- and footcuffs being loosened. The naked and chained prisoners were given suppository of unknown kind inserted into their anus, and diapers were put on them. They were forcibly dressed in dark overalls. Their hands and feet are chained to a specially designed harness. On the plane, both men are blindfolded and hooded. The plane took off at 21.49 and set course towards Egypt. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Later on, when the Gulfstream's log books came into a journalist's hands, the wider scope became clear:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041214172958/http://www.notinourname.net/restrictions/torture-flights-14nov04.htm Not In Our Name.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Analysis of the plane's flight plans, covering more than two years, shows that it always departs from [[Washington DC]]. It has flown to 49 destinations outside America, including the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba and other U.S. military bases, as well as Egypt, Jordan, [[Iraq]], [[Morocco]], Afghanistan, [[Libya]] and [[Uzbekistan]].
Witnesses have claimed that the suspects are frequently bound, gagged and sedated before being put on board the planes, which do not have special facilities for prisoners but are kitted out with tables for meetings and screens for presentations and in-flight films.}}

=== Appearance in fiction ===
N379P appears in the episode "Hundrede dage" of the Danish TV series ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]'' which focuses on the problems for the Danish prime-minister caused by the revelation of rendition flights landing at Thule. In addition, a Gulfstream V that is being used to carry out an extraordinary rendition appears in Jason Trask's 2011 novel, "I'm Not Muhammad" (Red Wheelbarrow Books).

==N596GA ==

''''N596GA''' was the tailnumber of a Gulfstream V, which has also been mentioned in print as a possible transport for the CIA program of extraordinary rendition. According to a 2008 article by writer Dave Willis, the plane was ordered in 1999 by the United States Air Force as a [[C-37A]], serial ''99-0405'', and was rolled out as N596GA but only briefly took up its military serial before reverting to the civil registration, issued on September 20, 2001, nine days after the [[9-11]] attacks. It was registered to National Aircraft Leasing of Greenville, New Castle County in Delaware, "and is believed to have been used by the [[Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System]]s (JPATS), managed by the [[U.S. Marshals Service]]. JPATS is responsible for moving prisoners and non-US citizen criminals around and has its own fleet of aircraft, as well as frequently leasing others. N596GA is also said to have been used in the CIA's programme of extraordinary rendition against terrorist subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Dave, "''Distinguished Airlift''", Air Forces Monthly, May 2008, Stamford, Lincs, UK, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==N85VM==
[[File:Gulfstream IV RNLAF.jpg|thumb|A [[Gulfstream IV]]]]
'''N85VM''' was the tail number of a [[Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV|Gulfstream IV]] which newspaper reports have speculated may have been used as a [[US Department of Defense]] or CIA prisoner transport.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/03/21/cia_uses_jet_red_sox_partner_confirms/ Edes, Gordon, "CIA uses jet, Red Sox partner confirms", ''The Boston Globe'', March 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Plane logs obtained by reporters show that the plane was in Cairo on February 18, 2003, the same day that the radical Egyptian cleric [[Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr|Abu Omar]] arrived in Cairo after being abducted in Italy, leading reporters to speculate that the Gulfstream IV may have been the plane used to render Abu Omar.&lt;ref name="ridder"&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0320-04.htm Crewdson, John, "Jet's Travels Cloaked in Mystery", ''Chicago Tribune'', March 20, 2005, archived at CommonDreams.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107102817/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0320-04.htm |date=January 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American and Italian intelligence officers were later charged with Abu Omar's abduction.&lt;ref name="beyondabduction"&gt;Wilkinson, T.  (2006).  [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1072876201.html?dids=1072876201:1072876201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+7%2C+2006&amp;author=Tracy+Wilkinson&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.4&amp;desc=The+World "Italian Probe Broadens Beyond Abduction: Prosecutors in the case of a Muslim cleric seek evidence of illegal spying by intelligence officers. Some journalists also may be involved."]  ''The Los Angeles Times'', July 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the trip to Cairo, between June 2002 and January 2005, the aircraft made 51 trips to Guantánamo Bay, as well as 82 visits to [[Dulles International Airport]] and [[Andrews Air Force Base]]. It also visited U.S. air bases at Ramstein and Rhein-Main in Germany, Afghanistan, Morocco, Dubai, Jordan, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="ridder"/&gt;

Concerning the business activities of the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] family, Saud bin Nayef argued "You have to understand one simple fact.

'''Sonneborn Building''', also known as Paca-Pratt Building, is a historic [[loft]] building in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], United States. Designed by [[Theodore Wells Pietsch I|Theodore Wells Pietsch]], it is a nine-story loft building constructed in 1905 of "fireproof" reinforced-concrete construction, faced in buff-colored brick, with a coursed ashlar foundation and stone trim.

'''Stanley E. Bogdan''' (December 16, 1918 – March 27, 2011) was the founder of S.E. Custom Built, a company dedicated to the handmade construction of fly reels.  Bogdan was born in Nashua, NH and lived there throughout his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  He became interested in fly fishing at an early age when he began receiving outdated copies of a hunting and fishing magazine from a local sports retailer.  At age 13, Bogdan was tying his own flies and would then become immersed in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon graduating high school, Bogdan began work at Rollins Engine Company, a local engines manufacturer in Nashua.  Later on, while working as a machinist, he began constructing some of the first prototypes for his reels.  Stanley Bogdan died on March 27, 2011 and is survived by his son Stephen, and his daughter Cheryl Doughty.  His wife Phyllis died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  While standing on the shore of one of his favorite rivers; The Grand Cascapedia, Mr Bogdan smiled and said: "I'd die if I could not fish anymore" shortly after Mr. Bogdan could no longer fish he succumbed to pancreatic cancer. 2009

==S.E. Custom Built==
S.E. Custom Built fly reels are primarily known for their ability to greatly reduce drag.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  This is mostly attributed to Bogdan's unique concept of the double-break shoe, known as the hallmark of any Bogdan reel.  The company is mostly focused on the production of salmon reels, however there have been a few trout reel models made.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Company History===
It wasn't until 1955 that Bogdan sold his first set of reels.  At the New England Sportsmen's Show, he received $150 from Julian Crandall for a set of 10 reels (one of which Crandall gave to professional baseball player, [[Ted Williams]]).  That same year Bogdan would make a deal with [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], one of the day's leading marketers of sport's goods, for a set of 40 reels.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The deal provided that:
#Three different models were to be made: 100M, 200M, 300M
#An identification code was to be stamped on each reel foot
#Anodized gloss black for the reel feet and handles to be used instead of the aluminum serpentine
#The reels would sell at $100 retail price granting Bogdan 60% of all sales&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Bogdan would retire work at the factories and begin working entirely on his reel making company.  From 1957 to 1977, S.E. Custom Built would have a relationship with [[Orvis]] including a deal similar to the one with [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]].  The [[Orvis]] reels differed slightly because they decided to use Bogdan's original aluminum serpentine colors.  Bogdan reels have since been marketed by many of the industry's major tackle merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually demands came for a trout reel in the Bogdan style, so S.E. Custom Built released a 5-weight single-action, non-adjustable, pawl-drag reel in 1976.  Demands would come for similar 3-, 4-, and 6-weight reels as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Bogdan, Stanley's son, would join S.E. Custom Built in September 1973.  Stephen purchased the company and became the sole owner in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reels===
Two qualities of Bogdan reels that they are most known for are Bogdan's signature double-brake shoe and the 10 position lever provided that is used to regulate drag.  They also have black anodized side plates with a pale gold anodized frame.&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, Douglas, [http://westslopefly.com/reels/bogdan.cfm "The Bogdan Story"], "West Slope"&lt;/ref&gt;  The prices of a Bogdan reel range from $1,500 to $2,400, depending on the type of fish one plans to catch with it.  Each Bogdan reel was handcrafted by either Stanley or Stephen.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  These reels are in very high demand and it is not uncommon for one to wait several years to receive their order.  Avid reel collector and friend of Bogdan's, Douglas Marchant says, "Since each reel is the product of very intensive hand labor, forecasting delivery is virtually impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, Douglas, [http://westslopefly.com/reels/bogdan.cfm "The Bogdan Story"], "West Slope"&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan's reels are owned and praised by some of fly fishing's most notable figures, such as:
*John Olin
*Lee Wulff
*Julian Crandall
*Ted Bates
*R.L. Haig Brown
* Sergey Shakirtov
* Paul Lucas

The entire city of Stockholm is also the centre of the [[Metropolitan Stockholm|Stockholm Metropolitan Area]].

Since 2007, Stockholm City Centre is organized into four ''stadsdelsområden'' (sometimes translated to [[Boroughs of Stockholm|boroughs]]): [[Kungsholmen (borough)|Kungsholmen]], [[Södermalm]], [[Norrmalm]] and [[Östermalm]].&lt;ref name="bydistricts"&gt;City of Stockholm: [http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ "Stockholm by districts"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218065732/http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2007, Stockholm City Centre was organized into five boroughs: [[Katarina-Sofia borough]], [[Kungsholmen borough]], [[Maria-Gamla stan borough]], [[Norrmalm borough]] and [[Östermalm borough]].

The border between the historical [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] of [[Södermanland]] and [[Uppland]] splits Stockholm City Centre in two parts. 179,185 people live on an area of 28.05&amp;nbsp;km² in the northern (Uppland) part, which gives a density of 6,388.06/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The same data for the southern (Södermanland) part is 103,646 people on 7.44&amp;nbsp;km², giving a density of 13,930.91/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This border is purely historical and has no administrative significance whatsoever.

'''Talitha Getty''' (18 October 1940 – 11 July 1971&lt;ref name="minimadmodmuses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minimadmodmuses.multiply.com/journal/item/3|title=Talitha Getty: Excerpts from the book "The House of Getty" by Russell Miller|author=Anita Pallenberg|website=minimadmodmuses.multiply.com|date=October 26, 2008|access-date=July 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013402/http://minimadmodmuses.multiply.com/journal/item/3|archive-date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an actress and model of Dutch extraction, born in the former [[Dutch East Indies]], who was regarded as a style icon of the late 1960s. She lived much of her adult life in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, in her final years, was closely associated with the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] city of [[Marrakesh]]. Her husband was the oil heir and subsequent philanthropist [[John Paul Getty Jr.]]

==Early life==
'''Talitha Dina Pol''' was born in [[Java]], then part of the Dutch East Indies (now [[Indonesia]]), daughter of the artists {{Interlanguage link multi|Willem Jilts Pol|nl}} (1905–88) and Arnoldine Adriana "Adine" Mees (1908–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/92737 Adine Mees] at the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father subsequently married Poppet John (1912–97), daughter of the painter [[Augustus John]] (1878–1961), a pivotal figure in the world of [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] culture and fashion. She was thus the step-granddaughter of both Augustus John and his [[muse]] and second wife, [[Dorelia McNeill|Dorothy "Dorelia" McNeil]] (1881–1969), who was a fashion icon in the early years of the 20th century. By [[Ian Fleming]]'s widowed mother, Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming née Rose, Augustus John had a daughter and Talitha's aunt, [[Amaryllis Fleming]] (1925–1999), who became a noted cellist.

Pol spent her early years, during the [[Second World War]], with her mother in a Japanese prison camp. Her father was interned in a separate camp and her parents went their own ways after the war, Pol moving to Britain with her mother, who died in 1948 in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2008/07/13/st_talithagetty.xml|title=Talitha Getty: Beautiful and Damned|date=2008-07-13|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Justine | last=Picardie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pol studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London. Writer and journalist [[Jonathan Meades]], who was at RADA several years later, recalled that, after first coming to London in 1964, he saw Pol with her stepmother at Seal House, [[Holland Park]] (home of Poppet John's sister, Vivien). Meades thought her "the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen ... I gaped, unable to dissemble my amazement".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 11 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of the British Parliament]] [[Woodrow Wyatt|Woodrow, Lord Wyatt]] recalled, with reference to the "success with women" of [[Antony Lambton|Anthony, Lord Lambton]], former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Government Minister, that

&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was that Talitha Pol who was very pretty and had a little starlet job in [[Yugoslavia]]; and he went and stayed at the hotel and sent her huge bunches of flowers about every two hours and showered her with presents.&lt;ref&gt;Diary, 15 August 1988: ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt'', ed Sarah Curtis (1998), p 614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another to come under Pol's spell was the dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]], who first met her at a party in 1965. According to Nureyev's biographer, Julie Kavanagh, the two were in thrall to each other, to the extent that Nureyev "had never felt so erotically stirred by a woman" and told several friends that he wished to marry Pol.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Kavanagh (2007) ''Rudolf Nureyev: The Life''; ''Sunday Times'', 16 September 2007. Kavanagh surmised that "what [Nureyev] was actually seeing was an exquisite, androgynous reflection of himself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Nureyev was unable to attend a dinner party given by [[Claus von Bülow]], at which he and Pol were to have been seated next to each other, and so von Bülow invited instead John Paul Getty, son of his employer, the oil tycoon [[Paul Getty]]. Pol and Getty Jr forged a relationship that led to their marriage in 1966.

==Marriage to John Paul Getty==
Pol became the second wife of [[John Paul Getty, Jr.]] on 10 December 1966. She was married in a white [[miniskirt]], trimmed with [[mink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/john-paul-getty-ii-a-very-english-billionaire-673885.html|title=John Paul Getty II: A very English billionaire|last=Hall|first=Malcolm Macalister |date=2001-06-14|publisher=''The Independent''|accessdate=2008-08-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gettys became part of [[Swinging London]]'s fashionable scene, becoming friends with, among others, singers [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] and his girl-friend [[Marianne Faithfull]]. Faithfull has recounted her apprehension, through "ingrained [[agoraphobia]]", about an invitation to spend five weeks with the Gettys in [[Morocco]] ("but for Mick this is an essential part of his life") and how, after splitting from Jagger, she took up with Talitha Getty's lover, Count Jean de Breteuil, a young French aristocrat (1949–1971). Breteuil supplied drugs to musicians such as [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Marianne Faithfull]], who wrote that Breteuil "saw himself as dealer to the stars"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main St.: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones'', DaCapo Press, 2006, pages 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Davis, ''Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend'', Gotham, 2005, pages 388-389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Faithfull: an Autobiography'', 1994, page 195&lt;/ref&gt; and has claimed that he delivered the drugs that accidentally killed Morrison&lt;ref&gt;'True Confessions' (portrait of Marianne Faithfull by Ebet Roberts) in ''Mojo'', September 2014, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; less than two weeks before Talitha's own death in 1971. For his part, Richards recalled that John Paul and Talitha Getty "had the best and finest [[opium]]".&lt;ref&gt;Keith Richards (2010) ''Life'', page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Print designer [[Celia Birtwell]], who married designer [[Ossie Clark]], recalled Talitha Getty as one of a number of "beautiful people" who crossed her threshold in the late 1960s, while couturier [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] likened the Gettys to the title of a 1922 novel by [[F Scott Fitzgerald]] as "beautiful and damned".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', November 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Among other glamorous figures of the Sixties, the fashion designer [[Michael Rainey]], who founded the Hung on You boutique in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], and his wife [[Jane Ormsby-Gore]], daughter of British ambassador [[David Ormsby-Gore]] to the United States during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] era, "hung out" with the Gettys in Marrakesh between their moving from [[Gozo]] to the [[Welsh Marches]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Michael Rainey, ''The Times'', 7 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul Getty, who has been described as "a swinging playboy who drove fast cars, drank heavily, experimented with drugs and squired raunchy starlets",&lt;ref&gt;Compton Miller (1997) ''Who's Really Who!'', p 115&lt;/ref&gt; eschewed the family business, Getty Oil, during this period, much to the chagrin of his father. However, in later years, he became a [[philanthropist]] and, as a U.S. citizen, received an honorary British knighthood in 1986. His luxury yacht, built in 1927 and renovated in 1994, was the ''MY Talitha G''.

In July 1968, the Gettys had a son, Tara Gabriel Gramophone Galaxy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Russell |title=The House of Getty|publisher=H. Holt|year=1986|pages=262|isbn=0-03-003769-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a noted ecological conservationist in Africa, dropped his third and fourth forenames, and took [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] citizenship in 1999. He and his wife Jessica (a chalet maid he met in [[Verbier]]) had three children, including a daughter named Talitha.&lt;ref name="The Tatler, May 2011, p 111"&gt;''The Tatler'', May 2011, p 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marrakesh photo==
Talitha Getty is probably best remembered for an iconic photograph taken on a roof-top in Marrakesh, Morocco in January 1969 by [[Patrick Lichfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/picture.php?pic=60742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091045/http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/picture.php?pic=60742 |archivedate=2010-04-17 |df= }} See also Lichfield (1981) ''The Most Beautiful Women'']&lt;/ref&gt; With her hooded husband in the background, this image, part of the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in London, portrayed her in a crouching pose, wearing a multi-coloured [[kaftan]], white [[harem (household)|harem]] pants and white and cream boots.

The look seemed stylishly to typify the [[hippie]] fashion of the time and became a model over the years for what, more recently, has been referred to variously as "hippie [[chic (style)|chic]]", "[[boho-chic]]" and "Talitha Getty chic".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', July 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
As an actress, Pol appeared in several films, including ''[[Village of Daughters]]'' (1962) (as a daughter, Gioia Spartaco); an [[Edgar Wallace]] mystery, ''[[We Shall See]]'' (1964) (as Jirina); ''[[The System (1964 film)|The System]]'' (1964) (as Helga); ''[[Return from the Ashes]]'' (1965) (as Claudine, alongside [[Maximilian Schell]], [[Ingrid Thulin]] and [[Samantha Eggar]]); and ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968), a sexually charged science-fiction fantasy starring [[Jane Fonda]], in which she had the minor uncredited role of a girl smoking a pipe.

==Death==
Talitha Getty is rumored to have died of a [[heroin]] overdose in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], on 11 July 1971.&lt;ref name="minimadmodmuses" /&gt; However, her death certificate listed the cause as cardiac arrest, with high levels of alcohol and barbiturates found in her blood.&lt;ref&gt;(source: source: 1930-, Pearson, John, (1995). [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32820398 ''Painfully rich : the outrageous fortune and misfortunes of the heirs of J. Paul Getty''] (1st ed ed.). New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0312135793}}[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32820398 )].&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly, she was in Rome to patch up her marriage.&lt;ref name="The Tatler, May 2011, p 111"/&gt; She died within the same 12-month period as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Edie Sedgwick]] and, as noted, [[Jim Morrison]], other cultural icons of the 1960s. Her friend [[Brian Jones]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], with whom she had spent time in Marrakesh, had predeceased Hendrix by a little over a year.&lt;ref&gt;Getty was slightly older than Morrison and Joplin who were later cited as members of the "[[27 Club]]" of stars who died at that age. Others included [[Brian Jones]] of the Rolling Stones in 1969 and [[Amy Winehouse]] in 2011, when the 27 Club received renewed attention in the media. Sedgwick was 28 when she died.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK India Business Council''' (UKIBC) is a membership-based, [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] organisation founded in 2007 to foster trade and business relations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukibc.com UKIBC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation works with businesses in both countries, as well as the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[India]]n governments, to promote and increase bilateral trade. The UK India Business Council supports UK businesses with the insights, networks, policy advocacy, services, and facilities needed to succeed in India.

They help UK companies achieve success whether they are well-established in India or in the early stages of their engagement.

Working with the UK Government and other influential and connected partners, they ensure business interests are conveyed to India’s Union and State legislators. The UK India Business Council seek to influence decisions that will make it easier for UK businesses to operate in India.

For those seeking practical advice, their team provide a range of sector-specific research, market entry and expansion services that help businesses understand – and take – the opportunities.

Their membership network is at the heart of their support. Through a wide variety of events and member-only Sector Policy Groups, they enable businesspeople to meet each other, identify potential partners, suppliers and customers, and to learn from top business leaders and commentators, including those on the Advisory Council.

UKIBC is a sister organisation to the [[UK-ASEAN Business Council]]

The UK India Business Council is the sole accredited UK Government Overseas Business Network Initiative provider for India. UKIBC is accredited by [[British Chambers of Commerce]] and works in partnership with [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]].

==History==
UKIBC has its origins in the Indo British Partnership (IBP) initiative, signed by then Prime Ministers [[John Major]] and [[P. V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3680">'''Waiariki Institute of Technology''' ({{lang-mi|Whare Takiura o Waiariki}}&lt;span style="margin-left:2.5px;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; was a tertiary institution based in the city of [[Rotorua]], [[New Zealand]], in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region in the central North Island. In May 2016, it merged with [[Bay of Plenty Polytechnic]] to form [[Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology]].

Regional campuses existed in [[Taupo]], [[Tokoroa]] and [[Whakatane]], and formerly [[Turangi]] and [[Kawerau]]. These were backed by a variety of specialist campuses and buildings, such as the Waipa Campus just south of Rotorua and the newly established offerings available from Waiariki in the [[Tauranga]] suburb of Windermere.

Waiariki was divided into three faculties, which offered masters, graduate, postgraduate and degree qualifications, as well as diplomas and certificates in several subject areas. They were the Faculty of Applied Technology and Primary Industries - Te Kura Takawāo, the Faculty of Business, Information Technology and Creative Arts - Te Kura Taki, and Te Pākaro a Ihenga: Faculty of Health, Education and Humanities.

Qualification subject areas included [[nursing]], [[teaching]], [[social work]], [[art]], [[sustainability]], [[Māori culture|Māori]], [[forestry]], [[business]], [[computing]], [[tourism]] and [[hospitality]]. These were backed by an equally diverse range of trade-based qualifications, in areas such as [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], [[fashion]], [[carpentry]] and [[hairdressing]].

== Tangatarua Marae ==
Waiariki has an on-site [[marae]] named Tangatarua, which translates as "two peoples" to reflect their [[bicultural]] nature. Tangatarua Marae was officially opened on 5 October 1996 and is named after a Túhourangi ancestor, Ihenga, who lived on the land where the Mokoia Campus is today.

== Academies ==
The Waiariki Academy of Sport offered talented athletes the opportunity to prioritise their sporting careers while gaining a tertiary education. Similarly, the Waiariki Academy of Singing and Music supported talented young singers and musicians to reach their musical goals while studying.

Waiariki also offered teenagers interested in trade areas the Bay of Plenty Trades Academy, which allowed secondary students to get a taste of trade subjects and tertiary life while still at high-school.

== History ==

Waiariki Community College was born in 1976, after the Rotorua Boys’ High School Technical Institute Division was merged with the Rotorua Girls' High School Business College to form a Senior Technical Division under the Rotorua High Schools' Board of Governors. Building on the Mokoia Drive site commenced that year, and the Waiariki Community College was opened two years later on 1 April 1978.

Tokoroa's 'outpost' opened in 1973, and subsequently became Waiariki’s first regional campus in 1978.

By the time Waiariki Community College changed its name to Waiariki Polytechnic in 1987, it was the largest polytechnic outside of the main city centres. The first two degree-level qualifications in tourism management and nursing were launched in 1995, and three years later, the name finally changed to Waiariki Institute of Technology.

'''William Dodd''' (born 18 June 1804) was an Englishman who came to notice when he described his work and growing disability as a [[child labor|child worker]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He was employed by the reformer [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] after writing about child workers in the textile industry, but Shaftesbury later sacked him after accusations were made that Dodd was lying and was a disgruntled employee. He wrote one more book on a related subject that was written and published in America.

==Biography==
Dodd was born in 1804 in [[Kendal]], Westmorland and by the age of five he was at work.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt; Dodd said that he came from a family that was well remunerated but that had fallen down the class structure by the time he started work.&lt;ref name=labor&gt;Dodd, William (1847) - [[s:The Laboring Classes of England/Letter 1|''The Laboring Classes of England'' - Letter 1: 'Introduction']]'&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd came to notice in 1840 when he published with the support of the social reformer [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]] a book which described his own and his sisters' experiences as child workers. He described how they all worked in a textile factory and sometimes they would work for 18 hours per day.&lt;ref name=albrecht&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albrecht|first1=editor, Gary L.|title=Encyclopedia of disability|date=2006|publisher=Sage Online|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412950510|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/disability/n977.xml|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd blamed this experience for making him a cripple and by the time he wrote his first book he had had one arm amputated as it had swollen; the doctors later reported that the bone was "honeycomb" and lacked bone marrow.&lt;ref name=wdodd&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRdodd.htm William Dodd] in ''Spartacus Educational'', retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd was able to write the book as he had learnt to write at evening classes&lt;ref name=albrecht/&gt; whilst working in Kendal. It was his job at that time to check the ages of young children who were employed at Isaac and William Wilson's textile mill. His first use of his literacy was to become a clerk at the same mill.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;

In 1837, Dodd briefly started his own school where he passed on his skills in reading, writing and arithmetic. School teaching was meant to suit his increasing disability but he lost the rooms he was renting and this ended the endeavor. Dodd's disability meant that he said that he was unable to find a wife and he resolved to abandon the idea of marriage and he moved to London.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;

In London, he worked as a clerk. After he had his arm amputated, he decided to write his autobiography. The text of ''A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings of William Dodd a Factory Cripple'' was sent to Lord Ashley, who was well known for his interest in child labour, and it was published. Ashley was a member of parliament and he had campaigned for children to be restricted to a ten-hour day. His motion was defeated but it led to the 1833 [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] which created a minimum age of nine for working in a textile factory and introduced maximum hours for all children under 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRashley.htm Lord Ashley], Spartacus, retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley employed Dodd and he wrote ''The Factory System: Illustrated'' to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture, which was published in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10001537 Anthony Ashley Cooper], HistoryMole, retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

These books and Dodd were attacked by Quaker politician [[John Bright]] in a parliamentary committee on the Factories Bill on 15 March 1844. Bright said that he had evidence that the books describing Dodd's mistreatment were in fact created by Dodd's ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Moreover, he had evidence that Dodd had reported that Lord Ashley was only using him because he was an example of a cripple damaged by work in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1844/mar/15/hours-of-labour-in-factories#S3V0073P0_18440315_HOC_32 Lours of Labour], House in Committee on the Factories Bill, Hansard, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America where he wrote ''The Laboring Classes of England'', which was published in Boston in 1847. It is not known where Dodd lived or died after this date.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;
