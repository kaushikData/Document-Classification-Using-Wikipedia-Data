In 2009 a provision was added to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Reauthorization Act that would have changed the conditions under which some of [[FedEx Corporation]]'s employees could [[Trade union|unionize]]. FedEx referred to these provisions as the "Brown Bailout".

==Overview==
The argument between [[FedEx]] on the one hand and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] and the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] union on the other is over which labor act FedEx's non-airline personnel should be covered under, the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) or the [[Railway Labor Act]] (RLA):
*under the NLRA, workers are able to unionize locally, on a site-by-site basis;
*under the RLA, workers must unionize nationally, which is more challenging and tends to keep rates of unionized workers low.

As of June 2010, The NLRA covers UPS's non-airline workers, and the RLA all of its airline workers; a large number of UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamster.org/sites/teamster.org/files/03%2006%2009%20Final%20UPS%20Master%20Agreemnt%202008-2013.pdf], UPS Teamsters Master Agreement 2008-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, all FedEx personnel, including those working on railways and other modes of ground transport, are covered under the RLA, which requires them to unionize nationally.

If the provisions were passed, FedEx's non-airline personnel would be able to unionize more easily, because they would be covered under the NLRA.&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt; According to the Memphis-based company, this change could also "expose [its] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupt the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”.&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt; The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has counter-attacked with its own web campaign, "FedEx drivers aren't pilots",&lt;ref name="notpilots"&gt;[http://www.fedexdriversarentpilots.com/ FedEx FedEx drivers aren't pilots.com], Retrieved on June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; insisting on the fact that the NLRA, not the RLA, should apply to FedEx's ground personnel.

==Controversial use of the term 'bailout'==
The term 'Brown Bailout' refers to the provision that UPS has lobbied{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} to have put into the $34.5 billion [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Reauthorization Act (H.R. 915) voted on by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in May 2009&lt;ref name="committees" /&gt; and by the [[United States Senate]] in March 2010.&lt;ref name="reauthorization"&gt;[http://www.civilrights.org/archives/2010/03/925-fedex-faa.html Senate Passes FAA Bill without FedEx Labor Fix], CivilRights.org, March 25, 2010. Retrieved on June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined in FedEx's large [[online advertising]] campaign against UPS and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; it seeks to emphasize the idea that changing FedEx's personnel statute would be equivalent to giving UPS a '[[bailout]]'. However, independent observers have strongly criticized FedEx's wording,&lt;ref name="factcheck"&gt;[http://factcheck.org/2009/07/brown-bailout-hardly 'Brown  Bailout?' Hardly], FactCheck.org, July 20, 2009. Retrieved on June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that it was "an abuse of the term".&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt; Steve Centrillo, a marketing consultant quoted by the New York Times, described the use of the word 'bailout' as "the most questionably ethical thing on the [Brown Bailout] site".&lt;ref name="hauntfedex"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/business/media/10adco.html?ref=united_parcel_service_inc Campaign Against Rival Could Haunt FedEx], NYTimes.com, June 9, 2009. Retrieved on June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted in the same article, [[advertising]] professional Scott Elser expressed his concern that the use of the word 'bailout' had "the ability to potentially harm" FedEx, arguing that what FedEx's website claimed was a bailout "clearly [was] not a bailout as most consumers and business people would define it".&lt;ref name="hauntfedex" /&gt; According to the Oxford American Dictionary, a bailout is the "act of giving financial assistance to a failing business or economy to save it from collapse".&lt;ref name="bailoutdefinition"&gt;Oxford American Dictionary. Retrieved on June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time Magazine]] listed the term 'bailout' as one of the top 10 buzzwords of 2008,&lt;ref name="buzzword"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1855948_1864100_1864102,00.html Top 10 Buzzwords], time.com, November 3, 2008. Retrieved on June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; insisting on its negative connotation; this is in large part due to the fact that a substantial number of Americans have a negative opinion of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], commonly referred to as 'a bailout of the U.S. financial system'.&lt;ref name="galluppoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/113047/Americans-Falling-Favor-Initial-Bailout.aspx Initial Bailout Falling Out of Favor With Americans], gallup.com, December 9, 2008.

The bile can be harvested using several techniques, all of which require some degree of surgery, and may leave a permanent fistula or inserted catheter. A significant proportion of the bears die because of the stress of unskilled surgery or the infections which may occur.

Farmed bile bears are housed continuously in small cages which often prevent them from standing or sitting upright, or from turning around. These highly restrictive cage systems and the low level of skilled husbandry can lead to a wide range of welfare concerns including physical injuries, pain, severe mental stress and muscle atrophy. Some bears are caught as cubs and may be kept in these conditions for up to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animalsasia.org/uk/our-work/end-bear-bile-farming/|title=End Bear Bile Farming|website=www.animalsasia.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bear bile and gallbladders, which store bile, are ingredients in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM). Its first recorded use was recorded in ''Tang Ban Cao'' (''Newly Revised Materia Medica'', Tang Dynasty, 659 A.D.).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The pharmacologically active ingredient contained in bear bile and gallbladders is [[ursodeoxycholic acid]] (UDCA); bears are the only mammals to produce significant amounts of UDCA.&lt;ref name="Feng" /&gt;

Initially, bile was collected from wild bears which were killed and the gall and its contents cut from the body. In the early 1980s, methods of extracting bile from live bears were developed in North Korea and farming of bile bears began. This rapidly spread to China and other regions.&lt;ref name=MacGregor/&gt; Bile bear farms were started (allegedly) to reduce hunting of wild bears, with the hope that if bear farms raised a self-sustaining population of productive animals, poachers would have little motivation to capture or kill bears in the wild.&lt;ref name="Hance"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/apr/09/bear-bile-china-synthetic-alternative|year=2015|title=Is the end of 'house of horror' bear bile factories in sight?|journal=The Guardian|author=Hance, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/detailed-discussion-bears-used-traditional-chinese-medicine|author=Tsai, L.|title=Detailed discussion of bears used in traditional Chinese medicine|publisher=Michigan State University College of Law|year=2008|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for bile and gallbladders exists in Asian communities throughout the world, including the EU and the US.&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Feng, Y., Siu, K., Wang, N., Ng, K.M., Tsao, S.W., Nagamatsu, T. and Tong, Y.|year=2009|title=Bear bile: dilemma of traditional medicinal use and animal protection|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine|volume=5|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-2|pmid=19138420|pmc=2630947}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demand has led to bears being hunted in the US specifically for this purpose.

==Methods of bile extraction==
Several methods can be used to extract the bile. These all require surgery and include:&lt;ref name="Isaccs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2013/0131-isaacs-bear-bile.html#QvvvZWi4roC1RUhw.99 |title=Asian bear farming: breaking the cycle of exploitation |author=Isaccs, J. R. |publisher=Mongabay.com |year=2013 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Repeated percutaneous biliary drainage''' uses an ultrasound imager to locate the gallbladder, which is then punctured and the bile extracted.
*'''Permanent implantation''' uses a tube entered into the gallbladder through the abdomen. According to [[the Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS), the bile is usually extracted twice a day through such implanted tubes, producing 10–20 ml of bile during each extraction.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
*'''Catheterization''' involves pushing a steel or [[perspex]] [[catheter]] through the bear's abdomen and into the gallbladder.
*The '''full-jacket''' method uses a permanent catheter tube to extract the bile which is then collected in a plastic bag set in a metal box worn by the bear.
*The '''free drip''' method involves making a permanent hole, or [[fistula]], in the bear's abdomen and gallbladder, from which bile freely drips out. The wound is vulnerable to infection, and bile can leak back into the abdomen, causing high mortality rates. Sometimes, the hole is kept open with a perspex catheter, which HSUS writes causes severe pain.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} An AAF Vet Report states that surgeries to create free-dripping fistulae caused bears great suffering as they were performed without appropriate antibiotics or pain management and the bears were repeatedly exposed to this process as the fistulae often healed over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalsasia.org/index.php?module=2&amp;menupos=5&amp;lg=en|title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Removal''' of the whole gallbladder is sometimes used. This method is used when wild bears are killed for their bile.

It has been estimated that 50% to 60% of bears die from complications caused by the surgery or improper post-surgical care.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

==Housing and husbandry==
[[File:Sun Bear bile extration 01.jpg|thumb|right|Bears are commonly kept in extraction cages.]]
Cubs are sometimes caught in the wild and used to supplement numbers held captive in farms. In 2008, it was reported that bear farms were paying the equivalent of US$280 to US$400 for a wild bear cub; this is equivalent to 10 times the monthly wage of a restaurant worker in China.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;

Bile extraction begins at three years-of-age and continues for a minimum of five to ten years. Some bears may be kept in cages for bile extraction for 20 years or more.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt; A bear can produce 2.2&amp;nbsp;kg of bile over a 5-yr production life.&lt;ref name="Dutton2011" /&gt;

When the bears outlive their productive bile-producing years (around 10 years old), they are often slaughtered and harvested for their other body parts such as meat, fur, paws and gallbladders; bear paws are considered a delicacy.&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/06|date=June 19, 2012|title=The Humane Society of the United States and Born Free USA Praise Hawaii Governor for Signing Bear Bile Prohibition into Law|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate the bile extraction process, mature bears are usually kept in small cages measuring approximately 130 x 70 x 60&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; These cages are so small they prevent the bears from being able to sit upright, stand or turn around. Some bears are kept in crush cages, the sides of which can be moved inwards to restrain the bear. The HSUS reports that some bears are moved to a crush cage for milking, but the remainder of the time live in a cage large enough to stand and turn around.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Bile bears are often subjected to other procedures which have their own concomitant ethical and welfare concerns. These include [[declawing]] in which the third [[phalanx bone|phalanx]] of each front digit is [[Amputation|amputated]] to prevent the bears from self-mutilating or harming the farm workers. They may also have their hind teeth removed for the same reasons. These procedures are often conducted by unskilled farm staff and may result in the bears experiencing constant pain thereafter.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

Pathology reports have shown that bile from sick bears is often contaminated with, blood, pus, faeces, urine, bacteria and cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animalsasia.org/uk/our-work/end-bear-bile-farming/what-is-bear-bile-farming/overview.html|title=Overview|website=www.animalsasia.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare concerns==
International concern about the welfare of bile bears began in 1993.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; Many bile bear farms have little or no veterinary supervision and the animal husbandry is often conducted by non-skilled attendants. In combination with the impacts of small cage sizes, their spacing and lack of internal structures, there are several indicators of poor welfare.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;

===Physiological indicators===
Elevated [[corticosteroid]] concentrations are a widely acknowledged indicator of physiological stress. Corticosteroid concentrations in the hair of Asiatic black bears relocated from a bile farm to a bear rescue centre fell between 12 and 88% over 163 days.&lt;ref name="Malcolm"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Malcolm, K.D. |author2=McShea, W.J. |author3=Van Deelen, T.R. |author4=Bacon, H.J. |author5=Liu, F. |author6=Putman, S. |author7=Brown, J.L. |year=2013|title=Analyses of fecal and hair glucocorticoids to evaluate short-and long-term stress and recovery of Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) removed from bile farms in China|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=185|pages=97–106 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.01.014|pmid=23416358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other physiological indicators of stress and potentially reduced welfare include growth retardation and [[ulcer]]s.&lt;ref name="Malcolm" /&gt;

A 2000 survey revealed that bile bears suffered from sores, skin conditions, ectoparasites, hair loss, bone deformities, injuries, swollen limbs, dental and breathing problems, diarrhoea and scarring.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;{{cite report|author=Maas, B.|year=2000|title=The veterinary, behavioural and welfare implications of bear farming in Asia|publisher=World Society for the Protection of Animals|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey of 165 bears removed from a farm showed that (out of 181 free-drip bears), 163 (99%) had cholecystitis, 109 (66%) had gallbladder polyps, 56 (34%) had abdominal herniation, 46 (28%) had internal abscessation, 36 (22%) had gallstones, and 7 (4%) had peritonitis. Many of the bears had a combination of these conditions.&lt;ref name="Lu"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lu, J., Bayne, K. and Wang, J.|year=2013|title=Current status of animal welfare and animal rights in China|journal=Alternatives to Laboratory Animals|volume=41|pages=351–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioural indicators===
Academic sources report that bile bears exhibit [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]] such as [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]], excessive inactivity and [[Self-harm#Other animals|self-mutilation]].&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malcolm" /&gt;

Living for 10–12 years under such circumstances results in severe mental stress and muscle atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Embassy of China: [http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/BearBileFarming.htm "Bile Bear Report."]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617163427/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/BearBileFarming.htm |date=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Animal Protection]] sent researchers to 11 bile farms.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} They reported seeing bears moaning, banging their heads against their cages, and chewing their own paws ([[autophagia]]).

The Chinese media reported an incident in which a mother bear, having escaped her cage, strangled her own cub and then killed herself by intentionally running into a wall.&lt;ref name="asiaone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother bear kills cub then itself|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20110805-292947.html|accessdate=10 August 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and mortality===
Farmed bile bears live to an average age of five years old whereas healthy captive bears can live up to 35 years of age and wild bears for between 25 and 30 years.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Legislation==

===China===
In 1994, Chinese authorities announced that no new bear farms would be licensed and in 1996, issued a special notice stating that no foreign object was allowed to be inserted into a bear body. No bears younger than 3 years of age and lighter than 100&amp;nbsp;kg were to be used for bile extraction, and bears could be confined in cages only during the time of bile extraction. The authorities required the adoption of the free-drip method which necessitates the creation of an artificial fistula between the gallbladder and the abdominal wall by opening a cut into the gallbladder.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Li, P.J.|year=2004|title=China's bear farming and long-term solutions.|journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=71–81|doi=10.1207/s15327604jaws0701_5|pmid=15066772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Chinese State Council Information Office said that it was enforcing a "Technical Code of Practice for Raising Black Bears", which "requires hygienic, painless practice for gall extraction and make strict regulations on the techniques and conditions for nursing, exercise and propagation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/xw/t231011.htm |title=Press Conference on Animal Welfare, Sponsored by the State Council Information Office(12/01/2006) |publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2007 veterinary report published by the [[Animals Asia Foundation]] (AAF) stated that the Technical Code was not being enforced and that many bears were still spending their entire lives in small extraction cages without free access to food or water. The report also noted that the free-dripping technique promoted in the Technical Code was unsanitary as the fistula was an open portal through which bacteria could infiltrate the abdomen. The report also stated that surgeries to create free-dripping fistulae caused bears great suffering as they were performed without appropriate antibiotics or pain management and the bears were repeatedly exposed to this process as the fistulae often healed over. The free-dripping method still requires the bears to be prodded with a metal rod when the wound heals over and under veterinary examination, some bears with free-dripping fistulae were actually found to have clear perspex catheters permanently implanted into their gallbladders. In addition to the suffering caused by infection and pain at the incision site, 28% of fistulated bears also experience abdominal hernias and more than one-third eventually succumb to liver cancer, believed to be associated with the bile-extraction process.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, bear farming was declared illegal in 1992. However, it was reported in 2008 that over 1,300 bears were still on 108 farms where farmers were hoping that legal farming would resume.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt; {{as of|2008}}, wild bears over the age of ten could still be legally killed for their gallbladders in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese government in 2005 made it illegal to extract bear bile&lt;ref name="WAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldanimalprotection.org.uk/campaigns/wildlife/bear-bile-farming|publisher=World Animal Protection|title=Bear bile industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a commitment to phase out bear farming. In 2008, there were still 3,410 bears on farms in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;

==Rescue centers==
The animal welfare charity Animals Asia have founded two award-winning rescue bear sanctuaries, one in China and another in Vietnam. This charity has rescued 500 bears - more than any other organisation in the world.&lt;ref name="Who We Are"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animalsasia.org/uk/about-us/who-we-are.html|title=Who We Are|website=www.animalsasia.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals Asia also works to end the trade in dogs and cats for food in China and Vietnam, and lobbies to improve the welfare of companion animals, promote humane population management and prevent the cross border export of "meat dogs" in Asia.&lt;ref name="Who We Are"/&gt;

==Alternative sources==
There are two alternative sources for bile from farmed bears, i.e. wild bears and synthetic sources.

===Wild bears===
Bile from farmed bears is considered inferior to bile and gall from wild bears.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;

====Implications for conservation====
Officially, 7,600 captive bears are farmed in China. According to Chinese officials, 10,000 wild bears would need to be killed each year to produce as much bile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parry-Jones |first1=R. |last2=Vincent |first2=A. |title=Can we tame wild medicine?|journal=New Scientist |volume=157 |issue=2115 |year=1998 |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials see farming as a reasonable answer to the loss of wild bears from poaching and are insouciant about animal welfare concerns. However, the government's agreement to allow the rescue of 500 bears may represent a softening of this stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsasia.org/index.php?module=8&amp;menupos=1&amp;submenupos=8&amp;item=4&amp;lg=en|title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report indicated that the illegal trade in bear bile and gallbladder for traditional medicine is open and widespread across Malaysia and is potentially a serious threat to wild bears. In a survey of 365 traditional medicine shops across Malaysia, 175 (48%) claimed to be selling bear gallbladders and medicinal products containing bear bile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ling |first1=L.S. |last2=Burgess |first2=E.A. |last3=Chng |first3=S.C. |year=2015 |title=Hard to bear: An assessment of trade in bear bile and gall bladder in Malaysia |url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2015/5/29/survey-finds-medicines-from-bear-parts-widely-available-in-m.html |publisher=TRAFFIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of bile bear farms argue, "Wildlife farming offers, at first glance, an intuitively satisfying solution: a legal trade can in principle be created by farming animals to assuage demand for wild animals which thus need not be harvested."&lt;ref name=Dutton2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dutton |first1=A.J. |last2=Hepburn |first2=C. |last3=Macdonald |first3=D.W. |year=2011 |title=A stated preference investigation into the Chinese demand for farmed vs. wild bear bile |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |page=e21243 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021243|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621243D |pmid=21799733 |pmc=3140486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, bears continue to be hunted in the wild to supply the bile farms. A survey in 2000 reported that almost all of the farms in the study supplemented their captive population of bile bears with wild-caught bears.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This is claimed to be necessary because of difficulties with captive breeding.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt; Consumers of bear bile have a strong preference for bile produced from wild bears; bile from farms may, therefore, not be a perfect substitute for bile from wild bears.&lt;ref name="Dutton2011" /&gt; Bear farming in Laos may be increasing the incentive to poach wild bears.&lt;ref name="Livingstone" /&gt;

A review of multiple types of wildlife tourist attractions concluded that bile bear farms had negative impacts on both animal welfare and conservation.&lt;ref name="Moorhouse"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moorhouse |first1=T.P. |last2=Dahlsjö |first2=C.A. |last3=Baker |first3=S.E. |last4=D'Cruze |first4=N.C. |last5=Macdonald |first5=D.W. |year=2015 |title=The customer isn't always right—conservation and animal welfare implications of the increasing demand for wildlife tourism |journal=PLoS One |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=e0138939 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138939 |pmid=26489092 |pmc=4619427|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1038939M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poaching in the United States====
In the late 1980s, U.S. park rangers began finding bear carcasses missing only gallbladders and paws. Initially, it was considered that occasional hunters were the cause, but investigations uncovered evidence that large commercial organizations were dealing in poaching and smuggling. During a three-year operation (Operation SOUP) ending in 1999, 52 people were arrested and 300 gallbladders seized in [[Virginia]]. Another investigation in [[Oregon]] led police to bring racketeering charges against an organisation that poached an estimated 50 to 100 bears per year for a decade.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neme"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neme, L.A.|year=2009|title=Animal Investigators: How the World's First Wildlife Forensics Lab is Solving Crimes and Saving Endangered Species|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated in 2008 that in North America, 40,000 [[American black bear]]s are illegally poached for their gallbladders and paws each year.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;

===Synthetic sources===
The pharmacologically active ingredient contained in bear bile is [[ursodeoxycholic acid]] (UDCA). This can be synthesized using cow or pig bile, or even using no animal ingredients.&lt;ref name="JCM" /&gt; The generic drug name is [[Ursodiol]] and it is now being widely produced under brand names such as [[Actigall]], [[Urso]], [[Ursofalk]], [[Ursogal]] and [[Ursotan]].&lt;ref name="JCM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives to bear bile|publisher=Journal of Chinese Medicine|url=https://www.jcm.co.uk/news/asiatic-black-bear-alternatives-to-bear-bile/|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated in 2008 that 100,000&amp;nbsp;kg of synthetic UDCA was already being used each year in China, Japan and South Korea, and that the total world consumption may be double this figure.&lt;ref name="Kavoussi" /&gt;  However, because of its artificial origin, synthetic UDCA is not considered by many as an acceptable substitute.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;

In Japan, UDCA has been synthesised from cow galls, as a by-product of slaughter, since 1955. It is also produced in the U.S. by Ciba-Geigy.

In 2014, [[Kaibao Pharmaceuticals]], which supplies approximately half of the bear bile consumed in China, stated it is developing another synthetic source derived from poultry bile.&lt;ref name="Hance" /&gt;

==Statistics==

===Wild population===
The world population of Asiatic black bears decreased between 30% to 49% between 1980 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Kikuchi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kikuchi, R.|year=2012|title=Captive bears in human–animal welfare conflict: A case study of bile extraction on Asia's bear farms|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|volume=25|issue=1|pages=55–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their reliability is unclear, range-wide estimates of 5–6,000 bears have been presented by Russian biologists. Rough density estimates without corroborating methods or data have been made in India and Pakistan, resulting in estimates of 7–9,000 in India and 1,000 in Pakistan. Unsubstantiated estimates from China give varying estimates between 15,000 and 46,000, with a government estimate of 28,000.&lt;ref name="iucn-ut"/&gt; Some estimates put the current (2015) total Asian worldwide population as low as 25,000.&lt;ref name="Hance" /&gt;

===Farmed population===

The [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]] has been reported in 2011 as saying that more than 12,000 bears are currently estimated to be housed in both illegal and legal bear farms across Asia.&lt;ref name="Speroforum" /&gt;

====China====
[[World Animal Protection]] conducted a study in 1999 and 2000, and estimated that 247 bear bile farms in China were holding 7,002 bears, though the Chinese government called the figures "pure speculation."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Chinese consider bear farms a way to reduce the demand on the wild bear population. Officially, 7,600 captive bears are farmed in China. According to Chinese officials, 10,000 wild bears would need to be killed each year to produce as much bile.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Parry-Jones, Rob &amp; Vincent, Amanda|url=http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pdfs/parryjones_and_vincent1998_newscientist.html|title=Can we tame wild medicine?|publisher=New Scientist|volume=157|issue=2115|date=January 3, 1998|pages=26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015002358/http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pdfs/parryjones_and_vincent1998_newscientist.html|archivedate=October 15, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government sees farming as a reasonable answer to the loss of wild bears from poaching. However, the government's agreement to allow the rescue of 500 bears may represent a softening of this stance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

China has repeatedly been found to be the main source of bear bile products on sale throughout South-East Asia; this international trade in their parts and derivatives is strictly prohibited by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  
In 2010, there were approximately 97 establishments in China keeping bile bears.&lt;ref name="Malcolm" /&gt;

In 2013, estimates of bears kept in cages in China for bile production range from 9,000&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagesofshame.com/page2.html|title=Cages of shame|year=2013|publisher=Guinness Entertainment Pty Ltd|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 20,000 bears on nearly 100 domestic bear farms.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt; One company (Fujian Guizhen Tang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) alone has more than 400 black bears to supply bile using the free drip method. The bile is harvested twice a day to collect a total of approximately 130 ml from each bear per day.&lt;ref name="Lu" /&gt;

Before the existence of bear farms (i.e. pre-1980) the demand for bear bile in China was about 500 kilos annually. In 2008, the demand had risen to about 4,000 kilos annually.&lt;ref name="Tsai" /&gt;

====Korea====
In 2009, according to the Korean Environment Ministry, 1,374 bears were raised at 74 farms across South Korea. In Korea, it is legal to keep bears for bile and bears older than 10 years old can be harvested for their paws and organs.&lt;ref name="Gwang-lip2009" /&gt; In 2012, the number of bears in Korean farms have risen to about 1,600.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Laos====
In [[Laos]], the first farm was established in 2000. The number of farmed bears tripled from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, there were 121 Asiatic black bears and one sun bear on 11 commercial facilities. It is possible that all the bears were wild-caught domestically, or illegally imported internationally. This is in violation of both National and International law.&lt;ref name="Livingstone"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Livingstone, E.  |author2=Shepherd, C.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2016|title=Bear farms in Lao PDR expand illegally and fail to conserve wild bears|journal=Oryx|volume=50|issue=1|pages=176–184|doi=10.1017/s0030605314000477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Laos in 2011, bear bile was selling for 120,000 kip (US$15) per ml, half the average monthly wage of 240,000 kip.&lt;ref name="Speroforum"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=58050&amp;t=Laos%3A+++Authorities+shut+down+bear+farm+that+extracted+the+animal%92s+bile|title= Laos: Authorities shut down bear farm that extracted the animal's bile|publisher=SperoNews|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary value of the bile comes from the traditional prescription of bear bile by doctors practicing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Bear bile contains [[ursodeoxycholic acid]]. It is purchased and consumed to treat hemorrhoids, sore throats, sores, bruising, muscle ailments, sprains, epilepsy, reduce fever, improve eyesight, break down gallstones, act as an anti-inflammatory, reduce the effects of overconsumption of alcohol, and to 'clear' the liver.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt; It is currently found in various forms for sale including whole gallbladders, raw bile, pills, powder, flakes, and ointment.&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt;

[[File:Examples of Bear Bile Products Seized by the Hong Kong Government - (37610617206).jpg|thumb|Examples of Bear Bile Products Seized by the Hong Kong Government]]
Because only minute amounts of bile are used in TCM, a total of 500&amp;nbsp;kg{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} of bear bile is used by practitioners every year, but according to WSPA, more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;kg{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} are being produced. The surplus is being used in other inessential products such as throat lozenges, shampoo, toothpaste, wine, tea, eyedrops, and general tonics.&lt;ref name="Guinness" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt;

===Efficacy===
Bile products have not been found to have any medical efficacy; it is unlikely to have the efficacy claimed by Chinese herbalists. It has been stated, "These products have absolutely no benefit to health"&lt;ref name="Guinness"/&gt; and "Scientists have scrutinized the health effects of bear bile but have come to no definitive conclusions".&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt;

===Cost===
In 2011, the overall worldwide trade in bear parts, including bile, was estimated to be a $2 billion industry.&lt;ref name="Kavoussi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kavoussi, B.|title=Asian bear bile remedies: Traditional medicine or barbarism?|year=2001|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/asian-bear-bile-remedies-barbarism-or-medicine/|publisher=Science-Based Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gallbladder====
In 1970, 1&amp;nbsp;kg of bear gallbladder cost approximately US$200, but by 1990 the price had risen to between US$3,000 and US$5,000 per kg. In 2009, the market price for legally sold gallbladders in Hong Kong had risen to between US$30,000 and US$50,000 per kg.&lt;ref name="Feng" /&gt;

A report published in 2013 stated that a poacher in North America can usually get US$100 to $150 for a gallbladder, but the organs can fetch $5,000 to $10,000 in the end-market once they are processed into a powder. The report also stated that the HSUS indicated a bear gallbladder can cost more than $3,000 in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beargallbladder.net/bear-gall-bladder/|title=Bear gall bladder|author=Zhao, D.|year=2013|accessdate=October 8, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723031149/http://beargallbladder.net/bear-gall-bladder/|archivedate=July 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TRAFFIC report estimated that prices for whole gallbladders were as low as $51.11 (Myanmar) and as high as $2,000 (Hong Kong SAR). For gallbladder by the gram, the least expensive was $0.11 per gram (Thailand) and the highest was $109.70 per gram (Japan).&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt;

====Raw bile and bile powder====
Raw bile can sell for as much as US$24,000 per kg, about half the price of gold.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt;

There is huge profitability in the trade of bile powder. In 2007, while the wholesale price of bile powder was approximately US$410 per kg in China, the retail price increased to 25 to 50 fold in South Korea, and to 80 fold in Japan, i.e. US$33,000 per kg.&lt;ref name="Kavoussi" /&gt;

====Pills====
Pill prices ranged from as low as $0.38 per pill (Malaysia) to $3.83 per pill (Thailand).&lt;ref name="Isaccs" /&gt; and in the U.S., approximately $1 per pill, which is an average price between the two countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Businesses==
In 2010, the [[Guizhentang Pharmaceutical company]] was one of the most successful bile extraction companies in China, paying some 10 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] in taxes.&lt;ref name="jinghua1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.jinghua.cn/351/c/201202/24/n3642737.shtml |title=业内人士称受舆论影响归真堂上市前景再生变数 _京华网 |publisher=News.jinghua.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608194139/http://news.jinghua.cn/351/c/201202/24/n3642737.shtml |archive-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company tried to go public in the [[Shenzhen stock exchange]] and proposed to triple the company’s stock of captive bears, from 400 to 1,200.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt; This provoked a large response from those opposed to bear bile farming, and met heavy challenges from activists, internet users and protesters.&lt;ref name="news1631"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/12/0227/10/7R8T62KG00011229.html |title=归真堂深圳门店遭"围观" 志愿者扮熊模仿被取胆_网易新闻中心 |publisher=News.163.com |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a number of controversies along with public interviews.&lt;ref name="moneyycwb1"&gt;{{cite web|author=来源:新华网　　发表时间：2012-02-28 11:13 |url=http://money.ycwb.com/2012-02/28/content_3731563.htm |title=归真堂创始人哭诉被陷害：早知道这样就不搞上市_理财_金羊网 |publisher=Money.ycwb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biologics Control Act''' of 1902, also known as the Virus-Toxin Law, was the first law that implemented federal regulations of [[Biopharmaceutical|biological products]] such as [[vaccine]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/100YearsofBiologicsRegulation/ucm070022.htm#TheSt.LouisTragedyandEnactmentofthe1902BiologicsControlAct|title=100 Years of Biologics Regulation - Science and the Regulation of Biological Products|last=Affairs|first=Office of Regulatory|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enacted in response to two incidents involving the deaths of 22 children who had contracted [[tetanus]] from contaminated [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milstien|first=Julie B.|date=2004|title=Regulation of Vaccines: Strengthening the Science Base|url=|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|volume=25| issue =  2|pages=173–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law paved the way for further regulation of drug products under the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 and the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938. Biologics control is now under the supervision of the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SelectionsFromFDLIUpdateSeriesonFDAHistory/ucm091754.htm|title=Selections From FDLI Update Series on FDA History - Biologics Centennial: 100 Years of Biologics Regulation|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Marine Hospital Service Stapleton Staten Island 19thcentury.gif|thumb|left|alt=The Marine Hospital, Staten Island, N.Y.|The Marine Hospital, Staten Island, N.Y. In 1887, National Institute of Health began as a single room Laboratory of Hygiene for bacteriological investigation established by the [[Marine Hospital Service|U.S. Marine Hospital Service]] at Stapleton, Staten Island, New York. From 1887 to 1891, the Laboratory was located in the attic of the Marine Hospital on Staten Island.]]
When the large scale production of vaccines began in the late 19th century, the United States had no government regulations on biological products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parascandola|first=John|date=November–December 1995|title=The Public Health Service and the Control of Biologics|url=|journal=Public Health Reports|volume= 110| issue =  6|pages=774–775}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, a 5-year-old girl died of tetanus in St. Louis, Missouri after being given a [[Diphtheria antitoxin|diphtheria anti-toxin]]. Investigations found that the St. Louis Board of Health produced the contaminated vaccine using the blood of a horse infected with tetanus. While the infected horse, [[Jim (horse)|Jim]], was killed, the Board of Health continued to use the serum to treat diphtheria. It was later discovered that 12 other children had died from the same contaminated vaccines in St. Louis. That same year, 9 children in [[Camden, New Jersey]] died from contaminated smallpox vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/forgshistory/cber/ucm135758.htm|title=Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research History - The Road to the Biotech Revolution - Highlights of 100 Years of Biologics Regulation|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents led the Hygienic Laboratory and the Medical Society of the District of Columbia to propose a law regulating the production of biological products. On July 1, 1902, Congress passed the Biologics Control Act.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Contents of the Act ==
The Biologics Control Act established a board to oversee the implementation of regulations of biological products. The board consisted of the Surgeon-General of the Army, the Surgeon-General of the Navy, and the Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital Service, and was to be overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury. This board was given the power to issue, suspend, and revoke licenses to produce and sell biological products. The Biologics Control Act also mandated that all products be labeled accurately with the name of the product and the address and license number of the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Laboratories could be subjected to unannounced inspections by the Treasury Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Donald|date=November–December 1978|title=The Food and Drug Administration and the Backward Motion toward the Source|url=|journal=Public Health Reports|volume= 93| issue =  6|pages=607–615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for the violation of this law was a fine of up to $500 or up to a year in prison.

== Institutions ==
The Laboratory of Hygiene of the Marine Health Service, established on Staten Island, NY, in 1887, was in charge of testing biologics before the Biologics Control Act. It was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1891, and renamed the Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in 1902.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Hygienic Laboratory was responsible for renewing licenses annually, testing products, and performing inspections. In 1930, the [[Ransdell Act]] transformed the Hygienic Laboratory into the National Institute of Health and gave it a larger role in public health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 29, 1930|title=The National Institute of Health|url=|journal=Science|volume=New Series, Vol. 72, No. 1861|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the name was changed again to the [[National Institutes of Health]], as it encompassed many institutes and centers dedicated to biomedical research. In 1972, biologics regulation was moved to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and later became known as the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)]].

== Impact ==
The Biologics Control Act set a precedent for the federal regulation of biologics such as vaccines and blood components.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the development of biotechnology, the FDA’s [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)]] has taken a larger role in reviewing and approving new biological products intended for medical purposes, including [[probiotic]]s, [[xenotransplantation]] and [[gene therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/|title=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)|last=Research|first=Center for Biologics Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Association''', usually abbreviated as '''BESLA''', is a professional organization of attorneys along with sports and entertainment executives of color to provide continuing education and other support services to its members.

==Organization==
BESLA's headquarters is in [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]. Lawrence C. Hinkle II serves as Chairman of the Board and Khadijah Sharif-Drinkard serves as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.besla.org/officers-bod|title=besla {{!}} OFFICERS &amp; BOD|website=besla|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1980, during the first annual Black Music Association Conference in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a group of prominent African-American attorneys determined that there was a need for a support organization to help individuals survive in a competitive marketplace.  This led to the development of the Black Entertainment Lawyers Association (BELA), later that year. One of the founding members was the late David McCoy Franklin, a pioneering African-American entertainment attorney who had represented such talents as [[Donny Hathaway]], [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] and [[Richard Pryor]].

'''''Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman''''' (1995) C-415/93 (known as the '''Bosman ruling''')&lt;ref&gt;[1995] ECR I-4921&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1995 [[European Court of Justice]] decision concerning [[freedom of movement for workers]], [[freedom of association]], and [[direct effect]] of article 39&lt;ref name="article39"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E039:EN:HTML|title=Article 39, Treaty Establishing the European Community|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615143740/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri%3DCELEX%3A12002E039%3AEN%3AHTML|archive-date=2008-06-15|dead-url=yes|accessdate=27 August 2008|work=EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now article 45 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) of the [[Treaty of Rome|TEC]]. The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of footballers within the [[European Union]] (EU).

The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract without a [[Free transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] being paid.

The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player [[Jean-Marc Bosman]]:
* ''[[Belgian Football Association]] v Jean-Marc Bosman''
* ''[[R.F.C. de Liège]] v Jean-Marc Bosman and others''
* ''[[UEFA]] v Jean-Marc Bosman''

==Facts==
[[Jean-Marc Bosman]] was a player for [[R.F.C. de Liège|RFC Liège]] in the [[Belgian First Division]] in Belgium whose contract had expired in 1990. He wanted to change teams and move to [[USL Dunkerque|Dunkerque]], a French club. However, Dunkerque refused to meet his Belgian club's transfer fee demand, so Liège refused to release Bosman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/who-is-jeanmarc-bosman-1602219.html|title=Who is Jean-Marc Bosman?|last=Burton|first=Mark|date=21 September 1995|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Bosman's wages were reduced as he was no longer a first-team player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3480363/Jean-Marc-Bosmans-fight-against-depression-and-alcoholism.html|title=Jean-Marc Bosman's fight against depression and alcoholism|last=Phillips|first=Martin|date=21 March 2011|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his case to the [[European Court of Justice]] in Luxembourg and sued for [[restraint of trade]], citing [[FIFA]]'s rules regarding football, specifically Article 17.

==Judgment==
On 15 December 1995, the court ruled the system, as it was constituted, placed a restriction on the free movement of workers and was prohibited by Article 39(1) of the [[Treaty of Rome|EC Treaty]] (now Article 45 (1) of the [[Treaty on the functioning of the European Union]]). Bosman and all other EU footballers were given the right to a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] at the expiration of their contracts, with the caveat they were transferring from a club within one EU association to a club within another EU association.

{{Cquote|94. The provisions of the Treaty relating to freedom of movement for persons are intended to facilitate the pursuit by Community citizens of occupational activities of all kinds throughout the Community, and preclude measures which might place Community citizens at a disadvantage when they wish to pursue an economic activity in the territory of another Member State (see Case 143/87 ''[[Stanton v INASTI]]'' [1988] ECR 3877, paragraph 13, and Case C-370/90 ''[[The Queen v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh]]'' [1992] ECR I-4265, paragraph 16).

95. In that context, nationals of Member States have in particular the right, which they derive directly from the Treaty, to leave their country of origin to enter the territory of another Member State and reside there in order there to pursue an economic activity (see, inter alia, Case C-363/89 ''[[Roux v Belgium]]'' [1991] ECR I-273, paragraph 9, and Singh, cited above, paragraph 17).

96. Provisions which preclude or deter a national of a Member State from leaving his country of origin in order to exercise his right to freedom of movement therefore constitute an obstacle to that freedom even if they apply without regard to the nationality of the workers concerned (see also Case C-10/90 ''[[Masgio v Bundesknappschaft]]'' [1991] ECR I-1119, paragraphs 18 and 19).

97. The Court has also stated, in Case 81/87 ''[[R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury|The Queen v HM Treasury and Commissioners of Inland Revenue ex parte Daily Mail and General Trust plc]]'' [1988] ECR 5483, paragraph 16, that even though the Treaty provisions relating to freedom of establishment are directed mainly to ensuring that foreign nationals and companies are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated under its legislation which comes within the definition contained in Article 58. The rights guaranteed by Article 52 et seq. of the Treaty would be rendered meaningless if the Member State of origin could prohibit undertakings from leaving in order to establish themselves in another Member State. The same considerations apply, in relation to Article 48 of the Treaty, with regard to rules which impede the freedom of movement of nationals of one Member State wishing to engage in gainful employment in another Member State.

98. It is true that the transfer rules in issue in the main proceedings apply also to transfers of players between clubs belonging to different national associations within the same Member State and that similar rules govern transfers between clubs belonging to the same national association.

99. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Bosman, by the Danish Government and by the Advocate General in points 209 and 210 of his Opinion, those rules are likely to restrict the freedom of movement of players who wish to pursue their activity in another Member State by preventing or deterring them from leaving the clubs to which they belong even after the expiry of their contracts of employment with those clubs.

100. Since they provide that a professional footballer may not pursue his activity with a new club established in another Member State unless it has paid his former club a transfer fee agreed upon between the two clubs or determined in accordance with the regulations of the sporting associations, the said rules constitute an obstacle to freedom of movement for workers.

101. As the national court has rightly pointed out, that finding is not affected by the fact that the transfer rules adopted by [[UEFA]] in 1990 stipulate that the business relationship between the two clubs is to exert no influence on the activity of the player, who is to be free to play for his new club. The new club must still pay the fee in issue, under pain of penalties which may include its being struck off for debt, which prevents it just as effectively from signing up a player from a club in another Member State without paying that fee.

102. Nor is that conclusion negated by the case-law of the Court cited by URBSFA and UEFA, to the effect that Article 30 of the Treaty does not apply to measures which restrict or prohibit certain selling arrangements so long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and so long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member States (see Joined Cases C-267/91 and C-268/91 ''[[Keck and Mithouard]]'' [1993] ECR I-6097, paragraph 16).

103. It is sufficient to note that, although the rules in issue in the main proceedings apply also to transfers between clubs belonging to different national associations within the same Member State and are similar to those governing transfers between clubs belonging to the same national association, they still directly affect players'access to the employment market in other Member States and are thus capable of impeding freedom of movement for workers. They cannot, thus, be deemed comparable to the rules on selling arrangements for goods which in Keck and Mithouard were held to fall outside the ambit of Article 30 of the Treaty (see also, with regard to freedom to provide services, Case C-384/93 ''[[Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën]]'' [1995] ECR I-1141, paragraphs 36 to 38).

104. Consequently, the transfer rules constitute an obstacle to freedom of movement for workers prohibited in principle by Article 48 of the Treaty. It could only be otherwise if those rules pursued a legitimate aim compatible with the Treaty and were justified by pressing reasons of public interest. But even if that were so, application of those rules would still have to be such as to ensure achievement of the aim in question and not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose (see, inter alia, the judgment in ''[[Kraus]]'', cited above, paragraph 32, and Case C-55/94 ''[[Gebhard v Consiglio dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano|Gebhard]]'' [1995] ECR I-0000, paragraph 37).}}

==Significance==
Prior to the Bosman ruling, professional clubs in some parts of Europe (but not, for example, in Spain and France) were able to prevent players from joining a club in another country even if their contracts had expired. In the United Kingdom, Transfer Tribunals had been in place since 1981 to resolve disputes over fees between clubs when transferring players at the end of their contracts. The Bosman ruling meant that players could move to a new club at the end of their contract without their old club receiving a fee. Players can now agree a pre-contract with another club for a free transfer if the players' contract with their existing club has six months or less remaining.

The Bosman ruling also prohibited domestic football leagues in EU member states, and also [[UEFA]], from imposing quotas on foreign players to the extent that they discriminated against nationals of EU states. At that time, many leagues placed quotas restricting the number of non-nationals allowed on member teams. Also, UEFA had a rule that prohibited teams in its competitions, namely the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], from naming more than three "foreign" players in their squads for any game. After the ruling, quotas could still be imposed, but could only be used to restrict the number of non-EU players on each team.

===Players===
Since the ruling came into effect throughout the EU in 1995, several notable players in European football have benefited from the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/297921.stm | title=Bosman summer holiday | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 March 1999 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Edgar Davids]] became Europe's first high-profile player to benefit from the ruling when he moved from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. In 1999, [[Steve McManaman]] became the most lucrative transfer at the time in British football, as "Britain's first high-profile Bosman departure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/fourfourtwoview/archive/2009/01/06/how-money-took-over-football-in-1879.aspx | title=How money took over football… in 1879 | publisher=FourFourTwo | date=6 January 2009 | accessdate=13 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107212633/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/fourfourtwoview/archive/2009/01/06/how-money-took-over-football-in-1879.aspx | archivedate=7 January 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he moved from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and the deal resulted in McManaman becoming the highest paid British player in history, from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/04/newsstory.sport | title=Our man in Madrid | publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Observer | first=Amy | last=Raphael | date=4 March 2001 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Davids and McManaman, scores of other notable players became able to negotiate deals according to their market value when their contracts expired, a trend that continued into the 2000s and beyond.

===Clubs===
The ruling meant that clubs could no longer block a move or demand a fee, from the player or from the destination club, if the player left at the end of their contracts.

The Bosman ruling coincided directly with a new era of financial gains in football. In 2005, UEFA declared it was seeking to repair aspects of the ruling because it was believed to be the cause of the increasing rich-poor gap between elite and smaller clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4528822.stm | title=Uefa to discuss Bosman drawbacks | publisher=BBC Sport | date=15 December 2005 | accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance in EU law==
Bosman confirmed the "rule of reason" approach of the courts used in the important [[Rewe-Zentral_AG_v_Bundesmonopolverwaltung_für_Branntwein|Cassis de Dijon]] case as not only suitable for issues relating to movement of goods within the EU, but also for cases concerning the free movement of workers.
 
If free movement is indistinctly applied (i.e. not just against foreign nationals) it could be justified if...
# The measures used were in pursuit of a legitimate aim
#That aim was justified by pressing reasons of public interest

The case also alludes to the fact that ''Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën'' provides a similar test for services, and ''Gebhard v Consiglio dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano'' for establishment.

===Other cases===
The Bosman ruling was considered and distinguished in ''Lehtonen'' (2000), a similar case which involved a deadline imposed by [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] after which basketball teams could not include players who had played for another team in the same season, where it was found that such a restriction was lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0176:EN:NOT| title=Judgment of the Court (Sixth Chamber) of 13 April 2000 – Jyri Lehtonen and Castors Canada Dry Namur-Braine ASBL v Fédération royale belge des sociétés de basket-ball ASBL (FRBSB)|work=EUR-Lex | publisher=Publications Office of the European Union | date=13 April 2000 | accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''City of Los Angeles v. Lyons''''',  461 U.S. 95 (1983), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision holding that the plaintiff, Adolph Lyons, lacked [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the city police department's use of [[chokehold]]s.

==Background==
In 1976, Adolph Lyons was stopped by four white officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) for driving with a broken [[tail light]]. The unarmed 24-year-old was ordered to leave his vehicle by officers with guns drawn and to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head. After being frisked, Lyons put his hands down. That prompted one officer to grab his hands and slam them against his head.

When Lyons complained that holding his car keys was causing him pain, a police officer put him in a chokehold until he [[unconsciousness|lost consciousness]]. He woke up lying face down in the road with [[Defecation|soiled underwear]] and blood and dirt in his mouth. The officers gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way.&lt;ref name="hhg"/&gt;

Seven years later, he sought both compensatory damages for the chokehold and declaratory and injunctive relief against the LAPD's chokehold policy (he introduced evidence from 1975 to 1983 that 16 people, including 12 African-Americans, had been killed by the LAPD using [[chokehold#Use in law enforcement|chokeholds]].&lt;ref name="hhg"&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
In an opinion authored by [[Byron White|Justice White]], the Court held 5-4 that Lyons had failed to allege a sufficiently-plausible threat of future injury to have standing over an [[injunction]]. Lyons, however, had standing for his damages action since it was retrospective and the injury, being subjected to the chokehold, was concrete and particular. The decision helped to establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for ''each'' form of relief sought.{{expand section|date=April 2012}}

==Dissenting opinion==
[[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]]'s dissent argued that the majority's test would immunize from review any widespread policy that deprives constitutional rights when individuals cannot show with certainty that they would be subject to a repeat violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that the Court's traditional rule did not distinguish different forms of relief for standing purposes.{{expand section|date=April 2012}}

==Commentary==
Based on Michelle Alexander’s book ''[[The New Jim Crow]]'' Lyons' case is related to what is believed to be biased action towards certain races, in this case African-Americans. She asserts that it is hard for people of color like Lyons to prevail in the [[judicial process]], like during the [[Jim Crow]] era. According to Alexander, one of the causes of such issues is the presence of implicit bias in the [[criminal justice system]], including the courts and police officers. In support of Alexander's argument, Georgetown Law provides Professor Charles Lawrence noted, "The purposeful intent requirement found in Supreme Court equal protection doctrine, and in the court's interpretation of antidiscrimination laws disserved the value of equal citizenship expressed in those laws because many forms of [[racial bias]] are [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence|first1=Charles R. III|title="Unconscious Racism Revisited: Reflections on the Impact and Origins of "The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection"|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As specified above, since Lyons' case involves [[legal system]], unconscious [[bias]] may produce negative outcomes for African-Americans.&lt;ref name="The New Jim Crow"&gt;''The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'', Michelle Alexander, The New Press, New York 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-59558-103-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Jim Crow,'' p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">The forensic '''Conditional Release Program''' ('''CONREP''') is the California Department of State Hospitals' statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsh.ca.gov/forensics/CONREP.asp Department of State Hospitals: Forensic Conditional Release Program (CONREP)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984 and began operations on January 1, 1986.

==Details==
CONREP patients are typically young males (77% are 18–44 years old) with severe [[mental disorder]]s (66%) who have committed violent felonies (85%). Common ways for offenders to be placed in CONREP include:
* Mentally Disordered Offenders can placed in CONREP by the Board of Prison Terms instead of the court.
* Offenders found "[[not guilty by reason of insanity]]" can be placed in CONREP by filing a petition for restoration of sanity and winning at the hearing.
* Offenders found "not guilty by reason of insanity" or "[[incompetent to stand trial]]" because of a serious felony must spend six months in a state [[mental hospital]] before transfer to CONREP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/pubs/517001.htm Disability Rights California: FAQs about CONREP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners can only be transferred to CONREP after being deemed no longer dangerous and released to outpatient status.

==Difficulties==
The CONREP programs have been under investigation by a variety of Federal and State agencies for abuse of its patients. Ranging from food and housing problems, to falsifying of legal documents. The average patient may be in the CONREP program for 20 years, or even for the rest of their lives. The program has recently been in the news for its treatment of convicted multiple [[sex offender]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">The term '''"Crown servant"''' is used to denote a "person employed by the Crown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-fra.html?lang=fra&amp;i=&amp;index=alt&amp;srchtxt=CROWN%20SERVANT |title=Crown Servant |website=Termium Plus - The Government of Canada’s terminology and linguistic data bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term is not consistently defined, generally speaking the term encompasses all [[Minister of the Crown|executive officials]] and their staffs, [[civil servants]], [[police]], [[judiciary|judicial officials]], and members of the [[armed forces]]. While the term is used in other Commonwealth countries such as [[Canada]], it has the most predominant use and is the most well-defined with the [[United Kingdom]].

==Crown servant vs civil servant==
{{quote|There is no meaningful legal definition of a civil servant. The [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] following the Tomlin Commission on the Civil Service unhelpfully refers to "the civil service of the State".|John Alder, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law''&lt;ref name=Alder&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alder|first1=John|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137050007|pages=326–327|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qwAdBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;ots=qfSDSQHqz1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The terms [[civil servant]] and Crown servant can coincide but are sometimes exclusive. It is suggested that the phrase "civil servant" may include every person who serves the Crown, with the exception of members of the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces of the United Kingdom]], the [[British Government frontbench|Ministers of the Crown]] and the [[judiciaries of the United Kingdom]]. However, members of the armed forces are nonetheless Crown servants.&lt;ref name=Alder /&gt;

==Employment rights==
Crown servants serve "at the pleasure of the Crown", and do not therefore benefit from the protections normally available to employees by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Alex|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9781405812313|page=267|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TViGFDOkFRoC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=gyEB_FuHV1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of these protections are applied to them by the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]. For the purposes of the Act, "crown employment" means employment "under or for the purposes of a government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown functions conferred by an enactment", though members of the armed forces are excluded from this provision, and the government has the ability to exclude other Crown servants "for the purpose of safeguarding national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|39|Employment|893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Secrets Act 1989==
Section 12(1) of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] defines the expression "Crown servant" for the purposes of that Act. It now provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act "Crown servant" means -
:(a) a [[Minister of the Crown]];
:[(aa) a member of the [[Scottish Executive]] or a [[junior Scottish Minister]];]
:[(ab) the [[First Minister for Wales]], a [[Welsh Minister]] appointed under section 48 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the [[Counsel General to the Welsh Assembly Government]] or a [[Deputy Welsh Minister]];]
:(b) . . .
:(c) any person employed in the civil service of the Crown, including [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]], [[Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service]], the civil service of Northern Ireland and the [[Northern Ireland Court Service]];
:(d) any member of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown, including any person employed by an association established for the purposes of [Part XI of the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]]];
:(e) any [[constable]] and any other person employed or appointed in or for the purposes of any police force [(including the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland Reserve]])][or of the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]];
:(f) any person who is a member or employee of a prescribed body or a body of a prescribed class and either is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph or belongs to a prescribed class of members or employees of any such body;
:(g) any person who is the holder of a prescribed office or who is an employee of such a holder and either is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph or belongs to a prescribed class of such employees.}}

Paragraph (aa) was inserted on 6 May 1999 by section 125 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/schedule/8/paragraph/26 paragraph 26(2)] of the Schedule to, the [[Scotland Act 1998]].

This provision came into force immediately after [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|the 2007 election]] by virtue of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/section/161 section 161(1)] of that Act (subject to section 161(4) and (5), which provide that so far as it relates to functions of the Welsh Ministers, the First Minister, the Counsel General or the Assembly Commission, it came into force immediately after the end of "the initial period").

Paragraph (b) referred to a person appointed under section 8 of the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] (which related to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and other things). It was repealed on 2 December 1999&lt;ref&gt;The [[Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Commencement No. 5) Order 1999]] (S.I. 1999/3209 (C.85)), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3209/article/2/made article 2] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3209/schedule/made Schedule].&lt;/ref&gt; by sections [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/99 99] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/100 100(2)] of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/schedule/13/paragraph/9 paragraph 9] of Schedule 13 to, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/schedule/15 Schedule 15] to, the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]], subject to savings in [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/95 section 95] of that Act.

The words in the first set of square brackets in paragraph (e) were substituted for the words "(including a police force within the meaning of the [[Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970]])" on 4 November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2001]] (S.R. 2001/396 (C.19)), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2001/396/article/2/made article 2] and  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2001/396/schedule/made Schedule].&lt;/ref&gt; by section 74 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/32/schedule/6/paragraph/9 paragraph 9] of Schedule 6 to, the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]].

The words in the second set of square brackets in that paragraph were substituted for the words "or of the [[National Criminal Intelligence Service]] or the [[National Crime Squad]]" on 1 April 2006&lt;ref&gt;The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional and Transitory Provisions and Savings) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/378 (C.9)), article 4(1) and paragraph 10 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/378/schedule/made Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; by section 59 of, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114162441/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/schedule/4/paragraph/58/prospective paragraph 58] of Schedule 4 to, the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]]. The words "or of the [[National Criminal Intelligence Service]] or the [[National Crime Squad]]" had been inserted on 1 April 1998,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police Act 1997 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1998]] (S.I. 1998/354 (C.8)), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/354/article/2/made article 2(2)(ay)]&lt;/ref&gt; by section 134(1) of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/50/schedule/9/paragraph/62 paragraph 62] of Schedule 9 to the [[Police Act 1997]].

'''Death sentence with reprieve''' ({{zh |s = 死刑缓期执行 |t=死刑緩期執行 |p = sǐxíng huǎnqī zhíxíng }}, abbr.: {{zh|labels=no |s=死缓 |p=Sǐhuǎn}}) is a [[criminal punishment]] found in the [[law of the People's Republic of China]]. According to the criminal law chapter 5 (death penalty), section 48, 50 and 51, it gives the [[death row]] inmate a two-year [[suspended sentence]] of the execution. The convicted person will be executed if found to intentionally commit further crimes during the two years following the sentence; otherwise, the sentence is automatically reduced to [[life imprisonment]] or, if the person is found to have performed deeds of merit during the two years, fixed-term imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Unlike [[pardon]] (clemency), in which the relief of the penalty is decided after the death penalty has been pronounced, reprieve is pronounced directly in place of the death sentence to the prisoner who has committed the potentially capital crime.

Chinese courts hand down this form of sentencing as frequently as, or more often than,&lt;ref name="Trevaskes"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Death Penalty in China Today: Kill Fewer, Kill Cautiously |first=Susan|last=Trevaskes|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|volume=48|number=3|date=May–June 2008|pages=393–413|doi=10.1525/as.2008.48.3.393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; actual death sentences. This unique sentence is used to emphasize the seriousness of the crime and the mercy of the court, and has a centuries-old history in Chinese jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="Scobell"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Death Penalty in Post-Mao China |first=Andrew|last=Scobell|journal=[[China Quarterly]]|number=123|date=September 1990 |pages=503–520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Amendment (IX) to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China'' in 2015, courts may act according to the circumstances for criminals charged with bribery or 'plundering the public treasury', possibly issuing a sentence without commutation or parole when the sentence was automatically reduced to life imprisonment (such as Bai Enpei, the Former Party Secretary of Yunnan). That means when a two-year suspended sentence of execution is over, a sentence of 'death with reprieve without commutation or parole' will automatically be reduced to life imprisonment – regardless of any deeds of merit performed during the two years, and the criminal will spend the rest of their life in jail, with no chance of a reduction to fixed-term imprisonment or parole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">'''Decennial liability insurance''' or "Inherent Defect Insurance" is [[insurance]] that is taken out (by the contractor or principal) to cover costs associated with the potential collapse of the building after completion.  The names derives from the fact that it covers the 10 year period after completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irmi.com/online/insurance-glossary/terms/d/decennial-liability.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  It is compulsory to insure in a few countries such as France,&lt;ref name="dr-hoek.de"&gt;http://www.dr-hoek.de/EN/beitrag.asp?t=Decennal-liability-under-FIDIC&lt;/ref&gt; and Egypt,.&lt;ref name="dr-hoek.de"/&gt;  In other countries like Qatar there is the form of [[strict liability]] arising from the French [[Civil code|Civil Code]] which does not require any proof of fault, but there is no compulsory requirement to insure&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beazley.com/idoc.ashx?docid=31c9cce1-3dcb-465d-9760-06b905d31ea4&amp;version=-1&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of the insurance can significantly increase construction costs and may be up to 1.5% of structural value (including the Technical Inspections that the insurers mandate).

Under French law (article L241-1 of the Insurance Code), every builder is required to purchase a ten-year insurance policy covering the mandatory decennial warranty on all construction projects. The decennial warranty is a legal liability assumed by builders for all defects that compromise the integrity of their structures or that cause them to become unsuited for their intended purposes. This responsibility is mandated by articles 1792 ''et seq.'' of the Civil Code. It is imposed on builders for ten years from the acceptance date of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://larevue.squirepattonboggs.com/French-construction-law-make-sure-you-are-insured_a1318.html|title=French construction law: make sure you are insured|last=Bar,|first=Nathalie ARDIS, Registered Lawyer at the Paris|website=La Revue {{!}} Squire Patton Boggs {{!}} Avocats|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Drake Edens, Jr.''', known as '''J. Drake Edens''' or '''Drake Edens''' (May 13, 1925 &amp;ndash; July 30, 1982), is recognized by many as the father of the modern [[South Carolina Republican Party]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Blythewood, South Carolina|Blythewood]], [[South Carolina]], Edens spent his entire life about the capital city of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. His mother was the former May Youmans (1898-1975), a native of [[Hampton County, South Carolina|Hampton County]], South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=43840014|title=May Youmans Edens|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Drake, Sr. (1899-1966), had developed the family farm into a [[supermarket]] chain, and Edens moved naturally into a management position within Edens Food Stores. When his career was interrupted by [[World War II]], Edens enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served from 1943 to 1946, seeing action in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]]. On his return to private life, Edens married Ferrell McCracken (1923-1982), a [[North Carolina]] native whom he had met while both were serving in the Marines. Edens enrolled at the [[University of South Carolina]] at Columbia and in 1949 graduated with a degree in [[Business Administration]]. In 1955, Edens Food Stores merged with [[Winn-Dixie]], and the following year Edens founded the Edens-Turbeville Agency, which he served as president from 1956 to 1964, when he sold his interest in the company to W. L. Turbeville.

Edens' political interest surfaced in 1960 when he organized a Republican club in his precinct during an exciting campaign year in which [[John F. Kennedy]], to the great surprise of some political observers, carried South Carolina over Vice-President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. Stimulated by his entry into the world of politics, Edens served as the campaign co-chair to elect [[Charles E. Boineau, Jr.]], to the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] in 1961. Boineau became the first Republican member of the legislature in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.sc.edu/file/220&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting in 1976 upon his entry into politics, Edens wrote [[Strom Thurmond]]: "The major concern that caused me to become active in the Republican Party years ago was the question of deficit spending by the federal government. I am still deeply concerned that deficit spending will be the cause of the eventual downfall of our country."

In 1962, Edens enlarged his political universe, working the entire state as chair of Republican [[W. D. Workman, Jr.]]'s Senate campaign against the Democratic incumbent [[Olin D. Johnston]]. By polling a surprising 43 percent of the vote, Workman proved the viability of the Republican Party in South Carolina. In February 1963, Edens was elected chairman of the Republican Party of South Carolina. In the [[1964 Republican National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]], Edens, as chair of South Carolina's sixteen-man delegation, cast South Carolina's votes for [[Barry Goldwater]], putting Goldwater over the top and ensuring that he would oppose [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the presidential campaign. Edens chaired the Goldwater effort in South Carolina, where Goldwater proved wildly popular and received 59 percent of the vote.

During an eventful 1965, Edens sold his interest in Edens-Turbeville to work for himself in a variety of enterprises involving real estate, farming, timber management, and investments. He also chaired [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert Watson]]'s campaign for Congress. Watson had been elected to the House in 1962 as a Democrat. A vigorous Goldwater supporter in 1964, he was stripped of his seniority by the House Democratic leadership. Watson resigned from his seat in Congress and from the party and ran as a Republican to succeed himself. Watson won the election with approximately 70 percent of the vote. In 1970, however, Watson was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee, having been defeated by Democrat [[John C. West]], Watson's former law professor. Edens resigned as state party chair and was elected Republican National Committeeman for South Carolina, gaining an important voice in Republican affairs at the national level.

In 1966, Edens played a role in Richard Nixon's planned second presidential campaign. He became the first member of the Republican National Committee to declare his support for Nixon's 1968 bid. Joining Edens in securing Nixon's first-ballot nomination at the convention in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], were former U.S. Representative [[Howard Callaway]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the Republican state chairmen [[Clarke Reed]] of [[Mississippi]] and [[Charlton Lyons]] of [[Louisiana]] During the fall campaign, Edens served on the national Nixon for President committee, the national Nixon Finance Committee, and chaired South Carolina's Nixon Finance Committee. The public first became aware of the health problems that plagued Edens throughout the remainder of his adult life in 1968, when Edens, who suffered from chronic [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], was forced to curtail his energetic and effective activities on behalf of the future president.

In 1972, Edens stepped down as vice-chair of the Republican National Committee, writing to his friend [[Leonard W. Hall]]: "This was a hard decision for me to make, but I simply felt that the time had come for me to slow up a bit and let somebody else step into this position for the period immediately ahead" (January 5, 1972). Future Governor [[Richard W. Riley]], in a widely popular move, appointed Edens to the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Commission. In 1979, Edens became chairman of the commission.

He drowned while [[Human swimming|swimming]] on July 30, 1982. Mrs. Edens, the former Ferrell McCracken (1923-1982) died thirty-three days after the passing of her husband. The Edens, including his parents, are interred at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=43840083|title=Ferrell McCracken Edens|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic Governor [[Robert Evander McNair|Robert McNair]] summed up Edens' role in the state's political affairs in a letter dated December 6, 1979, to Edens' daughter, Jenny Edens Padgett (born December 15, 1959) of [[Gaston, South Carolina|Gaston]] in [[Lexington County, South Carolina|Lexington County]], South Carolina:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mylife.com/jenny-padgett/e403099926768|title=Jenny Padgett|publisher=Mylife.com|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In my judgment, Drake Edens is responsible for the existence of the Republican Party as a strong and viable entity in South Carolina. Only because of his perseverance and credibility does the party exist."

The '''''Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act''''',&lt;ref&gt;originally {{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934 |abbr =S.C.|year =1934|chapter = 53|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1934v01cana#page/1316/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Loi sur les arrangements entre cultivateurs et créanciers}}) was an Act of the [[Parliament of Canada]] that attempted to remedy a wave of insolvencies that occurred among Canadian farmers during the [[Great Depression]]. Originally framed to deal with such problems nationwide, it was gradually reduced in scope, and was reenacted in 1943 to apply solely to farmers in the [[Prairie Provinces]].

==Background==
By 1934, the farm debt problem in Canada, which had been provoked by the Great Depression, reached a scale where provincial [[moratorium (law)|moratory legislation]]{{sfn|Easterbrook|1935|pp=391-392}}{{efn|as, in Ontario for example, {{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Mortgagors' and Purchasers' Relief Act, 1932|abbr =S.O.|year =1932|chapter = 49|link= https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1932onta#page/236/mode/2up}}, followed the following year by {{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Mortgagors' and Purchasers' Relief Act, 1933|abbr =S.O.|year =1933|chapter = 35|link= https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1933onta#page/78/mode/2up}}}} could not resolve it, as it could not remove the farmer from his position of [[default (finance)|default]].{{sfn|MacPherson|1934|p=70}} The last agricultural census reported that 244,201 farms (33.61% of all farms in Canada) reported having mortgages totalling $677,000,000 (16.75% of the value of all farms, or 49% of the value of owned farms).{{sfn|MacPherson|1934|p=71}} Cash flow problems also resulted in a significant increase in the amount of short-term obligations.{{sfn|MacPherson|1934|p=71}} It reached the point where [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.B. Bennett]] decided to introduce remedial legislation to address it at the federal level.{{sfn|Bryce|1986|p=160}} The initial draft submitted by the [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Department of Finance]] addressed only voluntary arrangements between farmers and their creditors, but Bennett sent it back to add provisions designed to adjust principal and interest obligations to the productive value of the farm.{{sfn|Bryce|1986|p=160}} As Bennett told the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], "The object, of course, is to keep the farmer on the farm; if possible to keep him cultivating the land on which he had lived."{{sfn|Bryce|1986|p=161}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Canada|title= Farm Indebtedness|url= http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC1705_04/189?r=0&amp;s=1|house= House of Commons|date= 4 June 1934|page= 3639|speaker= [[R.B. Bennett]]|position=Prime Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was introduced in June 1934,{{sfn|Bryce|1986|p=160}} together with relief legislation concerning farm loans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Canadian Farm Loan Act Amendment Act, 1934|abbr =S.C.|year =1934|chapter = 46|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1934v01cana#page/1012/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received [[Royal Assent]] a month later. [[M.A. MacPherson]], a former Attorney General and Provincial Treasurer of Saskatchewan,{{sfn|MacPherson|1934|p=67}} was appointed to oversee the Act's initial implementation,{{sfn|Bryce|1986|pp=160-161}} before permanent oversight was assigned to staff in the Department.

==Framework==
As originally passed, the Act provided for:

:* Official Receivers to be appointed in each county or district of a province where an assignment or a petition might be a filed with respect to a farmer&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:* such proposal to go ahead only with the concurrence of any [[secured creditor]] or person with a [[right of redemption]] over any applicable property (except in those cases where a proposal is formulated by a Board of Review)&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a stay of proceedings, not exceeding sixty days, where no creditor may exercise any remedy against property, or commence any proceedings relating to bankruptcy, [[debt recovery]] or realization of security&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the establishment of provincial Boards of Review, whose task would be to determine acceptable proposals (if, and only if, it can be done in fairness and justice to the debtor and creditors) where the creditors have declined to accept a farmer's proposal, and to submit their proposal (either with or without the creditors' consent) to the court for its approval, and such approved proposal would be binding&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
:* failure to comply with the terms of a approval would constitute an act of bankruptcy, except where the court considers that such an act was due to causes beyond the farmer's control&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 1(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the reduction of interest payable, where a mortgage's annual rate of interest exceeds 7%, so that the contracted rate can only be enforced on the amount of interest then due, plus three months' further interest in lieu of notice, after which the annual interest rate is commuted to 5%&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1934, c. 53, s. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent amendments===
In 1935, the Act was amended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935|abbr =S.C.|year =1935|chapter = 20|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1935v01cana#page/80/mode/2up}}, {{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act relating to the application of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934 in the Province of British Columbia|abbr =S.C.|year =1935|chapter = 61|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1935v01cana#page/370/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide for:

:* the stay of proceedings to be extended from sixty to ninety days&lt;ref&gt;SC 1935, c. 20, s.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a farmer resident in Quebec to be able to make an assignment in bankruptcy where the Board declines to make a proposal and declares that his affairs can best be dealt with under the ''Bankruptcy Act''&lt;ref&gt;SC 1935, c. 20, s.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Act was further amended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to amend The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934|abbr =S.C.|year =1938|chapter = 47|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1938v01cana#page/344/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide for:

:* an expansion of the definition of "creditor" to include persons holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege against the property of the debtor, notwithstanding any absence of [[privity of contract]], as well as the vendor of real property where the debtor holds it under an agreement of sale&lt;ref&gt;SC 1938, c. 47, s.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:* providing for the legal representative of a farmer dying on or after 3 July 1934 to be able to continue proceedings or make a proposal on behalf of the estate&lt;ref&gt;SC 1938, c. 47, s.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack on constitutional grounds==
Many Canadian legal commentators at the time expected that the ''FCAA'', together with 1933's ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933|abbr =S.C.|year =1932-33|chapter = 36|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl193233v01cana#page/186/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be declared unconstitutional as encroaching upon the provincial power over [[property and civil rights]] in relation to the rights of [[secured creditor]]s, and they were astonished when both were upheld.{{sfn|Torrie|2017|p=5}} The ''FCAA'' (and by extension the ''CCAA'') was held to be constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference Re Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act|link=Reference Re Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act|year=1936|court=scc|num=35|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1936] SCR 384|date=1936-06-17|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] subsequently agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Attorney General of British Columbia v Attorney General of Canada|link=|court=UKPC|year=1937|num=10|format=1|parallelcite=|date=28 January 1937|courtname=auto|juris=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lyman Duff|Duff CJ]] noted in his judgment:

{{cquote|
The statute is, by its express terms, incorporated into the general system of bankruptcy legislation in force in Canada and it is not open to dispute that legislation in respect of "compositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law".{{efn|''Reference re FCAA'',  pp. 393-394,quoting his judgment's introduction in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference Re Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act|link=Reference Re Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act|year=1934|court=scc|num=72|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 660|parallelcite=[1934] SCR 659|date=6 June 1934|courtname=auto|juris=}}}}
}}

==Replacement and repeal==
The Act was repealed and replaced in 1943, with its scope limited to the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1943 |abbr =S.C.|year =1943-44|chapter = 26|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl194344v01cana#page/138/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it would fall into disuse later in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www5.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/doc/prod/pdf/fdms-smmea_1_e.pdf|title= Report to Parliament on the ''Farm Debt Mediation Act'', Farm Debt Mediation Service and Farm Consultation Service|last= Mitchell|first= Andy|author-link= Andy Mitchell (politician)|date= May 2005|page= 2|publisher= [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would remain dormant until its repeal in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Act, 1987|abbr =S.C.|year =1988|chapter = 2|schedule=IV|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1988v01cana#page/130/mode/2up}}, Items 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the passage of the ''[[Farm Debt Review Act]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Farm Debt Review Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1986|chapter = 33|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1986v02cana#page/n15/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

The '''Government of the United Kingdom''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Llywodraeth y Deyrnas Unedig''), formally referred to as '''Her Majesty's Government''', is the central government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It is also commonly referred to as simply the '''UK Government''' or the '''British Government'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/ Her Majesty's Government] Retrieved 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="direct1"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073438 Overview of the UK system of government : Directgov – Government, citizens and rights]. Archived direct.gov.uk webpage. Retrieved on 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government is led by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], who selects all the remaining [[British Government frontbench|ministers]]. The prime minister and the other most senior ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].&lt;ref name="direct1"/&gt; The government ministers all sit in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and are [[Accountability#Political accountability|accountable]] to it. The government is [[Fusion of powers|dependent on Parliament]] to make [[primary legislation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/legislation/ |title=Legislation |year=2013 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-terms Parliaments Act 2011]], [[General elections in the uk|general elections]] are held every five years to elect a new [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], unless there is a successful [[vote of no confidence]] in the government or a [[Supermajority#United_Kingdom|two-thirds vote]] for a [[snap election]] (as was the case in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]]) in the House of Commons, in which case an election may be held sooner. After an election, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] (currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) selects as prime minister the leader of the party most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons, usually by possessing a majority of MPs.&lt;ref name="parliament1"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/396/396we02.htm House of Commons – Justice Committee – Written Evidence]. Publications.parliament.uk. Retrieved on 19 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]], [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] lies with the monarch, although this authority is exercised only by, or on the advice of, the prime minister and the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073442 The monarchy : Directgov – Government, citizens and rights]. Archived direct.gov.uk webpage. Retrieved on 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet members advise the monarch as members of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In most cases they also exercise power directly as leaders of the [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|Government Departments]], though some Cabinet positions are sinecures to a greater or lesser degree (for instance [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] or [[Lord Privy Seal]]).

The current prime minister is [[Theresa May]], who took office on 13 July 2016. She is the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won a majority of seats in the House of Commons in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|general election]] on 7 May 2015, when [[David Cameron]] was the party leader; although at the last general election she failed to secure a majority government. Prior to this, Cameron and the Conservatives led a coalition from 2010 to 2015 with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], in which Cameron was prime minister.

The Government is occasionally referred to with the [[metonym]] Westminster, due to that being where many of the offices of the government are situated, especially by members in the [[Government of Scotland]], the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in order to differentiate it from their own.

==Government in Parliament==
A key principle of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] is that the government is responsible to Parliament. This is called [[responsible government]].

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the reigning monarch (that is, the King or Queen who is the Head of State at any given time) does not make any open political decisions. All political decisions are taken by the government and Parliament. This constitutional state of affairs is the result of a long history of constraining and reducing the political power of the monarch, beginning with the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.

Parliament is split into two houses: the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The House of Commons is the lower house and is the more powerful. The House of Lords is the upper house and although it can vote to amend proposed laws, the House of Commons can usually vote to overrule its amendments. Although the House of Lords can introduce bills, most important laws are introduced in the House of Commons – and most of those are introduced by the government, which schedules the vast majority of parliamentary time in the Commons. Parliamentary time is essential for bills to be passed into law, because they must pass through a number of readings before becoming law. Prior to introducing a bill, the government may run a public consultation to solicit feedback from the public and businesses, and often may have already introduced and discussed the policy in the [[Queen's Speech]], or in an [[election manifesto]] or [[party platform]].

[[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] are responsible to the House in which they sit; they make statements in that House and take questions from members of that House. For most senior ministers this is usually the elected House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. There have been some recent exceptions to this: for example, cabinet ministers [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]] (First Secretary of State) and [[Lord Adonis]] (Secretary of State for Transport) sat in the Lords and were responsible to that House during the government of [[Gordon Brown]].
[[File:Crowned Portcullis.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]]]

Since the start of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s reign in 1901, the prime minister has always been an elected member of Parliament (MP) and therefore directly accountable to the House of Commons. A similar convention applies to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. It would likely be politically unacceptable for the budget speech to be given in the Lords, with MPs unable to directly question the Chancellor, especially now that the Lords have very limited powers in relation to money bills. The last Chancellor of the Exchequer to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]], who served as interim Chancellor of the Exchequer for one month in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ The Parliament Acts – UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the British system, the government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. It requires the support of the House of Commons for the maintenance of [[Loss of supply|supply]] (by voting through the government's budgets) and to pass [[primary legislation]]. By convention, if a government [[Motion of no confidence|loses the confidence]] of the House of Commons it must either resign or a General Election is held. The support of the Lords, while useful to the government in getting its legislation passed without delay, is not vital. A government is not required to resign even if it loses the confidence of the Lords and is defeated in key votes in that House. The House of Commons is thus the [[Responsible house]].

The prime minister is held to account during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQs) which provides an opportunity for MPs from all parties to question the PM on any subject. There are also departmental questions when ministers answer questions relating to their specific departmental brief. Unlike PMQs both the cabinet ministers for the department and junior ministers within the department may answer on behalf of the government, depending on the topic of the question.

During debates on legislation proposed by the government, ministers—usually with departmental responsibility for the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]—will lead the debate for the government and respond to points made by MPs or Lords.

Committees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/ Committees – UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; of both the House of Commons and House of Lords hold the government to account, scrutinise its work and examine in detail proposals for legislation. Ministers appear before committees to give evidence and answer questions.

Government ministers are also required by convention and the [[Ministerial Code (United Kingdom)|Ministerial Code]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125173150/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409215/ministerialcodemay2010.pdf Ministerial Code]. Cabinet Office 2010&lt;/ref&gt; when Parliament is sitting, to make major statements regarding government policy or issues of national importance to Parliament. This allows MPs or Lords to question the government on the statement. When the government instead chooses to make announcements first outside Parliament, it is often the subject of significant criticism from MPs and the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05647.pdf |title=Speakers' statements on ministerial policy announcements made outside the House |accessdate=2010-11-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716034414/http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05647.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

==Her Majesty's Government and the Crown==
{{Main article|Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]]]]
The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is the head of state and the sovereign, but not the head of government.

The monarch takes little direct part in governing the country, and remains neutral in political affairs. However, the legal authority of the state that is vested in the sovereign, known as [[The Crown]], remains the source of the executive power exercised by the government.

In addition to [[Act of Parliament|explicit statutory authority]], in many areas the Crown also possesses a body of powers known as the [[Royal Prerogative]], which can be used for many purposes, from the issue or withdrawal of passports to declaration of war. By long-standing custom, most of these powers are delegated from the sovereign to various ministers or other officers of the Crown, who may use them without having to obtain the consent of Parliament.

The head of the government, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], also has weekly meetings with the monarch, when she "has a right and a duty to express her views on Government matters...These meetings, as with all communications between The Queen and her Government, remain strictly confidential. Having expressed her views, The Queen abides by the advice of her ministers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |title=Queen and Prime Minister |year=2013 |publisher=The British Monarchy |accessdate=27 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |archivedate=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal Prerogative powers include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Domestic powers===
* The power to appoint (and also, in theory, dismiss) a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. This power is exercised by the monarch herself. By convention she appoints (and is expected to appoint) the individual most likely to be capable of commanding the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons.
* The power to dismiss and appoint other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]]. This power is exercised by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.
* The power to assent to and enact laws by giving [[Royal Assent|[Royal] Assent]] to [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] passed by both Houses of Parliament, which is required in order for a law to (from a passed Bill) &lt;i&gt;make it into the Statute Books&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., to become a valid law) as an &lt;i&gt;Act&lt;/i&gt; [of Parliament]. This is exercised by the monarch, who also theoretically has the power to refuse assent, although no monarch has refused assent to a bill passed by Parliament since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708.
* The power to give and to issue commissions to [[commissioned officer]]s in the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].
* The power to command the [[Armed Forces of the United Kingdom]]. This power is exercised by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]] in the Queen's name.
* The power to appoint members to [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]]. 
* The power to issue (and also to suspend, cancel, recall, impound, withdraw or revoke) British passports and the general power to provide (or deny) British passport facilities to British citizens and British nationals. This is exercised (in the United Kingdom, but not necessarily in the case of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] or the [[British Overseas Territories]]) by the [[Home Secretary]].
* The Royal [[Prerogative of mercy]] although capital punishment has been abolished (thereby removing the need to use this power to issue pardons to commute a death penalty imposed, usually substituted into life imprisonment in lieu), this power is still used under rare circumstances (e.g. to remedy errors in sentencing calculation).
* The power to grant (and also to cancel and annul) [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]]. 
* The power to create corporations (including the status of being a city, with its own corporation) by [[Royal Charter]], and also to amend, replace and revoke existing charters.

===Foreign powers===
* The power to ratify and make [[Treaty|treaties]].
* The power to [[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|declare war]] and [[Peace treaty|conclude peace]] with other nations.
* The power to deploy the Armed Forces overseas.
* The power to [[Diplomatic recognition|recognise states]].
* The power to credit and receive diplomats.

Even though the United Kingdom has no single constitutional document, the government published the above list in October 2003 to increase transparency, as some of the powers exercised in the name of the monarch are part of the [[Royal Prerogative]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation Mystery lifted on Queen's powers | Politics]. The Guardian. Retrieved on 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the complete extent of the Royal Prerogative powers has never been fully set out, as many of them originated in ancient custom and the period of [[absolute monarchy]], or were modified by later constitutional practice, 

==Ministers and departments==

The prime minister is based at [[10 Downing Street]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], London. Cabinet meetings also take place here. Most [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]] have their headquarters nearby in [[Whitehall]].

==Devolved governments==
{{Main article|Devolution in the United Kingdom}}
Since 1999, certain areas of central government have been devolved to accountable governments in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. These are not part of Her Majesty's Government, and are accountable to their own institutions, with their own authority under the Crown; in contrast, there is no devolved government in England.

==Local government==
[[File:Old Fire Station Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|right|Refurbishment notice at Old Fire Station, [[Oxford]], showing HM Government support.]]
{{Main article|Local government in England|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales|Local government in Northern Ireland}}

Up to three layers of elected local authorities (such as County, District and [[Parish councils in England|Parish Councils]]) exist throughout all parts of the United Kingdom, in some places merged into [[Unitary authority|Unitary Authorities]]. They have limited local tax-raising powers. Many other authorities and agencies also have statutory powers, generally subject to some central government supervision.

== Limits of government power ==
{{seealso|Act of Parliament (UK)}}
The government's powers include general executive and statutory powers, [[delegated legislation]], and numerous powers of appointment and patronage. However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, [[local authorities]], and the Charity Commissions) are legally more or less independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under [[Common Law]] or granted and limited by Act of Parliament, and are subject to [[European Union law]] and the [[Politics of the European Union#Competencies|competencies]] that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the Courts by [[judicial review]].

Nevertheless, magistrates and mayors can still be arrested for and put on trial for corruption, and the government has powers to insert commissioners into a local authority to oversee its work, and to issue directives that must be obeyed by the local authority, if the local authority is not abiding by its statutory obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-sends-in-commissioners-to-tower-hamlets|title = Secretary of State sends in commissioners to Tower Hamlets|date = 17 December 2014|accessdate = 10 April 2015|website = [[Gov.uk]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, as in every other [[European Union]] (EU) member state, EU officials cannot be prosecuted for any actions carried out in pursuit of their official duties, and foreign country diplomats (though not their employees) and foreign [[Members of the European Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2014/509981/IPOL_IDA%282014%29509981_EN.pdf|title=The Immunity of Members of the European Parliament|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=October 2014|publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; are immune from prosecution in the UK under any circumstance. As a consequence, neither EU bodies nor diplomats have to pay taxes, since it would not be possible to prosecute them for tax evasion. This caused a dispute in recent years when the US Ambassador to the UK claimed that London's [[congestion charge]] was a tax, and not a charge (despite the name), and therefore he did not have to pay it – a claim the [[Greater London Authority]] disputed.

Similarly, the monarch is totally immune from criminal prosecution and may only be sued with her permission (this is known as [[sovereign immunity]]). The monarch, by law, is not required to pay income tax, but [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has voluntarily paid it since 1993, and also pays local rates voluntarily. However, the monarchy also receives a substantial grant from the government, the [[Sovereign Support Grant]], and Queen Elizabeth II's inheritance from her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], was exempt from [[inheritance tax]].

In addition to legislative powers, HM Government has substantial influence over local authorities and other bodies set up by it, by financial powers and grants. Many functions carried out by local authorities, such as paying out housing benefit and council tax benefit, are funded or substantially part-funded by central government.

Even though the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) is supposed to be independent of the government on a day-to-day level and is supposed to be politically unbiased, some commentators {{By whom|date=July 2018}} have argued that the prospects of the BBC having its funding cut or its charter changed in future charter renewals in practice cause the BBC to be subtly biased towards the government of the day (or the likely future government as an election approaches) at times.

Neither the central government nor local authorities are permitted to sue anyone for [[defamation]]. Individual politicians are allowed to sue people for defamation in a personal capacity and without using government funds, but this is relatively rare (although [[George Galloway]], who was a backbench MP for a quarter of a century, has sued or threatened to sue for defamation a number of times). However, it is a criminal offence to make a false statement about any election candidate during an election, with the purpose of reducing the number of votes they receive (as with libel, opinions do not count).

'''International Network of Crackers''' ('''INC''') was one of the premier [[software cracking|cracking]]/releasing [[warez]] groups for the IBM PC during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The formation of INC was the result of the merger of several cracking groups, including ''Union'', based out of [[Texas]], and the ''Miami Cracking Machine'' (''MCM''), based out of [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/international-network-of-crackers |title=International Network Of Crackers |publisher=Defacto2 |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of MCM, who went under the [[pseudonym]] Line Noise, continued to manage INC until 1992. Following his departure from the group, Cool Hand and The Cracksmith took over.&lt;ref name="Cool Hand interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defacto2.net/wayback/scenelink-from-1998-june-25/features/issue/5/ch.html |title=cool hand interview |publisher=Defacto2.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a few years in which the group seemed dominant over the "warez" scene. It was not until internal conflicts and lack of interest by upper management entered the picture that things began to decline. When Cool Hand and The Cracksmith disappeared, the remaining members were unable to hold things together.&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page" /&gt;

The real identities of the key members have never been fully uncovered, but it has been reported that the founding members, Line Noise (Neil), The Cracksmith (Drew), and Cool Hand (Joe) have left the scene.&lt;ref name="Cool Hand interview" /&gt; Releases from INC aggressively declined and people within the scene generally had felt that INC lost its edge.&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page" /&gt; During a one-year period, they went from being the top gaming software release group to barely memorable. Some of the best games of the 80s and 90s were released by INC during a period of stiff competition with groups like [[Fairlight (group)|FLT]], [[The Humble Guys|THG]], and [[Razor 1911]]. By early 1994, INC had completely disappeared from the warez scene.&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page" /&gt;

Among their biggest rivals and competitors during the group's existence were [[The Humble Guys]].&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page" /&gt; During a period in which most groups were using any and all means possible (including [[credit card fraud]], lies, and anything else) to beat them, INC always maintained its moral high ground. The worst INC ever did was to "leak" a new game to The Humble Guys so they could steal the credit. While unknown to THG - the game was infected with a trojan that searched for a modem then dialed 9-1-1. Several of The Humble Guys members were visited by the police before they discovered they had been fooled.&lt;ref name="Defacto2 - International Network of Crackers Group Page" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cool Hand interview" /&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

A motion for '''judgment as a matter of law''' ('''JMOL''') is a motion made by a party, during trial, claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case.  JMOL is also known as a [[directed verdict]], which it has replaced in American federal courts. 

JMOL is similar to [[judgment on the pleadings]] and [[summary judgment]], all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim.  Judgment on the pleadings is a [[motion (legal)|motion]] made after pleading and before [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial; JMOL occurs during trial.

In [[United States federal courts]], JMOL is a creation of [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] Rule 50.  JMOL is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the JMOL motion.  If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party, judgment is entered by the court and the case is over.  If there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party, but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion, the party with the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of persuasion]] fails. 

Timing is very important in making a motion for JMOL; the motion can be made only after the opposing party has presented its case.  In civil cases, the [[plaintiff]] presents its case, then the [[defendant]] presents its case, and then the plaintiff may present a [[rebuttal]]. So once the plaintiff has presented its case, the defendant can move for JMOL, but the plaintiff cannot. But once the defendant has finished presenting its case, the plaintiff can then move for JMOL, and so can the defendant. 

JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned, where they are called "renewed" motions for judgment as a matter of law (RJMOL), but the motion is still commonly known by its former name, [[judgment notwithstanding the verdict]], or JNOV (from the [[English language|English]] [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] and the [[Latin]] ''non obstante veredicto''). However, in order to move for JNOV, the movant must have moved for a JMOL ''before'' the verdict as well.  This procedural quirk is necessary because it is considered a violation of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|7th Amendment]] for a judge to overturn a jury verdict.  Instead, the judge is said in a JNOV to be reexamining not the verdict, but his previous rejection of JMOL.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29295">'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].

Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.

In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.

==Theory of judicial independence==
[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865. In ''[[Federalist No. 78|The Federalist No. 78]]'', published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: "The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution."]]

===Importance===
Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] encroachment upon those rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexander Hamilton|authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|contribution=The Federalist No. 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-7DDxR-3KQC&amp;pg=PA524|editor=Jacob E. Cooke, ed.|title=The Federalist|location=Middletown, Conn.|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|year=1982|origyear=1961|pages=521–530 at 524|isbn=978-0-819-53016-5|quote=The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ... Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a foundation for the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]]. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom, ed.|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183–224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roger K. Warren|title=The Importance of Judicial Independence and Accountability|url=https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Center for State Courts]]|date=January 2003 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111072722/https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |archive-date=11 November 2018 |ref=CITEREFWarren (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 93A, and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=204A|ed=2007}}, ss. 71–80; and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2007}}, ss. 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2–3}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3–5}}

Also, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}

==Economic basis==
[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.

==Development of the concept==

===National and international developments===

The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009&gt;S Shetreet, ‘The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges’ (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009/&gt;

A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was evident when England’s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu’s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;See Baron de Montesquieu, The Sfdfsdfpirit of the Laws (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution’s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Article III of the US Constitution provides that “the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.”&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;UK Human Rights Act - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&gt; (visited Mar 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161–74 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55–68 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him&lt;/ref&gt; marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country’s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, “The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.”&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International standards===
The [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Scopus Approved Revised International Standards of Judicial Independence Approved March 19, 2008|url=http://www.jiwp.org/#!mt-scopus-standards/c14de|publisher=International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace - International Project of judicial independence|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The justice system===

In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Shetreet, Fundamental Values of the Justice System, 23 THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW 61-76, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Canada]] has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.

The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.
There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.

== Hong Kong ==
In [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_4 "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 4, Section 4], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
{{main|Judicial independence in Singapore}}
Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the [[Constitution of Singapore]], statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the [[common law]]. To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.

The [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}
====History====
During the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary usage====
Under the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in "good order," they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="legal_serves_act_2007"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

===Federal courts===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

The Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] "by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]." Once appointed, federal judges:

{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}

Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase "during good behavior" predates the Declaration of Independence. [[John Adams]] equated it with ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' in a letter to the [[Boston Gazette]] published on 11 January 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, Vol 3|last=Adams|first=John|year=1851|publisher=Little and Brown|place=Boston|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] in England.

The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the [[American Bar Association]], whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee "Well Qualified," "Qualified" or "Not Qualified."

===State courts===
[[State court (United States)|State courts]] deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both [[trial court]]s and [[appellate court]]s (including [[state supreme court]]s), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

'''''Kerans v. Porter Paint Co.'''''&lt;ref&gt;61 Ohio St.3d 486, 575 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 428 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[leading case]] in [[Ohio]] on employer liability for workplace sexual harassment. In an opinion by [[Alice Robie Resnick]], the court held that victims of harassment could bring [[tort]] claims against their employers. Resnick held that the psychological and emotional damages suffered by victims of harassment were not injuries under Ohio's [[workers' compensation]] statute, and employers were [[vicarious liability|vicariously liable]] for the sexual harassment of their employees when they knew or should have known about the harassment.

A '''law society''' is an association of [[Lawyer|lawyers]] with a regulatory role that included the right to supervise the training, qualifications and conduct of lawyers. Where there is a distinction between [[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s, solicitors were regulated by the law societies and barristers by a separate [[Bar Council]].

== History ==
Much has changed for law societies in recent years, with governments in Australia, New Zealand, England and Wales, and now Scotland (2010) creating government sponsored regulators for lawyers (both barristers and solicitors), leaving to law societies the role of advocacy on behalf of their members.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, each province and territory has a law society ({{lang-fr|barreau}}) with statutory responsibility for regulation of the legal profession in the public interest. These law societies are members of the [[Federation of Law Societies of Canada]].

=== United States ===
In the United States, unified [[bar association]]s are somewhat similar to Law Societies; however, there are differences between law societies and the general American phenomenon of bar associations.  Usually a bar association is an association of lawyers; lawyers may or may not join as they wish. Regulation of American lawyers usually takes places through the courts, which decide who gets admitted as a lawyer, and also decide discipline cases.  Law societies are often created by legislation and play (or played) significant direct roles in the training, licensing and disciplining of lawyers.  The conflict or roles between being a regulator and a trade association is seen by many as giving rise to the recent move to government sponsored regulators.

Law Societies also play a role as part of the justice system, and concern themselves with access to justice.  As a result, they may offer paid and unpaid legal assistance to the public or specific target audiences, and have historically been involved in the development of [[legal aid]] plans.

== List of law societies ==

'''Lemon laws''' are [[United States|American]] [[State law (United States)|state laws]] that provide a [[Remedy (law)|remedy]] for purchasers of cars and other consumer goods in order to compensate for products that repeatedly fail to meet standards of quality and performance. Although there may be defective products of all sorts ranging from small [[electrical appliance]]s to huge pieces of machinery, the term "[[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]]" is most often used to describe defective motor vehicles such as [[automobiles]], [[truck]]s, [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]], and [[motorcycles]].

==United States==

Lemon law protection arises under state law, with every U.S. state plus [[District of Columbia|D.C.]] having its own lemon law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBB Auto Line: State Lemon Laws|url=https://www.bbb.org/autoline/bbb-auto-line-state-laws|website=BBB|publisher=Better Business Bureau|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact criteria vary by state, new vehicle lemon laws require that an auto manufacturer repurchase a vehicle that has a significant defect that the manufacturer is unable to repair within a reasonable amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Lemon Law Criteria|url=http://www.autosafety.org/state-lemon-law-criteria/|website=The Center for Auto Safety|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon laws consider the nature of the problem with the vehicle, the number of days that the vehicle is unavailable to the consumer for service of the same mechanical issue, and the number of repair attempts made. If repairs cannot be completed within the total number of days described in the state statute, the manufacturer becomes obligated to buy back the defective vehicle.&lt;ref name="lemclaim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Make a Lemon Law Claim|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer/lemon_law_rights.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=26 Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the dealership has no obligation to buy back the vehicle, because the dealership does not warrant the vehicle, the manufacturer does.

Lemon laws offer remedies that exceed the scope of a vehicle manufacturer's warranty. While a manufacturer's warranty might obligate a vehicle manufacturer to make a repair at no cost to the consumer, warranties do not include maximum time periods for the completion of repair, nor do they trigger buy-back provisions if the repair cannot be completed within such a time period.

Some state lemon laws cover only certain classes of vehicles, such as vehicles purchased for individual use but not for business use, or vehicles under a certain gross weight. A small number of states additionally have more limited lemon laws that cover used vehicles.&lt;ref name="lemclaim"/&gt; Some states have lemon laws that apply to pet purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What you need to know about warranty laws|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/05/the-word-on-warranty-protection/index.htm|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===

There are two types of warranties for product purchases, [[Express warranty|express warranties]] and [[Implied warranty|implied warranties]]. Express warranties make specific promises about product repair, and are usually made in writing. An express warranty may be provided by the manufacturers in [[owner's manual]]s and other written sales or marketing materials. Implied warranties arise from a manufacturer's duty to meet certain minimum standards of quality whereby the product is fit for use for the purpose intended. An implied warranty arises from the sale itself, and need not be in writing. In each type the manufacturer assumes the liability and responsibility to correct the defect and, in the event that they cannot meet that duty, may be required to repurchase or replace the product.

The [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act|Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]] was enacted as a federal law in 1975, and protects citizens of all states, to ensure that manufacturers honor their warranties and to reduce the chance that a consumer will be misled about the nature and scope of a warranty when making a purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John J. Woodcock III Lemon Law Records.|url=http://www.library.ccsu.edu/help/spcoll/lemonlaw/index.html|website=Center for Public Policy &amp; Social Research|publisher=Central Connecticut State University|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act extends to the purchase of consumer products, including motor vehicles and appliances. The Act also provides that the warranter may be obligated to pay the prevailing party's [[Lawyer|attorney]] in a successful lawsuit, as do most state lemon laws. A consumer may pursue relief under both a state lemon law and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.&lt;ref name="FTCMM"/&gt;

The existence, scope and consequence of express and implied warranties can vary under state law, and warranties for the sale of goods will often be addressed by Article II of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act will not protect the buyer of a product purchased without a warranty, such as a product purchased "as is" or "with all faults", but may protect a consumer who was misled into waiving the protection of a warranty.&lt;ref name="FTCMM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Businessperson's Guide to Federal Warranty Law|url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Australia does not have a law similar to a lemon law, so consumers do not have legal protection beyond the vehicle warranty. Consumers have been known to take creative measures to try to convince vehicle manufacturers to buy back defective vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Jeep Owner Creates Hilarious Video Rant About His Lemon|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/s/angry-jeep-owner-creates-hilarious-video-rant-lemon-200051523.html|website=Yahoo! Ness|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=16 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland Parliament recently conducted an inquiry on the need for a consumer lemon law for new motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Lemon' Laws - An inquiry into consumer protections and remedies for buyers of new motor vehicles|url=https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/work-of-committees/committees/LACSC/inquiries/past-inquiries/04-Lemons|website=Queensland Parliament|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Hearing - "Lemon Laws Inquiry" Legal Affairs and Community Safety Committee|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1EsSOVFJtc|website=YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report of the findings of the inquiry was published in November, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report No. 17, 55th Parliament Legal Affairs and Community Safety Committee|url=https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/committees/LACSC/2015/04-Lemons/04-rpt-017-30Nov2015.pdf|website=Queensland Parliament|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The [[Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan]] (CAMVAP) is the [[dispute resolution]] program for Canadians who have problems with the assembly of their vehicle or with how the manufacturer implements its new vehicle warranty. CAMVAP covers new and used, owned and leased vehicles that are from the current model year and up to an additional four model years.

CAMVAP is free for consumers, and hearings are held in the consumer's home community. The process normally takes less than 70 days from start to finish. Most consumers are able to handle their own case without the assistance of lawyers. The manufacturers do not use lawyers. Their representatives usually are serving or retired district parts and services representatives. An inspection of the vehicle normally is part of an arbitration hearing and the arbitrator can order a technical inspection of the vehicle at the program's expense if doing so is required.

CAMVAP arbitrators can order the manufacturer to buy back the vehicle; repair it at the manufacturer's expense; pay for repairs already completed; or pay out of pocket expenses for items such as [[towing]], diagnostic testing, [[rental car]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and accommodation related to the problem with the vehicle. The arbitrator can also determine that the manufacturer has no liability.

CAMVAP is available in all Canadian [[Canadian province|provinces]] and [[Territory (Canada)|territories]].

==Singapore==
A similar "Lemon Law" was passed in [[Singapore]]'s [[Singapore Parliament|parliament]] on September 1, 2012, to strengthen consumer protection laws. Singapore's Lemon Law applies to all goods (including consumables and perishables) but it does not apply to services.

Under the law, consumers can report a defective item within six months of delivery and it is the responsibility of the retailer to prove that the defect did not exist at the time of delivery. The consumer may have the option to request for repair or a replacement, and if that is not possible, ask for a reduction in price, or even a refund.

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] relating to priorities of intervention where need or risk might be evident.  As the [[principle]] of [[distributive justice]] advanced by [[Ingrid Robeyns]], limitarianism states that it is morally impermissible to be (excessively) [[Wealth|rich]] (i.e. have more economic resources than a certain level).

==Types of ethical limitarianism==

'''Ethical limitarianism'''

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] which (1) tries to be a partial [[Explanation|account]] of [[distributive justice]], (2) which belongs within the realms of politics rather than morality, (3) which is conceived and developed at the level of non-ideal theory, (4) which relies on an instrumental justification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/36357522/Assessing_Non-intrinsic_Limitarianism Volacu, A., Dumitru, A., Assessing Non-intrinsic Limitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is related to [[effective altruism]].

'''Democratic Limitarianism'''

Democratic Limitarianism is a [[political theory]] that [[governments]] have priority duties to 
their citizenry to protect from risk and to ensure independence from fear, and thereby it urges that government prioritize protecting its citizens against fear of death or injury from: 
* Domestic threats
* Foreign threats
* Social insecurity
* Environmental hazard
A political movement advocates this [[prioritarianism|prioritization]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelimitarian.wordpress.com/democratic-limitarianism-what-and-why/ Democratic Limitarianism: What and Why.  The Limitarian, Citizen 2.0 website, accessed 1/2/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical limitarianism of [[Ingrid Robeyns]] would contrast with this view of democratic limitarianism.

==Earlier uses of term limitarianism==
Ethical limitarianism is not to be confused with [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] limitarianism, which teaches that [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|Christ's atonement]] applies only to [[the elect]] (as [[Calvinism]]), and not to all humanity (as [[Christian universalism]] taught), or of [[limited atonement]] and [[irresistible grace]] as [[St. Augustine]] had taught.

{{Barack Obama sidebar}}
By the end of his [[Presidency of Barack Obama|second and final term]] on January 20, 2017, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] had exercised his [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] power to grant executive clemency—that is, "[[pardon]], [[Commutation (law)|commutation of sentence]], remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/pardon/index.html|title=Office of the Pardon Attorney|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to 1,927 individuals convicted of [[Federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]]. Of the acts of clemency, 1,715 were commutations (including 504 [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]]) and 212 were pardons.&lt;ref name="Eggelston"&gt;Neil Eggelston, [https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/01/17/president-obama-has-now-granted-more-commutations-any-president-nations-history], White House (January 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals granted executive clemency by Obama had been convicted on drug charges,&lt;ref name="Malloy"&gt;Allie Malloy, [http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/19/politics/obama-clemency], CNN (December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and had received lengthy and sometimes [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory]] sentences at the height of the [[war on drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt Apuzzo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/obama-commutations-criminal-justice-trump.html After Obama Push for Clemency, Hints of Reversal Likely to Come], ''New York Times'' (November 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama holds the record for the largest single-day use of the clemency power, granting 330 commutations on January 19, 2017, his last full day in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/19/obama-grants-330-more-commutations-bringing-total-record-1715/96791186/|title=Obama grants 330 more commutations, bringing total to a record 1,715|newspaper=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-grants-final-330-commutations-to-nonviolent-drug-offenders/2017/01/19/41506468-de5d-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html|title=Obama grants final 330 commutations to nonviolent drug offenders|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has issued more commutations than the past thirteen presidents combined.&lt;ref name="Eggelston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/01/19/update-1-obama-commutes-prison-sentences-for-330-before-leaving/21658796/|title=President Obama commutes prison sentences for 330 before leaving office|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional provision ==

The pardon powers of the President are outlined in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] (Section 2, Clause 1), which provides:

{{quote|The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.}}

== Definitions ==

* A ''pardon'' is an executive order granting clemency for a conviction, it may be granted "at any point after the ... commission" of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/71/333#writing-USSC_CR_0071_0333_ZO|title=Ex Parte Garland|last=|first=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06|quote="The power thus conferred is unlimited, with the exception stated. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency or after conviction and judgment."}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Justice Department regulations, convicted persons may only apply five or more years after their sentence has been completed.&lt;ref name="justice.gov" /&gt; However, the President's power to pardon is not restricted by any temporal constraints except that the crime must have been committed. Its practical effect is the restoration of civil rights and statutory disabilities (i.e., firearm rights, occupational licensing) associated with a past criminal conviction.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/pardon/faq.htm#1|title=USDOJ: Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Executive Clemency|publisher=USDOJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rarer cases, such as the [[pardon of Richard Nixon]], a pardon can also halt criminal proceedings and prevent an indictment.

* A ''commutation'' is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

'''''Lynch v. Donnelly''''', 465 U.S. 668 (1984), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case challenging the legality of Christmas decorations on town property.

==Background==
[[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]'s annual [[Christmas]] display in the city's shopping district, consisting of a [[Santa Claus]] house, a [[Christmas tree]], a banner reading "[[Season's Greetings]]," and a [[Nativity scene|crèche]], was challenged in court. The crèche had been a part of the display since at least 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=465&amp;page=668 |title=Lynch v. Donnelly opinion |accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs brought the suit to the [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island|District Court of Rhode Island]], which permanently enjoined the city from displaying the Nativity scene as a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] affirmed the district court's ruling. The city then petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted [[certiorari]].

==Ruling==
The Supreme Court reversed previous rulings in a vote of 5–4, ruling that the display was not an effort to advocate a particular religious message and had "legitimate secular purposes."

[[Chief Justice Burger]] delivered the opinion of the Court, in which [[Byron Raymond White|Justices White]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]], [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], and [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] joined.&lt;ref name="Burger"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0465_0668_ZO.html |title=Burger opinion |accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court held that the crèche did not violate the Establishment Clause based on the test created in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971). They ruled that the crèche is a passive representation of religion and that there was "insufficient evidence to establish that the inclusion of the crèche is a purposeful or surreptitious effort to express some kind of subtle governmental advocacy of a particular religious" view. They also stated that the Constitution "affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any."

The Court ruled that the crèche has a legitimate secular purpose within a larger holiday display to celebrate the season and the origins of Christmas which has long been a part of Western culture. The Federal "Government has long recognized—indeed it has subsidized—holidays with religious significance." For example, the first [[United States Congress|Congress]] that passed the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] enacted legislation providing for paid [[Chaplains]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], and "It has long been the practice that federal employees are released from duties on [[Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] while being paid." The court compared the crèche to the display of religious paintings in government funded museums. In addition, the crèche requires only minimal expenses for assembly and dismantling. The Court also stated, "no inquiry into potential political divisiveness is even called for" because the situation does not involve direct aid to church-sponsored organizations and because the crèche been displayed for 40 years with no problems.

==Concurrence==
[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O’Connor]], in her concurring opinion, offered a "clarification" of how the Establishment Clause should be read:

The Establishment Clause prohibits government from making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community. Government can run afoul of that prohibition in two principal ways. One is excessive entanglement with religious institutions ...The second and more direct infringement is government endorsement or disapproval of religion. Endorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.

This is sometimes referred to as the "Endorsement Test." A law which fails this test is found to be unconstitutional because it "endorses" religion or religious beliefs in such a way that it tells those who agree that they are favored insiders and those who disagree that they are disfavored outsiders. The other side of the coin would be the "disapproval" of religion or religious beliefs in such a way that those who agree with the beliefs are told that they are disfavored outsiders while those who disagree with the beliefs are told that they are favored insiders.

==Dissent==
[[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justices Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]], and [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the case did not pass the ''Lemon'' test.&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0465_0668_ZD.html |title=Brennan opinion| accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackmun"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0465_0668_ZD1.html |title=Blackmun opinion| accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secular display surrounding their secular purpose of celebrating of a national holiday could have been done without a clearly religious symbol that supports only one religion to the exclusion of others giving one group public approval of their views. Even if other religious groups are allowed to include "'competing efforts [by religious groups] to gain or maintain the support of government' may 'occasio[n] considerable civil strife.'" The religious crèche is also placed in a central location within the display, which makes even less of the Court's idea that Pawtucket was just including all of the traditional images. The dissenting opinion also mentions that it cannot be compared to a religious display in a museum because it is not solely being considered as a piece of art but as a religious symbol as well. The government recognition of Christmas previously has only been to recognize the secular parts of Christmas, such as spending time with family. The minority also dissented, noting that "Those who believe in the message of the nativity receive the unique and exclusive benefit of public recognition and approval of their views" and that the creche provides "a significant symbolic benefit to religion..."&lt;ref name=Brennan /&gt; The dissent argued "The effect on minority religious groups, as well as on those who may reject religion, is to convey the message that their views are not similarly worthy of public recognition nor entitled to public support.  It was precisely this sort of chauvinism that the Establishment Clause was intended forever to prohibit."&lt;ref name=Brennan /&gt;

The '''Maori Language Act 1987''' was a piece of [[legislation]] passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maori Language Act 1987 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1987/0176/latest/DLM124116.html |accessdate=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that gave [[official language]] status to the [[Māori language]] ({{lang|mi|te reo Māori}}), and gave speakers a right to use it in legal settings such as in court. It also established the [[Māori Language Commission]], initially called {{lang|mi|Te Komihana Mo Te Reo Maori|italic=no}}, to promote the language and provide advice on it. The bill received a major update in 2016.

==1991 amendment==
The act was amended in 1991 and legislated the Māori Language Commission's name change to {{lang|mi|Te Taura Whiri I Te Reo Māori|italic=no}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maori Language Amendment Act 1991 |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/mlaa19911991n40239/ |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also slightly expanded the range of legal settings in which Māori could be used, to include bodies such as the [[Tenancy Tribunal]] and any [[Commission of Inquiry]].

==Use of macrons in the act==
The use of [[macron (diacritic)|macrons]] to indicate the long vowel in New Zealand Government legislation is inconsistent, with this act being one example of non-macron use.  A version of the legislation that includes macrons is, however, offered by the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori Language Act 1987|url=http://www.tereo.govt.nz/act87/index.shtml|accessdate=18 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526055421/http://www.tereo.govt.nz/act87/index.shtml |archivedate=26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The act was the result of many years of campaigning by Māori, particularly those involved in the [[Māori protest movement]]. It was also the result of shifts in thinking about the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. By the mid-1980s, the treaty had acquired increased relevance thanks primarily to the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]. The act was passed at least in part as a response to Waitangi Tribunal finding that the Māori language was a {{lang|mi|taonga}} (treasure or valued possession) under the Treaty of Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dana |first=Peterson |title=Te Reo Māori - the Māori language |url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7C98C7EE-4175-41F5-9576-87AB4ED03419/428/004TeReo3.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Library |accessdate=14 February 2013 |pages=1–9 [3] |date=14 March 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act also drew on a number of international precedents, primarily the [[Bord na Gaeilge Act 1978|{{lang|ga|Bord na Gaeilge|nocat=y|italic=no}} Act 1978]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which is cited several times in the legislation, but also the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] of the United Kingdom, which enabled the use of the [[Welsh language]] in [[Courts of England and Wales|Welsh]] court proceedings. 

Despite the act, Māori does not have the same status under law as English. For example, tax records must be kept in English unless the Commissioner of Internal Revenue agrees otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 22(2)(fb) |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0166/latest/DLM350462.html |accessdate=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 update==
The 1987 act was updated in 2016. As a New Zealand first, two versions of the law were circulated: one in Māori and another in English, with a provision in the law stating the Māori version of the law takes precedent to the English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/maori-language-bill-passed-2016041419 |title=Māori Language Bill passed |first=Maiki |last=Sherman |publisher=Newshub |date=14 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL56640_1/te-pire-m%C5%8D-te-reo-m%C4%81ori-m%C4%81ori-language-bill |title=Te Pire mō Te Reo Māori / Māori Language Bill |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=22 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metrix UK Ltd''' is a [[joint venture]] company, originally a 50/50 equity partnership between [[QinetiQ]] and [[Land Securities|LandSecurities Trillium]], specifically set up to bid for the two main contracts under the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government's 2001 [[Defence Training Review]] (DTR) rationalisation programme. Contract 1 involves provision of training for [[engineering]] and [[Telecommunication|communication]]s for the whole of the [[British Armed Forces]], while contract 2 was to provide training for [[logistics]], [[security]], [[police|policing]] and [[Administration (business)|administration]].

On 17 January 2007, it was announced that the Metrix [[consortium]] had been awarded Preferred Bidder status for Package 1 of the DTR programme, and Provisional Preferred Bidder status for Package 2. Metrix was expected eventually to reduce the current defence training estate from about 30 current sites to about 10 in the future, with a main campus to be located at an [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] site at [[MOD St Athan|St Athan]] in southern [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=257220&amp;NewsAreaID=2 Government News Network - Wednesday 17 January 2007 13:22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191641/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=257220&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2008, the Government announced that it had become apparent that the Metrix Consortium is not able to offer an affordable and acceptable Package 2 solution and, as a consequence, alternative approaches were being considered. This did not have any impact on the commitment to the Package 1 Metrix solution, which was still to be vigorously pursued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qinetiq.com/home_metrix_review/31_01_08_statement.html A statement issued by the [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]] on 31 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2008, Land Securities confirmed, in light of the significantly increased bid costs, that Trillium was withdrawing from its role as a partner in the Metrix consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsecurities.com/websitefiles/Metrix%20withdrawal_111208.pdf LandSecurities Metrix Withdrawal]&lt;/ref&gt; Their place was taken by [[Sodexo]] (originally a consortium member, rather than partner).

On 19 October 2010 the DTR project was cancelled and Metrix UK lost its status as preferred bidder.

The '''Minamata Convention on Mercury''' is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and mercury compounds. This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on Mercury ==
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources – such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities – but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.

Due to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2013.

and Environmental Transport. UNEP Chemicals Branch, Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the negotiations ==
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.

In 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.

A mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention. Other stakeholders, including intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations also participated in the process and contributed through sharing of views, experience and technical expertise.&lt;ref name="ehp.niehs.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2013|title=The Minamata Convention on Mercury: A First Step toward Protecting Future Generations|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/121-a304/|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=10|pages=A304–A309|doi=10.1289/ehp.121-A304|last1=Kessler|first1=Rebecca|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee was chaired by Fernando Lugris of [[Uruguay]] and supported by the Chemicals and Health Branch of UN Environment's Economy Division. The INC held five sessions to discuss and negotiate a global agreement on mercury:

In total, the Convention has 128 signatories.

Fernando Lugris, the Uruguayan chair delegate, proclaimed, "Today in the early hours of 19 January 2013 we have closed a chapter on a journey that has taken four years of often intense but ultimately successful negotiations and opened a new chapter towards a sustainable future.

Further to the adoption of the Convention, the intergovernmental negotiating committee was mandated to meet during the interim period preceding the opening of the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to facilitate its rapid entry into force and effective implementation upon entry into force. Two sessions of the INC were held:
* INC 6, 3 to 7 November 2014, in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]
* INC 7, 10 to 15 March 2016, in [[Dead Sea]], [[Jordan]]
Discussions covered a number of technical, financial as well as administrative and operational aspects.

The Convention required to enter into force the deposit of fifty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession by States or regional economic integration organizations. This fifty-ratification milestone was reached on 18 May 2017, hence the Convention entered into force on 16 August 2017 and held the first meeting of its [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] (COP1) from 24 to 29 September 2017 in Geneva.

==Overview of the Convention==
The objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.

The Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020, except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, of lamps such as compact fluorescent lamps, of  and relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.&lt;ref name="unep.org" /&gt;

==Text and provisions==

''Disclaimer : The information below aims at providing a rapid overview of the Convention. It neither represents an interpretation of the text of the Minamata Convention by UN Environment or the Interim Secretariat of the Minamata Convention, nor does it substitute the original authentic texts of the Minamata Convention on Mercury as deposited with the Secretary General of the UN acting as the Depositary.''

The Convention is made of 35 Articles and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.

The preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, "a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment."&lt;ref name="Minamata Convention on mercury"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development "the future we want". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.

The importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.&lt;ref name="Minamata Convention on mercury" /&gt;

=== Article 1 ===

*States the objective of the Convention, which is "to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds".

=== Article 2 ===
* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:
* "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;
* "Best available techniques";
* "Best environmental practices" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;
* "Mercury" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;
* "Mercury compound";
* "Mercury-added product" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;
* "Party" and "Parties present and voting";
* "Primary mercury mining";
* "Regional economic integration organization";
* "Use allowed".

===Article 3===
* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.
* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.
* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.
* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.
* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.

===Article 4===

*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. 
*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.

===Article 5===
* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.
* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.
* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.

===Article 6===
* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.
* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.
* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.
* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.
* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19170">{{Other uses|Motion (disambiguation)}}

In [[United States law]], a '''motion''' is a [[Legal procedure|procedural device]] to bring a limited, contested issue before a [[court]] for decision.&lt;ref name="wex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a request to the [[judge]] (or judges) to make a decision about the [[Legal case|case]].&lt;ref name="wex"/&gt; Motions may be made at any point in [[Administrative law|administrative]], [[Criminal procedure|criminal]] or [[Civil procedure|civil proceedings]], although that right is [[regulated]] by court rules which vary from place to place. The party requesting the motion may be called the ''movant'', or may simply be the ''moving party''. The party opposing the motion is the ''nonmovant'' or ''nonmoving party''.

==Process==

In the United States, as a general rule, courts do not have self-executing powers.  In other words, in order for the court to rule on a contested issue in a case before it, one of the parties or a third party must raise an appropriate motion asking for a particular order.  Some motions may be made in the form of an oral request in open court, which is then either summarily granted or denied orally by the court. Today, however, most motions (especially on important or dispositive issues that could decide the entire case) are decided after oral argument preceded by the filing and service of legal papers. That is, the movant is usually required to serve advance written notice along with some kind of written legal argument justifying the motion. The legal argument may come in the form of a memorandum of points and authorities supported by affidavits or declarations. Some northeastern U.S. states have a tradition in which the legal argument comes in the form of an affidavit from the attorney, speaking personally as himself on behalf of his client. In contrast, in most U.S. states, the memorandum is written impersonally or as if the client were speaking directly to the court, and the attorney reserves declarations of his own personal knowledge to a separate declaration or affidavit (which are then cited to in the memorandum). One U.S. state, Missouri, uses the term "suggestions" for the memorandum of points and authorities.

Either way, the nonmovant usually has the opportunity to file and serve papers opposing the motion. In addition, most jurisdictions allow for time for the movant to file reply papers rebutting the arguments made in the opposition.

Customs vary widely as to whether oral argument is optional or mandatory once briefing in writing is complete. Some courts issue tentative rulings (after which the loser may demand oral argument) while others do not. Depending upon the type of motion and the jurisdiction, the court may simply issue an oral decision from the bench (possibly accompanied by a request to the winner to draft an order for its signature reducing the salient points to writing), take the matter under submission and draft a lengthy written decision and order, or simply fill out a standard court form with check boxes for different outcomes. The court may serve all parties directly with its decision or may serve only the winner and order the winner to serve everyone else in the case.

==Types==
===U.S. federal courts===
{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

====To dismiss====
{{anchor|motdismiss}}A "'''motion to dismiss'''" asks the court to decide that a [[Claim (legal)|claim]], even if true as stated, is not one for which the law offers a [[legal remedy]]. As an example, a claim that the [[defendant]] failed to greet the plaintiff while passing the latter on the street, insofar as no legal duty to do so may exist, would be dismissed for failure to state a valid claim: the court must assume the truth of the factual allegations, but may hold that the claim states no cause of action under the applicable substantive law. A claim that has been presented after the [[statute of limitations]] has expired is also subject to dismissal. If granted, the claim is dismissed without any [[evidence (law)|evidence]] being presented by the other side. A motion to dismiss has taken the place of the common law [[demurrer]] in most modern civil practice. When a court dismisses a case, many lay persons state the case was "thrown out."

Under '''Rule 12''' of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], a party may raise by motion any [[Defense (legal)|defense]], [[Objection (law)|objection]], or request that the court can determine without a trial of the general issue. Before the trial starts, the motions can be based on defects in instituting the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]], defects in the [[indictment]] or information (which can be challenged at any stage but are generally raised before a trial begins). Pleadings in a federal criminal trial are pleadings in a criminal proceeding are the indictment, the information, and the pleas of [[Acquittal|not guilty]], [[Guilt (law)|guilty]], and ''[[nolo contendere]]''. A motion under '''Rule 14''' can address the statement of the charges (or individual specifications, see below) or the defendants. In these instances, the motion to dismiss is characterized as a "motion to sever charges or defendants."

Under '''Rule 907''', (Rules for Courts-Martial),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/military-legal-resources-home.html |title=Military Legal Resources (Federal Research Division: Customized Research and Analytical Services, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2013-10-25 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a motion to dismiss is a request to terminate further proceedings on one or more [[Indictment|criminal charges]] and specifications on grounds capable of resolution without trial of the general issue of guilt. A motion may be based on nonwaivable grounds (e.g. lack of jurisdiction or the failure to state an offense) or waivable grounds (denial of a right to a [[speedy trial]], statute of limitation, [[double jeopardy]] meaning a person has been previously tried by [[court-martial]] or federal civilian court for the same [[Offense (law)|offense]], [[pardon]] or [[Immunity from prosecution|grant of immunity]]). Specifications are sometimes referred to as 'counts' or separate instances of a particular offense which are connected to specific factual evidence. A motion may seek to dismiss these specifications, especially if it is so defective it substantially misled the accused, or it is multiplicious.

'''Multiplicity''', also known as ''allied offenses of similar import'', is the situation where two or more allegations allege the same offense, or a situation where one defined offense necessarily includes another. A counts may also be multiplicious if two or more describe substantially the same misconduct in different ways. For example, [[assault]] and [[disorderly conduct]] may be multiplicious if facts and evidence presented at trial prove that the disorderly conduct consists solely of the assault. That is to say, if all the elements contained in one are all in another they are allied offenses of similar import.

Discovery motions relate to the necessary exchange of [[information]] between the parties. In the [[Common law|common law system]], these motions capture an irreducible tension in the legal system between the right of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] and a duty to disclose information to another.

There are numerous practical differences between the discovery expectations and practices in civil and criminal proceedings. The local rules of many courts clarify expectations with respect to civil discovery, in part because these are often poorly understood or are abused as part of a trial strategy. As a result, civil discovery rules pertain to discretionary discovery practices and much of the argument in this respect centers on the proper definition of the scope of the parties requests. Because criminal prosecutions generally implicate a well-defined constitutional guarantee, criminal discovery is much more focused on automatic disclosure principles, which if found to be violated, will trigger the dismissal of the charges.

'''Rules 7.1''' and '''26-37''' of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], are often cited in combination with a specific local rule to form a basis for a civil discovery motion.

'''Rule 16''', Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is the basis for a criminal discovery motion. Rule 906(b)(7), Rules for Courts-Martial a variety of a "motion for appropriate relief" is used as a [[military law]] basis for discovery.

====For summary judgment====
A "'''motion for [[summary judgment]]'''" asks the court to decide that the available evidence, even if taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, supports a ruling in favor of the [[Summary judgement|moving party]]. This motion is usually only made when sufficient time for discovering all evidence has expired. For summary judgment to be granted in most jurisdictions, a two-part standard must be satisfied:  (i) no genuine issue of material fact can be in dispute between the parties, and (ii) the moving party must be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For example, a claim that a doctor engaged in [[malpractice]] by prescribing a drug could result in summary judgment if the plaintiff failed to obtain [[expert witness|expert]] [[testimony]] indicating that the drug was improperly prescribed. Motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment are types of [[dispositive motion]]s.

'''Rule 56''', Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is the rule which explains the mechanics of a summary judgment motion. As explained in the notes to this rule, summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Prior to its introduction in the US in 1934, it was used in England for more than 50 years.

In [[England]] motions for summary judgments were used only in cases of liquidated claims, there followed a steady enlargement of the scope of the remedy until it was used in actions to recover land or [[Personal property|chattel]]s and in all other actions at law, for liquidated or unliquidated claims, except for a few designated [[tort]]s and [[breach of promise]] of marriage. English Rules Under the [[Judicature Acts|Judicature Act]] (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 3, r. 6; Orders 14, 14A, and 15; see also O. 32, r. 6, authorizing an application for judgment at any time upon admissions. [[New York (state)|New York]] was a leader in the adoption of this rule in the US and the success of the method helps account for its current importance as an almost indispensable tool in administrative actions (especially before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which adjudicates [[employment discrimination]] claims and the [[United States Merit Systems Protection Board|Merit Systems Protection Board]] which adjudicates federal employment matters).&lt;ref name="History of Summary Judgment"&gt;Clark and Samenow, The Summary Judgment (1929), 38 Yale L.J. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Civil Litigation Management Manual'' published by the US Judicial Conference directs that these motions be filed at the optimum time and warns that premature motions can be a waste of time and effort. The significant resources needed to prepare and defend against such motions is a major factor which influences [[Lawsuit|litigants]] to use them extensively. In many cases, particularly from the defendant's (or defense) perspective, accurate or realistic estimates of the costs and risks of an actual trial are made only after a motion has been denied. Overbroad motions for summary judgment are sometimes designed to make the opponent rehearse their case before trial.

Most summary judgment motions must be filed in accordance with specific rules relating to the content and quality of the information presented to the [[judge]]. Among other things, most motions for summary judgment will require or include: page limits on submissions by [[counsel]]; an instruction to state disputed issues of fact up front; an instruction to state whether there is a governing case; an instruction that all summary judgment motions be accompanied by electronic versions (on a CD-R or DVD-R), in a chambers-compatible format that includes full pinpoint citations and complete deposition and affidavit excerpts to aid in opinion preparation; an instruction that all exhibits submitted conform to specific physical characteristics (i.e. be tabbed with letters or numbers, that pages be sequentially numbered or "Bates-stamped"); an instruction that citations to [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] or [[affidavit]] testimony must include the appropriate page or paragraph numbers and that citations to other documents or materials must include pinpoint citations. Many judges also ask the parties to prepare form orders with a brief statements of law to help the judge write the decision. A judge generally issues a tentative ruling on the submitted pleadings, and counsel will be offered an opportunity to respond in a later [[oral argument]]. Alternatively, a judge may grant requests for argument in a preargument order which specifies what points will be discussed prior to a decision.

====''In limine''====
A "'''motion ''[[in limine]]'''''" asks the court to decide that certain evidence may or may not be presented to the jury at the trial. A motion in limine generally addresses issues which would be prejudicial for the jury to hear in open court, even if the other side makes a timely objection which is sustained, and the judge instructs the jury to disregard the evidence. For example, the defendant may ask the court to rule that evidence of a prior [[conviction (law)|conviction]] that occurred a long time ago should not be allowed into evidence at the trial because it would be more [[Prejudice|prejudicial]] than [[probative]]. If the motion is granted, then evidence regarding the [[conviction]] could not be mentioned in front of the jury, without first approaching the judge outside of the hearing of the jury and obtaining permission. The violation of a motion in limine can result in the court declaring a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].

There are three types of motions ''in limine'':
* Inclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something included in the trial.
* Exclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something excluded in the trial.
* Preclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something precluded in the trial

====For a directed verdict====
A "'''motion for a [[directed verdict]]'''" asks the court to rule that the [[plaintiff]] or [[prosecutor]] has not proven the case, and there is no need for the defense to attempt to present evidence. This motion is made after the plaintiff has rested its case, and prior to the defense presenting any evidence. If granted, the court would dismiss the case.

====For judgment ''n.o.v.''====
A "'''motion for [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] ''n.o.v.'''''" (''[[non obstante veredicto]]'', or notwithstanding the [[verdict]]) asks the court to reverse the [[jury]]'s verdict on the grounds that the jury could not reasonably have reached such a verdict. This motion is made after the jury's verdict. If granted, the court enters a new verdict. This motion can be used in a criminal case only to reverse a guilty verdict; not guilty verdicts are immune to reversal by the court.

Under '''Rule 50''', Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the motion for directed verdict and JNOV have been replaced by the '''motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL)''', which can be made at the close of the opposing party's evidence and "renewed" after return of the verdict (or after the dismissal of a [[hung jury]]).

Under '''Rule 29''', Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the "motion for a judgment of acquittal," or Rule 917, Rules for Courts-Martial the "motion for a finding of not guilty," if the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to support a rational finding of guilty, there is no reason to submit the issue to a jury.

====For new trial====
A '''motion for new trial''' asks to overturn or set aside a court's decision or jury verdict. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the end result of a case. This motion must be based on some vital error in the court's handling of the trial, such as the admission or exclusion of key evidence, or an incorrect instruction to the jury. Generally the motion is filed within a short time after the trial (7–30 days) and is decided prior to the lodging of an appeal. In some jurisdictions, a motion for new trial which is not ruled upon by a set period of time automatically is deemed to be denied.

====To set aside judgment====
A "'''[[motion to set aside judgment]]'''" asks the court to vacate or nullify a judgment or verdict. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the grounds for the motion cannot be ones which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment.

====For ''nolle prosequi''====
A "'''motion for ''[[nolle prosequi]]'''''" ("not [[prosecute|prosecuting]]") is a motion by a prosecutor or other plaintiff to drop legal charges. n. Latin for "we do not wish to prosecute," which is a declaration made to the judge by a prosecutor in a criminal case (or by a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit) either before or during trial, meaning the case against the defendant is being dropped. The statement is an admission that the charges cannot be proved, that evidence has demonstrated either innocence or a fatal flaw in the prosecution's claim, or the district attorney has become convinced the accused is innocent. It should be distinguished from the motion for judgment of ''non prosequitur'', or judgment of ''non pros'', which is a motion in some jurisdictions (e.g. [[Pennsylvania]]) by a defendant for a judgment in his favor for failure of the plaintiff to timely prosecute his claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 231, Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 237.3. Relief from Judgment of Non Pros or by Default.|url=https://www.pacode.com/secure/data/231/chapter200/s237.3.html|website=Pennsylvania Code|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====To compel====
A "'''[[motion to compel]]'''" asks the court to order either the opposing party or a third party to take some action. This sort of motion most commonly deals with discovery disputes, when a party who has propounded discovery to either the opposing party or a third party believes that the discovery responses are insufficient. The motion to compel is used to ask the court to order the non-complying party to produce the documentation or information requested or to [[Sanctions (law)|sanction]] the non-complying party for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.

The causes and effects of municipally owned corporations are posited to be different from those of [[state-owned enterprises]]. [[Corporatization]] may be more utilised locally than nationally a way to allow hybrid or flexible forms of public service delivery such as [[public-private partnerships]] and [[inter-municipal cooperation]]. It also allows charging user fees.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt; Effects can be different because of lower regulator expertise, lower contracting capacity for municipalities,&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski /&gt; and the higher presence of scale economies. Current research shows that municipally owned corporations are frequently more efficient than [[bureaucracy]] but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; An additional problem is the fact that municipally owned corporations often have more than one municipal owner, and conflict between municipal owners can lead to reduced output for the municipally owned corporation due to various negative spillovers.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327833751_Background_Autonomy_Steering_and_Corporate_Governance_Determinants_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Governance_of_Municipal_Corporations|title= Background, Autonomy, Steering, and Corporate Governance: Determinants of the Effectiveness of (Governance of) Municipal Corporations|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke van Genugten, and Sandra van Thiel (2018)|publisher=Lausanne: EGPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Under [[New Public Management]], [[corporatization]] became prominent as a step towards (partial) [[privatization]].&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1527533|title=Debate: Corporatization as more than a recent crisis-driven development|last=Voorn, Bart, Sandra Van Thiel, and Marieke van Genugten (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became an end in itself, aiming to combine government control with efficient, businesslike service delivery that was considered lacking in bureaucratic service delivery. The [[state-owned enterprise]]s that resulted were to be organized akin to private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain state ownership are not traded on the [[stock market]].&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Marra2/publication/4732914_Internal_Regulation_by_Mixed_Enterprises_The_Case_of_the_Italian_Water_Sector/links/0deec529a2526c7663000000/Internal-Regulation-by-Mixed-Enterprises-The-Case-of-the-Italian-Water-Sector.pdf|title=Internal regulation by mixed enterprises: the case of the Italian water sector|last=Marra, Alessandro (2007)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 78(2): 245-275.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also became a trend at the local level. Municipal corporation followed a process of [[externalization]] that required new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and followed common changes in the institutional landscape of [[public services]].&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossi, Giuseppe, and Christoph Reichard (2008)|title=Municipal corporatization in Germany and Italy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030802264275|publisher=Public Management Review, 10(5): 597-617}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a substantial growth in the number of municipally owned corporations in the 1990s and 2000s throughout Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1486629|title=New development: Corporatization of local authorities in England in the wake of austerity 2010–2016|last=Ferry, Laurence, Rhys Andrews, Chris Skelcher, and Piotr Wegorowski (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorioFecher2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/blaannpce/v_3a82_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a361-373.htm|title=The future of public enterprises: Contributions to a new discourse|last=Florio, Massimo, and Fabienne Fecher (2011)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 82(4): 361-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons and effects ==
Municipal corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes) or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. Its reasons and effects are somewhat similar as those of [[corporatization]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferryetal /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares&gt;{{cite web|last=António F. Tavares (2017)|title=Ten years after: revisiting the determinants of the adoption of municipal corporations for local service delivery|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1356723|publisher=Local Government Studies, 43(5): 697-706.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt; Such externalization gives the service delivery organization legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, because it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, it can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy also reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; At the local level there may also be higher transaction costs, because contracting capacity may be lower.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown, Trevor, and Matthew Potoski (2003)|title=Transaction Costs and Institutional Explanations for Government Service Production Decisions|url=http://spa.hust.edu.cn/2008/uploadfile/2009-9/20090910194210575.pdf|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Once a service has been corporatised, it is often relatively easy to (partially) privatise it by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Thus corporatisation can be a stop on the way towards (partial) privatization.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of [[hybrid organization|hybrid]] forms of organization, such as institutional private-partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations, which are especially relevant at the local level because of opportunities to capture scale economies.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;

=== Alleviating fiscal stress ===
Municipal corporations tend to be established by local governments experiencing some degree of fiscal stress.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citroni&gt;{{cite web|last=Citroni, Giulio, Andrea Lippi, and Stefania Profeti (2013)|title=Remapping the State: Inter-Municipal Cooperation through Corporatisation and Public-Private Governance Structures|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03003930.2012.707615|publisher=Local Government Studies, 39(2): 208-234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen, Rune J. (2007)|title=Does dispersed public ownership impair efficiency? The case of refuse collection in Norway|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.5414&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Public Administration,85(4): 1045-1058.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization was a way to allow local governments to "hide their liabilities by allocating them partly to their companies" or "corporatized their utilities (…) to raise new sources of income from their companies."&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;

== Problems with multiple ownership ==
The frequent ownership of municipally owned corporations by multiple municipalities can cause problems, the so-called 'multiple principal problem', that can lead these to be inefficient&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt; or have high failure rates.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; There can be free-riding or duplication in steering and monitoring procedures, resulting in high costs. If there is heterogeneity in interests between the multiple municipalities, there may be directive ambiguity or lobbying of the corporations by individual municipalities, leading to high inefficiency. Delegating governance to one elected party may be a way to solve this problem.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

== Usage ==
Municipal corporatization is more prominent for some services than for others. It is typically prominent in:&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

[[John Belton O'Neall]] summarized the 1740 South Carolina law, in his written work, ''[[The Negro Law of South Carolina]]'', when he stated: "A [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] may, by the consent of his master, acquire and hold personal property.

{{Patent Cooperation Treaty}}
The '''Patent Cooperation Treaty''' ('''PCT''') is an international patent law [[treaty]], concluded in 1970. It provides a unified procedure for filing [[patent application]]s to protect [[invention]]s in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an '''international application''', or '''PCT application'''.

A single filing of a PCT application is made with a Receiving Office (RO) in one language. It then results in a [[prior art|search]] performed by an International Searching Authority (ISA), accompanied by a written opinion regarding the [[patentability]] of the invention, which is the subject of the application. It is optionally followed by a '''preliminary examination''', performed by an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the relevant national or regional authorities administer matters related to the examination of application (if provided by national law) and issuance of patent.

A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, since there is no such thing as an "international patent", and the grant of patent is a prerogative of each national or regional authority.&lt;ref name="Oxonica45"&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2008/2127.html ''Oxonica Energy Ltd v Neuftec Ltd (2008) EWHC 2127 (Pat)''], item 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a PCT application, which establishes a filing date in all contracting states, must be followed up with the step of entering into national or regional phases to proceed towards grant of one or more patents. The PCT procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application, which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law, in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired.

The contracting states,&lt;ref name="ART1"&gt;{{PCT Article|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the states which are parties to the PCT, constitute the '''International Patent Cooperation Union'''.&lt;ref name="ART1"/&gt;

==History==
The Washington Diplomatic Conference on the Patent Cooperation Treaty was held in [[Washington, DC|Washington]] from 25 May to 19 June 1970. The Patent Cooperation Treaty was signed on the last day of the conference on 19 June 1970. The Treaty entered into force on 24 January 1978, initially with 18 contracting states.&lt;ref name="25years"&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization, ''The First Twenty-five Years of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) 1970–1995'', 1995, {{ISBN|92-805-0601-3}}, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The first international applications were filed on 1 June 1978.&lt;ref name="25years"/&gt; The Treaty was subsequently amended in 1979, and modified in 1984 and 2001.

==Accession==

{{main|List of parties to the Patent Cooperation Treaty}}
Any contracting state to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] can become a member of the PCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|62|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the world's countries are parties to the PCT, including all of the major industrialized countries (with a few exceptions, including [[Argentina]], and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]). As of 16 March 2017, there were 152 contracting states to the PCT. [[Jordan]] became the 152nd contracting state on 9 March 2017,&lt;ref name="jordan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/pct_contracting_states.html|title=The PCT now has 152 Contracting States|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCT Newsletter No. 03/2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2017/pct_news_2017_3.pdf|title=PCT Newsletter No. 03/2017|date=March 2017&lt;!--|work=PCT Newsletter No. 03/2017--&gt;|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PCT entered into force there on 9 June 2017.&lt;ref name="jordan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCT Newsletter No. 03/2017"/&gt;

==Procedure==
The main advantages of the PCT procedure, also referred to as the international procedure, are the possibility to maximally delay: (a) the national or regional procedures; (b) the respective fees and translation costs; and, (c) the unified filing procedure.  From a practical standpoint, this could allow new ventures more time to locate strategic partnerships, funding, and markets, before their technology becomes public.

A PCT application (also called "international patent application") has two phases.&lt;ref name=2013-part1&gt;{{cite video |people=Matthias Reischle |date=19 August 2013 |title=Learn the PCT: Episode 1 - Introduction to the PCT System |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Kpu4aL7Fs |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=13 February 2014 |minutes=13:13 to 14:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase is the international phase in which patent protection is pending under a single patent application filed with the patent office of a contracting state of the PCT. The second phase is the national and regional phase which follows the international phase in which rights are continued by filing necessary documents with the patent offices of separate contracting states of the PCT.&lt;ref name=2013-part1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pct/guide/en/ "PCT Applicant's Guide"]&lt;/ref&gt; A PCT application, as such, is not an actual request that a patent be granted, and it is not converted into one unless and until it enters the "national phase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2008/2127.html ''Oxonica Energy Ltd v Neuftec Ltd (2008) EWHC 2127 (Pat)''], item 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filing===
The first step of the procedure consists in filing an ''international (patent) application'' with a competent patent office, called a ''Receiving Office'' (RO). This application is called an ''international application'' or simply a ''PCT application'' since it does not result in an international patent nor in a PCT patent (neither of which exists). The PCT application needs to be filed in one language only, although translations may still be required for international search and international publication, depending on the language of filing and the International Searching Authority to be used.

At least one applicant (either a [[person|physical]] or [[Juristic person|legal person]]) must be a national or [[dwelling|resident]] of a contracting state to the PCT; otherwise, no PCT filing date is accorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|9}}, {{PCT Rule|18|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a PCT filing date is erroneously accorded, the Receiving Office may, within four months from the filing date, declare that the application should be considered withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|14|4}} and {{PCT Rule|30}}; [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2009/pct_news_2009_06.pdf Practical Advice: PCT application considered withdrawn by receiving Office after having been accorded a PCT filing date], [[PCT Newsletter]], June 2009, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that at least one applicant must be a national or resident of a contracting state to the PCT needs, however, "only to be complied with at the time of filing the international application. Later changes in the applicant's country of residence (or nationality) (...) have no consequence on the validity of the international application itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2016/article_0006.html |title=Practical Advice - Situation where the sole applicant, who is not a national of a PCT Contracting State, is no longer resident in a PCT Contracting State|date=February 2016|work=PCT NEWSLETTER No. 02/2016|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most member states, the applicant or at least one of the applicants of the application is required to be a national or resident of the state of the receiving office where the application is filed. Applicants from any contracting state may file a PCT application at the International Bureau in Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|19}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to national security provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|27|8}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0011.html|title=Practical Advice: The need to take into account national security provisions when filing a PCT application|date=June 2014|work=PCT Newsletter, No. 06/2014|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon filing of the PCT application, all contracting states are automatically designated.{{#tag:ref|Applicable as from 1 January 2004.|group=notes}}{{#tag:ref|Germany, Japan, and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] can be excluded from this all inclusive designation, if priority is claimed from an earlier national filing in the state concerned.

===Search and written opinion===
A search or ''international search'' is then made by an authorized ''International Searching Authority'' (ISA) to find the most relevant [[prior art]] documents regarding the claimed subject matter. The search results in an ''International Search Report'' (ISR), together with a written opinion regarding [[patentability]].&lt;ref&gt;The written opinion is established by the International Searching Authority (ISA) for international applications filed on or after 1 January 2004 only.&lt;/ref&gt; The ISA(s) that the applicant can choose depends on the receiving Office with which the applicant filed the international application.&lt;ref name="Practical advice 06/2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Practical advice: Filing a demand with an International Authority which is not the Authority which carried out the international search |journal=PCT Newsletter |issue=06/2013 |pages=9–11 |publisher=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2013/pct_news_2013_6.pdf |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the most selected ISAs were the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) (with 37.7% of all ISRs issued), followed by the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO) (20.7%) and the [[Korean Intellectual Property Office]] (KIPO) (14.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/freepublications/en/patents/901/wipo_pub_901_2014.pdf|title=Patent Cooperation Treaty Yearly Review - The International Patent System|year=2014|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|page=68|isbn=978-92-805-2499-4|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISR is supposed to be provided by the ISA to the applicant 9 months after filing of the application in the event of a first filing and 16 months after the [[priority right|priority date]] in the event of a subsequent filing (i.e., claiming the priority of a first filing). However, long delays may occur,{{vague|Under which circumstances? For which International Searching Authorities?|date=May 2012}} even to the point where the ISR is not received by the 30/31-month national phase deadline.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The ISR is published together with the PCT application (or as soon as possible afterwards). The written opinion is initially confidential, but unless it is superseded by an ''International Preliminary Examination Report'' (see optional examination, below), it is made available in the form of an ''International Preliminary Report on Patentability'' (Chapter I of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or IPRP Chapter I), within 30 months of the filing date or a priority date, if any.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|44bis|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ISR is not in English, it is translated into English for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|45|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A designated Office may require a translation of the IPRP Chapter I into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|44bis|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international search report can help the applicant decide whether it would be worthwhile seeking national protection, and if so, in how many countries, as fees and other expenses, including translation costs, must be paid to enter the national phase in each country. Yet another advantage of filing a PCT application under the PCT is that many national patent authorities will rely on the international search report (although the PCT does not obligate them to do so) instead of performing a prior art search themselves, and the applicant may thus be able to save search fees.&lt;ref name="Oxonica46"&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2008/2127.html ''Oxonica Energy Ltd v Neuftec Ltd (2008) EWHC 2127 (Pat)''], item 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the compulsory international search, at least one optional supplementary international search may also be carried out by participating International Searching Authorities,&lt;ref&gt;namely, an International Searching Authority which is competent to do so under {{PCT Rule|45bis|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon request by the applicant&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|45bis|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and payment of corresponding fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|45bis|2 and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of seeing new prior art being cited in the subsequent national phases.&lt;ref name="sis"&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ppt/2009changes.ppt ''Amendments to the PCT Regulations as from 1 January 2009''], undated.

Consulted on 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication===
The PCT application is published by the International Bureau at the [[WIPO]], based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in one of the ten "languages of publication": [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Russian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|48|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication normally takes place promptly after 18 months from the filing date or, if a priority is claimed, from the earliest priority date.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|21|2|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCT Newsletter 2016-10"&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2016|title=Practical Advice - Requesting early publication of an international application|journal=[[PCT Newsletter]]|publisher=WIPO|volume=2016|issue=10|pages=8–11|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2016/pct_news_2016_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, a PCT application may be published earlier if the applicant requests early publication.&lt;ref name="PCT Newsletter 2016-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|21|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, if 18 months after the priority date, the PCT application designates only the United States, then the application is not automatically published.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|64|3}}, [http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.pdf PCT Reservations, Declarations, Notifications and Incompatibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the publication of the PCT application until 28 months after the priority date, any third party may file observations regarding the novelty and inventive step of the invention. The observations may be submitted anonymously, and no fee is due for filing such observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.wipo.int/wilma/pct-general/201207/msg00000.html |title=PCT Newsletter Update |date=4 July 2012  |accessdate=29 July 2012 |mailinglist=PCT Newsletter mailing list}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ai/s801.html |title=Administrative Instructions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, Part 8: Instructions Relating to Observations by Third Parties, Section 801: Third Party Observation System |work=Administrative Instructions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as in force from July 1, 2012 |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_08.pdf Practical Advice, Making third party observations], [[PCT Newsletter]], July–August 2012, No. 07-08/2012, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optional examination===
An ''international preliminary examination'' may optionally be requested ("demanded").&lt;ref&gt;The international preliminary examination may start before the publication of the PCT application if the applicant has expressly requested an earlier start. See WIPO, [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/pct/en/texts/pdf/ispe.pdf ''PCT International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines (Guidelines for the Processing by International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authorities of International Applications Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty) as in force from March 25, 2004''], Page 25, "''Commencement of International Preliminary Examination: ... The International Preliminary Examining Authority normally starts the international preliminary examination when: ... (b) the time limit within which the applicant was permitted to file the demand ... has expired, or earlier if the applicant has expressly requested an earlier start''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-04/2010"&gt; [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2010/pct_news_2010_04.pdf "Factors to be considered when deciding whether or not to file a demand for international preliminary examination" (Views of David Reed), Practical Advice, PCT Newsletter No. 04/2010], page 8ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The international preliminary examination is conducted by an authorized ''International Preliminary Examination Authority'' (IPEA) and its objective is "to formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable".&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|33|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an ''International Preliminary Examination Report'' (IPER). Since 2004, the IPER bears the title "''international preliminary report on patentability (Chapter II of the Patent Cooperation Treaty)''" (commonly abbreviated "''IPRP Chapter II''").&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|70|15|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filing of a demand for international preliminary examination, which must be done within a time limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|31|5}} and {{PCT Rule|54bis}}&lt;/ref&gt; is subject to the payment of a "handling fee" for the benefit of the International Bureau&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "preliminary examination fee" for the benefit of the IPEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of filing a demand varies depending on the IPEA used by the applicant.&lt;ref name="Practical advice 06/2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-04/2010"/&gt; The IPEA(s) that the applicant can choose however depends on the receiving Office with which the applicant filed the PCT application (the same applies to ISAs).&lt;ref name="Practical advice 06/2013"/&gt;

If the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority (ISA) is positive, "there is little value to be obtained from filing a demand".&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-04/2010"/&gt; However, "[for] cases where the written opinion of the ISA contains negative findings, the savings in the applicant's/agent's time and, where applicable, agent's fees, required by multiple responses to national offices may well justify the use of the Chapter II procedure."&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-05/2010"&gt; [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2010/pct_news_2010_05.pdf "Factors to be considered when deciding whether or not to file a demand for international preliminary examination – Part 2" (Views of David Reed), Practical Advice, PCT Newsletter No. 05/2010], page 8ff.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many advantages, such as cost and effort savings ("as well as possibly shortened pendency/faster grants"&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-05/2010"/&gt;), in receiving a favourable IPRP Chapter II, i.e. a favourable report following an international preliminary examination.&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-05/2010"/&gt; For instance, national offices "with a smaller examining staff and those without examiners tend to rely more heavily on the results in the IPRP Chapter II".&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-05/2010"/&gt;

When an examination is demanded, the contracting states for which the examination is demanded are called ''Elected Offices'' (under ''Chapter II''), otherwise they are called ''Designated Offices'' (under ''Chapter I''). The ''election'' of a contracting state correspondingly means electing it when demanding (requesting) the examination.

An alternative to the filing of a demand for international preliminary examination is to file informal comments in response to the written opinion established by the ISA. These informal comments are not published. The informal comments should be submitted to the International Bureau (IB), and not to the ISA or the IPEA.&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-10/2004"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/practical_advice/pa_102004.html ''PCT Newsletter'' 10/2004: Practical Advice]. Consulted on 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They are kept in the file of the PCT application and, in the case where no demand is filed, forwarded to the designated offices,&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-04/2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-10/2004"/&gt; which are free to require a translation of the informal comments.&lt;ref name="Practical-Advice-10/2004"/&gt;

===Subject matter===
The PCT does not make any specific provision concerning the types of invention which may be the subject of an international application. Rules 39 and 67 permit International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authorities not to carry out search and examination on certain types of subject matter, such as scientific and mathematical theories, methods of doing business and computer programs to the extent that the Authority is not equipped to carry out a search or international preliminary examination concerning such programs. However, while a lack of international search may make national processing more difficult, {{PCT Article|27|5}} makes clear that this does not affect the issue of whether the invention is patentable under the laws of the designated States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as prescribing anything that would limit the freedom of each contracting state to prescribe such substantive conditions of patentability as it desires. (...)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===National and regional phase===
Finally, at 30 months&lt;ref&gt;The 30-month time limit to enter the national phase is not applicable to all countries. A small number of countries still request the entering of the national phase under Chapter I (i.e., if the preliminary examination is not demanded or not demanded in time) at 20 months. Consult this [http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/pdf/time_limits.pdf chart] for national phase entry deadlines for specific countries or regions.&lt;/ref&gt; from the filing date of the PCT application or from the earliest priority date of the application if a priority is claimed, the international phase ends and the PCT application enters in national and regional phase. However, any national law may fix time limits which expire later than 30 months. For instance, it is possible to enter the European regional phase at 31 months from the earliest priority date. National and regional phases can also be started earlier on the express request of the applicant, even before publication of the international application.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|20|3}} or {{PCT Article|40|2}}; [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2011/pct_news_2011_10.pdf Entering the national phase early where the PCT application has not yet been published], Practical Advice, [[PCT Newsletter]] No. 10/2011, page 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the entry into national or regional phase is not performed within the prescribed time limit, the PCT application generally ceases to have the effect of a national or regional application.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|24|1|iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6907">'''[[Revised Statutes|Revised Statute]] 2477''' (commonly known as "RS 2477") was enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1866 to encourage the settlement of the Western United States by the development of a system of highways. Its entire text is one sentence: "the right-of-way for the construction of highways across public lands not otherwise reserved for public purposes is hereby granted."

The original grant did not require being recorded, meaning it was self-enacting, and in 1866 constructing a road often meant using a trail many times and perhaps filling low places, moving rocks and placing signs.

It granted to counties and states a right-of-way across federal land when a highway was built.

RS 2477 was repealed in 1976 under the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act]] (FLPMA).  The repeal was subject to "valid existing rights." The relevant text (Sec. 701. 43 U.S.C. 1701) reads (a) "Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blm.gov/or/regulations/files/FLPMA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Western Aggregates Inc. v. County of Yuba (7/17/2002) is a leading California case applying RS 2477 in California to reopen a lost Gold Rush era road.

==Controversy==
Shared-access advocates claim that neither the BLM, Forest Service nor other federal agencies, nor even private landowners have the authority to close RS 2477 roads. Their interpretation of the statute has brought them into conflict with wilderness advocates, the federal government and private landowners.

===Conflicts on Federal Lands===
RS 2477 has become an issue for wilderness advocacy groups because of language in the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964. According to Section 2 (c) 3, any area to be considered for wilderness status must contain "a least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition." Section 4 (c) further specifies, "Except as specifically provided for in this Act, and subject to existing private rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildwilderness.org/docs/act1964.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an RS 2477 "highway" which qualifies as a "road" could disqualify the land it traverses from being recognized by the federal government as a "wilderness" if it reduced the area under consideration beneath the 5,000 acre limit.

Access advocates have sometimes organized to reopen or maintain what they consider to be legitimate RS 2477 roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.off-road.com/offroad/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=294079&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2001/01/shovel.html The Jarbidge Shovel Brigade] is the best-known group that was formed for this purpose.

Landowners, environmental organizations, government organizations (federal, state and county) and recreational-use advocates have very different understandings of the law. Conflicts among these groups came to a head when President [[Bill Clinton]] declared the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument|Grand Staircase-Escalante]], in southern Utah, to be a National Monument. Several Utah counties have been fighting in court to assert RS 2477 claims to roads that cross federal and private property (see [http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2005/09/04-4071a.htm SUWA v BLM]), including across the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.

Interior Secretary [[Ken Salazar]] recently authorized interior representatives to negotiate federal recognition of RS 2477 roads for which there is a clear historical record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2010/july/salazar_lays_groundwork.html&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, quiet title of the Skutumpah Road, within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, (see [http://assets.matchbin.com/sites/990/assets/2BEP_Kane_County_Motion_for_Summary_Judgment___answer_due_9_8_2010.pdf Kane County, Utah v United States]) was granted to [[Kane County, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700061805/Kane-County-wins-its-first-RS-2477-road-2-the-Skutumpah.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts on Private Lands===
As western lands become developed into residential subdivisions, motorized recreationists and sportsmen are continuing to claim access rights on privately constructed, owned, and maintained roads that cross private land and gated communities. Because some disputed roads were never recorded by counties, shared-access groups claim that private landowners hold property with an unrecorded public right-of-way. Property rights advocates say that failure to record a right-of-way means that there was no intention to create a public right.  
 
Shared-access groups argue that lack of formal action by counties does not diminish the public’s [[easement]]/[[usufruct]] rights through private lands. They have engaged in threats, trespassing, and vandalism &lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~balarat/ranch-vigilantes.html&lt;/ref&gt; to vigorously assert those rights.

Private property activists claim that nobody has access rights without a recorded easement. Shared-access activists claim that virtually all private land that used to be public can legally be traversed by the public. There is little common ground between these interpretation, so lawsuits are being fought in the western United States, and it has fallen to the courts to determine which routes are public and which are not.

Courts have applied state laws, federal laws, and federal land court rulings to resolve RS 2477 claims. Recent examples of failed attempts to assert RS 2477 rights on private property are Galli v. Idaho County (Case Number CV 36692, Second Judicial District of Idaho, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galli v. Idaho County|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16268288420925476991&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ramey v. [[Mark Boslough|Boslough]] (Case Number 02-CV-582, Boulder County District Court, 20th Judicial District of Colorado, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramey v.

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}

The '''Secretary for Justice''' ({{zh|t=律政司司長}}) is the head of the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Department of Justice]], the chief legal advisor to the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], and the chief law enforcement officer of the [[Government of Hong Kong]]. Before the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Transfer of the Sovereignty]] in 1997, the position was known as the [[Attorney-General]] of [[Hong Kong]].

The Secretary for Justice, nominated by the [[Central People's Government|Chinese government]] on the advice of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], is an ''ex officio'' member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong]]. The Secretary takes office after appointment by the [[Central People's Government|Government of the People's Republic of China]], which is responsible for Hong Kong's [[diplomacy|foreign affairs]] and [[Military|defence]]. The Secretary for Justice also belongs to the Policy Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Secretary, 

The Office of the Secretary for Justice was established by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 53, Hong Kong Basic Law&lt;/ref&gt; which guarantees the power of the Department of Justice to control criminal prosecutions free from any interference.&lt;ref&gt;Article 63, Hong Kong Basic Law&lt;/ref&gt; The position is normally held by a [[Jurist|legal professional]], and was, before July 2002, a civil service position. The Secretary for Justice, after the [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Chief Secretary]] and the [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]], is one of the three highest [[Principal officials of Hong Kong|Principal Officials of the Government]]. 
 
The current Secretary for Justice is [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], [[Gold Bauhinia Star|GBS]], [[Senior Counsel|SC]], [[Justice of Peace|JP]].

==Role==

In the course of discharging his or her duties as the chief legal advisor to the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, the Secretary for Justice is assisted by five law officers, namely:

* the [[Solicitor General of Hong Kong|Solicitor General]] who heads the Legal Policy Division,
* the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] who head the [[Prosecutions Division (Hong Kong)|Prosecutions Division]],
* the [[Law Officers of the Crown|Law Officer (Civil Law)]] who heads the Civil Law Division,
* the [[Law Officers of the Crown|Law Officer (International Law)]] who heads the International Law Division, and
* the [[Parliamentary Counsel|Law Draftsman]] who heads the Law Drafting Division

(The Administration and Development Division is headed by an Administrative Officer.)

==Ranking in the Hong Kong Government==

The Secretary for Justice is the third in line, after the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary, to act for the Chief Executive when he or she is on leave, outside Hong Kong, or when the position is otherwise temporarily vacant.

The Secretary for Justice ranks fifth in the [[Hong Kong order of precedence]].

==Residence==

The Secretary of Justice has an official residence at 19 Severn Road, The Peak.

==Pre-1997 position==
Before the [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|1997 handover to China]], the position was known as the '''[[Attorney General#Hong Kong|Attorney General]]''' ({{zh|t=律政司}}), and the department was known as the [[Legal Department]] ({{zh|t=律政署}}) and was also known as the '''Attorney General's Chambers''' ({{zh|t=律政司署}}). The office of the Attorney General was never localized during British rule and no Hong Kong Chinese ever held this key post.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">Limitation periods in Irish law are set out in a variety of statutes and in judicial decisions but primarily the limitations applying to civil actions are set out in the Statute of Limitations, 1957 and the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1843.  These statutes impose a limit on the right of action so that after a prescribed period any action will be time barred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlibrary.ie/documents/publications/saraphelen.pdf  Bar Review]  Institution of Proceedings the Statute of Limitations&lt;/ref&gt;  A list of cause of actions affected are listed under part two of the Statute of Limitations 1957.

The [[statute of limitations]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] depends on the type of legal case and also who is taking the case (the rules are different for children). The time period usually starts from the date of accrual of the cause of action or (if later) knowledge of the potential cause of action.

==Limitation periods==

The income tax in Slovakia is levied at two different rates of 19% on income below 35.022,31 Euro and 25% above &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/slovakia/pages/income-tax.aspx|title = KPMG|date = Income tax rates|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A personal allowance of 3.803,33 Euro apply, which is phased out when yearly income hit 25% income tax bracket. In case of a non-working spouse a further allowance can be claimed.

== Social Security contributions ==
All employment income is mandated to pay into various social funds by law. In 2016 the rate for the employee is 13.4% and the employer contribution 35.2% of corresponding salary. Maximum monthly income base is 4.290 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.kpmg.com/SK/sk/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/tax-card-2013.pdf|title = KPMG|date = Tax Card 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value-added tax ==
The value-added tax (VAT) in Slovakia is levied at a rate of 20%, but is expected to fall back to 19% when the crisis is over. A lower rate of 10% is levied on medicine and certain books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vatlive.com/european-news/slovakia-raises-vat-1-to-20-in-january-2011/|title = VAT Live|date = VAT rate rise to 20%|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate tax ==
The corporate tax in Slovakia stood at 22% for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxnewsflash/pages/2014-1/slovakia-reduced-corporate-income-tax-rate-affects-advance-payments.aspx|title = KPMG|date = Corporate tax rate 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resident companies are those which have their legal seat or place of effective management in the Slovak Republic.

== Tax reform after the Soviet era ==
The time after the collapse of the soviet, a long range of range of reforms have been made, to bring the country from a government run economy to a free market economy. A large tax reform was enacted in the year 2003. It included a long range of reforms including abolishing most deductions on the income tax, and bringing it down to a flat rate of 19% instead of a progressive rate from 10% to 38%. The corporate tax fell from 25% to 19%. Furthermore, the two rates of VAT 14% and 20% were merged into one band of 19%. All inheritance and gift taxes was also abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://visegradrevue.eu/?p=1214|title = Visegradrevue|date = Tax reform Slovakia|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Road tax and toll ==
{{Update|Road tax and toll|date=July 2016}}Road tax and toll payment in Slovakia is compulsory. These are paid for with vignettes, purchased for between one week to one year periods. Cost is determined by the weight of the vehicle. Additional costs are incurred for trailers attached to vehicles.

=== Vehicles below 3.5 tons ===
Persons travelling on a highway or speedway in Slovakia with a vehicle with maximum permissible total weight below 3.5 tons, are obliged to pay [[road tax]] by buying vignette. There is a traffic sign on each border crossing informing about this obligation but no further reference within the country.

==== Types of vignettes ====
On 1 December 2015 the Slovak Republic commissioned the '''electronic system of vignette payment collection and records''' (hereinafter referred to only as the “electronic vignette system”) '''for the use of the specified sections of motorways and expressways''' (hereinafter referred to as the "specified road sections"). Switching the system of vignette payment collection and records into electronic form meant a change in the vignette form - the physical motorway stickers were replaced by vignettes in electronic form.

Currently, there are 3 types of electronic vignettes:
*1-year vignette - valid from 1 January of the relevant calendar year (or the day of payment for the vignette by the customer in the relevant calendar year) until 31 January of the following calendar year
*30-day vignette - valid for 30 days (including the day of starting date) from the date specified by the customer
*10-day vignette - valid for 10 days (including the day of starting date) from the date specified by the customer

If a [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] category O1 or O2 is attached (to a [[tractor]] vehicle within the vehicle categories M1, N1 or N1G, and the maximum permissible weight of the vehicle and trailer exceed 3.5 tons, drivers have to buy additional vignette for heavy vehicle combinations.

==== Prices ====
From 2015 the prices (including [[VAT]]) are the following:
* 1-year vignette - EUR 50
* 30-day vignette - EUR 14
* 10-day vignette - EUR 10

=== Vehicles over 3.5 tons ===
Since January 1, 2010 all vehicles above 3.5 tons maximum permissible total weight (including [[bus]]ses) must pay electronic toll when driving in Slovakia. Information about this obligation is stated by a traffic sign on each border crossing. Generally all main corridors (national roads) and highways are toll liable. A company named SkyToll A.S., runs a system based on a combination of [[GPS]], [[GSM]] and [[DSRC]] technology. Each driver has to stop at one of the distribution points located on each border crossing used by heavy traffic and register the vehicle. The driver obtains an electronic on-board unit.

'''''The Nature of the Judicial Process''''' is a legal classic written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]], and [[New York Court of Appeals]] [[Chief Justice]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in 1921.  It was compiled from [[The Storrs Lectures]] delivered at [[Yale Law School]] earlier that year.

==Summary==

The central question of ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' is how judges should decide cases. Cardozo’s answer is that judges should do what they have always done in the Anglo-American legal tradition, namely, follow and apply the law in easy cases, and make new law in hard cases by balancing competing considerations, including the paramount value of social welfare. Cardozo identifies four leading methods of legal analysis: (1) the method of logic (or “analogy,” or “philosophy”), which seeks to extend legal principles in ways that preserve logical consistency; (2) the method of history (or “evolution”), which adverts to the historical origins of the legal rule or concept; (3) the method of custom (or “tradition”), which views social customs as helpful guides to community values and settled expectations; and (4) the method of sociology, which looks to considerations of reason, justice, utility, and social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921, pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods may have their “preponderating value”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular cases. No simple test or rigid formula can decide which method should prevail in a given case.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; But in difficult cases where a legal rule is outmoded or the law contains “gaps” that must be filled, judges should frankly play the role of legislators and let “the welfare of society fix the path.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardozo admits that there are risks in judicial lawmaking. To minimize these, he points to a number of factors that significantly limit judicial discretion. First, judges may make new law only “interstitially,” that is, when the law contains gaps or a legal rule is clearly obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, judges in their exercise of judicial review should never strike down a law unless it is “so plainly arbitrary and oppressive that right-minded men and women could not reasonably regard”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; it otherwise. Finally, when judges invoke norms such as “reason,” “justice,” or “social advantage” when employing the method of sociology, they should look to community standards rather than to their own personal values.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-American system of law, Cardozo remarks, a judge “is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final balance, a judge’s freedom to innovate is insignificant “compared with the bulk and pressure of the rules that hedge him on every side.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 136-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In claiming that judges do and must make law, Cardozo was siding with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and other American “proto-realists” of his day who were challenging the traditional “oracular” or “mechanical” or “formalist” view of judicial reasoning. On that view, judges never make law, they simply discover pre-existing law and apply it. According to strict formalists, there are no hard cases where the law is silent, or ambiguous, or vague, or contradictory, or couched in broad generalities. Rather, the law is clear, consistent, and complete; all legal questions have a single correct answer; and judges are (in Blackstone's phrase) “living oracles” who deduce inexorable legal conclusions from indisputable legal axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Samuel Summers, ''Instrumentalism and American Legal Theory''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 138-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism was not Cardozo’s only target in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. He also attacked radical critics of formalism, such as John Chipman Gray, who claimed that judges have immense freedom and rejected the very idea of law as a set of binding rules. Gray and other proto-realists of the time tried to demystify law and view it with hard-headed pragmatism. They argued that since judges are the ultimate arbiters of law, “law” in the final analysis is whatever judges say it is (or what they predictably will say it is in the future). Cardozo argued that this isn’t an “analysis” of law, but a denial that any true law exists. The proto-realists confuse right with power. Judges may have the power to ignore settle legal standards, but they do not have the right. Moreover, the attempt to identify law with judicial rulings ignores the fact that the great majority of legal questions have clear, uncontroversial answers that guide everyday conduct and are never litigated in courts.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' established Cardozo “as one of the leading jurists of his time”&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward White, ''The American Judicial tradition: Profiles of Leading American Judges.'' Expanded ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; and “has become a classic of legal education."&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Its continuing appeal is due, in part, to its self-effacing tone, its lapidary prose, and its attempt to strike a happy medium between legal formalism and radical realist theories that wholly reject traditional views of law, legal reasoning, judicial restraint, and the rule of law.

The great success of Cardozo’s ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' created demand for further reflections on the law.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In two later works, ''The Growth of Law'' (1924) and ''The Paradoxes of Legal Science'' (1927), Cardozo refined, deepened, and to some extent modified the views of law laid out in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''.

==Notable quotations==

* The great generalities of the constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age. (17)

* Nothing is stable. Nothing absolute. All is fluid and changeable. There is an endless “becoming.” We are back with Heraclitus. (28)

* The final cause of law is the welfare of society. (66)

* A constitution states or ought to state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future. (83)

* The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders. (92)

* The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. (141)

* We shall have to feel our way here as elsewhere in the law. Somewhere between worship of the past and exaltation of the present, the path of safety will be found. (160)

* I was much troubled in spirit, in my first years upon the bench, to find how trackless was the ocean on which I had embarked. I sought for certainty. I was oppressed and disheartened when I found that the quest for it was futile. I was trying to reach land, the solid land of fixed and settled rules, the paradise of a justice that would declare itself by tokens plainer and more commanding than its pale and glimmering reflections in my own vacillating mind and conscience. (166)

* The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by. (168)

* The future . . . is yours. We have been called to do our parts in an ageless process. Long after I am dead and gone, and my little part in it is forgotten, you will be here to do your share, and to carry the torch forward. I know that the flame will burn bright while the torch is in your keeping. (179-80)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">[[File:Tilden Company New Lebanon, NY.jpg|thumb|1856 advertisement for the Tilden Company, maker of Tilden's Extract.]]

'''Tilden's Extract''' was a 19th-century [[Medical cannabis|medicinal cannabis]] extract, first formulated by [[James Edward Smith]] of Edinburgh.

In the [[United States]], the Tilden Company of [[New Lebanon, New York]], manufactured and sold the extract under its own name, advertising the drug as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Phrenic]], [[anæsthetic]], [[anti-spasmodic]] and hypnotic. Unlike [[opium]], it does not constipate the [[bowel]]s, lessen the appetite, create [[nausea]], produce dryness of the tongue, check pulmonary secretions or produce headache. Used with success in [[hysteria]], [[chorea]], [[gout]], [[neuralgia]], acute and sub-acute [[rheumatism]], [[tetanus]], [[rabies|hydrophobia]] and the like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Tilden Company was the family [[business]] of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] and [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 Democratic nominee]] for President [[Samuel J. Tilden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mason |first= William Cornell |date= 1876 |title= The Life of Hon. Samuel Jones Tilden, Governor of the State of New York: With a Sketch of the Life of Hon. Thomas Andrews Hendricks, Governor of the State of Indiana |url= https://archive.org/stream/lifeofhonsamuelj00corn#page/20/mode/2up |location= Boston, MA |publisher= Lee &amp; Shepard |page= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American author [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] used Tilden's Extract recreationally, and wrote the book ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]'' (1857) about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, F.H. ''The Hasheesh Eater'' (1857)&lt;/ref&gt;

O.J. Kalant estimated the strength of the extract and of Ludlow's doses as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ludlow consistently talked of "hasheesh" but in fact he took the solid extract of Cannabis Indica which was roughly twice as potent as the crude resin and ten times as potent as marijuana. A rough calculation shows that his intake was equivalent to about 6 or 7 [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] cigarettes per dose, i.e. at the hallucinatory rather than at the euphoriant level prevalent in contemporary North American use.&lt;ref&gt;
Kalant, O.J. "Ludlow on Cannabis: A Modern Look at a Nineteenth Century Drug Experience". ''The International Journal of the Addictions'', June 1971
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ludlow wrote of taking as much as a [[drachm]] of the extract (3.9&amp;nbsp;grams or 0.14 ounces) in his largest doses — if Kalant's figures are correct, this would equate to a quarter-ounce of resin or well over an ounce of herbal cannabis.

}}The '''Travel Promotion Act of 2009''' ({{USPL|111|145}}, Sec. 9) is a law creating the '''Corporation for Travel Promotion''', a [[public-private partnership]] tasked with promoting tourism in the [[United States]]. To fund the Corporation's activities, the Act provides for a fee of $10 for use of the [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization]] (ESTA). Additionally, the Act authorizes a further charge to recover the costs of providing and administrating the ESTA.

The [[United States House of Representatives|House]] passed the bill by a vote of 358–66 in October 2009, and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] followed on February 25, 2010 with a vote of 78–18.

{{Politics of Turkey}}

The '''Constitution of 1921''' ([[Ottoman language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''Teşkilât-ı Esasiye Kanunu''; {{lang-tr|1921 Türk Anayasası}}) was the [[constitution|fundamental law]] of [[Turkey]] for a brief period from 1921 to 1924. The first constitution of the modern Turkish state, it was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] in January 1921. It was a simple document consisting of only 23 short articles. In October 1923 the constitution was amended to declare Turkey to be a [[republic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/about_tgna.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In April the following year the constitution was replaced by an entirely new document, the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|Constitution of 1924]].

==Background==
{{See also|Establishment of Turkish national movement}}
It was prepared by the Grand National Assembly that was elected both as a Constitutional Convention and as an acting [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] on April 23, 1920, following the de facto collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the aftermath of the [[World War I|First World War]]. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who would later become the first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, was the major driving force behind the preparation of a Constitution that derived its [[sovereignty]] from the nation and not from the [[Sultan]], the absolute [[monarch]] of the Ottoman Empire. The National Assembly convened with the purpose of writing a would prepare the ground for the proclamation of a Republic and consecrate the principle of [[national sovereignty]]. This Constitution would also serve as the legal basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] during 1919-1923, since it would refute the principles of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1918 signed by the Ottoman Empire, by which a great majority of the Empire's territory would have to be ceded to the [[Entente powers]] that had won the First World War.

==Overview==
{{See also|Atatürk's Reforms}}
The National Assembly commenced the debates for a new constitution on November 19, 1920 and it was ratified during the session of January 20, 1921. It was the first Turkish Constitution that consecrated the principle of national sovereignty.

It was a relatively short text consisting of twenty-three articles, the first nine articles laying out the principles upon which the state would be founded. It delegated the [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]] prerogatives to "the only true delegate of the sovereignty of the Nation", the National Assembly that was to be elected by direct popular vote. After the proclamation of the Republic on October 29, 1923, the executive powers were to be exercised by the President and the Council of Ministers on behalf of the National Assembly.

Because of the larger geopolitical conjecture of the time and the lack of a formal declaration of a republic, it failed to mention anything about the role the Sultan might play under this new constitution. From a technical point of view, it could be argued that it left open the possibility that the Sultanate might not be abolished and that it could have been amended to make way for a [[constitutional monarchy]], similar to one founded by the [[French Constitution of 1791]]. On hindsight, however, it is clear that this omission was on purpose awaiting the outcome of the [[Turkish Independence War|Independence War]] and the cessation of hostilities before the proclamation of the Republic.

It also didn't include any references to the judicial system for similar reasons, nor did it define the rights and responsibilities of citizens.

==Timeline==
After having come into force on January 20, 1921, it stayed as the law of the land for three years until the adoption of the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|Constitution of 1924]]. During this time it witnessed many extremely important and fundamental events in the history of the Republic of Turkey:
*The [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won by the Turkish forces
*The Ottoman Sultanate and all aristocratic titles were abolished on November 1, 1922
*The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] that led to the international recognition of the new Republic was signed between Turkey and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] that had won the First World War on July 24, 1923
*The [[Republic of Turkey|Republic]] was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923 with Atatürk as its first President
*The title of the [[Caliphate]] that was held by the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman Sultans]] since 1517 was abolished on March 3, 1924, along with all the remaining vestiges of [[Islamic Law]]. (Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the National Assembly and the title has since been inactive. Though very unlikely, the Turkish Republic still retains the right to reinstate the Caliphate.)
*Per the law of March 3, 1924, the last Ottoman Sultan, the last [[Caliph]] and all members of their imperial families had their citizenships revoked, were exiled forever from the new Republic and their descendants banned from ever setting foot in its territory. The same law also nationalized all the properties of the Imperial Crown without compensation.

==Text (as enacted)==
The text of the first nine articles may be translated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~genckaya/1921C.html Unauthorized translation, November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
*'''Article 1:''' Sovereignty is vested in the nation without condition. The governmental system is based on the principle of self-determination and government by the people.
*'''Article 2:''' Executive power and legislative responsibility is exercised by and concentrated in the hands of the Grand National Assembly which is the sole and real representative of the nation.
*'''Article 3:''' The Turkish State is governed by the Grand National Assembly (''Büyük Millet Meclisi'') and its government is entitled 'the Government of Grand National Assembly' (''Büyük Millet Meclisi Hükûmeti'').
*'''Article 4:''' The Grand National Assembly is composed of members who are elected by the people of the provinces.
*'''Article 5:''' Elections to the Grand National Assembly are held every two years. The duration of membership is limited to two years but re-election of a member is possible.  The former assembly remains in office until the new assembly convenes. When holding a new election seems to be impossible the legislative period can be extended by only one year. Each member of the Grand National Assembly is not only a representative of the province by which he is elected but of the whole nation.
*'''Article 6:''' The General Assembly of the Grand National Assembly convenes of its own accord on the first day of November.
*'''Article 7:''' The basic rights of the application of the ordinances of the sacred law; the promulgation, amendment, and abrogation of all laws; the concluding of treaties and peace; the promulgation of the defence of the fatherland (i.e., the declaration of war) belong to the Grand National Assembly. The preparation of laws and regulations will be guided by juridical and religious provisions, which best conform to the ''modus operandi'' of the people and the needs of the times, as well as established customs. The functions and responsibilities of the Council of Ministers shall be fixed by a special law.
*'''Article 8:''' The government of the Grand National Assembly exercises the executive function through ministers who are elected according to its special law. The Grand National Assembly directs the ministers on executive affairs and changes them when necessary.
*'''Article 9:''' The Head of the Grand National Assembly who is elected by the General Assembly is the Head of the Grand National Assembly  for one electoral period. With this status, he is entitled to sign on behalf of the Assembly and to approve the decisions of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers elects one member from among its number as the head of the Council of Ministers. However, the Head of the Grand National Assembly is the natural head of the Council of Ministers.}}

Article 10 is headed ''Administration''. Articles 11 to 21 concern local government units. These subdivisions are called ''[[Vilâyet]]'' (Art. 11-14), ''[[qadaa|Kaza]]'' (Art. 15) and ''[[Nahiye]]'' (Art. 16-21). Articles 22 to 23 provide for the General Inspectorate (''Umumi Müfettişlik''). There is also a final provisional article, which is unnumbered.

[[File:Pavel Durov 26years.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pavel Durov]], the founder of VKontakte, on his 26th birthday, 10 October 2010.]]

===2006–2008: Launch and rapid growth===

VKontakte was incorporated on 19 January 2007 as a Russian [[limited liability company]]. Founder [[Pavel Durov]] launched VKontakte for beta testing in September 2006, shortly after his graduation from [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg State University]]. The following month, the domain name ''vkontakte.ru'' was registered. User registration was initially limited to within university circles exclusively by invitation, but the site still grew quickly.

In February 2007 the site reached a user base of over 100,000 and was recognized as the second largest company in Russia's nascent social network market. In the same month, the site was subjected to a severe [[DDoS]] attack, which briefly put it offline. The user base reached 1 million in July 2007, and 10 million in April 2008. In December 2008 VK overtook rival [[Odnoklassniki]] as Russia's most popular social networking service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/fi/blog_posts/vkontakte-remains-more-popular-than-facebook-in-russia-26403|title=Vkontakte Remains more popular than Facebook in Russia|work=Mynewsdesk|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2012: Public access===

Founder and CEO Pavel Durov owned 20% of shares (although he had majority voting power through proxy votes), and a trio of Russian-Israeli investors, Vyacheslav Mirilashvili ([[Mikhael Mirilashvili]]'s son)  and [[Lev Binzumovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000837139&amp;fid=1725 |title=Lev Leviev sells Russian social network stake |publisher=Globes |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned 60%, 10%, and 10% respectively.&lt;ref name="owners"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ru:Кто в контакте | url        = http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/142644/ | publisher  = Vedomosti | date       = 2008-02-29  | accessdate = 2011-04-16 |language    = Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original founders then sold a stake of 39.99% to [[Mail.ru]] Group (formerly [[Digital Sky Technologies]]).&lt;ref name="dstownsvk"&gt;{{cite web | title = Exercise of Option | url = http://corp.mail.ru/en/IR/news/1125 | publisher = Mail.ru Group | date = 2011-07-14 | accessdate = 2011-07-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006195703/http://corp.mail.ru/en/IR/news/1125 | archivedate = 2011-10-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title      = Vkontakte.ru shareholder structure unveiled | url        = http://www.ewdn.com/2011/08/06/vkontakte-ru-shareholder-structure-unveiled | publisher  = East-West Digital News | date       = 2011-08-06 | accessdate = 2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2012, Mail.ru Group announced that it has decided to yield control of the company to Durov by offering him the voting rights on its shares. Combined with Durov's personal 12% stake, this gave him 52% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shareholder Mail.ru Group yields control to founder|url=http://www.ewdn.com/2012/05/30/vkontaktes-ipo-postponed-indefinitely-shareholder-mail-ru-group-yields-control-to-founder/|accessdate=2012-05-30|publisher=ewdn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipovotes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia's VKontakte delays IPO after Facebook debacle|date=29 May 2012|first=John|last=Bowker|publisher=Reuters|location=Moscow |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/29/net-us-russia-internet-idUSBRE84S0LE20120529|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–present: Share changes, IPO cancellation, Mail.ru Group ownership===

In April 2013, the [[Mikhael Mirilashvili|Mirilashvili family]] sold its 40% share in VK to United Capital Partners for $1.12 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.527800 |title=The richest Israelis got NIS 10 billion richer in 2013 |publisher=Haaretz.com |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=410768 | title = UCP closes deal to buy 48% of Vkontakte from Mirilashvili, Leviev | newspaper = interfax }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lev Binzumovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]] sold his 8% share in the same deal, giving United Capital Partners 48% ownership. In January 2014, VK's founder Pavel Durov sold his 12% stake in the company to Ivan Tavrin, the CEO of [[MegaFon]], which is controlled by [[Alisher Usmanov]]. Following the deal, Usmanov and his allies controlled around 52% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usmanov tightens hold on Russian social net VKontakte as founder sells stake|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/technology/a/21024349/usmanov-tightens-hold-on-russian-social-net-vkontakte-as-founder-sells-stake/|publisher=The West Australian (Reuters)|accessdate=18 February 2014|author=Maria Kiselyova}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the CEO of Megafon, sold his 12% stake to Mail.ru, thus allowing mail.ru to consolidate its controlling stake of 52% in VK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail.Ru Secures Control of VKontakte|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304747404579446634205590924|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 March 2014|author=Olga Razumovskaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Ukrainian President [[Petro Poroshenko]] signed a decree to impose a ban on Mail.ru and its widely used social networks including VKontakte and [[Odnoklassniki]] as part of its continued sanctions on Russia for its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] and involvement in the [[War in Donbass]].&lt;ref name=UbRwM17&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39934666 Ukraine's Poroshenko to block Russian social networks], [[BBC News]] (16 May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poroshenko170515&gt;{{cite web | last = Poroshenko | first = Petro | author-link = Petro Poroshenko | title = УКАЗ ПРЕЗИДЕНТА УКРАЇНИ №133/2017: Про рішення Ради національної безпеки і оборони України від 28 квітня 2017 року "Про застосування персональних спеціальних економічних та інших обмежувальних заходів (санкцій)" | url = https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/1332017-21850 | language = Ukrainian | trans-title = DECREE OF THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE №133 / 2017: On the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine dated April 28, 2017 "On the application of personal special economic and other restrictive measures (sanctions)" | publisher = President of Ukraine | date = May 15, 2017 | access-date = March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UkraineSanctionsEntityList&gt;{{cite web | title = Додаток 2 до рішення Ради національної безпеки і оборони України від «28» квітня 2017 року «Про застосування персональних спеціальних економічних та інших обмежувальних заходів (санкцій)» ЮРИДИЧНІ ОСОБИ, до яких застосовуються обмежувальні заходи (санкції) | url = https://www.president.gov.ua/storage/j-files-storage/00/40/38/6f76b8df9d0716da74bb4ae6a900d483_1494964345.pdf | language = Ukrainian | trans-title = Annex 2 to the Decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine dated April 28, 2017 "On the Application of Personal special economic and other restrictive measures (sanctions) "Legal Entities under Restrictive Measures (Sanctions)" | publisher = President of Ukraine | page = 185-6 (#422 mail.ru Group), 186-7 (#423 ТОВ «Вконтакте» (VKontakte)), 187-8 (#424 ТОВ «В Контакті» (In Kontakte)) &amp; 189 (#425 mail.ru Ukraine).

==Website==
[[File:Vkontakte.png|thumb|VK logo before 2015]]
As with most social networks, the site's core functionality is based around private messaging and sharing photos, status updates and links with friends. VK also has tools for managing online communities and celebrity pages. The site allows its users to upload, search and stream media content, such as videos and music. VK features an advanced search engine, that allows complex queries for finding friends, as well as a real-time news search. VK updated its features and design on April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbgadget.com/2016/08/vkcom-new-interface.html|title=VK.com New Interface, Design, Looks &amp; Tips|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===

* '''Messaging'''. VK Private Messages can be exchanged between groups of 2 to 500 people. An email address can also be specified as the recipient. Each message may contain up to 10 attachments: Photos, Videos, Audio Files, Maps (an embedded map with a manually placed marker), and Documents.&lt;ref&gt;Supported are the formats: doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt , pptx, rtf, pdf, png, jpg, gif, psd, mp3, djvu, fb2, ps and archives containing these formats. Executable files and files over 200 Mb are not allowed.Video chat is also available (for users who allow incoming calls ) since 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''News'''. VK users can post on their profile walls, each post may contain up to 10 attachments – media files, maps, and documents (see above). User mentions and hashtags are supported. In case of multiple photo-attachments the previews are automatically scaled and arranged in a magazine-style layout. The news feed can be switched between ''all news'' (default) and ''most interesting'' modes. The site features a news-recommendation engine, global real-time search and individual search for posts and comments on specific users' walls.
* '''Communities'''. VK features three types of communities. ''Groups'' are better suited for decentralised communities (discussion-boards, wiki-style articles, editable by all members, etc.). ''Public pages'' is a news feed orientated broadcasting tool for celebrities and businesses. The two types are largely interchangeable, the main difference being in the default settings. The third type of community is called ''Events'', which are used for organizing concerts and events in an appropriate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vk.com/pages?oid=-59800369&amp;p=%D0%92%D1%8B%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80_%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0|title=Types of community pages|last=|first=|date=|website=vk.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2017, according to [[Alexa Internet]] ranking, VK is one of the most visited websites in some Eurasian countries. It is:

* The most visited in [[Russia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/RU | title= Alexa - top sites in Russia|publisher=Alexa.com | accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the fourth most viewed site in Ukraine until, in May 2017, the Ukrainian government banned the use of VK in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=UbRwM17/&gt; According to a study for May 2018 conducted by [[Factum Group Ukraine]] VK remained the fourth most viewed site in Ukraine, but [[Facebook]] was twice as much visited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/511662.html Banned VK social network remains fourth in Internet traffic in Ukraine in May], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (13 June 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
As of May 2018 the site is available in 86 languages, while advertisements are only shown in the Russian and Ukrainian versions. Russian-speaking users can choose between the standard Russian version and two extras: a Soviet version and a [[Russian Revolution|Pre-Revolutionary]] version. Other than language tweaks (e.g. ''telegrams'' for messages and ''comrades'' for friends), these versions contain other easter eggs. For example, all private messages in the Soviet version have a stamp saying 'passed server censorship'. The pre-revolutionary version uses [[Reforms of Russian orthography|old-style Russian orthography]]. Both extra versions are also ad-free.

===Promotional use by bands and musicians===

Musicians that use VK for promotion often upload their own tracks to their official VK pages. Notable examples include the international celebrities like [[Tiësto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJ Tiesto's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/tiesto|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakira]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shakira's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/shakira|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul van Dyk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Van Dyk's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/paulvandyk|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Prodigy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prodigy official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/theprodigy|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Balan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Balan's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/danbalan|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014094950/http://vk.com/danbalan|archivedate=14 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vk.com/pages?oid=-2158488&amp;p=Известные_люди_ВКонтакте |accessdate=January 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031031603/http://vk.com/pages?oid=-2158488&amp;p=%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B4%D0%B8_%D0%92%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B5 |archivedate=October 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Limp Bizkit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wall|url = https://vk.com/wall-22822305_126428|website = vk.com|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eros Ramazzotti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eros Ramazzotti's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/eros.ramazzotti.official|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilyn Manson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marilyn Manson's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/id254319901|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moby's official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/public44064378|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Offspring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Offspring official page on VK.com|url=http://vk.com/offspring|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and controversies==
[[File:Singer House in Saint Petersburg at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|The headquarters of VK on the [[Nevsky Avenue]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] (aka [[Singer House]])]]

===Copyright issues===

====Litigation====
In 2008, the leading Russian television channel TV Russia (tvchannel name RTR used in 1991-2002 years) (then Russia 1) and television company VGTRK sued VKontakte (then VK) over unlicensed copies of two of its films which had been uploaded by VK users. In 2010, this dispute was settled by the Russian Supreme Arbitration Court in favour of the social network. The court ruled that VK is not responsible for its users’ copyright violations, taking into account that both parties agreed with the technical possibility to identify the user who posted illegal content and who, consequently, must incur the liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court rules social network not responsible for user copyright violations|url=http://www.ewdn.com/2011/03/16/russian-court-rules-social-network-not-responsible-for-user-copyright-violations/|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=ewdn.com|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ruling early in 2012 went partially in favor of [[Warner Music Group|Gala Records (now Warner Music Russia)]], a recording studio, when the same court ordered VK to pay $7000 for not being active enough in regard to copyrighted materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vkontakte.ru too "passive" with copyright infringement, says arbitration court|url=http://www.ewdn.com/2012/02/22/vkontakte-ru-too-passive-with-copyright-infringement-says-arbitration-court/|newspaper=ewdn.com|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Efforts against copyright infringement====
VK offers a content removal tool for copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vk.com/dmca |title=Copyright Violation Notification |publisher=Vk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artistic-license.org/takedowns/vk-com-takedown-process/|title=VK.com TakeDown Process {{!}} Artistic License|work=Artistic License|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale copyright holders may gain access to bulk content removal tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TNT removes its videos from Vkontakte|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/11/10/tnt/|newspaper=Lenta.ru|date=10 November 2010|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, VK has also entered several partnerships with legal content providers such as television networks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CTC Media clamps down on piracy|url=http://www.ewdn.com/2011/06/20/ctc-media-clamps-down-on-piracy/|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=ewdn.com|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and streaming providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vkontakte to replace pirated video with legal content|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/11/25/video/|newspaper=Lenta.ru|date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the Video on Demand provider IVI.ru that has secured licensing rights with all of Hollywood majors in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Online Video Service ivi.ru Inks Deals with Hollywood Majors|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/russian-online-video-service-iviru-317483|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These partnerships allow providers to remove user-uploaded content from VK and substitute it with legal embedded copies from the provider's site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Oleg Tumanov, Ivi.ru CEO|url=http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2012/05/14/media/562949983821661|newspaper=RBC Daily|date=14 May 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legal content can be either ad-sponsored, subscription based, or free, depending on the provider's choices. VK does not display its own advertising in the site's music or video sections, nor in the videos themselves. On October 2013, VKontakte was cleared of copyright infringement charges by a court in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The judge ruled that the social network is not responsible for the content uploaded by its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy |url=https://torrentfreak.com/russian-facebook-not-responsible-for-users-pirate-music-uploads-131026/ |title=Russian Facebook Not Responsible For Users’ Pirate Music Uploads |publisher=Torrentfreak.com |date=2013-10-26 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the head of The Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, [[Maxim Ksenzov]], said that Vkontakte will complete the process of legalization of the content at the beginning of 2015. At that time (November, 2014), negotiations between major labels companies and the social network Vkontakte were ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macdigger.ru/macall/vkontakte-udalit-ves-piratskij-kontent-v-nachale-2015-goda.html |title="ВКонтакте" удалит весь пиратский контент в начале 2015 года &amp;#124; MacDigger - Новости из мира Apple |publisher=Macdigger.ru |date=2014-11-20 |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DDoS attacks on sites ===
Because the social network is the one most popular and highloaded sites in [[runet]], its visits can be used to make DDoS attacks on smaller sites.
VK performed [[DDOS attack]]s on certain sites, making users' browsers send multiple requests to the target site without their consent. The targets were the [[Runet Prize]] voting page in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://habrahabr.ru/post/43171|title=ВКонтакте против "Премии рунета"|publisher=Habrahabr.ru|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[CAPTCHA]]-solving service antigate.com in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitylab.ru/news/423743.php|title="ÂÊîíòàêòå" îñóùåñòâèë DDoS àòàêó íà ñàéò antigate.com|date=26 April 2012|publisher=Securitylab.ru|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://habrahabr.ru/post/142836|title=ВКонтакте ддосит antigate.com|publisher=Habrahabr.ru|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was done by inserting an iframe and a piece of JavaScript code which periodically reloaded the iframe. As a countermeasure, antigate was detecting whether iframe was loaded from VK and if it were antigate had redirected request to [[xHamster]], a [[Internet pornography|pornography website]]. VK needed to cease the attack due to the site's use by children. VK tried to use [[XMLHttpRequest]] to solve this problem, but had forgotten about the [[same-origin policy]]. They succeeded in stopping the attack, though there were many ways to solve the problem with redirect{{Original research inline|date=March 2018}}.

===Blacklisted===
On 24 May 2013, it was reported in the media that the site had been mistakenly put on a list of websites banned by the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22651973 |title=Error blacklists Russia's top social network VKontakte |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have accused the blacklist of being simply the latest in a series of suspicious incidents to have happened to the website in recent months, as the Russian government look to increase their stake in, and control of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balmforth |first=Tom |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-vkontakte-under-fire/24999478.html |title=Russia's Top Social Network Under Fire |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2013-05-28 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian controversy===
On 18 November 2013, following an order from the Court of [[Rome]], VK was blocked in [[Italy]] after a complaint from Medusa Film stating that it was hosting an illegal copy of one of its films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-Berlusconi-s-Company-Blocked-Off-vKontakte-and-File-Hosting-Sites-in-Italy-401518.shtml |title=How Berlusconi's Company Blocked Off vKontakte and File-Hosting Sites in Italy |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of April 2015, the site has been reopened for Italian users and its mobile app is available on both [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]].

===Founder Pavel Durov's dismissal===
Founder [[Pavel Durov]] was dismissed as CEO in April 2014 after he had failed to retract a (according to himself) prank [[April fools]] letter of resignation.&lt;ref name=DurovMT22414/&gt; Durov then claimed the company had been effectively taken over by [[Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin's]] allies&lt;ref name=DurovMT22414/&gt;&lt;ref name=DurovTI22414&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-04-22/news/49318882_1_social-network-vkontakte-pavel-durov-founder-mark-zuckerberg |title=Pavel Durov left Russia after being pushed out|accessdate=April 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424024304/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-04-22/news/49318882_1_social-network-vkontakte-pavel-durov-founder-mark-zuckerberg |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toor |first=Amar |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/22/5638980/russias-largest-social-network-is-under-the-control-of-putins-allies |title=Russia's largest social network is under the control of Putin's allies, founder says |publisher=The Verge |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested his ousting was the result of his refusal to hand over personal details of users to the [[Russian Federal Security Service]] and his refusal to shut down a VK group dedicated to anti-corruption activist [[Alexei Navalny]].&lt;ref name=DurovMT22414/&gt;&lt;ref name=DurovTI22414/&gt;

=== China Controversy ===
In January 2016, [[China]] banned VKontakte, accusing that it was manipulating web content and cooperating with the Kremlin. According to Russia's [[media watchdog]], the network estimates around 300,000 users based in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russia-media-watchdog-boasts-it-convinced-china-to-lift-vkontakte-ban-60523|title=Russia's Media Watchdog Boasts It 'Convinced' China to Lift Vkontakte Ban|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 14 February 2018, China authorities unblocked VKontakte and it was fully [[accessible]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.com/society/990009|title=China unblocks Russian social network VKontakte|work=TASS|access-date=2018-03-09|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and projects ==

=== Hackathons ===
VK organized their first 24-hour [[Hackathon]] in 2015 from 31 October to 1 November. The participants were invited to develop projects united by a common idea: “Make it Simple!” (Russian: «Упрощайте!»). 34 teams took part in the competition. A prize pool of 300 thousand rubles was split among the winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vc.ru/social/11462-vk-hackaton-fin|title=Фоторепортаж: Первый хакатон «ВКонтакте» — Соцсети на vc.ru|last=Kontsarenko|first=Philipp|date=2015-11-02|work=vc.ru|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second VK Hackathon took place from 26 November to 27 November 2016. The participants developed projects for the community app platform. The “Search for Lost Cats” (Russian: «Поиск пропавших котиков») app won the “Developers’ Choice” category. The prize pool for the event was 300 thousand rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/shapito/2016/11/28/poisk-propavshih-kotikov-prilozhenie-kotoroe-ischet-poteryavshihsya-zhivotnyh-s-pomoschyu-neyrosetey|title=«Поиск пропавших котиков»: приложение, которое ищет потерявшихся животных с помощью нейросетей — Meduza|work=Meduza|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third VK Hackathon took place from 20 October to 22 October 2017 with 320 participants competing in the event. The prize pool was one million rubles. An application designed to help users navigate the State Hermitage Museum won the “Culture” category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperpaper.ru/papernews/2017/10/23/hackathon/|title=На Хакатоне «ВКонтакте» победили авторы приложения, помогающего выбрать маршрут в Эрмитаже|date=2017-10-23|work=«Бумага»|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Start Fellows ===
In 2011, Pavel Durov and [[Yuri Milner]] created Start Fellows, a grant program founded to support projects in the field of technology. In 2014, VK took over the Start Fellows program and made it more systematic. The grant was provided to 3 companies each month and included project consultation from VK along with 25 thousand rubles a month for advertisement on the VK platform. Winners of the grant include “University Schedules” (Russian: «Расписание вузов»), a scheduling app, LiveCamDroid, a mobile streaming service, HTML Academy, an educational project, and others.

VK re-launched the project in 2017. Only active projects with an earnings model could submit applications. 327 grant applications were received buy only 67 of them passed the initial screening. The total prize pool was 2.5 million rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ferra.ru/ru/techlife/news/2017/12/04/vk-start-fellows-2017/|title=Победители Start Fellows получили 2,5 млн рублей от ВКонтакте|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VK Music Awards ===
The first VK Music Awards ceremony took place on 25 December 2017. The VK Music Awards were produced by [[Timur Bekmambetov]] and the [[Bazelevs Company]] with [[Pavel Volya]] hosting the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.intermedia.ru/news/318143|title=«ВКонтакте» завершит год вручением своей первой музыкальной премии|date=2017-12-15|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards ceremony was held in the form of an online live stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://regnum.ru/news/2362173.html|title=Названы победители премии VK Music Awards|work=ИА REGNUM|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any VK user could watch the broadcast live. After the ceremony, a private concert was held in the Vegas City Hall in Moscow. Tickets to the event could be won through a contest held in the VK Music community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://regnum.ru/news/2362173.html|title=Названы победители премии VK Music Awards|work=ИА REGNUM|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; VK Music Awards winners were determined by the number of plays an artist’s song got on VK and the BOOM app. The names of the 30 award winners were published on the official VK Music Awards community page and on the BOOM app website. “Rosé Wine” (Allj and Feduk), “Lambada” (T-Fest and Scriptonite), and “My Half” (MiyaGi and Endspiel) topped the list of most listened to songs. The official pages of all award winners have been marked with a special symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://the-flow.ru/news/vk-music-awards|title=В Москве прошла премия VK Music Awards.

=== VK Fest ===
Since 2015, VK has held a yearly 2-day open-air music and entertainment festival. This festival traditionally takes place on a weekend in July at the 300th Anniversary Park (Russian: Парк имени 300-летия Санкт-Петербурга) in St. Petersburg, Russia. According to data from the organizer, 70 thousand people attended the festival in 2016, with the number rising to 85 thousand attendees in 2017. In 2017, around 40 artists and groups performed on 3 stages, including [[Little Big (band)|Little Big]], The Hatters, and others. Bloggers and other famous individuals, such as [[Dmitry Grishin]], [[Timur Bekmambetov]], and [[Mikhail Piotrovsky]] (speakers at the 2017 festival), are also an important part of the festival. More than 1.5 million people watched the festival’s official live stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rg.ru/2017/07/14/reg-szfo/v-peterburge-na-vyhodnyh-projdet-tretij-vk-fest.html|title=В Петербурге на выходных пройдет третий VK Fest|date=2017-07-14|work=Российская газета|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charitable Works ===
For many years, VK has paid special attention to charity work. A stylized image of a dog with a scar, the symbol of the website, was drawn by Pavel Durov in 2011 for a charity auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya-opinion/lyudi/212150-kod-pavla-durova-pyat-istorii-iz-zhizni-vkontakte-i-ee-sozdatelya|title=Код Павла Дурова: пять историй из жизни «ВКонтакте» и ее создателя.

On 19 November 2015, VK, in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund, released a sticker pack called “WWF”. When hovering the cursor above the animal’s sticker, a description of the animal appears, along with a link to a special WWF page containing information about ways to help that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwf.ru/resources/news/iz-zhizni-fonda/redkie-zhivotnye-poselyatsya-vkontakte/|title=Редкие животные «поселятся» ВКонтакте|website=WWF.ru - Всемирный фонд дикой природы|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2016, VK launched a special initiative on its website in cooperation with Downside Up, a charity supporting Russian children with Down syndrome. Whenever the word “Down” (Russian: даун), a common Russian insult, was used, it became a link that took users to a special website discussing individuals with Down syndrome and debunking common myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wonderzine.com/wonderzine/life/news/217687-down-syndrome-day|title=«ВКонтакте» проводит акцию в поддержку людей с синдромом Дауна|work=Wonderzine|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2017, VK Team members visited the Saint Petersburg “Help a Friend” (Russian: «Помоги другу») animal shelter to launch a campaign entitled “Become a Support Agent — Support Homeless Animals” (Russian: Стань агентом поддержки — поддержи бездомных животных). Over three months, people shared stories about helping animals using the hashtag #VKUserkindness (Russian: #ВКДобропользователи). 600 thousand virtual presents were given to participants in appreciation of their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vk.com/wall-133169189_170|title=Wall|website=vk.com|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On World Blood Donor Day, 14 June 2017, VK, in cooperation with the DonorSearch project, offered users a way to find “blood friends” (Russian: «друзей по крови») by filling out a special questionnaire where they could enter their blood type and Rh group. In addition, there was an option to register as a potential blood donor. 4.5 million people participated in this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vk.com/blog/donor_day|title=View post|website=vk.com|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2017, VK held “VK for Good”, an auction where charitable organizations received 972 hours of digital services from interactive agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.rambler.ru/other/38306252-blagotvoritelnye-fondy-poluchili-pochti-tysyachu-chasov-digital-uslug-na-auktsione-vk-for-good/|title=Благотворительные фонды получили почти тысячу часов digital-услуг на аукционе VK for Good|work=Рамблер/новости|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''wrongful dismissal''', also called '''wrongful termination''' or '''wrongful discharge''', is a situation in which an employee's [[contract of employment]] has been terminated by the employer, where the termination breaches one or more terms of the contract of employment, or a [[statutory|statute]] provision or rule in [[employment law]]. Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the [[jurisdiction]].

A related concept is [[constructive dismissal]] in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights.

==Forms of wrongful dismissal==
Being terminated for any of the items listed below may constitute wrongful termination:

* '''Discrimination''': The employer cannot terminate employment because the employee is a certain race, nationality, religion, sex, age, or (in some jurisdictions) sexual orientation.
* '''Retaliation''': An employer cannot fire an employee because the employee filed a claim of discrimination or is participating in an investigation for discrimination. In the US, this "retaliation" is forbidden under civil rights law.
* '''Employee's refusal to commit an illegal act''': An employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal.
* '''Employer is not following the company's own termination procedures''': In some cases, an employee handbook or company policy outlines a procedure that must be followed before an employee is terminated. If the employer fires an employee without following this procedure, depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction in which the termination occurs, the employee may have a claim for wrongful termination.

The absence of a formal contract of employment does not preclude wrongful dismissal in jurisdictions in which a ''de facto'' contract is taken to exist by virtue of the employment relationship. Terms of such a contract may include obligations and rights outlined in an [[employee handbook]].

Many jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which that hear actions for wrongful dismissal. A proven wrongful dismissal will tend to lead to the award of one or both of the following remedies:
*reinstatement of the dismissed employee;
*monetary compensation for the wrongfully dismissed.

==Probationary employees==
One way to avoid potential liability for wrongful dismissal with newer employees is to institute an [[probation (workplace)|employment probation]] period after which a new employee is automatically terminated unless there is sufficient justification not to do so. The dismissed employee may still assert a claim, but proof will be more difficult, as the employer may have broad discretion with retaining such a temporary employee.

==United States==
In the United States, there is no single “wrongful termination” law. Rather there are several state and federal laws and court decisions that define this concept.

In all U.S. states except Montana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|website=Montana Department of Labor &amp; Industry|publisher=State of Montana|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051735/http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers are considered by default to be [[At-will employment|at-will employees]], meaning that they may be fired at any time without cause.

Some employees have contracts of employment that limit their employers' ability to terminate them without cause. Other employees may be members of unions and benefit from a [[Collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] that defines disciplinary proceedings and limits when an employee may be terminated. Employees who work for government agencies normally benefit from civil service protections that restrict termination. Those employees, if terminated, may attempt to bring wrongful termination claims under the terms of the contract or agreement, or civil service law.

===Termination of at-will employment===
Although at-will employees are protected from termination by civil rights laws and other laws that prohibit retaliatory termination, in the absence of a contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement, or civil service protections extended to government workers, they have few protections from being fired.&lt;ref name="lars"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Wrongful Termination of At Will Employment|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=5 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050932/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations an at-will employee may be able to claim wrongful termination. Three leading grounds for claiming wrongful termination are:
#'''Implied contract''': In some situations a court might find an implied contract of employment that restricts the employer's ability to terminate an employee without cause. For example, the terms of an employee manual may support an employee's claim that the employer must follow a defined disciplinary process prior to termination.
#'''Public policy''': In many states it is possible to argue that the employer's reasons for terminating an employee, although not in violation of a statute, violated the state's public policy such that a wrongful termination claim should be allowed. For example, a court might allow a claim by an employee who was fired for refusing to take an action that was in violation of the law, for reporting a violation of the law to an enforcement agency, or for otherwise exercising the employee's rights under the law.
#'''Covenant of good faith and fair dealing''': In what is in many senses an extension of public policy doctrine, some states allow an at-will employee to pursue a wrongful termination claim if the cause for the termination is deemed to reflect bad faith on the part of the employer. For example, a state might apply this doctrine to allow a claim against an employer that terminated an employee a week before that employee's pension benefits vested, for no reason other than to avoid paying the employee a pension.

A 2016 study found evidence that the implied-contract exception to at-will employment reduced state employment rates by 0.8% to 1.7%. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and goodfaith exceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Autor|first=David H|last2=Donohue|first2=John J|last3=Schwab|first3=Stewart J|date=2006-05-01|title=The Costs of Wrongful-Discharge Laws|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/rest.88.2.211|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=88|issue=2|pages=211–231|doi=10.1162/rest.88.2.211|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination in violation of the law===
In the United States, termination of employment is not legal if it is based on your membership in a group protected from discrimination by law.&lt;ref name="lars"/&gt; It is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee based upon factors including employee's race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, or age (over 40), pursuant to U.S. federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219201431/https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|archivedate=19 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)|url=https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm|website=Americans with Disabilities website|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many states also have civil rights laws that protect workers from discrimination. For example, those forms of discrimination are prohibited by the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act|California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act]] (FEHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlawful Discrimination|url=http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|website=California Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=August 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231104941/http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laws also prohibit termination, even of at-will employees. For example, [[whistleblower]] laws may protect an employee who reports a legal or safety violation by the employer to an appropriate oversight agency. Most states prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim, or making a wage complaint over unpaid wages.

==Canada==
In Canadian law, absent a written contract which addresses how to end the employment relationship, the law implies into the employment relationship a term that it will not be ended without "notice" of its termination.

Notice is advanced warning an employer must provide an employee that their employment will be terminated. It is measured in units of time. The employer has the option to provide one of two kinds of notice:
# working notice, or
# pay in lieu of notice

If an adjudicator determines a dismissal was unjust, the employer may be ordered to reinstate the employee with or without compensation for lost wages, pay compensation for lost wages without reinstating the employee, or do anything that is equitable to remedy any consequences of the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/labour-standards/reports/unjust-dismissal.html#h2.6|title=Unjust Dismissal|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working notice ===

Working notice is legal in Canada. Therefore, if the employee is provided a reasonable amount of working notice, the employer owes the employee no additional money.

=== Pay in lieu of notice ===

Pay in lieu of notice, sometimes referred to as termination pay, is the amount of money the employer must pay the employee if the employer seeks to immediately terminate the employee without working notice.

=== Notice is measured in two different ways: statutory notice and common law "reasonable notice". ===

Employees may be entitled to either statutory or reasonable notice, which ever is greater, but at the very minimum, must receive statutory notice. Provincial legislation such as Ontario's Employment Standards Act, delineates statutory notice by way of a formula.

Reasonable notice, on the other hand, has no formula. The [[common law]] dictates how much reasonable notice an employee is entitled to.[http://www.slaw.ca/2015/11/29/the-new-bardal-factors-may-just-be-the-old-bardal-factors/] In this regard, the length of reasonable notice depends on a number of factors, best described by [[James Chalmers McRuer|McRuer CJHC]] in the 1960 Ontario decision of ''Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail|vol= 24|reporter= DLR (2d)|opinion= 140|pinpoint= 145|court= Ont. H.C.|date= 1960|url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There could be no catalogue laid down as to what was reasonable notice in particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must be decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the character of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the age of the servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the so-called "Bardal Factors" feature in hundreds of cases, predictive modeling is now possible.[http://www.bardalfactors.ca/new-blog/2017/11/16/predictive-analytics-what-are-they] Notwithstanding the above, the courts are open to creative interpretations of reasonable notice. For example, if an employee was persuaded to leave a job to come to another (i.e. inducement), the courts may take that into account in calculating the employee’s length of service and thus drastically increase the notice period.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has significantly expanded the scope of wrongful dismissal in Canadian jurisprudence:

An employer is entitled to dismiss an employee according to the terms of the employment contract. There are oral employment contracts, and written employment contracts, and combinations of oral and written employment contracts. In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behaviour which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal. A wrongful dismissal will allow the employee to claim monetary damages in an amount that compensates the employee for the wages, commissions, bonuses, profit sharing and other such emoluments the employee would have earned or received during the lawful notice period, minus earnings from new employment obtained during the lawful notice period. In Canadian employment law, in those jurisdictions where a remedy for [[unjust dismissal]] is not available, it has long been the rule that reinstatement is not a remedy available to either the employer or the employee{{em dash}}damages must be paid instead.

Although Canadian employment law provides some of the above remedies, each (provincial) jurisdiction may treat employment law differently. It is important to determine which jurisdiction the employment occurs in or is regulated by, then seek appropriate legal advice relevant to that jurisdiction and its particular employment laws.
