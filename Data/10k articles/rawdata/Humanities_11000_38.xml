'''Angkola''' (also known as '''Batak Angkola''' or '''Anakola''') people are one of the sub-ethnic groups comprising the [[Batak people]] from [[North Sumatra]] who live in [[South Tapanuli Regency|South Tapanuli]] regency. The [[Angkola language]] is similar to [[Mandailing language]], but it is [[sociolinguistic]]ally distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/akb/view/***EDITION*** |title=

The name ''Angkola'' is believed to have originate from the Angkola river or ''Batang Angkola'', which was named by an officer called Rajendra Kola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Rasjid Manggis Dt Radjo Panghulu|title=Minangkabau: Sejarah Ringkas Dan Adatnya|year=1982|publisher=Penerbit Mutiara|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Angkola'' or city lord) who was passing through [[Padang Lawas Regency|Padang Lawas]] and later came to power there. The southern (downstream) part of the Angkola river is called ''Angkola Jae'', while the northern (upstream) part is called ''Angkola Julu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetbatak.blogspot.com/2013/08/suku-batak-angkola.html |title=Suku Batak Angkola  |publisher=Planet Batak |date=August 2013 |accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angkola people practice [[patrilineal kinship]], and the [[clan]]s and [[Marga (Batak)|surnames]] of Angkola people are based on the patrilineal system. There are only a few Angkola [[Marga (Batak)|surnames]] - Siregar, Dalimunthe, Harahap, Hasibuan, Rambe, Nasution, Daulay, Tanjung, Ritonga, Batubara and Hutasuhut, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ch.

'''Anomic aphasia'''  (also known as '''dysnomia''', '''nominal aphasia''', and '''amnesic aphasia''') is a mild, fluent type of [[aphasia]] where an individual has word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anomic Aphasia - National Aphasia Association|url = http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/anomic-aphasia/|website = National Aphasia Association|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anomia is a deficit of expressive language. The most pervasive deficit in the aphasias is anomia. Some level of anomia is seen in all of the aphasias.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;Manasco, M. (2014). Chapter 7: Motor Speech Disorders: The Dysarthrias. In Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders . Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Barlett Learning.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Manasco, M. H. (2014). Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders. Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
There are three main types of anomia:

*'''Word selection anomia''' occurs when the patient knows how to use an object and can correctly select the target object from a group of objects, and yet cannot name the object. Some patients with word selection anomia may exhibit selective impairment in naming particular types of objects, such as animals or colors.&lt;ref name = Devinsky&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devinsky |first1=Orrin |last2=D'Esposito |first2=Mark |year=2004 |title=Neurology of Cognitive and Behavioral Disorders |edition=21st|pages = 194–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subtype known as '''color anomia''', the patient can distinguish between colors but cannot identify them by name or name the color of an object.&lt;ref name="Mattocks Hynd 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattocks|first1=Linda|last2=Hynd|first2=George W.|title=Color anomia: Clinical, developmental, and neuropathological issues|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|volume=2|issue=2|year=1986|pages=101–112|issn=8756-5641|doi=10.1080/87565648609540333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients can separate colors into categories, but they cannot name them.
* '''Semantic anomia''' is a disorder in which the meaning of words becomes lost. In patients with semantic anomia, a naming deficit is accompanied by a recognition deficit. Thus, unlike patients with word selection anomia, patients with semantic anomia are unable to select the correct object from a group of objects, even when provided with the name of the target object.&lt;ref name = Devinsky/&gt;
*'''Disconnection anomia''' results from the severing of connections between sensory and language cortices. Patients with disconnection anomia may exhibit modality-specific anomia, where the anomia is limited to a specific [[sensory modality]], such as hearing. For example, a patient who is perfectly capable of naming a target object when it is presented via certain sensory modalities like audition or touch, may be unable to name the same object when the object is presented visually. Thus, in such a case, the patient's anomia arises as a consequence of a disconnect between his/her visual cortex and language cortices.&lt;ref name = Devinsky/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;Patients with disconnection anomia may also exhibit '''callosal anomia''', in which damage to the [[corpus callosum]] prevents sensory information from being transmitted between the two hemispheres of the brain. Therefore, when sensory information is unable to reach the hemisphere that is language-dominant (typically the left hemisphere in most individuals), the result is anomia. For instance, if a patient with this type of disconnection anomia holds an object in their left hand, this somatosensory information about the object would be sent to the right hemisphere of the brain, but then would be unable to reach the left hemisphere due to callosal damage. Thus, this somatosensory information would fail to be transmitted to language areas in the left hemisphere, in turn resulting in the inability to name the object in the left hand. In this example, the patient would have no problem with naming, if the test object were to be held in the right hand. This type of anomia may also arise as a consequence of a disconnect between sensory and language cortices.&lt;ref name = Devinsky/&gt;

== Causes ==
Anomia can be genetic or caused by damage to various parts of the [[parietal lobe]] or the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[brain]] by an accident or [[stroke]], or a brain [[tumor]].&lt;ref name="Woollams 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Woollams | first1 = AM. | last2 = Cooper-Pye | first2 = E. | last3 = Hodges | first3 = JR. | last4 = Patterson | first4 = K. | title = Anomia: a doubly typical signature of semantic dementia. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 2503–14 |date=Aug 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.04.005 | PMID = 18499196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main causes are not specifically known, many researchers have found factors contributing to anomic aphasia. It is known that people with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain are more likely to have anomic aphasia. [[Broca's area]], the speech production center in the brain, was linked to being the source for speech execution problems, with the use of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), now commonly used to study anomic patients.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fridriksson J, Moser D, Ryalls J, Bonilha L, Rorden C, Baylis G |title=Modulation of frontal lobe speech areas associated with the production and perception of speech movements |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=812–9 |date=June 2009 |pmid=18978212 |pmc=2693218 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2008/06-0197) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts believe that damage to [[Wernicke's area]], which is the speech comprehension area of the brain, is connected to anomia because the patients cannot comprehend the words that they are hearing.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamilton AC, Martin RC, Burton PC |title=Converging functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for a role of the left inferior frontal lobe in semantic retention during language comprehension |journal=Cogn Neuropsychol |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=685–704 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20401770 |doi=10.1080/02643291003665688 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many experts have believed that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area are the main causes of anomia, current studies have shown that damage in the left [[parietal lobe]] is the epicenter of anomic aphasia.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fridriksson J, Kjartansson O, Morgan PS |title=Impaired speech repetition and left parietal lobe damage |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=33 |pages=11057–61 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20720112 |pmc=2936270 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1120-10.2010 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study was conducted using a word repetition test as well as fMRI in order to see the highest level of activity as well as where the [[Lesion|lesions]] are in the brain tissue.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2010"/&gt; Fridrikkson, et al. saw that damage to neither Broca's area nor Wernicke's area were the sole sources of anomia in the subjects. Therefore, the original anomia model, which theorized that damage occurred on the surface of the brain in the [[grey matter]] was debunked, and it was found that the damage was in the [[white matter]] deeper in the brain, on the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2010"/&gt; More specifically, the damage was in a part of the nerve tract called the [[arcuate fasciculus]], for which the mechanism of action is unknown, though it is known to connect the posterior (back) of the brain to the anterior (front) and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JM, Gilmore R, Roper S |title=Conduction aphasia and the arcuate fasciculus: A reexamination of the Wernicke-Geschwind model |journal=Brain Lang |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10534369 |doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2135 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New data has shown that although the arcuate fascicles' main function does not include connecting Wernicke's area and Broca's area, damage to the tract does create speech problems because the speech comprehension and speech production areas are connected by this tract.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2010"/&gt; Some studies have found that in [[laterality|right-handed]] people the language center is 99% in the left hemisphere; therefore, anomic aphasia almost exclusively occurs with damage to the left hemisphere. However, in left-handed people the language center is about 60% in the left hemisphere; thus, anomic aphasia can occur with damage to the right hemisphere in left-handed people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} &lt;!-- The previous 2 paragraphs cite incorrectly the same reference (9) in multiple contexts.  This paper does not support these claims specifically.  I believe there is a mixup, as the ultimate paragraph refers to 'new data' yet cites this same source, again --&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
The best way to see if anomic aphasia has developed is by using verbal as well as imaging tests. The combination of the two tests seem to be most effective, since either test done alone may give false positives or false negatives. For example, the verbal test is used to see if there is a speech disorder, and whether it is a problem in speech production or in comprehension.  Patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] have speech problems that are linked to [[dementia]] or [[progressive aphasia]]s which can include anomia.&lt;ref name="Rohrer, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rohrer JD, Knight WD, Warren JE, Fox NC, Rossor MN, Warren JD |title=Word-finding difficulty: a clinical analysis of the progressive aphasias |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=8–38 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17947337 |pmc=2373641 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm251 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harciarek M, Kertesz A |title=Primary progressive aphasias and their contribution to the contemporary knowledge about the brain-language relationship |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=271–87 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21809067 |pmc=3158975 |doi=10.1007/s11065-011-9175-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imaging test, mostly done using MRI scans, is ideal for lesion mapping or viewing deterioration in the brain. However, imaging cannot diagnose anomia on its own because the lesions may not be located deep enough to damage the white matter or damage the arcuate fasciculus. However, anomic aphasia is very difficult to associate with a specific lesion location in the brain. Therefore, the combination of speech tests and imaging tests has the highest [[sensitivity and specificity]].&lt;ref name="Healy, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Healy EW, Moser DC, Morrow-Odom KL, Hall DA, Fridriksson J |title=Speech perception in MRI scanner noise by persons with aphasia |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=323–34 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17463232 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/023) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to first do a [[hearing test]], in case the patient cannot clearly hear the words or sentences needed in the speech repetition test.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wambaugh JL, Ferguson M |title=Application of semantic feature analysis to retrieval of action names in aphasia |journal=J Rehabil Res Dev |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=381–94 |year=2007 |pmid=18247235 |doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.05.0038  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech tests, the person is asked to repeat a sentence with common words; if the person cannot identify the word but he or she can describe it, then the person is highly likely to have anomic aphasia. However, to be completely sure, the test is given while a test subject is in an fMRI scanner, and the exact location of the lesions and areas activated by speech are pinpointed.&lt;ref name="Fridriksson, 2010"/&gt; Few simpler or cheaper options are available, so lesion mapping and speech repetition tests are the main ways of diagnosing anomic aphasia.
=== definition ===
Anomic aphasia (anomia) is a type of [[aphasia]] characterized by problems recalling words, names, and numbers. Speech is fluent and receptive language is not impaired in someone with anomic aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Manasco, M. (2014). Chapter 4: The Aphasias. In Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders . Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Barlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects often use [[circumlocution]]s (speaking in a roundabout way) in order to avoid a name they cannot recall or to express a certain word they cannot remember.  Sometimes the subject can recall the name when given clues. Additionally, patients are able to speak with correct grammar; the main problem is finding the appropriate word to identify an object or person.

Sometimes subjects may know what to do with an object, but still not be able to give a name to the object. For example, if a subject is shown an orange and asked what it is called, the subject may be well aware that the object can be peeled and eaten, and may even be able to demonstrate this by actions or even verbal responses – however, they cannot recall that the object is called an "orange". Sometimes, when a person with this condition is [[multilingual]], they might confuse the language they are speaking in trying to find the right word (inadvertent [[code-switching]]).

== Management ==
There is no method available to completely cure anomic aphasia. However, there are treatments to help improve word-finding skills.

Although a person with anomia may find it difficult to recall many types of words such as common [[nouns]], [[proper nouns]], [[verbs]], etc., many studies have shown that treatment for object words, or nouns, has shown promise in rehabilitation research.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh, 2007"/&gt; The treatment includes visual aids, such as pictures, and the patient is asked to identify the object or activity. However, if that is not possible, then the patient is shown the same picture surrounded by words associated with the object or activity.&lt;ref name= "Coelho 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=Carl A.|last2=McHugh|first2=Regina E.|last3=Boyle|first3=Mary|title=Semantic feature analysis as a treatment for aphasic dysnomia: A replication | journal=Aphasiology |volume=14|issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=133–142|issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/026870300401513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Maher, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maher LM, Raymer AM |title=Management of anomia |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=10–21 |year=2004 |pmid=14872396 |doi=10.1310/318R-RMD5-055J-PQ40 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the process, positive encouragement is provided. The treatment shows an increase in word-finding during treatment; however, word identifying decreased two weeks after the rehabilitation period.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh, 2007"/&gt; Therefore, it shows that rehabilitation effort needs to be continuous for word-finding abilities to improve from the baseline. The studies show that verbs are harder to recall or repeat, even with rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh, 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mätzig 20098"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mätzig S, Druks J, Masterson J, Vigliocco G |title=Noun and verb differences in picture naming: past studies and new evidence |journal=Cortex |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=738–58 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19027106 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.10.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods in treating anomic aphasia include Circumlocution Induced Naming therapy (CIN), wherein the patient uses [[circumlocution]] to assist with his or her naming rather than just being told to name the item pictured after given some sort of cue. Results suggest that the patient does better in properly naming objects when undergoing this therapy because CIN strengthens the weakened link between [[semantics]] and [[phonology]] for patients with anomia, since they often know what an object is used for but cannot verbally name it.&lt;ref name="Francis Clark 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Francis|first1=Dawn R.|last2=Clark|first2=Nina|last3=Humphreys|first3=Glyn W.|title=Circumlocution-induced naming (CIN): A treatment for effecting generalisation in anomia?| journal=Aphasiology|volume=16|issue=3|year=2002| pages=243–259|doi=10.1080/02687040143000564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anomia is often challenging for the families and friends of those suffering from it. One way to overcome this is computer-based treatment models, effective especially when used with clinical therapy. Leemann et al. provided anomic patients with computerized-assisted therapy (CAT) sessions, along with traditional therapy sessions using treatment lists of words. Some of the patients received a drug known to help relieve symptoms of anomia ([[levodopa]]) while others received a [[placebo]]. The researchers found that the drug had no significant effects on improvement with the treatment lists, but almost all of the patients improved after the CAT sessions. They concluded that this form of computerized treatment is effective in increasing naming abilities in anomic patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leemann|first=B.|author2=Laganaro, M.|author3= Chetelat-Mabillard, D.|author4= Schnider, A.|title=Crossover Trial of Subacute Computerized Aphasia Therapy for Anomia With the Addition of Either Levodopa or Placebo|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|date=12 September 2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=43–47|doi=10.1177/1545968310376938|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:31780/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, one study researched the effects of using "excitatory (anodal) [[transcranial direct current stimulation]]" over the right temporo-parietal cortex, a brain area that seems to correlate to language. The electrical stimulation seemed to enhance language training outcome in patients with chronic aphasia.&lt;ref name="Flöel 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Flöel| first1=A.| last2=Meinzer| first2=M.| last3=Kirstein| first3=R.| last4=Nijhof| first4=S.| last5=Deppe| first5=M.| last6=Knecht| first6=S.| last7=Breitenstein| first7=C.| title=Short-term anomia training and electrical brain stimulation.| journal=Stroke| volume=42| issue=7| pages=2065–7|date=Jul 2011 | doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.609032| PMID=21636820| url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/42/7/2065.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology==
Many different populations can and do suffer from anomia. For instance, deaf patients who have suffered a [[stroke]] can demonstrate semantic and phonological errors, much like hearing anomic patients. Researchers have called this subtype '''sign anomia'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Marshall, J.|year=2004|title=Aphasia in a user of British Sign Language: Dissociation between sign and gesture|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=537–554|doi=10.1080/02643290342000249|author2=E. Smulovitch|author3=A. Thacker|author4=B. Woll}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-10-20--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bilingual]] patients typically experience anomia to a greater degree in just one of their fluent languages. However, there has been conflicting evidence as to which language – first or second – suffers more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendez |first=Mario F. |date=November 2001 |title=Language-Selective Anomia in a Bilingual Patient |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=12 |pages=515–516 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12.4.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Filley |first=Christopher M. |last2=Ramsberger|first2=Gail |last3=Menn |first3=Lise |last4=Wu |first4=Jiang |last5=Reid |first5=Bessie Y. |last6=Reid |first6=Allan L. |year=2006 |title=Primary Progressive Aphasia in a Bilingual Woman |journal=Neurocase |volume=12 |pages=296–299 |doi=10.1080/13554790601126047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on children with anomia has indicated that children who undergo treatment are, for the most part, able to gain back normal language abilities, aided by [[brain plasticity]]. However, longitudinal research on children with anomic aphasia due to head injury shows that even several years after the injury, some signs of deficient word retrieval are still observed. These remaining symptoms can sometimes cause academic difficulties later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Hout|first=Anne|title=Acquired Aphasia in Children|journal=Seminars in Pediatric Neurology|date=June 1992|volume=4|issue=2|pages=102–108|doi=10.1016/s1071-9091(97)80026-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patients ==
This disorder may be extremely frustrating for people with and without the disorder. Although the person with anomic aphasia may know the specific word, they may not be able to recall it and this can be very difficult for everyone in the conversation. &lt;!-- However, it is important to be patient and work with the person so that he or she gains confidence with his or her speech. --&gt; Positive reinforcements are helpful.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh, 2007"/&gt;

Although there are not many literary cases about anomic aphasia, there are many non-fiction books about living with [[aphasia]]. One of them is ''The Man Who Lost His Language'' by Sheila Hale. It is the story of Sheila Hale's husband, [[John Rigby Hale|John Hale]], a scholar who suffered a stroke and lost speech formation abilities. In her book, Sheila Hale also explains the symptoms and mechanics behind aphasia and speech formation. She adds the emotional components of dealing with a person with aphasia and how to be patient with the speech and communication.&lt;ref name="Hale 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Hale| first1=Sheila.| title=The man who lost his language : a case of aphasia| year=2007| publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers| location=London ; Philadelphia| isbn=978-1-84310-564-0 | oclc=174143262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acampbell.org.uk/bookreviews/r/hale.html | title=Book Review - THE MAN WHO LOST HIS LANGUAGE | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Anthony Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antithesis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "setting opposite", from {{lang|grc|ἀντί}} "against" and {{lang|grc|θέσις}} "placing") is used in writing or speech either as a proposition that contrasts with or reverses some previously mentioned proposition, or when two opposites are introduced together for contrasting effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QCzeDfeUe30C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=Antithesis+figure+of+speech#v=onepage&amp;q=Antithesis%20figure%20of%20speech&amp;f=false | title = English Kumarbharati Grammar,Language Study &amp; Writing Skills Std.X | author1 = Ferreira | first1 = Gladwyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9xF14SzHIBAC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Antithesis+figure+of+speech#v=onepage&amp;q=Antithesis%20figure%20of%20speech&amp;f=false | title = The Art of Writing and Speaking the English Language | isbn = 1406846570 | author1 = Cody | first1 = Sherwin | date = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antithesis can be defined as "a figure of speech involving a seeming contradiction of ideas, words, clauses, or sentences within a balanced grammatical structure. Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Antithesis|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An antithesis must always contain two ideas within one statement. The ideas may not be structurally opposite, but they serve to be functionally opposite when comparing two ideas for emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd|first1=Alfred|title=The Logic of Antithesis|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods|date=25 May 1911|volume=8|issue=11|pages=281–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aristotle]], the use of an antithesis makes the audience better understand the point the speaker is trying to make. Further explained, the comparison of two situations or ideas makes choosing the correct one simpler. Aristotle states that antithesis in rhetoric is similar to [[syllogism]] due to the presentation of two conclusions within a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preminger|first1=Alex|last2=Brogan|first2=T.V.F.|title=Antithesis|date=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antitheses are used to strengthen an argument by using either exact opposites or simply contrasting ideas, but can also include both. They typically make a sentence more memorable for the reader or listener through balance and [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]] of the words.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Skellon, "Antithesis: examples and definition," Speak Like A Pro. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhetorical antithesis ==
In [[rhetoric]], antithesis is a [[figure of speech]] involving the bringing out of a contrast in the [[idea]]s by an obvious contrast in the [[word]]s, [[clause]]s, or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], within a parallel grammatical structure.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antithesis|volume=2|pages=146-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "antithesis" in rhetoric goes back to the 4th century BC, for example Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', 1410a, in which he gives a series of examples.

An antithesis can be a simple statement contrasting two things, using a parallel structure:

*I defended the Republic as a '''young man'''; I shall not desert her now that I am '''old'''. ([[Cicero]], ''2nd Philippic'', 2.118)

Often there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where "man" is opposed to "God", and "proposes" is contrasted with "disposes":

*'''Man proposes''', '''God disposes'''. (anonymous)

Another type is of the form "not A, but B" (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:

*I came not to bring '''peace''' but a '''sword'''. (St Matthew's Gospel, 10:34).

Another type involves a [[chiasmus]] (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:

*In '''peace''' you are for '''war''', and in '''war''' you long for '''peace'''.
*Two things show feebleness of mind: '''holding your breath''' at the time for '''speaking''', and '''speaking''' when you should be '''silent'''. ([[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]])

The negative-positive antithesis and the chiasmus-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:
*Ask not what '''your country''' can do for '''you''' – ask what '''you''' can do for '''your country'''. – [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy]], 1961.

=== Some literary examples ===
Some other examples of antithesis are:

* Give '''every''' man '''thy ear''', but '''few''' thy '''voice'''. ([[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Hamlet]]'')
* '''Many''' are '''called''', but '''few''' are '''chosen.''' ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A14&amp;version=KJV Matthew 22:14])
* Never give in — never, never, never, never, in nothing '''great''' or '''small''', '''large''' or '''petty''', never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. (by [[Winston Churchill]])
* It was the '''best''' of times, it was the '''worst''' of times, it was the age of '''wisdom''', it was the age of '''foolishness''', it was the epoch of '''belief''', it was the epoch of '''incredulity''', it was the season of '''Light''', it was the season of '''Darkness''', it was the spring of '''hope''', it was the winter of '''despair''', we had '''everything''' before us, we had '''nothing''' before us, we were all going direct to '''Heaven''', we were all going direct the '''other way'''... ([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'')
* We must learn to '''live together''' as '''brothers''' or '''perish together''' as '''fools'''. ([[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], speech at [[St. Louis]], 1964.)
* The world will little note, nor long remember '''what we say here''', but it can never forget '''what they did here'''. ([[Abraham Lincoln]], [[The Gettysburg Address]], 1863.)
* He who desires '''peace''', should prepare for '''war'''. ([[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]], ''Epitoma Rei Militaris'', book 3, introduction.)
* For '''now''' we see through a glass, darkly; but '''then''' face to face: '''now''' I know in part; but '''then''' shall I know even as also I am known. (St Paul, 1st Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12, King James version)
* My '''men''' have become '''women''', and my '''women''', '''men'''. (King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC), according to [[Herodotus]] 8.88.3)
* Senator, in everything I said about Iraq '''I''' turned out to be '''right''' and '''you''' turned out to be '''wrong'''. ([[George Galloway]] at a US Senate hearing, May 2005.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4557279.stm BBC News online, 17 May 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
* I'm not saying that '''this or that statue''' was stolen from there; I'm saying this, that you, Verres, left '''not one single statue''' in Aspendus. ([[Cicero]], ''In Verrem'', 2.1.53.)
* I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the '''color of their skin''' but by the '''content of their character'''. ([[Martin Luther King]], 1963.)

== The "Antitheses" in St Matthew's Gospel ==
{{main|Matthew 5#Antitheses}}

''Matthew's Antitheses'' is the traditional name given to a section of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]{{bibleref2c|Matt.|5:17–48}} where [[Jesus]] takes six well known prescriptions of the [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic Law]] and calls his followers to do more than the Law requires. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. "Antithesis" was the name given by [[Marcion of Sinope]] to a manifesto in which he contrasted the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]] and defined what came to be known as [[Marcionism]].

== In philosophical discussion ==
{{See also|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Dialectic}}
In [[dialectic]]s (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way. The logical arguments are said to be stated in the order [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]].

Although this style of philosophical discussion (stating a point of view, then its opposite, and finally drawing a conclusion) was commonly used by ancient philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Cicero, ''de Officiis'' 3.54-57.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the trio "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" itself to describe it goes back only to the 18th century, to a work published in 1794 by the German philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Robert R. (1992). ''Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other''. SUNY Press. p. 46, note 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated to originate from the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. However, Hegel never actually used the trio of terms except once in a lecture, in which he reproached [[Immanuel Kant]] for having "everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann,
 Walter, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', 1966, Anchor Books, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

:

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aoede''' {{IPAc-en|eɪ|ˈ|iː|d|iː}} ({{lang-grc|Ἀοιδή}}, ''Aoidē'') was one of the three original ([[Boeotia|Boeotian]]) [[Muse|muses]], which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named.  Her sisters were [[Melete]] and [[Mneme]]. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of [[Zeus]], the King of the Gods, and [[Mnemosyne]], the goddess of memory. 

She lends her name to the [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Jupiter XLI]], also called Aoede, which orbits the planet [[Jupiter (astronomy)|Jupiter]].

{{distinguish|text=[[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]]s, an apposition-like structure whose elements are not placed side by side|opposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Apposition''' is a [[grammatical]] construction in which two elements, normally [[noun phrase]]s, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the two elements are said to be ''in apposition''. One of the elements is called the '''appositive''', although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.

For example, in the two sentences below, the phrases ''Alice Smith'' and ''my sister'' are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:
* My sister, ''Alice Smith'', likes jelly beans.
* Alice Smith, ''my sister'', likes jelly beans.

Traditionally, appositions were called by their [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''appositio'', although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: ''ad'' ("near") and ''positio'' ("placement").

Apposition is a figure of speech of the [[scheme (linguistics)|scheme]] type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as [[hyperbaton]]s, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: "My wife, a nurse by training, ...", it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification "a nurse by training".

==Restrictive versus non-restrictive==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Non-restrictive appositive]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Restrictive appositive]] --&gt;

A '''restrictive appositive''' provides information essential to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It limits or clarifies that phrase in some crucial way, and the meaning of the sentence would change if the appositive were removed.
In English, restrictive appositives are not set off by [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]s.
The sentences below use restrictive appositives. Here and elsewhere in this section, the relevant phrases are marked as the ''appositive phrase''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; or the ''phrase in apposition''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''My friend''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– I have many friends, but I am restricting my statement to the one named Alice Smith.&lt;/small&gt;
* He likes ''the television show''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''The Simpsons''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– There are many television shows, and he likes that particular one.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''non-restrictive appositive''' provides information not critical to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It provides non-essential information, and the essential meaning of the sentence would not change if the appositive were removed.
In English, non-restrictive appositives are typically set off by commas.&lt;ref name=WritingPU&gt;
[http://www.princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/commas.pdf "Commas: Some Common Problems"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Princeton Writing Program, [[Princeton University]], 1999, ''princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sentences below use non-restrictive appositives.
* ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''my friend''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The fact that Alice is my friend was not necessary to identify her.&lt;/small&gt;
* I visited ''Canada''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a beautiful country''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is not needed to identify Canada.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The first to arrive at the house''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, ''she''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; unlocked the front door.

The same phrase can be a restrictive appositive in one context and a non-restrictive appositive in another:
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; is here. &lt;small&gt;– Restrictive: I have many brothers, and the one named Nathan is here.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, is here. &lt;small&gt;– Non-restrictive: I have only one brother and, as an aside, his name is Nathan.&lt;/small&gt;
If there is any doubt that the appositive is non-restrictive, it is safer to use the restrictive form.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
In the example above, the restrictive first sentence is still correct even if there is only one brother.

A [[restrictiveness|relative clause]] is not always an appositive.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase ''Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase with dependent relative clause ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* My sister, whose name is Alice Smith, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– There is no appositive. There is a relative clause: ''whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Examples==
In the following examples, the appositive phrases are shown in italics:

* I was born in Finland, ''the land of a thousand lakes''. &lt;small&gt;– Appositives are not limited to describing people.&lt;/small&gt;
* Barry Goldwater, ''the junior senator from Arizona'', received the Republican nomination in 1964.
* John and Bob, ''both friends of mine'', are starting a band.
* Alexander the Great, ''the Macedonian conqueror of Persia'', was one of the most successful military commanders of the ancient world.
* Dean Martin, ''a very popular singer'', will be performing at the Sands Hotel.
* You are better than anyone, ''anyone I've ever met''.
* ''A staunch supporter of democracy'', Rob campaigned against the king's authoritarian rule.

A kind of appositive is the [[false title]], a restrictive phrase, as in "''Noted biologist'' Jane Smith has arrived.", where the phrase ''Noted biologist'' is used as an informal title. The use of false titles is [[False title#Controversy|controversial]].

Appositive phrases can also serve as definitions:
* No one – ''not a single person'' – should ever suffer that way.
&lt;!-- Is the following really an appositive? "the best" is a noun phrase, "better than all the rest" is an adjective phrase --&gt;
* You're simply the best, ''better than all the rest''.

==Appositive genitive==
In several languages, the same syntax that is used to express such relations as possession can also be used appositively. Examples include:

* In English:
** "Appositive oblique", a prepositional phrase with ''of'' as in: ''the month of December'', ''the sin of pride'', or ''the city of New York''. This has also been invoked as an explanation for the [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]]: ''a friend of mine''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5, §14.3 (pages 447–448), Rodney Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ending ''-'s'' as in "[[In Dublin's Fair City]]". This is uncommon.
* In classical Greek:
** "Genitive of explanation" as in {{lang-gr|italic=yes|ὑὸς μέγα χρῆμα}} (hyòs méga chrêma), "a monster (great affair) of a boar" ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories of Herodotus]], 1.36);&lt;ref&gt;§1322 (pages 317–318), [[Herbert Weir Smyth]], revised by Gordon M.

* In Japanese:

[[File:ArielPlath.jpg|thumb|right| First edition ([[Faber and Faber]])]]

'''''Ariel''''' was the second book of [[Sylvia Plath]]'s poetry to be published, and was originally published in 1965, two years after her death by suicide. The poems in the 1965 edition of '''''Ariel''''', with their free flowing images and characteristically menacing psychic landscapes, marked a dramatic turn from Plath's earlier ''[[The Colossus and Other Poems|Colossus]]'' poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/plath/colossus.htm |title=On "The Colossus" |publisher=English.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1965 edition of ''Ariel'', [[Ted Hughes]] changed Plath's chosen selection and arrangement by dropping twelve poems, adding twelve composed a few months later, and shifting the poems' ordering, in addition to including an introduction by the poet [[Robert Lowell]].&lt;ref name="powells1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0060732598-0 |title=''Ariel: The Restored Edition: A Facsimile of Plath's Manuscript, Reinstating Her Original Selection and Arrangement by Sylvia Plath''&amp;nbsp;– Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having Lowell write the introduction to the book was appropriate, since, in a BBC interview, Plath cited Lowell's book ''[[Life Studies]]'' as having had a profound influence over the poetry she was writing in this last phase of her writing career.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-v-U70xoZM&amp;feature=related |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, Plath also cited the poet [[Anne Sexton]] as an important influence on her writing during this time since Sexton was also exploring some of the same dark, taboo, personal subject matter that Plath was exploring in her writing.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

In 2004 a new edition of ''Ariel'' was published which for the first time restored the selection and arrangement of the poems as Plath had left them; the 2004 edition also features a foreword by Plath and Hughes' daughter [[Frieda Hughes]].&lt;ref name="powells1"/&gt;

==Contents (1965 version)==
Poems marked with an * were not in Plath's original manuscript, but were added by Ted Hughes. Most of them date from the last few weeks of Plath's life.

'''Azal''' (אצל), or '''Azel''', is a location mentioned in the [[Book of Zechariah]] 14:5, in Bibles that use the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]] as the source for this verse. In Bibles that follow the Greek [[Septuagint]] ([[LXX]]) rendering, depending upon the source manuscript used, ''Azal'' is transcribed ''Jasol'' (ιασολ, pronounced "Yasol"), ''Jasod'' (a corruption of ''Jasol''), or ''Asael'' (ασαηλ):

{{quote|''And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto ''Azal'': yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of [[Uzziah]] king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].''|source={{Bibleverse||Zechariah|14:5|KJV}} [[King James Version]]}}

{{quote|''The valley between the hills will be filled in, yes, it will be blocked as far as ''Jasol'', it will be filled in as it was by the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah'',|source={{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=45&amp;bible_chapter=14|title=Zechariah 14:5|publisher=[[New Jerusalem Bible]]|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}}}

== Theories on location ==

No written work prior to the late 19th-century definitively identifies what, or where, Azal is or was. Most Bible commentators of the late 19th century considered it to be a place near [[Jerusalem]].  [[Cyril of Alexandria]] wrote in his commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]], Chapter 14. that Azal was known to be “a town situated at the far point of the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Cyril | last=Alexandria | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lG_NF6CrjtcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=a+town+situated+at+the+far+point+of+the+mountain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPZjpAt7Ba&amp;sig=NvAQJgqzXKB8N7VcHP2l0YKIGcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI--assLmXxwIVDJ2ICh1CYgRr#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20town%20situated%20at%20the%20far%20point%20of%20the%20mountain&amp;f=false | editor-last = Hill | editor-first = Robert C.| series = | title = Commentary on the Twelve Prophets, Volume 3 | at = pp. 259-60 | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, Palestinian [[geographer]] {{ill|Rabbbi Joseph Schwarz|he|יהוסף שוורץ}}&lt;ref name=Schwarz&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13342-schwarz-joseph|title=SCHWARZ, JOSEPH |date =1890|work =[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Azal was modern Azaria, situated a half mile southeast of the southernmost peak of the [[Mount of Olives]] (then called Mount Corruption).&lt;ref name=Palestine&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewish-history.com/palestine/moriah.html|title=Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine |date =1850|work =Jewishhistory.com|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Orientalist and archaeologist [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], who identified the site of the ancient [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Gezer]] preserving the [[Mesha Stele]]'s inscriptions&lt;ref name=Gezer&gt;{{Cite report|last=Pelgrift|first=Henry|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/853/|title=The History of Excavations at Tel Gezer |date =January 12, 2016|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Schwarz was referring to [[al-Eizariya]], the traditional [[Bethany]] of New Testament times. However, al-Eizariya lies several kilometers due east of the [[Mount of Olives]], not a half mile southeast of it, as Schwarz claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clermont-Ganneau |first=Charles |date=1896 |title=Archaeological researches in Palestine during the years 1873–1874 |url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologicalre02cler |location=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |page=251-255; 275 |ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1873 and 1874, Clermont-Ganneau explored many tombs in a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which the peasants of [[Silwan]] called {{transl|ar|Wady Yasul}}. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Clermont-Ganneau proposed that Wady Yasul is Azal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine'', Vol. 1. pg. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, April 1874, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this valley is bordered on the west by the Jerusalem [[Peace Forest]] and the neighborhood of [[Talpiot]], on the north by the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood on the southern slope of the Hill of Evil Council, and on the south by the neighborhood of [[Jabel Mukaber]] on the ridge where the former UN headquarters sits. The mouth of the valley lies at the base of the southernmost summit of the Mount of Olives (Mount of Corruption). Its Hebrew name is {{transl|he|Nahal Atzal}} ({{lang|he|נחל אצל}}).

There is evidence that Clermont-Ganneau's theory and the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5 are correct. In 1984, Israeli geologists Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte identified the location of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives that is directly adjacent to both Wady Yasul (Nahal Atzal) and the area of the ancient King's Gardens at the juncture of the [[Hinnom]] and [[Kidron Valley]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wachs |first1= Daniel |last2= Levitte|first2= Dov |year= 1984|title=Earthquake Risk and Slope Stability in Jerusalem |journal=Environmental Geology and Water Sciences |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=183–186 |publisher= |doi=10.1007/BF02509912 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1323l6j20248l21/ |accessdate=November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wachs' and Levitte's discovery validates Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]]' account of an earthquake-caused landslide during King [[Uzziah]]'s reign blocking up the kings' gardens in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', book 9, chapter 10, paragraph 4, verse 225, William Whiston&lt;/ref&gt; It also accords with the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5, which states a valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. Additionally, the Israelis officially named this valley '''אצל''' (Atzal), which is the same Hebrew spelling of Azal ('''אצל''').

'''[[Bronze]] mirrors''' preceded the [[Mirror|glass mirrors]] of today. This type of mirror, often incorrectly termed a copper mirror, has been found by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] among elite assemblages from various cultures, from [[Etruscan art|Etruscan Italy]] to [[China]].

==History==
[[File:Mirror (Jing) with 'TLV' Design LACMA AC1998.251.29.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Eastern Han]]-period [[TLV mirror]]]]

===Egypt===
Polished bronze mirrors were made by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] from 2900 BCE onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Y. Saad: ''The Excavations at Helwan. Art and Civilization in the First and Second Egyptian Dynasties'', University of Oklahoma Press, Oklahoma 1969, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indus valley civilization===
In the [[Indus valley civilization]], manufacture of bronze mirrors goes back to the time between 2800 and 2500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Corson: ''Fashions in Makeup: From Ancient to Modern Times'', 1972, {{ISBN|0-7206-0431-1}}, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bronze mirror are usually circular.

===China===
[[Image:MirrorDSCF6602.jpg|thumb|250px|An Iron Age bronze mirror from 120-80 BCE found in [[St Keverne]], England]]

Bronze mirrors were produced in China from [[neolithic]] times until the [[Qing Dynasty]], when western glass mirrors were brought to China. Bronze mirrors were usually circular, with one side polished bright, to give a reflection, and the reverse side with designs. They often had a knob in the center so that they could be attached to clothing. Some of the earliest examples of Chinese bronze mirrors belonged to the [[Neolithic]] [[Qijia culture]] from around 2000 BCE. However, until [[Warring States]] times, bronze mirrors were not common with approximately only twenty having been discovered. During the [[Warring States]] period, mirrors became particularly popular. It was during the [[Han Dynasty]], and the introduction of the [[TLV mirror]], that mirrors started to be mass-produced. Both Han and Tang mirrors are considered to be the most technically advanced. Bronze mirrors continued to remain popular up through the [[Song Dynasty]], but then gradually lost their popularity and ceased to be produced after the arrival of Western mirrors during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasties.

===Europe===
In Europe, bronze mirrors from the [[Bronze Age]] have been discovered from various places, including [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Italy]]. A notable example includes the [[Birdlip mirror]]. [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] mirrors were produced from between the 6th and 2nd centuries BCE. [[Celt]]ic mirrors in [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]] were produced up until the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='Mirrors in Roman Britain', in J. Munby and M.

==History==
Some fragments of the Carlsberg papyrus collection date back to ca. 2000 B.C., while others &amp;mdash; such as the [[Tebtunis]] manuscripts &amp;mdash; date back to ca. 1st century A.D.&lt;ref name="The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection"/&gt;

[[Aksel Volten]] was keeper of the collection since 1943. By 1954 he was able to enlarge it substantially through new acquisitions with funds mainly provided by the [[Carlsberg Foundation]].&lt;ref name="The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection"/&gt;

==Contents==
Most of the texts are written in hieratic and demotic scripts, although there are several texts written in [[hieroglyphs]] and in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. The actual contents of the papyrus vary greatly, but it focuses mainly on treatment for eye diseases and pregnancy. The structure of the papyrus bears great resemblance to that of the [[Kahun Papyrus|Kahun]] and [[Berlin Papyrus (disambiguation)|Berlin]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; papyri.&lt;ref name="The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancient Egyptian Medical Papyri"/&gt;

The collection was further expanded through acquisitions from Professor H. O. Lange and Professor C. E. Sander-Hansen, private owners of several papyri. Two Coptic [[codices]] purchased from Carl Schmidt and the ''[[Teaching for King Merykara|Teaching of King Merikare]]'' further added to the collection.&lt;ref name="The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection"/&gt;

More than six hundred individual manuscripts have been recorded, some of which have been pieced together from dozens or even hundreds of fragments.&lt;ref name="The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">'''Crux''' ([[Latin]] for "cross", "gallow", or "t-shape") is a term applied by [[palaeography|palaeographers]], [[textual criticism|textual critics]], [[bibliography|bibliographers]], and literary scholars to a point of significant corruption in a literary text. More serious than a simple slip of the pen or typographical error, a crux (probably deriving from Latin ''crux interpretum'' = "cross of the interpreters") is difficult or impossible to interpret and resolve. Cruxes occur in a wide range of pre-modern ([[ancient history|ancient]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]], and [[Renaissance]]) texts, printed and manuscript.

==Shakespearean examples==
Though widely exposed to readers and scholars, the texts of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays yield some of the most famous literary cruxes. Some have been resolved fairly well. In [[Henry V (play)|''Henry V,'']] II.iii.16-7, the [[First Folio]] text has the Hostess describe [[Falstaff]] on his death-bed like this:
{{quote|...his nose was sharp as a pen, and 'a Table of green fields.}}
[[Lewis Theobald]]'s editorial correction, "and 'a [he] babbl'd of green fields", has won almost universal acceptance from subsequent editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' pp. 945, 973.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "dram of eale" In ''[[Hamlet]]'' I, iv, 36 can be sensibly interpreted as "dram of ev'l [evil]."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 1148, 1188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Shakespearean cruxes have not been so successfully resolved. In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]],'' IV.ii,38-9, Diana observes to Bertram,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre,
That we'll forsake ourselves.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
Editors have reached no consensus on exactly what "ropes in such a scarre" can mean, or how it should be amended: "no satisfactory explanation or emendation has been offered."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 530, 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best alternative that has been proposed is "may rope 's [us] in such a snare." Another unresolved Shakespearean crux is the "runaway's eyes" in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' III, ii, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, p. 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a crux will not require emendation, but simply present a knotty problem of comprehension. In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]],'' IV, i, 98-9, Sir Richard Vernon describes Prince Hal and his comrades as appearing:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
All plum'd like estridges, that with the wind
bated like eagles having lately bath'd...
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
This is most likely a reference to some obscure assertion about animal behavior, and has sent researchers poring through dusty volumes in search of an explanation.

==Typographic conventions==
In editions of Greek and Roman authors, a crux is marked off by [[dagger (typography)|obeli]], to indicate that the editor is not confident enough either to follow the manuscript reading or to print a conjecture.

'''Democratic Alternative''' ({{lang-fi|Demokraattinen Vaihtoehto}} {{lang-sv|Demokratiskt Alternativ}}) was a political party in [[Finland]]. Deva was formed in 1986 by expelled members of the [[Communist Party of Finland]] and its mass front [[Finnish People's Democratic League]]. In 1990 Deva disintegrated and its members joined the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], a merger of SKP and SKDL, founded earlier that year.

Deva consisted of [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland (Unity)]], [[Revolutionary Youth League (Finland)|Revolutionary Youth League]], [[Women's Democratic Action Centre]], [[Socialist Students' League (Finland)|Socialist Students' League]] and [[Democratic Civic Association]]. The [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers' Party]] (STP) had candidates on Deva list in the 1987 election but STP was never member of Deva.

Deva contested the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1987|1987 parliamentary elections]] and won 122 181 votes (4.24%). [[Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen]], [[Ensio Laine]], [[Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi]] and [[Esko-Juhani Tennilä]] were elected MPs. [[Jouko Kajanoja]] was the party candidate in the [[Finnish presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]. Kajanoja gathered 44 428 votes (1.44%). The electors on Deva list got 56 528 votes (1.89%). In the 1988 local elections, 127 Deva councillors were elected to over 70 municipality councils. Their best results were in [[Karkkila]] (19.6%, 7 councillors) and [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]] (15.5%, 6). Deva also participated in trade union and cooperative elections.

==Biography==
Dorothy Gould was the granddaughter of the railroad magnate [[Jay Gould]]. She was born in the United States in 1904 to [[Frank Jay Gould]] and [[Helen Margaret Kelly]]. In 1919 she left the United States for Europe, and she never re-established a legal residence in the United States.

On May 5, 1925 she married a Swiss citizen, Baron Roland Graffenried de Villars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Married |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720380,00.html#ixzz0wSNjydg2 |quote=Miss Dorothy Gould, 21, daughter of Frank Jay Gould and his onetime wife, Princess Vlora, now the divorced wife of Prince Houreddin Vlora of Albania, to Baron de Graffenried de Villars, 25, of Switzerland; in Paris.  |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=May 18, 1925 |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edward J.

They had two daughters and divorced in 1936. During this period she traveled as a citizen of the United States using a [[United States passport]] which expired in 1934. The [[United States Department of State]] refused to renew her United States passport, so she traveled under an "affidavit in lieu of passport" issued by the American Consulate in Switzerland. When the Germans occupied France, she returned to the United States in 1941 on a newly issued [[United States passport]]. She remained only briefly and entered Cuba where she met her second husband, Archibald Burns, a Mexican national of Scottish parents. She traveled with him to Mexico where they married in 1944.

She died on July 6, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dorothy Burns, 58, Heiress To French Resort Founder |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/07/archives/dorothy-burns-58-heiress-to-french-resort-founder.html |quote=Mrs. Dorothy Burns, who inherited hotels ...

The US position was upheld by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], and subsequently affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. The Second Circuit held that the estate could not succeed in its claim, because of the doctrines of [[estoppel]] and [[Laches (equity)|laches]] that arose out of her assertions that she had remained an American citizen.

'''Dwarf-tossing''', or '''midget-tossing''', is a [[Public house|pub]]/[[Bar (establishment)|bar]] attraction in which people with [[dwarfism]], wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes, are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro-coated walls.&lt;ref&gt;International Dwarf Tossing Association&lt;/ref&gt; Participants compete to throw the dwarf the farthest. A related formerly practiced activity was dwarf-bowling, in which a person with dwarfism was placed on a skateboard and used as a bowling ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php Dwarf Bowling on Staten Island Lands in Gutter: Gothamist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002832/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwarf Tossing was started in Australia as a form of Pub entertainment in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ozzienews.com/news/is-dwarf-tossing-coming-to-melbourne/ Dwarf Tossing Coming to Melbourne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistededge.org/Funny_As_Hell/World_According/Midget_Throwing/ World according to Midget Throwing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===Australia===
Commonly thought of as the place where dwarf tossing originated. Laws may prohibit dwarf tossing implicitly, but there are not explicit laws preventing a consenting dwarf from being 'tossed'.

===Canada===
In [[Ontario]], Canada, the Dwarf Tossing Ban Act was introduced in 2003 by [[Windsor West]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] [[Sandra Pupatello]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=1128 Dwarf Tossing Ban Act, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[private member's bill|private member's public bill]] did not proceed beyond its introduction to second or third readings, nor did it receive royal assent, and therefore died at the close of the 37th [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"/&gt; The bill proposed a fine of not more than $5,000, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both. The bill was hastily advanced in response to a dwarf-tossing contest&lt;ref name="OntLA2"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/2003-06-12_L025.htm#PARA511 Legislative Assembly of Ontario Transcript of Debates for Thursday, June 12, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; that was held at Leopard's Lounge in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario with a dwarf nicknamed "Tripod".&lt;ref name = "GlobeAndMail1"&gt;{{cite news

|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The [[mayor]] of the small French town of [[Morsang-sur-Orge]] prohibited dwarf-tossing. The case went through the appeal chain of administrative courts to the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', which found that an administrative authority could legally prohibit dwarf-tossing on grounds that the activity did not respect human [[dignity]] and was thus contrary to public order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007877723 Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°136727, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The question raised legal questions as to what was admissible as a motive for an administrative authority to ban an activity for motives of public order, especially as the ''conseil'' did not want to include "public morality" in public order. The ruling was taken by the full assembly and not a smaller panel—proof of the difficulty of the question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062531/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html |date=27 September 2011 }} of the ruling on the Conseil d'État's site&lt;/ref&gt; The ''conseil'' ruled similarly in another case between an entertainment company and the city of [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007882056&amp; Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°143578, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Human Rights Committee decided on July 26, 2002, that the ban was not discriminatory with respect to dwarfs. It ruled that the ban could be considered as "necessary to protect public order, which brings into play considerations of human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1010&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, dwarf-tossing is not prohibited outright in France. The ''Conseil d'État'' decided that a public authority could use gross infringement on human dignity as a motive of public order to cancel a spectacle, and that dwarf-tossing constituted such a gross infringement. However, it is up to individual authorities to make specific decisions regarding prohibition.

===United States===
Robert and Angela Van Etten, [[Florida]] members of the [[Little People of America]], convinced the state's legislators in 1989 that dwarf-tossing be made illegal. A measure banning dwarf-tossing was passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_Dec_10/ai_80677114/ Florida Ban on Dwarf Tossing Must Be Upheld, Announces LPA, Inc.; Dwarf-Tossing is a Dangerous, Demoralizing Activity That Poses Specific Hazards to Persons with Dwarfism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] later followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistededge.org/Funny_As_Hell/World_According/Midget_Throwing/ Midget Throwing: A Lost Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-25/news/mn-1001_1_dwarf-tossing |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Cuomo Signs Bill to Ban Dwarf Tossing |date=July 25, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Dave Flood, who appeared on the MJ Morning Show as "Dave the Dwarf," filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1989 law allowing the state to fine or revoke the [[liquor license]] of a bar that allows dwarf-tossing. The pastime was popular in some Florida bars in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lQFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1342,4094341 "Florida Radio Personality Files Suit to Allow Return of 'Dwarf Tossing'"].

In October 2011, [[Ritch Workman]] introduced legislation that would overturn the ban on dwarf-tossing, claiming such a ban to be an "unnecessary burden on the freedom and liberties of people" and "an example of Big Brother government". Although not a personal advocate of the activity, Workman stated "if a little person wants to make a fool out of themselves for money, they should have the same right to do so as any average sized person".&lt;ref name="PBP dwarves"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/cerabino-lawmaker-wants-state-to-reinstate-dwarf-tossing-1898183.html |work=The Palm Beach Post |first=Frank |last=Cerabino |title=Lawmaker Wants State to Reinstate Dwarf Tossing |date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Espardenyes.jpg|thumb|250px|Espadrilles]]

'''Espadrilles''' or '''espardenyes''' are casual, flat, but sometimes [[High-heeled footwear|high-heeled]] [[shoes]]. They usually have a [[canvas]] or [[cotton]] [[Textile|fabric]] upper and a flexible [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] made of [[esparto]] [[rope]]. The esparto rope sole is the defining characteristic of an espadrille; the [[Upper (shoe)|upper]]s vary widely in style. 

[[File:Mare de Déu de la Salut 15.jpg|thumb|Traditional Valencian espadrille of llaurador dancer at [[La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival]] celebrated in [[Algemesí]]]]

==Etymology==
The existence of this kind of shoe in [[Europe]] is documented since at least 1322, when it was described for the first time with its current [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name. [[File:Alpargatas 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Typical clothing with espadrilles in the [[Andes]]]]
The term ''espadrille'' is French and derives from the word in the [[Occitan language]], which comes from ''espardenya'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or ''alpargata'' and ''esparteña'' in Spanish. Both ''espardenya'' and ''esparteña'' refer to a type of shoes made with [[esparto]], a tough, wiry Mediterranean [[grass]] used in making [[rope]].&lt;ref name="espadrille history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-espadrilles.htm|title=What are Espadrilles?|work=wiseGEEK|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name in the Basque region is ''espartina''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soule-xiberoa.fr/eu/herri-alkargoa/herri-alkargoaren-egitasmueak/industriecommercesartisanat/mauleko-espartina-ateleria.html ''Espartina'' in the official website of the community of Soule municipalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707083122/http://www.soule-xiberoa.fr/eu/herri-alkargoa/herri-alkargoaren-egitasmueak/industriecommercesartisanat/mauleko-espartina-ateleria.html |date=2014-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Francesc Galofré i Oller- Un model- 251.JPG|alt= Traditional espadrille in this painting by de Francesc Galofré. A model,1894|thumb|Traditional espadrille in this painting by de Francesc Galofré. ''A model,''1894]]
Espadrilles have been made in [[Occitania]] region (France) and all over [[Spain]], where they were the usual peasant footwear since the 14th century at least, and are still being produced as from old. The oldest, most primitive form of espadrilles dates as far back as 4000 years ago {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Traditional espadrilles have a [[canvas]] upper with the toe and vamp cut in one piece and seamed to the rope sole at the sides. Often they have laces at the throat that are wrapped around the ankle to hold the shoes securely in place. Traditional espadrilles are worn by both men and women.

==Modern espadrilles==
Once [[peasant]] [[footwear]], then urban workers footwear, espadrilles nowadays have grown in popularity, especially in the French Atlantic coast of the Basque Country and Spanish Mediterranean coast from Granada to Girona, where many men and women wear them during the spring and summer months. Designer espadrilles are now widely available. They are usually manufactured in France, Spain and South Asia. Modern espadrilles are predominantly for women, though some men's shoes are made in this style.

The soles of espadrilles may be flat, platform, or wedge shaped made of [[natural fiber]].  Uppers may be made from nearly any substance and may have open or closed toes, open or closed backs, and can be slip-on or tied to the ankle with laces.  Thousands of varieties of espadrilles can be found, from inexpensive bargain brands to high priced designer brands.

Espadrilles became fashionable in the USA in the 1940s. [[Lauren Bacall]]'s character in the 1948 movie ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' wore ankle-laced espadrilles.

Wedge shaped espadrilles were first popularized by French fashion designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]]. At a trade fair in Paris in 1970, he came into contact with the Spanish espadrille manufacturer [[Castañer]]. Yves Saint Laurent had been looking in vain for months for someone to make him a wedge espadrille. Castañer managed to interpret Yves Saint Laurent's vision and the wedge espadrilles were an instant hit, influencing fashion even today.

The espadrille style was revived in the USA in the 1980s, due to the success of ''[[Miami Vice]]''—the shoe was worn by the character Sonny Crockett (played by [[Don Johnson]]).  In 2013 at luxury shoe stores in New York City, a pair of espadrilles could cost nearly $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/fashion/shoe-battles-going-toe-to-toe-in-stilettos.html|title=Shoe Battles: Going Toe-to-Toe in Stilettos|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Jute sole espadrilles==
Due to cost and material availability, the soles of espadrilles are now commonly made with jute rope or braid. The natural bright white color of jute is a major design feature of modern espadrilles.

[[Bangladesh]] is the producer of high quality jute and has become a manufacturing center for premium quality jute soles and complete espadrilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jute.cotheeka.com/espadrilles/|title=Espadrille|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the world's total production of complete espadrilles, as well as jute soles, is now manufactured in Bangladesh,  although some manufacturers in [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] import jute soles from Bangladesh to finish espadrilles in those countries.  Complete espadrilles are also assembled in [[Argentina]] (known as alpargatas), [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Venezuela]] with imported jute from Bangladesh.

Jute soles typically include fully or partially vulcanized rubber beneath the jute soles for long-lasting espadrille shoes.  Sometimes crepe soles are used as out-soles although those are not as durable compared to vulcanized ones.  Jute braid soles might include heels made of wood or [[EVA foam]].

==Manufacture==
[[File:Fabrication de la semelle d'espadrille.ogv|thumb|Assembling of a jute sole]]
The manufacture of espadrilles is generally more complex than that of sandals. The jute soles are the most critical part.  The jute twines are first machine-braided. These braids are then manually formed into the shape of the sole and  [[hydraulically]] pressed with heat to form the final shape and completed with vertical stitching with Espadrille Needles.&lt;ref&gt;Dritz ES50063&lt;/ref&gt; These basic soles are then [[vulcanized]] underneath.  EVA foam or wooden [[heel]]s are glued in place and more jute braids are wrapped around it to complete the soles. Uppers of different styles are then built on the jute soles to complete the espadrille.&lt;!-- https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/r2QAAOSwfi9ZuA8l/s-l1600.png DR185 Photographie Photo Vintage Snapshot Chapeau Hat Espadrille Femme Woman https://www.ebay.com/itm/332377289558 Type: Tirage argentique noir et blanc d'époque.

{{quote|On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;}}

== American Psychological Association ==
The [[APA Ethics Code]] of the [[American Psychological Association]], a different organization than the American Psychiatric Association, also supports a similar rule. In 2016, in response to the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article "Should Therapists Analyze Presidential Candidates?", American Psychological Association President [[Susan H. McDaniel]] published a letter in ''The'' ''New York Times'' in which she stated:

{{quote|Similar to the psychiatrists' Goldwater Rule, our code of ethics exhorts psychologists to "take precautions" that any statements they make to the media "are based on their professional knowledge, training or experience in accord with appropriate psychological literature and practice" and "do not indicate that a professional relationship has been established" with people in the public eye, including political candidates.

When providing opinions of psychological characteristics, psychologists must conduct an examination "adequate to support statements or conclusions." In other words, our ethical code states that psychologists should not offer a diagnosis in the media of a living public figure they have not examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/response/presidential-candidates.aspx|title=Response to Article on Whether Therapists Should Analyze Presidential Candidates|last=McDaniel|first=Susan H.|date=March 14, 2016|website=American Psychological Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420031828/http://www.apa.org/news/press/response/presidential-candidates.aspx|archive-date=2016-04-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==American Medical Association==

In the fall of 2017, the [[American Medical Association|American Medical Association's]] Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs wrote new guidelines into the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, stating that physicians should refrain "from making clinical diagnoses about individuals (e.g., public officials, celebrities, persons in the news) they have not had the opportunity to personally examine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/default/files/media-browser/public/hod/i17-refcomm-conby.pdf#page=41 |title=Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws |access-date=January 4, 2018 |date=2017 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Stat (website)|Stat]]'' |title=I'm a brain specialist.

== Violations ==
=== Regarding Donald Trump ===

In 2016 and 2017, a number of psychiatrists and [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] faced criticism for violating the Goldwater rule, as they claimed that [[Donald Trump]] displayed "an assortment of [[Personality disorder|personality problems]], including [[grandiosity]], a lack of [[empathy]], and 'malignant [[narcissism]]{{Single double}}, and that he has a "dangerous mental illness", despite having never examined him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/health/analyzing-donald-trump-psychology.html|title=The Psychiatric Question: Is It Fair to Analyze Donald Trump From Afar?|last=Carey|first=Benedict|date=August 15, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 25, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldwatertrump"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/04/21/dozens-of-psychiatry-experts-claim-trump-has-dangerous-mental-i/22049682/|title=Dozens of psychiatry experts claim Trump has 'dangerous mental illness' at controversial conference|first=William|last=Steakin|date=April 21, 2017|accessdate=April 24, 2017|publisher=[[America Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gartner, a practicing psychologist, and the leader of the group Duty to Warn, stated in April 2017 that: "We have an ethical responsibility to warn the public about Donald Trump's dangerous mental illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bulman|first=May|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-dangerous-mental-illness-yale-psychiatrist-conference-us-president-unfit-james-gartner-a7694316.html|title=Donald Trump has 'dangerous mental illness', say psychiatry experts at Yale conference|date=April 21, 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en-GB|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] (APsaA), a different organization from the APA, sent a letter on June 6, 2017, that highlighted differences between the APA and APsaA ethical guidelines, stating that "The American Psychiatric Association's ethical stance on the Goldwater Rule applies to its members only.  APsaA does not consider political commentary by its individual members an ethical matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter | url = http://www.apsa.org/sites/default/files/Harriet_Associaiton_email_July_6_17.pdf |title=Letter| recipient = members | date = July 6, 2017 | publisher = [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] | accessdate =July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo-clarifying"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.yahoo.com/news/clarifying-goldwater-rule-psychotherapists-age-trump-184518946.html | title = Clarifying the 'Goldwater Rule' for psychotherapists in the age of Trump | first = Michael | last = Walsh | work = [[Yahoo News]] | date = July 25, 2017 | accessdate = July 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2017, the website ''[[Stat (website)|Stat]]'' published an article by Sharon Begley, labeled "exclusive" and titled "Psychiatry group tells members they can defy 'Goldwater rule' and comment on Trump's mental health".  The article, with a photograph of Barry Goldwater as the headline image, stated that "A leading psychiatry group has told its members they should not feel bound by a longstanding rule against commenting publicly on the mental state of public figures", first sourcing the statement to the July 6 American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) letter, but also claiming that it "represents the first significant crack in the profession's decades-old united front aimed at preventing experts from discussing the psychiatric aspects of politicians' behavior"; the article then repeatedly referred to the "Goldwater rule", quoted an unnamed source as saying "leadership has been extremely reluctant to make a statement and publicly challenge the American Psychiatric Association", and claimed that an unnamed "official" had said that "Although the American Psychological Association "prefers" that its members not offer opinions on the psychology of someone they have not examined, it does not have a Goldwater rule and is not considering implementing one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/25/psychiatry-goldwater-rule-trump/ | title = Psychiatry group tells members they can defy 'Goldwater rule' and comment on Trump's mental health | first = Sharon | last = Begley | work = [[Stat (website)|Stat]] | date = July 25, 2017 | publisher = [[Boston Globe Media]] | accessdate = July 26, 2017 | dead-url = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170725125258/https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/25/psychiatry-goldwater-rule-trump/ | archivedate = July 25, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;!-- in the spirit of [[WP:BLP]] and [[WP:V]], archive listed for verifiability in case Stat website "refactors" its article later --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.yahoo.com/news/psychiatry-group-tells-members-defy-083037831.html | title = Psychiatry group tells members they can defy 'Goldwater rule' and comment on Trump's mental health | first = Sharon | last = Begley | date = July 25, 2017 | work = [[Yahoo News]] | agency = [[Stat (website)|Stat]] | accessdate = 2017-07-26 }}&lt;!-- in the spirit of [[WP:BLP]] and [[WP:V]], second website's copy of Stat article for verification in case one is taken down --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yahoo News]] reporter Michael Walsh criticized the ''Stat'' article, saying it was "misleading" by stating that the letter "represents the first significant crack": The American Psychiatric Association retains the Goldwater rule, and the APsaA never had the rule and was not changing.&lt;ref name="yahoo-clarifying"/&gt;  Also, even though the APsaA has no Goldwater rule for its members and allows its members to give individual opinions about specific political figures, its Executive Councilors unanimously endorsed a policy that "the APsaA as an organization will speak to issues only, not about specific political figures".&lt;ref name="yahoo-clarifying"/&gt;

'''Idania de Los Angeles Fernandez''', born July 23, 1952 in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]], assassinated in captivity in [[Leon, Nicaragua]] April 16, 1979. Martyr of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. Scholars in US universities have placed her name next to [[Camilo Torres Restrepo]],&lt;ref name="Pascher"&gt;Pascher&lt;/ref&gt; [[Che Guevara]], [[José Martí]]&lt;ref name="Pascher"/&gt; in that they shared a profound sensitivity toward injustice.

==Legacy==
Religious books&lt;ref&gt;Schussler&lt;/ref&gt; and works of columnists and editorials&lt;ref&gt;Seibel&lt;/ref&gt; have been dedicated to her memory. Works of testimonial literature like ''Adios Muchachos'' {{es icon}}, by [[Sergio Ramirez]],&lt;ref&gt;Sergio&lt;/ref&gt; and ''We are all awake'' by Margaret Randall,&lt;ref name="Randall"&gt;Randall&lt;/ref&gt; cite as an example of life. Until today her memory as such is recalled frequently in speeches and editorials in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;Cardenal&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early years==
The second of five children. Lived her early years in [[Leon, Nicaragua]]. She was 3 years old when her family moved to the neighborhood of Subtiava,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manfut.org/leon/sutiava.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the outskirts of Leon. Her birthday coincides with the anniversary of the Somoza's National Guard massacre on college students marching on the streets of Leon in 1956. This is, each birthday of her life was a reminder of Students Martyrs, for it was a day off in schools in Nicaragua by decree. She lived in Managua between age six and ten. In 1962 her family moved to the town of [[Jinotega]]. On Sunday family outings visited San Rafael del Norte and other surrounding towns in the mountains that witnessed Gen. [[Augusto César Sandino]] zaga in the 1930s.

==Education==
Returning to Managua, finished Elementary and High school at the French School of the Sacred Heart between 1965 and 1972,&lt;ref name="oblatas"&gt;oblatas&lt;/ref&gt; the same school attended by prominent personalities in Nicaragua today including ex-President of Nicaragua, [[Violeta Chamorro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2003/10/13/op2MMM1013.htm Oblatas, Cien Aňos, Idania, ''Fundadoras, ...Violeta Chamorro,etc....] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223120702/http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2003/10/13/op2MMM1013.htm |date=2008-12-23 }} (Note:Idania, Far right, second row in the picture)&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Catholic to revolutionary==

Idania developed organizational and leadership skills as a member of the group "Las Metanoias"&lt;ref&gt;Maryknoll&lt;/ref&gt; in Senior High School. The group made spiritual retreat trips to hacienda El Tepeyac,&lt;ref name="oblatas"/&gt; near [[Mombacho]] Volcano and [[Lake Nicaragua]] for study and discussions on the [[Liberation Theology]]. Idania turned an ardent activist and represented her school among a broad base of organizations engaged in demonstrations demanding the release of political prisoners in 1971&amp;ndash;1972. Her activities won her a slap on the face from Sister Nicolle, the school Director, who actually feared for Idania's fate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2003/10/13/op2MMM1013.htm oblatas El Tepeyac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223120702/http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2003/10/13/op2MMM1013.htm |date=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, her family moved to Panama and she started her college education in Economics at the University of Panama. Resumed activism joining the Solidarity Committees in support of the Sandinista Liberation Front prisoners. In 1974 She married David Miranda, a Panamanian-Nicaraguan student of Economics also. In August 1975 she gave birth to daughter Claudia, named after Claudia Chamorro another Sandinista fallen years earlier.

==Reunion with the Sandinista leadership==

Following the successful Sandinista operatives at the Chema Castillo's residence in the 1974 Christmas party with attendance of dictator [[Somoza]]'s Elite, Idania had the opportunity she longed for so long. She was finally able to meet personally the Sandinistas she fought so hard for their release since her school days, upon their arrival to Panama.

Because Idania had residence in Panama since 1973, and many friends, she helped in the logistics to provide accommodations and supplies to the Sandinistas; so much, that she donated her personal belongings (furniture, appliances, books, etc.) to the safe houses in Panama where the Sandinistas were staying. It did not take long for Idania to fit perfectly in the "organization" (as they used to call the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] in Panama where they enjoyed medium security environment.

Idania was considered to participate in the spectacular raid at the National Government Palace in 1978, taking 3000 hostages, which resulted in the release of several [[Sandinistas]] in captivity. Ultimately; [[Dora María Téllez]] was chosen, the only woman in the operative, named after [[Rigoberto López Pérez]].

==Military training==
In 1978 following the popular insurrection in Monimbo, Masaya, 78), Idania decided to join full-time the ranks of the FSLN Command in Panama and Costa Rica, where she frequently met with members of the "Direccion Nacional", the highest ranking of that organization. She trained in Cuba in rocket launching in the middle of 1978. General [[Omar Torrijos]], and the people of Panama, did not like the Somoza dictatorship and offered logistic support to the Sandinistas and also military training in the Province of Chiriqui (Panama) and she also trained there among other young cadres.

==Wounded in the Southern Front==
[[Image:Angela 1.jpg|thumb|Idania wounded in the Southern Front, September 1978]]
Between 1975 and 1978 Idania made trips to Nicaragua and [[Costa Rica]] on clandestine missions, including one trip to the Northern Front and different operatives, but in September 1978 she was wounded in combat on the left hand in Nicaragua near the southern border. She was taken initially to a Costa Rican hospital near the border, and her pictures appeared in Costa Rican newspapers front page referring to her only as "Angela", respecting her identity. Fearing for her security at the Hospital, [[Sergio Ramirez]]'s wife picked her up and took her to a Sandinista makeshift hospital in Nicaragua near the border.&lt;ref name="Ramírez 81,82"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcQFAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Sergio+Ramirez+Adios+Muchachos&amp;lr=&amp;ei=B2ufSP2rEJfEigGo45z7BA |title=Adiós muchachos: una memoria de la revolución sandinista |first=Sergio |last=Ramírez |page= 81,82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her return to Panama, the Panamanian military had assigned Secret Service security personnel to high ranking or identifiable Sandinistas including Idania. She could no longer use her real name or passport on her missions to Nicaragua either, or visit public places in Panama without escort. She was also required to carry a high caliber Magnum pistol in her purse at all times, which she did.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"&gt;Ramirez&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of spontaneous uprisings in Monimbo, Matagalpa, Estelí and other cities, where the Sandinistas were forced to fight in support of the people's uprising, rather than the opposite, a major shift in Sandinista strategy was developed. In order to take the lead of the Insurrection, two major Insurrectional Commands were organized; the Frente Interno in Managua and the Western command in the city of Leon. Idania was assigned to the newly formed Western Insurrectional Command, which required experience with the communities and base organizations ("trabajo de barrios"), worker unions, students, religious groups and organizing the neighborhoods for the final offensive.&lt;ref name="Ramírez 81,82"/&gt;

==Plans for a final insurrection and a new government junta==
In February 1979, [[Omar Torrijos]], head of the Panamenian government invited the Grupo de [[Los Doce]], prominent Nicaraguan businessmen backing up the Sandinistas, for talks in Panama. By this time, arms shipments from Venezuela and Cuba were under way. Dr. Joaquin Cuadra, a member of [[Los Doce]] and whose son [[Joaquin Cuadra]], leader of the Frente Interno Sandinista Command, was in Nicaragua, invited Idania and Oscar Perez Cassar for the talks and dinner. Idania and Oscar were also members of the Frente Interno, and scheduled to go back to Nicaragua via Honduras, to assume the leadership of the Western Regional Command for the final Insurrection. [[Sergio Ramirez]], also a member of [[Los Doce]] and a member of the upcoming Government Junta, relates that Idania attended with her hand still bandaged from surgery after her wounds in September.&lt;ref name="Ramírez 81,82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

In March 1979, Idania went back to Nicaragua to resume her new post in the Western Regional Command, the leading Commando of the Insurrection, and was prepared to stay indefinitely until victory or death, as a member of the ill-fated Insurrectional Command "[[Rigoberto López Pérez]]" headed by [[Dora Maria Tellez]]. In late 1978 the Somoza's National Guard had been killing the population without mercy in the towns of Leon, Masaya, Estelí by aerial bombing, reported by the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Genv. Conv.&lt;/ref&gt; That was too much to bear for the [[Sandinistas]]. It was about time to finish the Somoza's regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/country-reports/nicaragua1978-ch2.html Ref. Univ. Of Minn. Genev. Conv. Red Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Swan Over the Burning Coals==
Title chosen by [[Sergio Ramirez]] for the chapter of his book "''Adios Muchachos''" dedicated to the memory of the events the day that shook the entire City of Leon, specially, and the rest of the country. On April 16, 1979 the Sandinista war was escalating fast. Combats were taking place in more than twenty cities in Nicaragua. However; most of the leaders of the soon to be Revolutionary Government were in Costa Rica or Panama in safe houses. Their role was to provide the military strategy, negotiations with foreign governments and sketching a plan for the new an imminent Nicaraguan Government Junta. The war was actually run in the field by five Regional Commands. The most important ones were the Western Command based in the City of Leon and the Frente Interno, based in Managua. They were considered critical for a fast victory. The Regional Commands had the future of Nicaragua at hand.

On that day, the Members of the Western Regional Command integrated by Oscar Perez Cassar, Idania Fernandez, Araceli Perez Darias, Ana Isabel Morales, Edgard Lang Sacasa, Roger Deshon Arguello and Carlos Manuel Jarquin were in session in a safe house in the suburbs of Leon. The National Guard was attacking heavily the City of [[Estelí]], near the mountains and they were coordinating the efforts to help them. Reportedly, there was a whistleblower, a supposedly former Sandinista militia who turned police informant. The informant and eighty members of the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|National Guard]], in jeeps and tanks, surrounded the block, and stormed into the house. The Sandinistas had no chance to escape or to grab their weapons. Ana Isabel put an apron on, grabbed a child form an adjacent house, and passed herself off as a domestic. She was the only survivor. The informant identified positively the men as important cadre, but he argued not knowing the women. So, all men were executed on the spot, Idania and Araceli were arrested, taken to the Fortin of Acosasco, tortured and murdered.&lt;ref name="Randall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=hc1HV7jWZNUC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Idania+fernandez&amp;ei=W5SeSK-aCaHOjgHcvPH6BA&amp;sig=ACfU3U2EZa0d8XvlZz8Gpa53vswcNFGA1w#PPA243,M1 Randall Interview Dora M Tellez Idania, Roger, Aracely, six important members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aftermath==
Thousands attended their funeral. The entire city of Leon (not to mention the Sandinista ranks at all levels) was enraged. The Somoza government refused to return Araceli's (who was Mexican) remains to her family. Idania's parents and two youngest sisters were living in Dallas, Texas, and contacted the Dallas Morning News. The paper dedicated a full page article on the events in the Sunday edition. Edgard Lang Sacasa was 23 and he was the son of a first cousin to dictator Somoza and a friend of a Wall Street Journal columnist, and this prompted an editorial.

Soon after, as expected, the city of Leon street fighters headed by [[Dora Maria Tellez]], Idania's comrade, increased greaty in numbers and firepower. In June the victory over the Somoza forces in Leon was complete, followed by Managua, two weeks later, and the Somoza regime went with it.

==The Legacy==
"I leave you an example of life, mine", wrote Idania to her daughter in her farewell letters. Reprinted in Margaret Randall's book ''Todas Estamos Despiertas''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Randall&lt;/ref&gt;
and many columnists' and editorial pages in Nicaragua countless times over the last twenty nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez&lt;/ref&gt;
Ernesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez and other dissidents of the Sandinistas often quote Idania's writings and ideals. This is a true legacy and probably the best.

After her death, Idania firepower increased thousandfold. In 1984, at the peak of the [[Contras|Contra]] war, one of the largest battalions of the [[Sandinista People's Army]] (Ejército Popular Sandinista), dispatched to the Northern Front to fight the Contras, was named after her.

Occasionally, they name a nursery or police station after Idania but there are no monuments or statues for her in Nicaragua. She would probably have liked it this way.

== Features ==
There are several methodologies for indexing:&lt;ref name="software"/&gt;
* [[Index (publishing)#Embedded indexing|Embedded indexing]] includes the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.
* '''Tagging''' allow indexing codes to be embedded in the text after the indexing is complete. The indexer inserts numbered dummy tags in the files, and then builds the index separately
* Most [[Word processor]]s have integrated automated indexing functions. These tools build a concordance or word lists from processed files. They have often limited usage.

== List of tools ==
The most well-known indexing tools are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indexers.org.uk/files/publications/Indexing%20Software%20programs%20v2.pdf |title=DEDICATED INDEXING SOFTWARE: WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU |publisher=indexers.org |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''Intelligent falling''' ('''IF''') is a [[parody]] of the [[intelligent design]] (ID) movement. It is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[supernatural]] explanation of the effects of [[gravitation|gravity]]. The joke originated on [[Usenet]], and has appeared in several online parodies. An article about Intelligent Falling in ''[[The Onion]]'' described free fall as being caused by "the hand of God".&lt;ref name=theonion /&gt;

==Summary==
Intelligent Falling proposes that the [[science|scientific]] explanation of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] cannot explain all aspects of the [[phenomenon]], so credence should be given to the idea that things fall because a higher intelligence is moving them.  Furthermore, IF asserts that theories explaining [[gravity]] are not internally consistent nor mathematically reconcilable with [[quantum mechanics]], making gravity a "theory in crisis".  IF also makes the claim that gravity is "only a theory", parodying the claims made by [[Creationism|creationists]] regarding the [[Evolution as fact and theory|theoretical status of evolution]]. IF apologists jokingly advocate that IF should be taught in school along with the theory of gravity so that students can make "an informed decision" on the subject in a parody of the demands to "[[Teach the Controversy|teach the controversy]]".&lt;ref name=theonion /&gt;

==History==
In June 2002 a user named Jeff Stubbs posted a draft of a letter to the editor that mentions "intelligent grappling" to the alt.atheism and talk.origins usenet groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|message-id=140620021018451922%mandos5@lycos.com|newsgroup=alt.atheism|author=Jeff Stubbs|date=14 June 2002 |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/alt.atheism/NNW8exUOu7Y/EoBKW2xuw5IJ|title=letter to editor (was Greensburg Salem curriculum) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that "I don't like the theory of gravity, I feel personally insulted that engineers design structures only considering physical mass. What about our souls? I propose that science classes also teach the theory of "Intelligent Grappling". There's no way a weak force such as gravity can possibly hold everything onto the planet. [[Occasionalism|It must be God]],  using our souls, to hold everything together." This was followed by [[Elf Sternberg]] posting a "FAQ on intelligent grappling" on the sci.skeptic usenet group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/group/sci.skeptic/msg/28ebb87902c8ecba?dmode=source&amp;hl=en|message-id=1024441816.691379@yasure|newsgroup=sci.skeptic|title=Gravity is God given|author=Elf Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

'''Interactive storytelling''' (also known as '''interactive drama''') is a form of digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined. The author creates the setting, characters, and situation which the narrative must address, but the user (also reader or player) experiences a unique story based on their interactions with the story world. The architecture of an interactive storytelling program includes a drama manager, user model, and agent model to control, respectively, aspects of narrative production, player uniqueness, and character knowledge and behavior.{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012|page=28}} Together, these systems generate characters that act "human," alter the world in real-time reactions to the player, and ensure that new narrative events unfold comprehensibly.

The field of study surrounding interactive storytelling encompasses many disparate fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[natural language processing]], [[user interface design]], [[computer science]], and emergent intelligence. They fall under the umbrella term of [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI), at the intersection of hard science and the humanities.{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012|page=21}} The difficulty of producing an effective interactive storytelling system is attributed to the ideological division between professionals in each field: artists have trouble constraining themselves to logical and linear systems and programmers are disinclined to appreciate or incorporate the abstract and unproven concepts of the humanities.{{sfn|Crawford|2012}}

==Definition==
What characteristics distinguish an interactive story from another form of [[interactive media]] is subject to much debate. Interactivity and storytelling are both [[polysemic]] terms, and the phrase "interactive storytelling" does not inherently distinguish it from other kinds of storytelling, many of which are already interactive to some extent. Some of the literature associated with the term "interactive storytelling" is actually about [[transmedia storytelling]], which is not a form of entertainment, but a marketing strategy for building a compelling [[brand]] across digital platforms. Varying levels of interactivity are a function of the "relatedness of transmitted messages with previous exchanges of information where sender and receiver roles become interchangeable." {{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Storytelling, in this case, refers to the process of active creation and authoring rather than the final product and its passive reception. Interactive storytelling by this definition can entail any media that allows the user to generate several unique dramatic narratives. Though its final goal is a fully unauthored AI environment with a comprehensive human-level understanding of narrative construction (i.e., the [[Holodeck]]), projects that use branching stories and variable gates are considered experimental prototypes in the same genre.{{sfn|Szilas|2004}}

Interactive storytelling is defined as distinct from [[interactive fiction]] (or IF), as well as video games with strong narrative focus ([[Mass Effect]], [[BioShock]], etc.), by [[Sense of agency|user agency]] and [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|open-ended narrative]]. [[David Gaider]], an RPG developer at [[BioWare]], stated that "every possible branch needs to be written and fully realized, even if not every player sees it, and thus any game which allows for a lot of player choice becomes a much more expensive proposition for a developer." {{sfn|Chapple|2014}} IF and video games, to balance user choice with authorial effort, must constrain the directions the narrative can take with puzzles, battles, or unchangeable plot points and bottlenecks, all of which detract from a sense of immersion. {{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} Only the most critical of the user's narrative choices are used or remembered in narrative development, according to the need to fulfill specific player goals that define a "gameplay" experience.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=24}} A true IS system would incorporate all of them, as do living human agents, simultaneously and continuously - a task only artificial intelligence can meet. {{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Sandbox games like ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', which do involve extensive AI-based social interaction, do not manage dramatic tension or produce a cohesive narrative .{{sfn|Rauch|2006|p=86}}

To Mateas and Stern, creators of ''[[Façade (interactive story)|Façade]]'' and ''The Party'', interactive storytelling is best understood as interactive theater, in that its goal is dramatic meaning rather than fun.{{sfn|Rauch|2006}} It was [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] who coined the term interactive storytelling in the 90s, arguing that IS is not a video game with a narrative, and that a game and IS cannot be combined successfully.{{sfn|Crawford|2012}} Because of limited technology and the amount of work required, it is still difficult to combine a robust interactive storytelling system and a game engine without detracting from the effectiveness of both.

Emerging voices in the field, however, argue for the possibilities of adding narrative complexity and realistic characters to existing video game genres. Using MADE (Massive Artificial Drama Engine), a team of AI researchers developed a [[Genetic Algorithm]] to guide emergent behavior for secondary non-player characters (NPCs) based on [[literary archetypes]] .{{sfn|García-Ortega|García-Sanchez|Mora|Merelo|2014}} In the open-source AI engine of [[Skyrim|TES: Skyrim]], this was tested to elaborate on the mechanistic behavior of townspeople:
{{Quote|text=...hungry inhabitants could become thieves, guards could pursue the thieves, villagers could fall in love with others, or different war alliances could emerge.|author=García-Ortega et al.|source=''My life as a sim: evolving unique and engaging life stories using virtual worlds'', 2014}}

== History ==
Early attempts to understand interactive storytelling date back to the 1970s with such efforts as [[Roger Schank]]'s research at Northwestern University and the experimental program TaleSpin .{{sfn|Meehan|1977}} In the early 1980s Michael Liebowitz developed "Universe", a conceptual system for a kind of interactive storytelling. In 1986, [[Brenda Laurel]] published her PhD dissertation, "Toward the Design of a Computer-Based Interactive Fantasy System."{{sfn|Lauren|1986}}

During the 1990s, a number of research projects began to appear, such as the Oz Project led by Dr. Joseph Bates and [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the Software Agents group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the Improv Project led by Ken Perlin at [[New York University]], and the Virtual Theater group at Stanford, led by Dr. Barbara Hayes-Roth.

There were also a number of conferences touching upon these subjects, such as the Workshop on Interactive Fiction &amp; Synthetic Realities in 1990; Interactive Story Systems: Plot &amp; Character at Stanford in 1995; the AAAI Workshop on AI and Entertainment, 1996; Lifelike Computer Characters, Snowbird, Utah, October 1996; the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents at Marina del Rey, CA. February 5–8, 1997.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The first conference to directly address the research area was the 1st International Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment, which took place in March 2003 and focused specifically on concepts and first prototypes for automated storytelling and autonomous characters, including modeling of emotions and the user experience.{{sfn|Göbel|2004}} The concepts were developed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], in his 2005 book.{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}

In the 2000s, work on interactive storytelling and related topics expanded, and was presented at events including the alternating bi-yearly conferences, TIDSE (Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment) and ICVS (International Conference on Virtual Storytelling), hosted in Germany and France, respectively. TIDSE and ICVS were superseded by ICIDS (International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling), a yearly event established in 2008.{{sfn|ICIDS}}

The first published interactive storytelling software that was widely recognized as the "real thing" was ''[[Façade (interactive story)|Façade]]'', created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. The system was publicly released in 2006, {{sfn|Mateas|Stern|2003}} and was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance Independent Games Festival]].{{sfn|Christensen|2006}}

== Strategies ==
The architecture of an interactive storytelling system has three component parts: a drama manager, a user model, and an agent model. The drama manager is responsible for guiding the narrative by searching and executing story "beats" in a coherent sequence, refining story events by providing new information and reconciling contradictory plots, and collaborating with the agent model to choose the best narrative actions for the characters .{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} It monitors a number of overview variables in the storyworld to make the best decision for the narrative, defined by the goals of the author: a measure of worldwide conflict would help to increase or decrease dramatic tension, while measures of relationships and likability could guide a story towards a romantic storyline. {{sfn|Crawford|2012|p=210}} The agent model collects information about the story world and characters and generates possible actions in response for each non-player character in the story. Possible actions are drawn from the personality and emotional model of the character, allowing each one to exhibit autonomous behavior with intelligent dramatic goals .{{sfn|Bostan|Marsh|2012}} Finally, the user model keeps track of player choices and inputs, such that the drama manager and agent model can cooperate with the way the user attempts to play rather than challenging or misunderstanding their decisions.

Crawford discusses three potential strategies for developing interactive storytelling systems.  Firstly, environmental approaches are those which take an interactive system, such as a computer game, and encourage the actions of a user in such a way as to form a coherent plot.  With a sufficiently complex system, emergent behavior may form story-like behavior regardless of the user's actions.

Secondly, data-driven strategies have a library of "story components" which are sufficiently general that they can be combined smoothly in response to a user's actions (or lack thereof). This approach has the advantage of being more general that the directed environmental approach, at the cost of a much larger initial investment.

Finally, language-based approaches require that the user and system share some, very limited, domain-specific language so that they can react to each other and the system can 'understand' a greater proportion of the users actions. Crawford suggests approaches that only use, for example, pictorial languages or restricted versions of English.{{sfn|Crawford|2005|loc=Ch.8-10}}

Planning-based systems can be integrated into any of the above approaches to ensure narrative cohesion. The system does this by anticipating potential holes in the plot and repairing them by introducing new information and events. Two such systems include Automated Story Director (ASD), which forms narrative repairs based on plot points predefined by the author, and Player-Specific Automated Storytelling (PAST), which chooses from several possible repairs according to the player's previous behaviors.{{sfn|Ramirez|Bulitko|Spetch|2013}} PAST characterizes a player along five vectors of style based on [[Robin Laws]]' work on player types—fighter, power gamer, storyteller, method actor, and tactician—and may choose to solve a broken plot point for a fighter by adding a battle with a new character, or for a storyteller by adding new background information that justifies the break.

From the background of a multimedia author, media director and designer Eku Wand describes further strategies which are related to structure, space, time and perspective.{{sfn|Wand|2002}}{{sfn|Rieser|Zapp|2002|pp=163–178}} {{elucidate|date=January 2017}}

== Evaluation ==
The success of an interactive storytelling experience depends on a balanced [[dramatic structure]] and user agency. A dramatically interesting narrative experience is one that moderates tension between characters and events over time, such that conflicts arise logically and are not left without resolution. It must also differ noticeably on every "playthrough" as a function of the user's freedom to interact with characters and objects in the virtual world.{{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} This can be achieved to varying degrees of success by branching, emergent, character-driven, and plot-driven systems, but no existing system fully achieves a lifelike experience. AIs do not yet have a human grasp of the rules of drama and narrative, so existing interactive dramas produce a limited number of significantly different story outcomes, relative to the amount of labor required of the author.

There have been several attempts at formalizing an evaluation system for interactive dramas, despite the fact that all existing projects are still in experimental stages. Player agency and fun remain the primary concerns, though fun is often exchanged for more narrative-specific metrics, like "interestingness" and "suspense."{{sfn|Ramirez|Bulitko|Spetch|2013|p=66}} Likert scales filled out by players create a rough quantitative picture of user experience, but leave out much of the subjective interpretation that lies behind complex human interactions.

Mehta et al. focused on conversation-centric systems to develop qualitative metrics for the user's successful engagements, instead of quantitative measures of "inappropriate utterances" (in which the AI misunderstands player input and responds nonsensically) and other technical failures.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=25}} After a "breakdown" in conversation, how effectively the user incorporates it into the overall understanding of the characters and story depends on design features. In their study of Façade, some AI actor breakdowns include shallow semantic understanding, inverted meanings, and the timing of responses. Artificially intelligent agents have trouble translating ambiguous user input into the limited narrative meaning system, as when "sad" or "hurt" is interpreted only as a reference to clinical depression.{{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=29}} Similarly, negative and positive user sentiments are often confused with one another, especially if a positive statement is preceded by disagreement with a negative one. This is exacerbated if a user cannot send a reply fast enough - their utterance is understood as referring to the most recent speaker, leading to unintended interactions. However, background information is referenced often enough for a player to invent narrative justifications for apparently strange behaviors, which most participants did. {{sfn|Mehta|Dow|Mateas|MacIntyre|2007|p=30}}

== Projects ==

=== The Oz Project ===
''The Oz Project'' was an attempt in the early 1990s to use intelligent agent technology to attack the challenges in IS. Its architecture included a simulated physical world, several characters, an interactor, a theory of presentation, and a drama manager. {{sfn|The Oz Project Homepage}} Users communicated with the system using either a text based or graphical interface .{{sfn|Mateas|1997}}{{sfn|Kelso|Weyrauch|Bates|1993}}

=== Façade ===
{{Main article|Façade (interactive story)|l1=Façade}}
''Façade'' is an artificial-intelligence-based approach created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. It was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival and is recognized as the first true interactive storytelling software. It is text based and uses natural language processing and other artificial intelligence routines to direct the action .{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}{{sfn|Mateas|Stern|2003}}

=== HEFTI ===
The ''Hybrid Evolutionary-Fuzzy Time-based Interactive'' (HEFTI) storytelling system was produced at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and uses genetic algorithms to recombine and evaluate story components generated from a set of story templates.&lt;ref&gt;A genetic algorithm approach to interactive narrative generation, JJ Leggett and T. J. Ong - Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM conference, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crawford described it as the "wrong approach to development systems [...] incomprehensible to the kind of creative talent needed for storytelling," {{sfn|Crawford|2005}} it continues to be discussed as a research and approach and genetic algorithm continue to be considered a potential tool for use in the area.

=== Library of story traces ===
Figa and Tarau have used [[WordNet]] to build technologies useful to interactive storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;WordNet, wordnet.princeton.edu/, retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This approach defines 'story traces' as an abstract reduction (or skeleton) of a story, and 'story projection' as a fragment of a story that can be treated as a single dramatic building block. This work seeks to build up large repositories of narrative forms in such a way that these forms can later be combined .{{sfn|Crawford|2005}}

=== Interactive narrative design ===
As defined by [[Stephen Dinehart]], Interactive narrative design combines [[ludology]], [[narratology]] and [[game design]] to form interactive entertainment development methodologies. Interactive entertainment experiences allow the player to witness data as navigable, participatory, and dramatic in real-time:{{sfn|Dinehart|2009c}} “a narratological craft which focuses on the [[structuralism|structuralist]], or [[literary]] [[semiotic]] creation of stories." Interactive Narrative design seeks to accomplish this via viewer/user/player (VUP) navigated dataspaces {{sfn|Dinehart|2009a}}

Interactive narrative design focuses on creating meaningful participatory story experiences with interactive systems. The aim is to transport the player through play into the videogame (dataspace) using their visual and auditory senses.{{sfn|Dinehart|2009b}} When interactive narrative design is successful, the VUP (viewer/user/player) believes that they are experiencing a story.{{sfn|Dinehart|2009c}}

=== Summary table {{sfn|Arinbjarnar|Barber|Kudenko|2009}} ===
Story possibilities are not precisely calculable, and are represented as orders, such that O(10) would be in the order of tens of stories, and O(1) would be fewer than 10 unique story possibilities.

"'''Jewish Princess'''" is a song by [[Frank Zappa]] released on his album ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' in 1979. The song is a humorous look at the [[Jewish-American princess stereotype]] which attracted attention from the [[Anti-Defamation League]], to which Zappa denied an apology, arguing: "Unlike the unicorn, such creatures do exist — and deserve to be 'commemorated' with their own special opus". In an interview with ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine he was almost offended saying, "…as if to say there is no such thing as a Jewish Princess. Like I invented this?"&lt;ref name="LLC1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=SPIN Media LLC|title=SPIN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbkGT02oWs4C&amp;pg=PA91|date=July 1991|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|pages=91–|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer Barry Miles claimed in his book, ''Frank Zappa'' (Atlantic Books of London, 2005), that the ADL asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ban the record from being played on the air – a symbolic effort given that the song was not being played anyway. This led to the rumor that a legal action had been filed against Zappa, a charge he vehemently denied in a CNN interview on "The Freeman Report" show of October 26, 1981.&lt;ref name="killuglyradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killuglyradio.com/2010/01/01/zappa-on-freeman-report-cnn-october-26th-1981/|title=Zappa on &amp;#8220;Freeman Report&amp;#8221; CNN &amp;#8211; October 26th, 1981 &amp;#124; Kill Ugly Radio|publisher=killuglyradio.com|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa claimed that offensive songs such as this are why ''Sheik Yerbouti'' became one of his best selling albums of all time. Although it had little play in concert, it was included on Zappa's theme collection ''[[Have I Offended Someone?]]''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Real Frank Zappa Book|author1=Zappa, F.|author2=Occhiogrosso, P.|date=1990|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9780671705725|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA226|pages=1–226|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/jewish-princess-mt0002453060|title=Jewish Princess - Frank Zappa &amp;#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review &amp;#124; AllMusic|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Karkazis published her first book, ''[[Fixing Sex]]'', on the medical treatment and lived experience of intersex people. Since publication of ''Fixing Sex'' and co-authoring a 2012 journal article on sex testing in sport, ''Out of Bounds'', Karkazis has widely written and been quoted as an expert on issues of informed consent, bodily diversity, testosterone, and access to sport. Media coverage of sport issues includes [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', often in collaboration with [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]].&lt;ref&gt;Articles:

In 2015, Karkazis testified before the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)]] in the case of ''[[Dutee Chand]] v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) &amp; The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF)'', and in July 2015 the CAS issued a decision to suspend its [[sex verification in sports|sex verification]] policy on excluding women athletes with [[hyperandrogenism]] (high levels of testosterone) due to insufficient evidence of a link between high androgen levels and improved athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Fagan| first = Kate| authorlink = Kate Fagan (sportswriter) | title = Katie Ledecky is crushing records, so why are we still worried about Caster Semenya?| work = [[ESPN]]| accessdate = 2016-08-27| date = August 13, 2016| url = http://www.espn.com/espnw/voices/article/17275159/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Padawer| first = Ruth| title = The Humiliating Practice of Sex-Testing Female Athletes| work = [[The New York Times]]| accessdate = 2016-08-27| date = June 28, 2016 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court allowed two further years for convincing evidence to be submitted by the IAAF, after which the regulation will be automatically revoked if evidence has not been provided.&lt;ref name=NYTRuling&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branch|first1=John|title=Dutee Chand, Female Sprinter With High Testosterone Level, Wins Right to Compete|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/sports/international/dutee-chand-female-sprinter-with-high-male-hormone-level-wins-right-to-compete.html?_r=0|accessdate=27 July 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===

''[[Fixing Sex| Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]]'', published by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008 presents a history of the medical treatment and lived experience of intersex people and their families. The book has been well received by both clinicians and intersex groups. Gary Berkovitz, writing in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] states that Karkazis's analysis is fair, compelling, and eloquent.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805101 | volume=360 | title=Book Review Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience By Katrina Karkazis. 365 pp. Durham, NC, Duke University Press, 2008. $84.95 (cloth); $23.95 (paper). 978-0-8223-4302-8 (cloth); 978-0-8223-4318-9 (paper). | year=2009 | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | page=1683 | last1 = Berkovitz | first1 = Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Reis, reviewing the book in [[American Journal of Bioethics]], states that the book "masterfully examines the concerns and fears of all those with a stake in the intersex debate: physicians, parents, intersex adults, and activists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15265160902790617 | volume=9 | title=Review of Katrina Karkazis,Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience1 | year=2009 | journal=The American Journal of Bioethics | pages=105–106 | last1 = Reis | first1 = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mijeon, in [[American Journal of Human Genetics]] writes that the "conclusion is quite fitting", "the history of thinking about the body ... can be highly politicized and controversial".&lt;ref name="mijeon"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.04.022 | volume=84 | title=Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience | year=2009 | journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics | page=717 | PMC=2694968 | issue=6 | last1 = Migeon | first1 = Claude J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Copeland MD, former president of the [[Pediatric endocrinology|Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society]] describes the book as, "Masterfully balancing all aspects of one of the most polarizing, contentious topics in medicine... the most recent authoritative treatise on intersex."&lt;ref name="scbe" /&gt; Intersex community organization [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] regards the book as "approachable," "compelling and recommended reading",&lt;ref name="oii-au"&gt;[http://oii.org.au/5849/fixing-sex-karkazis/ Katrina Karkazis, "Fixing Sex" (recommended reading)], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was subsequently cited by the [[Senate of Australia]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="oii-au" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia], Community Affairs Committee, [[Senate of Australia]], October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer-reviewed publications ===

In ''Out of Bounds? A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes'', a collaborative article with [[Georgiann Davis]], [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], and Silvia Camporesi, published in 2012 in the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]'', they argue that a new sex testing policy by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15265161.2012.680533 | pmid=22694023 | pmc=5152729 | volume=12 | title=Out of bounds?

In ''Emotionally and cognitively informed consent for clinical care for differences of sex development'', co-authored with [[Anne Tamar-Mattis]], Arlene Baratz, and Katherine Baratz Dalke and published in 2013, the authors write that "physicians continue to recommend certain irreversible treatments for children with differences of sex development (DSD) without adequate psychosocial support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/19419899.2013.831215 | volume=5 | title=Emotionally and cognitively informed consent for clinical care for differences of sex development | year=2013 | journal=Psychology &amp; Sexuality| pages=44–55 | last1 = Tamar-Mattis | first1 = Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''What’s in a Name? The Controversy over “Disorders of Sex Development”'', co-authored with Ellen Feder and published in 2008, the authors state that "tracing "the history of the terminology applied to those with atypical sex anatomy reveals how these conditions have been narrowly cast as problems of gender to the neglect of broader health concerns and of the well-being of affected individuals."&lt;ref&gt;"What’s in a Name? The Controversy over ‘Disorders of Sex Development’", Ellen K. Feder and Katrina Karkazis, Hastings Center Report 38, no. 5 (2008): 33- 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Karkazis and Feder also collaborated in ''Naming the problem: disorders and their meanings'', published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming the problem: disorders and their meanings'', Katrina Karkazis and Ellen Feder, ''[[The Lancet]]'', Vol 372 December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard James Arrington''' (July 2, 1917 – February 11, 1999) was an American author, academic and the founder of the [[Mormon History Association]].  He is known as the "Dean of Mormon History"&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; and "the Father of Mormon History"&lt;ref name=jwha/&gt; because of his many influential contributions to the field. He was the first [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1972 to 1982, and was director of the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]] from 1982 until 1986. 
 
Arrington grew up in a large family in Idaho, where he and his family were members of the LDS Church. After high school, he studied [[agricultural economics]] at the [[University of Idaho]] and continued studying economics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. While teaching at the [[Utah State Agricultural College]] in [[Logan, Utah]], [[Harvard University Press]] published his book ''Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900'' in 1958. After a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright professorship]] at the [[University of Genoa]] in Italy, Arrington raised funds to pay for research and writing on LDS (Mormon) biographies. He taught Western American History at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) from 1972 to 1987.

In conjunction with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed as the first Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It was the first time a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's [[Priesthood Correlation Program|Correlation Program]] and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, [[G. Homer Durham]], required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]]. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.

Arrington donated his research and personal papers to Utah State University, and also donated microfilms of his pre-1982 diaries to the LDS Church Archives, with the condition that the diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection was given to the LDS Church Archives.

==Early life==
Leonard Arrington was born in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]] on July 2, 1917, the third of eleven children.&lt;ref name="Topping"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Topping|first1=Gary|title=Leonard J. Arrington: A Historian's Life|date=2008|publisher=The Arthur C. Clark Company; University of Oklahoma|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=9780870623639}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} His parents, Noah and Edna, were farmers and devout [[Latter-day Saints]], the most well-known branch of Mormonism. Arrington grew up as an aspiring farmer and active member and one of the first national officers of the [[National FFA Organization]].&lt;ref name=USUpapers&gt;{{Cite archival metadata

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his FFA independent project, he raised several hundred [[Rhode Island Red]] chickens and won a prize for them at the Idaho State Fair in 1934.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|32}} The chicken project helped him win a [[Union Pacific Railroad]] scholarship.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Arrington was also a member of the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] and read books by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], naturalist co-founder of the Boy Scouts. In the summers, he slept outside in the family orchard to have a quiet place to read and enjoyed an idyllic country life. On one evening observing nature, Arrington had a transcendent experience where he felt "an intimate kinship with the world" which he said "made it easy for me [...] to integrate personal religious experiences and intuitions with the more formal affirmations, practices, forms, and ceremonies of the organized church."&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|29–30}}

During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Arrington was curious about the price of potatoes and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Education==
Arrington's father offered to pay for Arrington to serve as an [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionary]], but not for a university education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Under a scholarship to the [[University of Idaho]], Arrington studied [[agricultural science]] in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics.&lt;ref name=2004Kingdom&gt;{{cite book|author=Walker, Ronald W.| authorlink=Ronald W. Walker |title=Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900; New Edition|chapter=Introduction to the Illinois Edition|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jzg-ZMna724C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12|nopp=true|isbn=978-0-252-07283-3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|36}} One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of [[Alfred Marshall]] and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Arrington graduated cum laude and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|37}} Arrington then began graduate work under a Kenan teaching fellowship at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|37}} and married Grace Fort in 1942.&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; Grace joined the LDS Church in 1946.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

In [[World War II]], he served in the Army in North Africa and Italy from 1942 to 1945. He worked in the [[Prisoner of war|prisoner-of-war]] processing division and for [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italy's Institute of Statistics]].&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; While stationed at a [[Prisoner-of-war camp]] for Italian prisoners in North Africa, Arrington reported having another transcendent experience after reading ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. He reported feeling that God wanted him to become a teacher and a writer about religion and economics.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|39}}

==Academic career==
[[File:Old Main Utah St Univ.jpg|thumb|Utah State University]]
He was a professor at Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, Utah (which became [[Utah State University]] in 1957) from 1946 to 1972. He completed a PhD in economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1952, taking a year's leave from teaching and moving to North Carolina to complete his coursework. Arrington easily completed the coursework and examinations, as he had already been teaching much of the material, and published several articles in the meantime.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

In 1958, [[Harvard University Press]] published Arrington's ''Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900'', based on his doctoral dissertation, ''Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847–1900''.&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; ''Great Basin Kingdom'' was published through a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which subsidized publication of books about economic history. Under the grant, all royalties went back into the fund to help publish more books; Arrington did not receive royalties from the book until the University of Utah reprinted it in 1993.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

Arrington completed much of the research for ''Great Basin Kingdom'' in the LDS Church library archives.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|41}} Aware of the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]]'s hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using [[Multipart stationery|carbon copy paper]], enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into ''Great Basin Kingdom'', Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]].&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

In ''Great Basin Kingdom'', Arrington traces the Mormon pioneer practices of "central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory" to the democratic theory of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning.&lt;ref name="Great Basin"&gt;{{cite book

May]] and [[Donald Worster]] criticized ''Great Basin Kingdom'' for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|84}} One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements to a lack of empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. [[Dale Morgan|Dale L. Morgan]], though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|95–96}} The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt;

From 1958 to 1959, he was a Fulbright Professor of American Economics at the University of Genoa in Italy.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Leonard J. Arrington, 81, Mormon Historian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/us/leonard-j-arrington-81-mormon-historian.html|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=The New York Times|date=13 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from Italy, Arrington arranged for donations from patrons to fund the writing of Mormon biographies. Much of these biographies were researched and written by graduate students and other assistants, but published under Arrington's name with acknowledgements of the student work.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|97}} Also in 1959, Arrington wrote an article featured in the first issue of [[BYU Studies Quarterly|''BYU Studies'']] entitled "An Economic Interpretation of 'The Word of Wisdom.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|date=1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article argued that [[Brigham Young]]'s enforcement of the Word of Wisdom as a commandment was motivated by a desire to keep cash inside Utah (and not spent on luxury imports). ''BYU Studies'' was suspended for a year, which Ernest L. Wilkinson told Arrington was because of his revisionist history paper.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|137}}

From 1966 to 1967 he worked as a visiting professor of history at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; From 1972 to 1987 he was Lemuel H. Redd Jr. Professor of Western American History at BYU. In 1977, he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from the [[University of Idaho]] (his [[alma mater]]), and in 1982 Utah State University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree.&lt;ref name=rsc/&gt;

===Historical associations===
Arrington helped establish the Mormon History Association in 1965 and served as its first president from 1966 to 1967.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|139}} After Arrington's article caused the suspension of ''BYU studies'', ''BYU Studies'' was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone with an interest in Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to ''Dialogue''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

Arrington also founded the ''[[Western Historical Quarterly]]'' and served as president of the [[Western History Association]] (1968–69), the [[Agricultural History Society]] (1969–70), and the Pacific Coast Branch of the [[American Historical Association]] (1981–82).&lt;ref name=rsc/&gt; For his distinction in writing American history he was awarded the Western History Association Prize in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Western History Association Prize Recipient, 1984: Leonard J. Arrington|journal=[[The Western Historical Quarterly]]|volume=16|issue=1|date=January 1985|last1=Hinton|first1=Harwood|last2=Spence|first2=Clark C.|last3=Hundley|first3=Norris|jstor=968155|pages=17–26|doi=10.2307/968155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was made a Fellow of the [[Society of American Historians]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=UHE/&gt;

==LDS Church Historian and Church History Division==

===Appointment===
[[Nathan Eldon Tanner|N. Eldon Tanner]] was made [[First Presidency|second counselor]] to [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|the president of the LDS Church]], [[David O. McKay]], in 1963. Tanner met with the director of the BYU library at the time, S. Lyman Tyler, to coordinate LDS historians' work with the LDS Church Archives. Arrington began attending these meetings in 1966.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|100}} In 1967, Arrington indicated that publisher Knopf was interested in publishing a general history of Mormons, and asked for unrestricted access to the LDS Church Archives, which he was granted in January 1968.

[[File:BYU East.jpg|thumb|Arrington's office was in the [[Harold B. Lee Library]] from 1972–1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |type = |item-id =UA 1104 |date =1973—1987|box=1–2 |collection =Brigham Young University telephone directories |collection-url =https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/UA%201104/ |repository =L. Tom Perry Special Collections |institution =Brigham Young University |location =Provo, UT|accession= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
After McKay died in 1970, the LDS Church Historian Joseph Fielding Smith succeeded him as church President. This left the position of official Church Historian—which was traditionally held by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—vacant. Apostle [[Howard W. Hunter]] was chosen as the next Church Historian, and he formed a committee of prominent Mormon historians to discuss reorganizing the church history department. As part of this reorganization, Arrington was appointed official Church Historian of The LDS Church, replacing Howard W. Hunter, in January 1972. At the same time, Arrington was appointed as "Lemuel H. Redd Professor of Western History" and Founding Director of the "Charles Redd Center for Western Studies" at BYU; his historian position was funded half by the church and half by BYU.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|101}} The Church Historian's Office was transformed into the church's Historical Department, and Arrington was made director of its research-oriented History Division. It was the first time a professional historian rather than an administrator was given a church historian position.&lt;ref name="Bitton"/&gt;{{rp|9}} He hired [[James B. Allen (historian)|Jim Allen]] and David Bitton as assistant church historians, whose positions were also funded half by the church and half by their universities.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|102}}

Arrington and his assistants were supported by a team of editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|107}} It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used to lend a publication authority.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|110}} As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|199}} [[Richard Bushman]], a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|111;226}} William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded by a grant from the descendants of [[James Moyle]], a Utah politician.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|111}} A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. [[Eugene England Sr.]] also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

===The Story of the Latter-day Saints===
During his time in the office, Arrington sponsored authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this "[[New Mormon History]]" were two general Church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, ''[[The Story of the Latter-day Saints]]'', and one for interested outsiders, ''The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints''.&lt;ref name="Bitton"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as "Camelot" due to its open and idealistic ethos.&lt;ref name="Bitton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitton|first1=Davis|title=Ten Years in Camelot: A Personal Memoir|journal=Dialogue|date=1983|volume=16|issue=3|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V16N03_11.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The division's output was not subject to the LDS Church's [[Priesthood Correlation Program|Correlation Program]]. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like instruction manuals and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and [[Maureen Ursenbach Beecher|Maureen Beecher]]&lt;ref name="Adventures"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=Adventures of a Church Historian|date=1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|isbn=978-0252023811}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} served as a reading committee for the division's writings in place of formal Correlation approval.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|117}} Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that "I do not think we could determine the truth of what had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it."&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

===Mounting resistance===
The open and idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's immediate supervisors, [[Joseph Anderson]] and G. Homer Durham, failed to defend the division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of [[Mark E. Petersen]], compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority).&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|114; 227}} In a meeting with the first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President [[Harold B. Lee]] rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|''Ensign'']], exploring the origins of the office of [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishop]], and asserted that [[Edward Partridge]] was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the ''Ensign'' did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle [[Spencer W. Kimball]] suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|115–116}}

While many readers praised the division's publications, some members criticized the new histories. In a meeting with institute teachers, [[Ezra Taft Benson]], then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, obliquely criticized some of the terms used in ''The Story of the Latter-day Saints'', like "primitivist" and "communitarian".&lt;ref name="Bitton"/&gt;{{rp|17}} After the publication of Dean C. Jessee's ''Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons'', [[Boyd K. Packer]], then an apostle, wrote a letter to the first presidency objecting to the inclusion of Young's tobacco use and the fact that his descendants were unhappy with the way Young's will was carried out. Packer preferred that a sanitized version be published and believed that the History Division's work ought to be sent through the Correlation Program.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|118}} However, President Kimball found ''The Story of the Latter-Day Saints'' a "great work."&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|121}} A University of Utah undergraduate wrote a research paper connecting the New Mormon History coming from the Church Division with secularism and the work of anti-Mormon historians [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]]. The paper quoted interviews with Mormon historians that were very unlikely to have been real. A copy of the paper reached the Quorum of the Twelve via Mark Petersen, and as a result of the ensuing discussion, several LDS historians were barred from publishing in church sources.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|121}}&lt;ref name="Adventures"/&gt;{{rp|154}} Other critics were similarly non-confrontational, but had enough influence to constrain and redirect the historical department.&lt;ref name="Bitton"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

G. Homer Durham, a member of the [[First Quorum of the Seventy]], replaced Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|123–124}} Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.&lt;ref name="Adventures"/&gt;{{rp|173}}{{refn|group=nb|The list of books that were published from the multi-volume church history project are as follows:

=== Departure ===
The Church transferred its History Division to BYU in 1982, bringing the era of open LDS Church Archives to a close. Working in a new BYU division, the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]], brought Arrington into a more static situation, as he no longer divided his time between Church Headquarters and BYU. In February 1982, he was privately released as Church Historian and director of the History Division.&lt;ref name=lavina/&gt; These positions were assumed by  Durham, who said that moving the team would save them from the increasing hostility from the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|124}} At the April 1982 [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]], the change was not formally announced and Arrington did not receive the traditional vote of thanks for his service.&lt;ref name=lavina&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Anderson |first= Lavina Fielding |authorlink= Lavina Fielding Anderson |title= A Note on Church Historians |work= By Common Consent (newsletter) |volume= 11 |issue= 3 |publisher= [[Mormon Alliance]] |date=July 2005 |place=Salt Lake City|url= http://mormonalliance.org/newsletter/2005jul.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820013812/http://www.mormonalliance.org/newsletter/2005jul.htm |archivedate= 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1982, Arrington's wife Grace died. Arrington married Harriet Horne, granddaughter of [[Alice Merrill Horne]], in November 1983.&lt;ref name=USUpapers/&gt; Arrington continued on as director of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History until 1986 and he retired in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History – Byuorg|url=https://byuorg.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Joseph_Fielding_Smith_Institute_for_Church_History|website=byuorg.lib.byu.edu|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=24 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rsc&gt;{{cite web|title=Arrington, Leonard J.|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/es/authors/arrington-leonard-j|website=rsc.byu.edu|publisher=Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University|accessdate=24 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Institute was closed and the department's historians were returned to LDS Church Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Carrie A.|title=Scholars moving to S.L.|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600143054/Scholars-moving-to-SL.html|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=DeseretNews.com|date=21 June 2005|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other writings==
Roland Rich Woolley, lawyer for several Hollywood celebrities, funded three biographies by Arrington. The first was a biography of Woolley's father-in-law, [[William Spry]]. Woolley first hired popular writer William L. Roper to write the biography, but as the manuscript lacked professionalism, Roper hired Arrington to complete it. The biography focuses disproportionately on Spry's decision to execute [[Joe Hill]], reflecting Woolley's conservative politics in suppressing labor radicalism.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Woolley's choice of subjects for two additional biographies were his grandfathers Charles C. Rich and Edwin D. Woolley. With these biographies, Woolley gave Arrington complete control over the manuscripts. As Arrington was busy with university commitments at the time, he delegated much of the work to other historians, former students, and administrative assistants.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|140–141}} The sources on Rich did not provide any introspection or motives for Rich's actions, and his biography had to focus on the events Rich experienced and his faithfulness, deduced from his actions.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|143}} Edwin Wooley's letters and personal documents were more personable, and his role as financial adviser to Brigham Young made him a more fruitful subject for biography. Rebecca Cornwall wrote most of the book, and Arrington requested that she be named a co-author, but Woolley insisted that only Arrington's name be in the book's byline. ''From Quaker to Latter-day Saint: Bishop Edwin D. Woolley'' reflect's Cornwall's literary elegance and boldness in "informed speculation."&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|140–149}}

Another wealthy family, the Eccles, commissioned Arrington to write a biography of [[David Eccles (businessman)|David Eccles]], a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan part of the family originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|152}} Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer [[Wallace Stegner]] to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|156}} To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington write a serious biography of Brigham Young, and Arrington paid assistants for the project out of his own pocket, possibly to insulate it from donor influences. Arrington wrote the in-depth biography with help from many of his associates at the History Division. One of Arrington's biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in ''Brigham Young: American Moses'', but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young's wives were treated.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|161; 166}}&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Arrington also worked on biographies for Harold Silver, Madelyn Silver, and Charles Redd, with funding from their respective families. Arrington also worked on a biography for Alice Merrill Horne.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|167}}

During research on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript under the title ''Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons.'' Deseret Book published the book in 1976.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|180–181}} The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book was not allowed to reprint the book and ''Church News'' was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too willing to give Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.&lt;ref name="Topping"/&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

==Death and legacy==
Arrington remained an active and devoted member of the LDS Church throughout his life.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|105}} In 1982, his wife Grace Fort died, and in 1983 Arrington was remarried to Harriett Ann Horne.&lt;ref name="UHE"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bitton |first= Davis |chapter= Arrington, Leonard James |url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/a/Arrington_Leonard.html |editor-last= Powell |editor-first= Allan Kent |year= 1994 |title= Utah History Encyclopedia |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[University of Utah Press]] |isbn= 0874804256 |oclc= 30473917|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109222102/http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/a/Arrington_Leonard.html|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 1999 at the age of 81, Arrington died of heart failure at his home in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Saxon, Wolfgang|title=Leonard J.

Starting in 1999 after his death, the Mormon History Association created the annual Leonard J. Arrington Award, awarded for distinguished and meritorious service to Mormon history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MHA Awards|publisher=Mormon History Association|url=http://www.mhahome.org/awards/index.php|accessdate=2008-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612051305/http://www.mhahome.org/awards/index.php|archivedate=2008-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he was posthumously awarded the first annual Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]].&lt;ref name=jwha&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 Lifetime Achievement Award|year=2002|publisher=[[John Whitmer Historical Association]]|url=https://www.jwha.info/awards|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005,&lt;ref name=rsc/&gt; Utah State University created the Leonard J. Arrington Chair in Mormon History and Culture, which was sponsored by more than 45 donors. This chair is the first position at a public institution specifically for the study of Mormon history and culture. In Fall 2007, this chair was first filled by [[Philip Barlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome|work=Program in Religious Studies|publisher=Utah State University|url=http://www.usu.edu/rels/|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university hosts the Leonard J. Arrington Mormon History Lecture Series, in which Arrington himself gave the inaugural lecture in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collected Leonard J. Arrington Mormon History Lectures|work=Books|publisher=Utah State University Press|url=http://www.usu.edu/usupress/books/index.cfm?isbn=000X|accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii}}

===The Leonard Arrington Papers===
Prior to his death, Arrington's long history and family ties influenced his decision to donate his papers to Utah State University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leonard Arrington and the Writing of Mormon History|last=Prince|first=Gregory A.|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2016|isbn=9781607814795|location=Salt Lake City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|460}} The LDS Church claimed to own materials from Arrington's period as Church Historian.  USU was willing to cooperate, allowing the church to search the materials for a short time. Church officials claimed that they had documentation proving up to 60% of the ownership rights regarding Arrington's collection, which is over 700,000 items.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|461–462}} The LDS Church revised its list, only asking for less than one-half of one percent of the total collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|463}} By November 2001, there was a lawsuit between the LDS Church and the university and the parties decided to negotiate a settlement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|464}}

In addition to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given microfilm of his diary from his boyhood until 1982 to the Church Archives, but with the condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|464}} Shortly after Arrington's death, a general authority asked Arrington's daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 parts of her father's diary.&lt;ref name="Moulton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moulton|first1=Kristen|title=Controversy over Arrington collection is history|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/home/50304969-76/church-arrington-diary-family.html.csp|accessdate=16 February 2017|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making this request, the LDS Church representatives revealed that they read Arrington's journals without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church and the negotiations were quickly over.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|464}} Arrington's family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony.&lt;ref name="Moulton"/&gt;

Before his passing, Arrington's children convinced their father to decrease the amount of time before making his diaries available from 25 years to 10 years. The diaries were made available in September 2010 at Utah State University. Arrington's collection of papers at Utah State's Merrill-Crazier Library adds up to 319 linear feet. It has been regarded as "one of the most important archival sources on twentieth-century Mormon history."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|464}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31264">The [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] form various [[linguistic area]]s or [[Sprachbund]]s that share various common (areal) traits.

==Overview==
The languages of the Americas often can be grouped together into ''linguistic areas'' or ''[[Sprachbund]]s'' (also known as ''convergence areas''). The linguistic areas identified so far deserve more research to determine their validity. Knowing about Sprachbunds helps historical linguists differentiate between shared areal traits and true genetic relationship. The pioneering work on American areal linguistics was a dissertation by [[Joel Sherzer]], which was published as Sherzer (1976).

In ''American Indian Languages: the Historical Linguistics of Native America'', [[Lyle Campbell]] also lists over 20 [[Sprachbund]]s or linguistic areas,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle (1997). ''American Indian languages: the historical linguistics of Native America''. Ch. 9 ''Linguistic Areas of the Americas'', pp. 330–352. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-509427-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are still hypothetical.

''Note'': Some linguistic areas may overlap with others.

Pache, et al. (2016) posit a Wintun origin for this root.

''xostén'') and Migueleño Salinan ''xučaːi''), [[Chumash language|Chumash]] (Ineseño Chumash ''huču'', likely borrowed from Salinan)

In [[Languages of South America|South America]], a root for ‘dog’ is shared by [[Uru–Chipaya languages|Uru-Chipayan]] (''paku'' or ''paqu'') and several unrelated neighboring languages of lowland Bolivia ([[Movima language|Movima]] ''pako'', [[Itonama language|Itonama]] ''u-paʔu'', and [[Trinitario language|Trinitario]] ''paku''), as well as [[Guaicuruan languages|Guaicuruan]] ([[Mocoví language|Mocoví]], [[Toba Qom language|Toba]], and [[Pilagá language|Pilagá]] ''pioq''). An identical root for ‘dog’ is also shared by [[Huastec language|Huastec]] (*''sul'') and [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]] (''šul''), which are very geographically distant from each other although both are located along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast.&lt;ref name="Pache2016"/&gt; Areal words for ‘dog’ are also shared across the U.S. Southeast ([[Karankawa language|Karankawa]] ''keš'' ~ ''kes'', [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]] ''kiš'', [[Cotoname language|Cotoname]] ''kissa'' ‘fox’, [[Huave language|Huavean]] *''kisɨ''), as well as across [[Mesoamerica]].

==Northern Northwest Coast==
{{see also|Category:Northern Northwest Coast Sprachbund (North America)}}
This linguistic area was proposed by Jeff Leer (1991), and may be a subarea of the Northern Northwest Coast Linguistic Area. This sprachbund is contains languages that have strict head-final (XSOV) syntax.

Leer (1991) considers the strong areal traits to be:
*lack of labial obstruents
*promiscuous number marking
*periphrastic possessive construction

==Northwest Coast==
{{see also|Category:Northwest Coast Sprachbund (North America)}}
This linguistic area is characterized by elaborate consonant systems. Phonological areal traits include:

*Series of glottalized stops and affricates
*Labiovelars
*Multiple laterals
*s/š opposition
*c/č opposition
*[[voiceless uvular stop]] ''q''
*one fricative series, which is voiceless
*velar fricatives
*highly limited inventory of [[labial consonant]]s
*large inventory of [[uvular consonant]]s
*limited vowel systems

Typical shared morphological traits include:
*reduplication processes: including iterative, continuative, progressive, plural, collective
*numeral classifiers
*alienable/inalienable oppositions in nouns
*pronominal plural
*nominal plural
*verbal reduplication signifying distribution, repetition, etc.
*suffixation of tense-aspect markers in verbs
*verbal evidential markers
*locative-directional markers in the verb
*visibility/invisibility opposition in demonstratives
*nominal and verbal reduplication signaling the diminutive
*passive-like constructions (except for Tlingit)
*negative appearing as the first element in a clause regardless of the usual word order
*lexically paired singular and plural verb stems

==Plateau==
Primary shared phonological features of this linguistic area include:
*glottalized stops
*velar/uvular contrasting series
*multiple laterals

Other less salient shared traits are:
*labiovelars
*one fricative series
*velar (and uvular) fricatives
*series of glottalized resonants (sonorants) contrasting with plain resonants (except in Sahaptin, Cayuse, Molala, and Kiksht)
*word-medial and word-final consonant clusters of four or more consonants (except in Kiksht, and uncertain in Cayuse and Molala)
*vowel systems of only 3 or 4 vowel positions (except Nez Perce, which has 5)
*vowel-length contrast
*size-shape-affective sound symbolism involving consonantal interchanges
*pronominal plural
*nominal plural
*prefixation of subject person markers of verbs
*suffixation of tense-aspect markers in verbs
*several kinds of reduplication (except in Nicola)
*numeral classifiers (shared by Salishan and Sahaptian languages)
*locative-directional markers in verbs
*different roots of the singular and the plural for various actions, such as 'sit', 'stand', 'take' (except in Kutenai and Lillooet, uncertain in Cayuse and Molala)
*quinary-decimal numerical system (Haruo Aoki 1975)

==Northern California==
Features of this linguistic area have been described by [[Mary Haas]]. They include:
*rarity of uvular consonants: they occur in Klamath, Wintu, Chimariko, and Pomoan
*retroflexed stops
*rarity of a distinct series of voiced stops except in the east-west strip of languages including Kashaya Pomo, Wintu-Patwin, and Maidu (this series contains implosion in Maidu)
*consonant sound symbolism: in Yurok, Wiyot, Hupa, Tolowa, Karuk, and Yana

Washo, spoken in the Great Basin area, shares some traits common to the Northern California linguistic area.
*pronominal dual
*quinary/decimal numeral system
*absence of vowel-initial syllables
*free stress

==Clear Lake==
This is clearly a linguistic area, and is centered around [[Clear Lake, California]]. Shared features include:

*retroflexed dentals
*voiceless l (ɬ)
*glottalized glides
*3 series of stops

==South Coast Range==
Languages in Sherzer's (1976) "Yokuts-Salinan-Chumash" area share the following traits.

*3 series of stops - also in the Clear Lake area
*retroflexed sounds - also in the Clear Lake area
*glottalized resonants (sonorants)
*prefixation of verbal subject markers)
*presence of /h, ɨ, c, ŋ/ in the Greater South Coast Range area
*t/ṭ (retroflex/non-retroflex) contrast in the Greater South Coast Range area, as well as other parts of California

==Great Basin==
This linguistic area is defined by Sherzer (1973, 1976) and Jacobsen (1980). Shared traits include:
*k/kʷ contrast
*bilabial fricatives /ɸ, β/
*presence of /xʷ, ŋ, ɨ/
*overtly marked nominal system
*inclusive/exclusive pronominal distinction

However, the validity of this linguistic area is doubtful, as pointed out by Jacobsen (1986), since many traits of the Great Basin area are also common to California languages. It may be an extension of the Northern California linguistic area.

==Southern California–Western Arizona==
This linguistic area has been demonstrated in Hinton (1991). Shared traits include:

*k/q distinction
*presence of /kʷ, tʃ, x/

The Yuman and Cupan languages share the most areal features, such as:
*kʷ/qʷ contrast
*s/ʂ contrast
*r/l contrast
*presence of /xʷ, ɲ, lʲ/
*small vowel inventory
*sound symbolism

The influence is strongly unidirectional from Yuman to Cupan, since the features considered divergent within the Takic subgroup. According to Sherzer (1976), many of these traits are also common to Southern California languages.

Shaul and Andresen (1989) have proposed a Southwestern Arizona ("Hohokam") linguistic area as well, where speakers of Piman languages are hypothesized to have interacted with speakers of Yuman languages as part of the Hohokam archaeological culture. The single trait defining this area is the presence of retroflex stops (/ʈ/ in Yuman, /ɖ/ in Piman).

==Pueblo==
{{main|Pueblo linguistic area}}

==Plains==
The Plains Linguistic Area, according to Sherzer (1973:773), is the "most recently constituted of the culture areas of North America (late eighteenth and nineteenth century)." The following areal traits are characteristic of this linguistic area, though they are also common in other parts of North America.

*prefixation of subject person markers in verbs
*pronominal plurals

Frequent traits, which are not shared by all languages, include:
*one stop series
*the [[voiceless velar fricative]] /x/
*alienable/inalienable opposition in nouns
*nominal plural suffix
*inclusive/exclusive opposition (in first person plural pronouns)
*nominal diminutive suffix
*animate/inanimate gender
*evidential markers in verbs
*lack of labiovelars (other than Comanche and the languages of the Southern Plains subregion)
*presence of /ð/ (eastern Plains subregion only)

Southern Plains areal traits include:
*phonemic pitch
*presence of /kʷ, r/
*voiced/voiceless fricatives

==Northeast==
Central areal traits of the Northeast Linguistic Area include the following (Sherzer 1976).

*a single series of stops (especially characteristic of the Northeast)
*a single series of fricatives
*presence of /h/
*nominal plural
*noun incorporation

In New England, areal traits include:
*vowel system with /i, e, o, a/
*nasalized vowels
*pronominal dual

New England Eastern [[Algonquian languages]] and [[Iroquoian languages]] share the following traits.

*nasalized vowels (best-known feature); for instance, Proto-Eastern Algonquian &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;a- is nasalized due to influence from Iroquioan languages, which have two nasalized vowels in its proto-language, &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;ɛ̃ and &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;õ.
*pronominal dual

The boundary between the Northeast and Southeast linguistic areas is not clearly determined, since features often extend over to territories belonging to both linguistic areas.

==Southeast==
Bilabial or labial fricatives (/ɸ/, sometimes /f/) are considered by Sherzer (1976) to be the most characteristic trait of the Southeast Linguistic Area. Various other shared traits have been found by Robert L. Rankin (1986, 1988) and T. Dale Nicklas (1994).

==Mesoamerican==
{{main|Mesoamerican Linguistic Area}}

This linguistic area consists of the following language families and branches.

*[[Mayan languages|Mayan]]
*[[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] (except Chichimeco-Jonaz and some varieties of Pame north of the Mesoamerican boundary)
*[[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoque]]
*[[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]]
*[[Aztecan languages|Aztecan]] (a Southern Uto-Aztecan branch)
*[[Purépecha language|Purépecha]]
*[[Huave language|Huave]]
*[[Tequistlatecan languages|Tequistlatec]]
*[[Cuitlatec language|Cuitlatec]]

Some languages formerly considered to be part of the Mesoamerican sprachbund, but are now considered to lack main diagnostic traits of Mesoamerican area languages, include Cora, Huichol, Lenca, Jicaquean, and Misumalpan.

==Mayan==
The Mayan Linguistic Area is considered by most scholars to be part of the Mesoamerican area. However, Holt &amp; Bright (1976) distinguish it as a separate area, and include the Mayan, Xincan, Lencan, and Jicaquean families as part of the Mayan Linguistic Area. Shared traits include:

*presence of glottalized consonants and alveolar affricates
*absence of voiced obstruents and labiovelar stops

==Colombian–Central American==
This linguistic area is characterized by SOV word order and postpositions. This stands in contrast to the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, where languages do not have SOV word order.

Holt &amp; Bright (1976) define a Central American Linguistic Area as having the following areal traits. Note that these stand in direct opposition to the traits defined in their Mayan Linguistic Area.
*presence of voiced obstruents and labiovelar stops (absent in the Mayan area)
*absence of glottalized consonants and alveolar affricates (present in the Mayan area)

Constenla's (1991) Colombian–Central American area consists primarily of [[Chibchan languages]], but also include Lencan, Jicaquean, Misumalpan, Chocoan, and Betoi (Constenla 1992:103). This area consists of the following areal traits.
*voicing opposition in stops and fricatives
*exclusive SOV word order
*postpositions
*mostly Genitive-Noun order
*Noun-Adjective order
*Noun-Numeral order
*clause-initial question words
*suffixation or postposed particle for negatives (in most languages)
*absence of gender opposition in pronouns and inflection
*absence of possessed/nonpossessed and alienable/inalienable possession oppositions
*"morpholexical economy" - presence of lexical compounds rather than independent roots. This is similar to calques found in Mesoamerica, but with a more limited number of compounding elements. For instance, in Guatuso (as in Athabaskan languages), there is one compounding element of liquid substances, one compounding element for pointed extremities, one for flat surfaces, and so on.

==Venezuelan–Antillean==
This linguistic area is characterized by VO word order (instead of SOV), and is described by Constenla (1991). Shared traits are:

*exclusive VO word order, and absence of SOV word order
*absence of voicing opposition in obstruents
*Numeral-Noun order
*Noun-Genitive order
*presence of prepositions

The Venezuelan–Antillean could also extend to the western part of the Amazon Culture Area (Amazonia), where there are many Arawakan languages with VO word order (Constenla 1991).

==Andean==
This linguistic area is characterized by SOV word order and elaborate suffixing.

Quechuan and Aymaran languages both have:
*SOV basic word order
*suffixing morphology; other similar morphological structures

Büttner's (1983:179) includes Quechuan, Aymaran, Callahuaya, and Chipaya. Puquina, an extinct but significant language in this area, appears to not share these phonological features. Shared phonological traits are:
*glottalized stops and affricates (not found in all varieties of Quechuan)
*aspirated stops and affricates (not found in Chipaya)
*uvular stops
*presence of /ɲ, lʲ/
*retroflexed affricates (retroflexed /ʃ/ and /tʃ͡/) - more limited in distribution
*absence of glottal stop /ʔ/
*limited vowel systems with /i, a, u/ (not in Chipaya)

Constenla (1991) defines a broader Andean area including the languages of highland Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and possibly also some lowland languages east of that Andes that have features typical of the Andean area. This area has the following areal traits.

*absence of the high-mid opposition in back vowels
*absence of the opposition of voiced/voiceless affricates
*presence of the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]], [[voiceless prepalatal fricative]], [[palatal lateral]], [[palatal nasal]], retroflexed fricatives or affricates
*Adjective-Noun order
*clause-initial interrogative words
*accusative case
*genitive case
*passive construction

===Statistical Work===

Quantitative studies on the Andes and overlapping areas have found the following traits to be characteristic of these areas in a statistically significant way.

====Morphosyntactic features====
A statistical study of argument marking features in languages of South America found that both the Andes and Western South America constitute linguistic areas, with some traits showing a statistically significant relationship to both areas. The unique and shared traits of the two areas are shown in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;Birchall (2014:215-16)&lt;/ref&gt; (The wordings of the traits are directly from the source.)
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Andes only !! Both Andes and Western South America !! Western South America only
|-
| Subject-object-verb constituent order || Use of both case and indexation as argument marking strategies || Marked neutral case marking patterns in ditransitive constructions
|-
|  || Suffixes as verbal person markers || Verbally marked applicative constructions
|-
| || The R argument role can be indexed in ditransitive constructions ||
|-
| || Accusative case alignment for NP arguments ||
|-
|}

====Phonological features====
Phonologically, the following [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]] and segmental [[Distinctive feature|features]] are areal for the Andes:&lt;ref&gt;Michael et al. (2012:14-15)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Consonants=====
*A contrast between [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] in the [[Stop consonant|stops]] and the postalveolar affricate
*A "comparatively large number of affricates, fricatives, and liquids"
*The palatal place of articulation (in nasals and liquids)
*The uvular place of articulation (in stops and fricatives)
*The absence of the following types of consonants:
**[[Voiced alveolar stop]] and [[Voiced alveolar affricate|affricate]]
**[[Labialized velar consonant|Labialized velar]] voiceless stop and nasal
**[[Voiced bilabial fricative|Voiced bilabial]] and [[voiceless labiodental fricative]]s
**[[Glottal stop]] and [[Voiceless glottal fricative|fricative]]

=====Vowels=====
*The presence of short /u/ and [[Vowel length|long]] /iː, uː, aː/
*The absence of mid and non-low central vowels and nasal vowels, and "long versions of many of these vowels."

==Ecuadorian–Colombian==
This is a subarea of the Andean Linguistic Area, as defined by Constenla (1991). Shared traits are:

*high-mid opposition in the front vowels
*absence of glottalized consonants
*presence of the glottal stop /ʔ/, voiceless labial fricative /ɸ/
*absence of uvular stops /q, ɢ/
*rounding opposition in non-front vowels
*lack of person inflection in nouns
*prefixes expressing tenses or aspects

==Orinoco–Amazon==
The Orinoco–Amazon Linguistic Area, or the Northern Amazon Culture Area, is identified by Migliazza (1985 [1982]). Common areal traits are:

*a shared pattern of discourse redundancy (Derbyshire 1977)
*ergative alignment (except in a few Arawakan languages)
*objects preceding verbs, such as SOV and OVS word orders (except in a few Arawakan languages)
*lack of active-passive distinction
*relative clauses formed by apposition and nominalization

The following traits have diffused to west to east (Migliazza 1985 [1982]):
*nasalization
*aspiration
*glottalization

==Amazon==
Derbyshire &amp; Pullum (1986) and Derbyshire (1987) describe the characteristics of this linguistic area in detail. Traits include:

*objects preceding subjects, such as VOS, OVS, and OSV word orders. Word order in OVS and OSV languages tends to be highly flexible.
*verb agreement with both subject and object (additionally, null realization of subject and object nominals or free pronouns, which means that sentences frequently lack full noun-phrase subjects or objects)
*predictability of when subjects and objects will be full noun phrases or when they will be signaled by verbal affixes (depending on whether they represent "new" or "given" information")
*use of nominalizations for relative clauses and other subordinate clauses (in many cases, there are no true subordinate clauses at all)
*nominal modifiers following their head nouns
*no agentive passive constructions (except Palikur)
*indirect speech forms are nonexistent in most languages and rare in the languages that do have them; thus, they rely on direct speech constructions.
*absence of coordinating conjunctions (juxtaposition is used to express coordination instead)
*extensive use of right-dislocated paratactic constructions (sequences of noun phrases, adverbials, or postpositional phrases, in which the whole sequence has only one grammatical relation in the sentence)
*extensive use of particles that are phrasal subconstituents syntactically and phonologically, but are sentence operators or modifiers semantically
*tendency toward ergative subject marking
*highly complex morphology

Noun classifier systems are also common across Amazonian languages. Derbyshire &amp; Payne (1990) list three basic types of classifier systems.

*'''Numeral''': lexico-syntactic forms, which are often obligatory in expressions of quantity and normally are separate words.
*'''Concordial''': a closed grammatical system, consisting of morphological affixes or clitics and expressing class agreement with some head noun. However, they may also occur on nouns or verbs.
*'''Verb incorporation''': lexical items are incorporated into the verb stem, signaling some classifying entity of the associated noun phrase.

Derbyshire (1987) also notes that Amazonian languages tend to have:
*ergatively organized systems (in whole or in part)
*evidence of historical drift from ergative to accusative marking
*certain types of split systems

Mason (1950) has found that in many languages of central and eastern Brazil, words end in vowels, and stress is ultimate (i.e., falls on the final syllable).

Lucy Seki (1999) has also proposed an Upper Xingu Linguistic Area in northern Brazil.

===Validity===
The validity of Amazonia as a linguistic area has been called into question by recent research, including quantitative studies. A study of argument marking parameters in 74 South American languages by Joshua Birchall found that “not a single feature showed an areal distribution for Amazonia as a macroregion. This suggest that Amazonia is not a good candidate for a linguistic area based on the features examined in this study.” Instead, Birchall finds evidence for three “macroregions” in South America: the Andes, Western South America, and Eastern South America, with some overlap in features between Andes and Western South America.&lt;ref&gt;Birchall (2014:225)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on that study and similar findings, Patience Epps and Lev Michael claim that “an emerging consensus points to Amazonia not forming a linguistic area ''sensu strictu''{{sic|?}}.”&lt;ref&gt;Epps and Michael (to appear, 18-19)&lt;/ref&gt;

Epps (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Epps, Patience. 2015. [https://www.eva.mpg.de/fileadmin/content_files/linguistics/conferences/2015-diversity-linguistics/Epps_slides.pdf The dynamics of linguistic diversity: Language contact and language maintenance in Amazonia]. Presented at Diversity Linguistics: Retrospect and Prospect, 1-3 May 2015 (Leipzig, Germany), Closing conference of the Department of Linguistics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that [[Wanderwort]] are spread across the languages of Amazonia. [[Morphosyntax]] is also heavily borrowed across neighboring unrelated Amazonian languages.

==South Cone==
The languages of the South Cone area share the following traits (Klein 1992):

*Semantic notions of position signaled morphologically by means of "many devices to situate the visual location of the noun subject or object relative to the speaker; tense, aspect and number are expressed as part of the morphology of location, direction, and motion" (Klein 1992:25).
*palatalization
*more back consonants than front consonants
*SVO basic word order

'''Merz (art style)''' is a [[synonym]] for the more common expression and term [[Dada]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Richard Huelsenbeck (Ed.): ''Dada Almanach''. New York, Something Else Press, 1966 (reprint of the 1920-edition).&lt;/ref&gt; and traces back to [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monograph 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981. {{ISBN|3499502968}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The made-up word ''Merz'', however, traces back to Kurt Schwitters, who planned a Dada section in Hanover. But not being invited to the First International Dada Fair in Berlin in 1920, Schwitters was on the look-out for a ''totally unique hat fitting only a single head"— his own''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monographien 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981, p. 19 f. {{ISBN|3499502968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Original German quote translated by Arguseyed2200).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The very moment==
He found ''Merz'' by chance when creating a collage with the German word ''Kom'''merz''''' (commerce). The result: a nonsensical‚ dadaistic’ word. ''Merz'' became Schwitters 's very synonym for his own way of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Kurt Schwitters, 1887-1948: Urwerk'', Edited by Robert Galitz/Kurt Kreiler/Klaus Gabbert. Frankfurt am Main/Berlin 1986. {{ISBN|3-549-06667-8}}. New Edition: Zweitausendeins, Frankfurt am Main, 2007. {{ISBN|9783861506744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The very reception==
Kurt Schwitters, father of installation art and  a pioneer in fusing collage and abstraction—those two most transformative innovations of the 20th century art— influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]],  the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Joseph Beuys]], too.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Kurt Schwitters — Space, Image, Exile'' by Megan R. Luke. 352 p., 22 color plates, 98 halftones. University of Chicago, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Hatcher (1986).jpg|thumb|Michael Hatcher unveils a bell found at the "Nanking cargo" site (1986)]]
'''Michael "Mike" Hatcher''' (born 1940) is a British explorer and [[marine salvage|marine salvor]].

He has specialised in work in the [[South China Sea]]. In 1981 he was involved in investigating the wreck of Dutch submarine ''K XVII''.
 
He is especially known for his recovery of large quantities of Chinese porcelain from the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] ship ''[[Geldermalsen (ship)|Geldermalsen]]'' (known as the "Nanking cargo") which was sold at auction by [[Christie's]] in Amsterdam in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml BBC Radio World Service Broadcast, "What Lies Beneath" First broadcast Friday 22 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, he discovered the ''[[Tek Sing]]'' shipwreck and retrieved 360,000 pieces of porcelain, most of it in impeccable condition, making this the greatest porcelain treasure that has ever been recovered.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The cargo originates from the ''Tek Sing'', a junk whose history British shipping researcher Nigel Pickford was able to reconstruct in unprecedented detail. The porcelain was stowed in the tower cargo holds of the ship, where it also served as ballast to stabilize the enormous ship. Most of the porcelain was blue-white porcelain manufactured in the Chinese city of Dehua in the 18th and early 19th century. The greater part of the find is everyday Chinese porcelain utensils intended for export to other countries inside Asia and thus rarely found in the Western hemisphere. As the merchandise had not been made for the European markets, shapes and patterns were not adapted to European taste, but were genuinely Chinese. Other categories of porcelain from different periods were also found, dating back as far the 15th century. The cargo contained a remarkable amount of porcelain of different shapes and sizes, but with identical decoration. It gave buyers in the 21st century the opportunity to compose complete dinner sets with Qing porcelain.  Further items such as mercury, sextants, pocket watches, cannons, coins and other merchandise were also salvaged. The recovery was the largest in salvage history.{{cn|date=August 2017}} 

It is the story of an incredible shipping disaster with more than 1600 dead (and was consequently entitled the “Titanic of the East” by ''Spiegel'' news magazine), involving opium smuggling, economic difficulties and mass emigration in the early 19th century. The porcelain itself was robust and survived almost 200 years in the sea. Never before have experts been able to examine Chinese export porcelain intended for the South East Asian market on this scale.
 
The catalogue itself broke new ground, becoming a valuable reference work on porcelain in professional circles. It also served as an auction catalogue in conjunction with the auction list featuring all the individual lots.
 
Hatcher already had two important finds of Chinese porcelain to his name: the Hatcher Collection (from an unidentified Chinese junk) and the Nanking cargo from the Dutch ''Geldermalsen'' that sank in 1752. Both cargoes were successfully auctioned in Europe in the 1980s. Hatcher chose Nagel Auktionen, the leading auction company for Asian art on the European continent, to release the items to the market. 

The importance of the discovery and the auction was emphasized by the commissioning of a special book on the history of the ''Tek Sing'' and its cargo. Harper Collins published a book about Mike Hatcher's life written by Hugh Edward and Nigel Pickford and titled ''Treasures of the Deep''. The book ''The Legacy of the Tek Sing'' contains an account of the story behind the shipwreck, a tale of treachery and heroism, arrogance and greed, all played out against a background of opium smuggling, piracy and mass emigration. It gives details about the salvage as well as the historical background.

== Controversy ==

A number of controversies surround the salvaging of historic wreck cargo undertaken by Michael Hatcher. The salvaging of both the ''Tek Sing'' and the ''Geldermalsen'' have been heavily criticized by archaeologists for stripping archaeological sites of valuable artefacts without recording any context and destroying the less economically valuable parts of the assemblage, such as the ships themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25616201?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents George L. Miller (1992) 'The Second Destruction of the Geldermalsen' 26(4) ''Historical Archaeology'' 124]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven containers of the ''Tek Sing'' cargo were seized by Australian authorities pursuant to their Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 as the Indonesian government had confirmed that they had been illegally exported from its territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/pdf/Report_from_Australia_anne.pdf Australian Government (2015) Report from Australia on the implementation of the UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 1970'']&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmation came too late for much of the cargo however, and it was able to continue its journey and be sold at auction in the EU. On 12 September 2001, the 71 939 seized ceramics were returned by Australia to Indonesia.

'''Milakpur''' is an [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site and village situated in the [[Bhiwani district]] of [[Haryana]], India. Milakpur comes under [[Hisar (Lok Sabha constituency)]], which is represented in [[Lok Sabha]] by [[Dushyant Chautala]] of [[INLD]]. The village serves under the jurisdiction of Bhiwani Administration under police station at [[Bawani Khera]], which also serves as [[Tehsil]] to the village.

==Location==
The Bus stand of the village caters to the needs of more than six villages and the village railway station, Aurangnagar, also provides for surrounding villages.

==Economy==
The area is known for its large number of brick kilns, which cater to the demand of bricks from surrounding areas and other areas as far flung as [[Bhiwani]] and [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]]. However, the residents are not concerned about the pollution and ecological devastation caused by them, perhaps due to lack of environmental awareness. Indeed, not even the authorities are concerned by their detrimental effect on the ecology and the environment of the area.

Like most of the villages in Haryana, Milakpur too has made a big contribution towards the [[Indian Army]] as soldiers and officers. Though the former outnumber the latter when quantified. Lack of other economic avenues and poor quality education lead to this choice rather than strong feelings of nationalism and patriotism. In addition to a career in the army, other occupations range from brick kiln management, farming, labour, teaching, to Mom and pop shop management. Of these, farming remains the largest and the default source of livelihood.

==Education==
[[Hansi]],a town just six kilometers away, exerts significant urban influence upon the village. Increased educational awareness among the people has resulted in a more proactive stance towards education for their wards. In their quest for quality education, the number of pupils attending English medium schools in surrounding urban areas has increased significantly, despite the expensive fees in comparison to the overlooking free state-run schools where only children of under-privileged families find way. Indeed, the quality of state-run schools is so severely worse than urban schools that children from a poorer socio-economic background, who cannot afford urban schools, are compelled to go to private village schools. The quality of education of these schools is questionable and they have nothing in the name of infrastructure. Sanitation facilities are rare. This clearly indicates the shoddy state of education in the area and brings into light the bogus claims of improving quality of education made by the polity. The poor quality of education, in conjunction with other factors, contributes to the sheer prevalence of inequality among people, at large.

A '''Mocăniță''' ({{IPA-ro|mokəˈnit͡sə}}) is a [[narrow-gauge railway]] in [[Romania]], most notably in [[Maramureș]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Bukovina]]. Archetypely, they are situated in mountainous areas and the [[locomotive]]s operating on them (which themselves can also be referred to as ''mocăniță''s) are steam-powered. These railways were built for cargo and passenger services - some in the era of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], before 1920 - but fell into disrepair over the years. Some are now being rehabilitated for [[Heritage railway|the purposes of tourism]].

==Etymology==
The word ''mocăniță'' is a term of endearment, derived from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''mocan'', meaning ''shepherd'' or ''one who lives in the mountains'', and suffixed as feminine and diminutive in keeping with the tradition of naming conveyances and indicating small size. It's also been suggested that it means "coffee machine", as one of the little locomotives is reminiscent of one of these in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = transylvaniaexpress.com| url = http://www.transylvaniaexpress.com/agnita/restoration.html | accessdate = 2007-11-18 | title = The Restoration of the Sibiu to Agnita Narrow-Gauge Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaser Valley Mocăniţa==
[[Image:MocanitaCar.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Rocar]] minivan on rails]]
The most well-known mocăniță runs in the [[Vaser River|Vaser Valley]] in [[Maramureş County]]. This railway was constructed in the period 1933-1935 and uses a gauge of {{RailGauge|760mm|lk=on}}. It was partially destroyed by German troops during the [[World War II|war]], but was rebuilt again. It has primarily been used for [[logging]], and is still used for this purpose, but in 2004 work began on rehabilitating it as a tourist attraction. A Swiss enthusiast who came to Romania in 1987 helped this greatly by starting an organisation for saving the railway: "Hilfe für die Wassertalbahn in Rumänien".

Several steam engines are used: 764-211 (''Măriuța'') was built in Berlin by [[Orenstein &amp; Koppel]] in 1910; 763-193 (''Krauss'') was also built in Germany, in 1921; and there are five Romanian locomotives built at [[Reşiţa]] between 1953-1955. Diesel engines (built in 1960s-1970s) and other vehicles such as converted minvans also run on the lines. The latter are used by border police, rangers and others for getting quickly up the mountains.

The tracks run from [[Vişeu de Sus]], from a yard on Strada A. I. Cuza, 1.5&amp;nbsp;km north from the town centre. The main line is 43&amp;nbsp;km long, from Vișeu de Sus to Comanu, near the Ukrainian (former Polish) border, though the service may terminate before then at Faina. This trip usually takes between 3 and 4 hours each way.

There are two other branches: along the Novat Valley (13&amp;nbsp;km) and towards Stevioara (3&amp;nbsp;km). The train can occasionally come off the rails, but at a speed of 10&amp;nbsp;km/hour this poses no danger, and experienced passengers help to get the train back on the rails! The Vaser Valley is an exceptionally scenic location, the habitat of many [[European Brown Bear|bears]] and [[Red Deer|deer]], along with many cattle and sheep. The line is run by a private company, Căile Ferate Forestiere (CFF). As well as regular services, trains can be charted by tourists; special services are also run, for instance on New Year's Eve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bWQoy-nPvU&amp;feature=related This video made about this Mocăniţă] is accompanied by local music from Maramureș.

The railway, and the ''Mariuța'' engine complete with rolling stock featured in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-u9g8sZ0w episode 3 "Wild East" ("From the Dniestr to the Danube"] in the US version) of [[Michael Palin's New Europe]]. It can be viewed in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJeD5e-aYFI&amp;feature=watch_response part 3] of that episode on YouTube at time index 2 minutes 54 seconds.

'''Polycentric law''' is a legal structure in which providers of [[legal system]]s compete or overlap in a given [[jurisdiction]], as opposed to [[monopoly| monopolistic]] [[statutory law]] according to which there is a sole provider of [[law]] for each jurisdiction. [[Devolution]] of this monopoly occurs by the principle of jurisprudence in which they [[rule according to higher law]].

==Overview==
Tom W. Bell, former director of telecommunications and technology studies at [[Cato Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/images/stories/policy-magazine/1999-autumn/1999-15-1-tom-bell.pdf |title=Polycentric Law in the New Century |last=Bell |first=Tom |periodical=Policy Magazine |date=Autumn 1999 |publisher=[[Centre for Independent Studies]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201231229/http://www.cis.org.au/images/stories/policy-magazine/1999-autumn/1999-15-1-tom-bell.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2018-10-20 |deadurl=no}} An [http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/policy-report/1998/11/polycentric-law-new-century.pdf earlier version] was published by the [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; now a professor of law at [[Chapman University School of Law]] in [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/thomas-bell|title=Faculty Profile|website=www.chapman.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "Polycentric Law", published by the [[Institute for Humane Studies]], when he was a law student at the [[University of Chicago]]. In it he notes that others use phrases such as "non-monopolistic law" to describe these polycentric alternatives.&lt;ref name="Bell1991"&gt;Tom W. Bell, [http://osf1.gmu.edu/~ihs/w91issues.html Polycentric Law], [[Institute for Humane Studies]] Review, Volume 7, Number 1 Winter 1991/92.&lt;/ref&gt; He outlines traditional [[customary law]] (also known as [[consuetudinary]] law) before the creation of [[State (polity)|states]], including as described by [[Friedrich A. Hayek]], [[Bruce L. Benson]], and [[David D. Friedman]]. He mentions [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[customary law]], [[Canon law|church law]], guild law, and [[law merchant| merchant law]] as examples of polycentric law. He notes that customary and statutory law have co-existed through history, as when [[Roman law]] applied to Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire]], but indigenous legal systems were permitted for non-Romans.&lt;ref name="Bell1991"/&gt; In "Polycentric Law in the New Millennium," which won first place in the [[Mont Pelerin Society]]'s 1998 Friedrich A. Hayek Fellowship competition, Bell predicts three areas where polycentric law might develop: alternative dispute resolution, private communities, and the Internet.

The [[University of Helsinki]] ([[Finland]]) funded a "Polycentric Law" research project from 1992 to 1995, led by professor Lars D. Eriksson. Its goal was to demonstrate "the inadequacy of current legal paradigms by mapping the indeterminacies of both the modern law and the modern legal theory. It also addressed the possibility of legal and ethical alternativies to the modern legal theories" and "provided openings to polycentric legal theories both by deconstructing the idea of unity in law and re-constructing legal and ethical differences". The project hosted two international conferences. In 1998 the book ''Polycentricity: The Multiple Scenes of Law'', edited by Ari Hirvonen, collected essays written by scholars involved with the project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720182508/http://savotta.helsinki.fi/halvi/keho/researce.nsf/504ca249c786e20f85256284006da7ab/4a21f65be414c8a4c2256769004fa548?OpenDocument Research project on polycentric law].&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Randy Barnett]], who originally wrote about "non-monopolistic" law, later used the phrase "polycentric legal order". He explains the advantages of such a system in his book ''The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law.''&lt;ref&gt;Randy E. Barnett, [http://www.randybarnett.com E/TOC.htm ''The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law,''] Chapters 12 -14, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce L. Benson also uses the phrase, writing in a Cato Institute publication in 2007: "A customary system of polycentric law would appear to be much more likely to generate efficient sized jurisdictions for the various communities involved—perhaps many smaller than most nations, with others encompassing many of today’s political jurisdictions (e.g., as [[international commercial law]] does today)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce L. Benson]], "[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/16/bruce-l-benson/polycentric-governance/ Polycentric Governance]", ''[[Cato Institute|Cato Unbound]]'', August 16th, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung in "No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order," criticize the concept of polycentric law.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung, "[http://blogs.gonzaga.edu/gulawreview/files/2011/02/PalchakLeung.pdf No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order]," 38 ''Gonzaga Law Review'', 289, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholar [[Gary Chartier]] in "Anarchy and Legal Order" elaborates and defends the idea of law without the state. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/22/is-anarchism-socialist-or-capitalist|title=Is Anarchism Socialist or Capitalist?|date=22 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animated by a vision of peaceful, voluntary cooperation as a social ideal and building on a careful account of [[non-aggression]], the book seeks to explain why the state is illegitimate, dangerous, and unnecessary. It proposes an understanding of how law enforcement in a [[stateless society]] could be legitimate and what the optimal substance of law without the state might be, suggests ways in which a stateless legal order could foster the growth of a culture of freedom, and situates the project it elaborates in relation to [[leftist]], [[anti-capitalist]], and [[socialist]] traditions.

{{History of Scotland}}

'''Prehistoric Orkney''' refers to a period in the human occupation of the [[Orkney]] archipelago of [[Scotland]] that was the latter part of these islands' [[prehistory]]. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus ''Homo'' is part of the [[geology of Scotland]]. Although some [[Protohistory|written records]] refer to Orkney during the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman invasions of Scotland]], prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Historic Period]] around AD 600.

There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney, especially from the [[Neolithic]] period, four of which form a [[World Heritage Site]]. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The [[sandstone]] bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of [[plough]]ing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 11&amp;ndash;13, who states that the total number of archaeological sites in Orkney is "around 10,000" i.e. about 10 for every km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehistory is conventionally divided into a number of shorter periods but differentiating these various [[List of archaeological periods|eras of human history]] is a complex task &amp;ndash; their boundaries are uncertain and the changes between them are gradual. The [[Paleolithic]] lasted until the retreat of the ice, the [[Mesolithic]] until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until [[metalworking]] commenced. A number of the sites span long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The extraordinary wealth of structures from the Neolithic is not matched either by the early periods, for which the evidence of human occupation is sparse or non-existent, or the later [[Bronze Age]] which provides a relative dearth of evidence. The subsequent [[Iron Age]] supported a return to monumental building, especially of [[broch]]s.

Formal excavations were first recorded in the late 18th century and as they proceeded an understanding of the structures involved progressed from little more than folklore to modern archaeological science. The sites discussed are found on the [[Orkney Mainland]] unless otherwise stated.

==Paleolithic==
No traces have yet been found in Scotland of either a [[Neanderthal]] presence or of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' during the [[Pleistocene]] [[interglacial]]s. The first indications of humans occur only after the [[Last glacial period|ice retreated]] in the [[11th millennium BC]] and the current [[Flandrian interglacial]] began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Kevin J and Ralston, Ian B.M. "Environment and People in Prehistoric and Early Historical Times: Preliminary Considerations" in Edwards &amp; Ralston (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, [[sea level]]s were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to [[Continental Europe]]. Much of the [[North Sea]] basin was also dry land until after 4000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent [[isostasy|isostatic]] rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973) p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 46&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) p. 74 states that mesolithic travellers would have encountered a stretch of water when voyaging from mainland Scotland to Orkney.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John Flett "Geology and Landscape" in Omand (2003) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesolithic==
The very limited [[archaeology|archaeological]] record provides scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney in particular and Scotland north of [[Inverness]] in general. "Lithic scatter" sites at Seatter, South Ettit, Wideford Hill, Valdigar and [[Loch of Stenness]] have produced small polished stone tools and chippings. A charred hazelnut shell, recovered during the excavations at Longhowe in [[Tankerness]] in 2007, has been dated to 6820-6660 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002600.html "Hazelnut shell pushes back date of Orcadian site"] (3 November 2007) Stone Pages Archaeo News. Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence to suggest whether or not these sites were in year-round occupation and no Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered anywhere in Scotland to date.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) pp. 62&amp;ndash;63, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble (1996) p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson, Bill and Edwards, Kevin J. "The Mesolithic" in Edwards &amp; Ralston (2003) pp. 122&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recently excavated site on [[Stronsay]] has produced a thousand pieces of [[flint]] and what may be evidence of a temporary camp. With a tentative dating of 7000 BC or older it may prove to be the oldest settlement site found so far on Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Towrie, Sigurd (20 March 2008) [http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/stronsayflints2008.htm "New Contender for Orkney's Oldest settlement Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026150044/http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/stronsayflints2008.htm |date=26 October 2008 }} Orkneyjar.

About 6000 BC the [[Storegga Slides]] of the coast of Norway created a [[tsunami]] that reached {{convert|25|m|ft}} above normal high tides in places. Evidence of widespread coastal inundations from a wave {{convert|8|m|ft}} high has been found as far south as [[Fife]] and the impact on shore-dwelling mesolithic societies in Orkney would have been considerable.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) pp. 59&amp;ndash;60, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/Storegga.html "The Storegga Submarine Slides"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108042250/http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/Storegga.html |date=8 January 2008 }}.

==Neolithic==
[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|The seaward walls of Knap of Howar]]
The assemblage of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom and on the Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies came to the fore that were a radical departure from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/orkney.html "Death and re-birth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704181428/http://www.scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/orkney.html |date=4 July 2008 }} Scotland.org.

The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were constructed almost a millennium before the [[sarsen]] stones of [[Stonehenge]] were erected.&lt;ref&gt;The sarsens of Stonehenge were erected c. 2300 BC (see [http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1914 "Stonehenge – Forever a mystery"] English Heritage. Retrieved 27 September 2008). The Stones of Stenness on Orkney date from the fourth millennium BC, perhaps as early as 3400 (see [http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_280&amp;PropName=Stones%20Of%20Stenness%20Circle%20And%20Henge "Stones of Stenness Circle and Henge"] Historic Scotland. Retrieved 27 September 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; At one time it was believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, Clive (10 January 2014) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3449dde2-7800-11e3-afc5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2q5B0HnYi "Science: Orkney – hot spot of the Stone Age"].

===Early dwellings and chambered cairns===
[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|The interior of Knap of Howar]]
[[Knap of Howar]] Neolithic farmstead is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated on the island of [[Papa Westray]] (which may have been combined with nearby [[Westray]] in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. [[Unstan ware]] pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 31&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneydigs.org.uk/howar.html "The Knap of Howar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208183045/http://www.orkneydigs.org.uk/howar.html |date=8 February 2007 }} Orkney Archaeological Trust.

The [[Barnhouse Settlement]] is a cluster of at least fifteen buildings, including one that may have been used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/barnhouse/index.html "The Barnhouse Neolithic Settlement"]. Orkneyjar.

[[File:barnhouse04.jpg|thumb|left|House 3 in the Barnhouse Settlement, with [[Loch of Harray]] beyond]]

[[Skara Brae]] consists of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 3100&amp;ndash;2500 BC the houses are similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large [[midden]] containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four [[Carved Stone Balls|carved stone balls]] were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2000) pp. 1, 11&amp;ndash;15, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/world_heritage_sites/world-heritage-neolithic-orkney.htm "The Heart of Neolithic Orkney"].

There are two main types of [[chambered cairn]] on these islands: the Orkney/[[Cromarty]] type with a burial chamber approached through a low passage and usually divided into "stalls" by upright stone slabs, and the [[Maeshowe type]] (see below), which is a later development with a cruciform layout and an elongated passage.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) pp. 103, 115, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are a variety of sub-types including "Bookan", "Tri-partite" and "Hybrid". See Hedges (1984) pp. 80&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of [[Rousay]] has a substantial number of prehistoric sites (see also below), including fifteen of such tombs, resulting it becoming known as the "Egypt of the north".&lt;ref name=Rous&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/rousay/rousay/index.html "Rousay"] Undiscovered Scotland.

The exterior walls of this large stone burial mound survive to well over head-height and the constituent stones are arranged in a herring bone pattern. The original interior chambers were simple in style and dived into two or three stalls, but were later enlarged to include twelve separate compartments set along a {{convert|23|m|ft}} passageway.&lt;ref&gt;Feacham (1977). p54.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other substantial tombs at Blackhammer, Taversoe Tuick, and Yarso.&lt;ref name=Rous/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 52&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 14&amp;ndash;15 states that a list of 76 chambered tombs has been compiled for Orkney.&lt;/ref&gt; Enlargement and elaboration of burial cairns as the Neolithic progressed is a theme found throughout Scotland, and the move from simple and private tombs to larger structures, some with entrances apparently designed for public gatherings may also be linked to the emergence of landscape-scale ceremonial complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) pp. 137&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Other chambered tombs of significance include those at [[Unstan Chambered Cairn|Unstan]] and Bookan on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] and [[Holm of Papa|Holm of Papa Westray]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H84/&gt;

[[Links of Noltland]], a site on the north coast of the island of [[Westray]] has been excavated since the 1980s. In 2009 a lozenge-shaped figurine was discovered, which may have been carved 2500-3000 BC and is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland. The face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Archaeologist Richard Strachan described it as a find of "astonishing rarity".&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Frank (21 August 2009) "Face to face with the 5,000-year-old 'first Scot'." Edinburgh.

===The Heart of Neolithic Orkney===
[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|right|A stone dresser at Skara Brae]]
Skara Brae, [[Maeshowe]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Stones of Stenness]] together form the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the western part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/514 "Heart of Neolithic Orkney"] UNESCO. Retrieved 29 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) pp. 24&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.

There is also the possibility that tribal differences were part of the Neolithic cultural landscape. Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar, and stalled tombs such as Midhowe. [[Grooved Ware]] pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger 'village' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse, and with Maes Howe style tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maeshowe====

Dating from about 3000 BC, Maeshowe is a large chambered cairn and [[passage grave]].

It is aligned so that the rear wall of its central chamber, a rough cube of {{convert|4.5|m3|cuyd}} is illuminated on the [[winter solstice]]. It gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairns, (see above) that include other significant sites such as [[Cuween Hill Chambered Cairn|Cuween Hill]], [[Quanterness]] and [[Wideford Hill]], and at [[Quoyness]] on [[Sanday, Orkney|Sanday]].&lt;ref name=H84&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 84&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 54&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maes&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/index.html "Maeshowe"]. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

After it fell into disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by [[Vikings]] from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left a series of [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions on the stone walls of the chamber, some of which were left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 1153&amp;ndash;54. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 178&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/maeshrunes.htm "Maeshowe's runes - Viking graffiti"] Orkneyjar.

====Ring of Brodgar====
The [[Ring of Brodgar]] is a [[henge]] and [[stone circle]] {{convert|104|m|ft}} in diameter, originally made of 60 stones (of which only 27 remain standing) set within a circular ditch up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|10|m|ft}} wide. Some of the remaining stones are {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} high and it has been estimated that the ditch alone took 80,000 man-hours to construct. The ring stands on a small [[isthmus]] between the [[Loch of Stenness|Lochs of Stenness]] and Harray and it is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/brodgar/ " The Ring o' Brodgar, Stenness "].

More recent excavations have revealed a large temple complex on the site without parallel in western Europe, with more than a dozen large temples that were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/06/orkney-temple-centre-ancient-britain |title=Neolithic discovery: why Orkney is the centre of ancient Britain  |last=McKie |first=Robin |date=6 October 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site is now considered to be of such significance that Nick Card, director of excavations, was prompted to say in 2012: "We need to turn the map of Britain upside down when we consider the Neolithic and shrug off our south-centric attitudes...London may be the cultural hub of Britain today, but 5,000 years ago, Orkney was the centre for innovation for the British isles. Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges – stone rings with ditches round them – were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread to the rest of the Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012"/&gt;

====Stones of Stenness====
[[File:Stenness 1983.jpg|thumb|right|The Stenness Watch Stone stands outside the circle]]
The Stones of Stenness are five remaining [[megalith]]s of a henge, the largest of which is {{convert|6|m|ft}} high. The site is thought to date from 3100 BC, one of the earliest dates for a henge anywhere in Britain.&lt;ref name=Sten&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/standingstones/index.html "The Standing Stones o' Stenness"]. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A68&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 68&amp;ndash;70.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stones are part of a landscape that evidently had considerable ritual significance for the "[[Grooved ware people]]". The Ring of Brodgar lies about {{convert|1.2|km|mi}}  to the north-west, and Maeshowe is a similar distance to the east. Barnhouse is only {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the north.&lt;ref name=Barn/&gt;

The existing [[megalith]]s were originally part of an elliptical shaped stone circle of 12 stones, about {{convert|32|m|ft}} in diameter surrounded by a ditch that was {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|7|m|ft}} deep and with a single entrance causeway on the north side that faces towards the Barnhouse Settlement. The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} high. Other smaller stones include a square stone like a huge hearth setting in the centre of the circle and this along with the bones of cattle, sheep, wolves and dogs found in the ditch suggest ritual sacrifice and feasting.&lt;ref name=A68/&gt;

Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to [[List of Norse gods and goddesses|Norse gods]]. The "[[Odin]] Stone" was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding hands through the gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/odinstone/index.html  "The Odin Stone"] Orkneyjar. Retrieved 30 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century a local landowner and recent immigrant to Orkney decided to remove the Stones on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land in using the stones. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another. The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.&lt;ref name=Sten/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Late Neolithic sites===
[[File:Dwarfie Stane, Island of Hoy, Orkney.jpg|thumb|The Dwarfie Stane]]
The Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the "[[Tomb of the Eagles]]" is located on the cliffs of [[South Ronaldsay]]. This [[chambered tomb]] was in use for 800 years or more from 3150 BC, and has five separate stalls and three side-chambers. 16,000 human bones were found during the excavations, as well as 725 bird bones, predominantly [[white-tailed sea eagle]] and over {{convert|25|kg|lb}} of pottery shards.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, M. 2006. Flight of the eagles. ''British Archaeology'' '''86''': 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomboftheeagles.co.uk/ "Tomb of the Eagles"] tomboftheeagles.co.uk. Retrieved 11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 58&amp;ndash;59, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dwarfie Stane]] tomb on the island of [[Hoy]] is made from a single huge block of red [[sandstone]] with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century ''Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum'' by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by [[Giant (mythology)|giants]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp.19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland has produced a relative dearth of remains from this period in comparison to the Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/scotland/2200-800BC "Scotland: 2200-800 BC Bronze Age"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203063651/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/scotland/2200-800BC |date=3 December 2010 }} worldtimelines.org.uk Retrieved 23 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 32, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new [[Beaker people|Beaker]] culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[bronze]] metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 154, 158, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, Graeme and Edwards, Kevin J. (1994) [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_124/124_055_065.pdf "Palynology as a predictive tool in archaeology"] (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. '''124''' pp. 55&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt; There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a [[Celt]]ic culture in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.

In addition to various Mainland sites such as Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on [[Holm of Faray]], and a burnt mound and farmstead on [[Auskerry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 74&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age==

===Early Iron Age===
The Iron Age provides numerous substantial building remains. In the 1970s excavations at Quanterness, near the site of the Neolithic chambered tomb, revealed an [[Atlantic roundhouse]]. This was built about 700 BC using stone stripped from the older building that had fallen into disuse some two millennia previously. [[File:Midhowe Broch.jpg|thumb|left|Midhowe Broch on the west coast of [[Rousay]]]]Numerous similar finds have been made at for example, Bu on the Mainland and Pierowall Quarry on Westray. These are also many impressive [[broch]] sites. These are substantial stone towers that developed out of the roundhouse tradition in north and west Scotland, whose [[drystone|dry-stone]] walls may have reached {{convert|13|m|ft}} in height. Although Orkney has no broch towers where the surviving walls are more than a few metres high, several important sites have been excavated which have numerous associated buildings forming a "broch village".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 81&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midhowe Broch]] lies close to the chambered cairn of the same name on Rousay. There appear to have been at least two separate periods of occupation and at some point buttresses were added to the exterior of the wall, suggesting the structure was in need of support. It is one of 11 broch sites on either side of the [[Eynhallow]] Sound.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 122&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 92&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughston Broch on the island of [[Shapinsay]] was built in the second half of the first millennium BC and excavated in the mid 19th century. Its earth cladding is intact, allowing visitors to peer down into the [[broch]] from above. The walls are up to {{convert|4|m|ft}} thick in places and there is a complete chamber off the entrance passage. The remains of stone furniture are evident in the interior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/shapinsay/burroughstonbroch/index.html Burroughston Broch] Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (7 October 2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=7891 "Burroughston Broch"] The Megalithic Portal. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Burroughston Broch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burroughston Broch]], Shapinsay]]
[[Mine Howe]], located near Tankerness in the parish of [[St Andrews, Orkney|St Andrews]], is a prehistoric [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] man-made chamber dug {{convert|7|m|ft}} deep inside a large mound. Its purpose is not obvious. The walls are lined with stones fitted to form an arch over the cavity and steep steps lead to a rock floor. The entrance is at the top of the small hill and there is a surrounding ditch and evidence of sophisticated metal working around the site.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rennibister Earth House]] is a [[souterrain]]  consisting of an oval chamber with a corbelled roof supported by pillars. Although these structures are usually associated with the storage of food this site is reminiscent of the Neolithic chambered tombs and excavations revealed 18 human skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 127&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wheelhouse (archaeology)|Wheelhouses]] are stone buildings from the later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) form the basis for [[lintel]] arches supporting [[corbel]]led roofing with a hearth at the hub.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1998) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of [[Shetland]] and the [[Western Isles]]. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Iain "The wheelhouse" in Ballin Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 112, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arguably there are none in Orkney, in which case the reason for their absence is unknown. See Armit (2003) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of Rome===
For a brief period Orkney emerged from prehistory and into [[protohistory]]. The Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his ''On the Ocean'' he refers to the most northerly point as ''Orcas'', conceivably a reference to Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Broch of Gurness2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Broch of Gurness]]]]
Remarkably, the earliest written record of a formal connection between [[Roman empire|Rome]] and Scotland is the attendance of the "King of Orkney" who was one of eleven British kings who submitted to the Emperor [[Claudius]] at [[Camulodunum|Colchester]] in AD 43 following the [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of southern Britain]] three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later [[Caledonia]]n resistance to Rome is striking.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 174-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomponius Mela]], the Roman geographer, recorded in his ''De Chorographia'', written c. 43 AD, that there were thirty [[List of Orkney islands|Orkney islands]].&lt;ref name= B12&gt;Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to AD 60 from pottery found at the [[Broch of Gurness]] and 1st and 2nd century Roman coins have been found at Lingro broch.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (2008) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman presence in Scotland]] was however little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, William S. "The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes", in Edwards and Ralston (2003) pp. 195, 198. The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson (2003) p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued, largely unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson (2003) p. 216. "The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pictish rule===
[[File:Brough of Birsay.jpg|thumb|right|The tidal islet of Brough of Birsay]]
In the centuries following Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, at least for a time, part of the [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom. Very little is known about the Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being [[Pictish symbol stones|symbol stones]]. One of the best examples is located on the [[Brough of Birsay]]; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 106&amp;ndash;07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R39&gt;Ritchie, Anna "The Picts" in Omand (2003) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period.

[[Adomnan]], the biographer of St [[Columba]], states that there were Orcadians at the court of the Pictish High King, [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], in AD 565.&lt;ref name=R39/&gt; These Orcadians were described as "hostages" which could imply difficult relations between Orkney and the king, although they may have simply been guests at the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/history4.htm "A Brief History of Orkney: The Picts - 300-800AD"]. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 29 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A Pictish cemetery was found in the grounds of [[Skaill House]] (adjacent to Skara Brae) in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. The [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]] found at a Pictish site on [[Birsay]] is an [[Ogham]]&amp;ndash;inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Anna "The Picts" in Omand (2003) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th century was also the time the [[Viking]] invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial [[Orkneyinga Saga]] amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 11&amp;ndash;12 repeats an old jest that the ongoing use of flagstones as a material meant that the Stone Age in Orkney lasted until the first few decades of the 19th century, which saw the introduction of cheap wooden furniture and cement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological history==
Formal excavations are first recorded at Earl's Knoll on [[Papa Stronsay]] in the [[Statistical Account of Scotland]] in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/papar/orkney1.html "The Papar Project: Papa Stronsay"] RCAHMS. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Dwarfie Stane, the mound was assumed to be a giant's grave at the time. Following soon after this, work on the "Picts-house" (i.e. chambered tomb) at Quanterness commenced, but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century. F. W. L. Thomas, whose day job was as a [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the [[Royal Navy]] published ''The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney'' in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, F. W. L. (1852)  	 [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ARCHway/toc.cfm?rcn=150&amp;vol=34 "Account of some of the Celtic antiquities of Orkney, including the Stones of Stenness, Tumuli, Picts-houses, etc. with plans"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624055013/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ARCHway/toc.cfm?rcn=150&amp;vol=34 |date=24 June 2009 }} Archaeologia '''34'''. pp. 88&amp;ndash;136. Retrieved 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed various sites and aimed to interest "antiquarians" in the subject. His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer, R.J. Hebden and [[George Petrie (archaeologist)|George Petrie]]. However, other than work at Unstan near [[Stromness]] there was then a lull for about six decades. Then, from the late 1920s, work recommenced with the assistance of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] and the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. The most eminent archaeologist to work here at this time was [[Vere Gordon Childe]]. He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and Rinyo, but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V.G. and Grant, Walter G. (12 December 1938) [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_073/73_006_031.pdf A Stone-Age Settlement at the Braes of Rinyo, Rousay, Orkney]. (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950, including five on [[Eday]] and one on the [[Calf of Eday]] and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged. The advent of [[radiocarbon dating]] enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], such as those built by the [[Minoan civilization#Burial and mortuary practice|Minoans]], when it became clear that the former pre-dated the latter by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 20&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Capitalist pyramid 1900.jpg|thumb|The 1900 Russian cartoon]]

The '''Pyramid of Capitalist System''' is a common name of a 1911 American [[cartoon]] [[caricature]] [[criticism of capitalism|critical of capitalism]], closely based on a Russian flyer of {{circa}} 1900.&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"/&gt; The graphic focus is on [[social stratification]] by [[social class]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt; The work has been described as "famous",&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"/&gt; "well-known and widely reproduced".&lt;ref name=Krieger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krieger|first=N|title=Ladders, pyramids and champagne: the iconography of health inequities|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|date=1 December 2008|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1098–1104|doi=10.1136/jech.2008.079061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[derivative work]]s exist.&lt;ref&gt;Consider a number of modern derivative works found at the following websites:

It was published in the 1911 edition of ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' (The International Publishing Co., [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], U.S.), a newspaper of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and attributed to "Nedeljkovich, Brashich, &amp; Kuharich".&lt;ref name="Health2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Krieger Professor Harvard School of Public Health|title=Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context: Theory and Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z59ciXRRaPsC&amp;pg=PA338|date=23 March 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975035-1|pages=338–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lange2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristina Lange|title=Historisches Bildverstehen oder Wie lernen Schüler mit Bildquellen?: ein Beitrag zur geschichtsdidaktischen Lehr-Lern-Forschung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvSZLDF89tIC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-11354-2|pages=189–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laborarts.org/collections/item.cfm?itemid=428 |title=Labor Arts |publisher=Labor Arts |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture shows a literal "social pyramid" or hierarchy, with the wealthy few on the top, and the impoverished masses at the bottom. Crowned with a [[money bag]] representing [[capitalism]], the top layer, "we rule you", is occupied by the [[Royal family|royalty]] and state leaders. Underneath them are the [[clergy]] ("we fool you"), followed by the military ("we shoot at you"), and the [[bourgeoisie]] ("we eat for you"). The bottom of the pyramid is held by the workers ("we work for all... we feed all").&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marino2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Marino|title=Early Modern History and the Social Sciences: Testing the Limits of Braudel's Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zTwxlJoAocC&amp;pg=PA121|year=2002|publisher=Truman State Univ Press|isbn=978-1-931112-06-2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt;

The work is based on an anonymous 1900 caricature of the [[Russian Empire]] hierarchy by the [[Union of Russian Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reinhard Bendix|title=Kings Or People: Power and the Mandate to Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxAb4kAtzMYC&amp;pg=PA540|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04090-8|page=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hingley1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Hingley|title=A concise history of Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pewrAQAAIAAJ|date=1 March 1972|publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original picture showed workers supporting the pyramid on their backs, with the [[stanza]]: "The time will come when the people in their fury will straighten their bent backs and bring down the structure with one mighty push of their shoulders."&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"/&gt; Notable differences between the Russian 1900 original and the American 1911 derivative version include the replacement of the Russian Empire's black eagle with a money bag, the [[Russian tsar]] and tsarina with a more generic trio of figures (a monarch and state leaders in suits), two of the three [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (catholicism)|cardinal]] and a [[Protestant]] minister, and the Russian Empire army with a more generic group of soldiers; the workers are no longer bent and no revolutionary stanza is present. On both pictures, a fallen child or [[child worker]] symbolizes the plight of the workers.&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt; Another shared element is a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] raised amongst the workers, symbolizing the emergence of the [[socialist movement]].&lt;ref name="Nordin1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rune Nordin|title=Fackföreningsrörelsen i Sverige: Uppkomst och utveckling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZppIAAAAYAAJ|year=1981|publisher=Prisma i samarbete med Landsorganisationen i Sverige|isbn=978-91-518-1470-4|page=28|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The basic message of the image is the critique of the capitalist system, with its hierarchy of power and wealth. It also illustrates that the working class is supporting all others, and if it would withdraw their support from the system it could, literally, topple the existing social order.&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt; This type of [[criticism of capitalism]] is attributed to the French socialist [[Louis Blanc]].&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Mulgan|title=The Locust and the Bee: Predators and Creators in Capitalism's Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4gXkeGQkj4C&amp;pg=PA80|date=27 February 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-4665-X|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57452">The '''American Civil War bibliography''' comprises books that deal in large part with the [[American Civil War]]. There are over 60,000 books on the war, with more appearing each month.&lt;ref&gt;In 2001, Jonathan Sarna estimated that over 50,000 books had already appeared, with 1,500 more appearing annually. ''American Jewish History'' 89.3 (2001) 335&amp;ndash;337.&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is no complete bibliography to the war; the largest guide to books is over 40 years old and lists over 6,000 titles selected by leading scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Allan Nevins, Bell Irvin Wiley, and James I. Robertson, ''Civil War Books: A Critical Bibliography'' (2 vol, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; The largest guides to the historiography annotates over a thousand titles.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, Steven; et al., eds. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
One of four children, Robert Durst grew up in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. He is the son of [[real estate]] investor [[Seymour Durst]] and his wife [[Bernice Herstein]]. His siblings are [[Douglas Durst|Douglas]], Tommy, and Wendy. Durst's paternal grandfather, [[Joseph Durst]], a penniless [[Jewish]] tailor when he emigrated from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1902, eventually became a very successful real estate manager and developer, founding the [[Durst Organization]] in 1927. Seymour Durst became head of the family business in 1974 upon his father's death.&lt;ref name=WSJHelm&gt;{{cite news|first=Dana|last=Rubinstein |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704482704576072202098963980 |title=New York Real Estate: Douglas Durst Takes Helm to Change City Landscape |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|location=new York City|date=January 10, 2011 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert was seven, his mother died as a result of a fall from the family's Scarsdale home; he later claimed that, moments before her death, his father walked him to a window from which he could see her standing on the roof. In a March 2015 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview, however, his brother Douglas denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Dwyer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/nyregion/a-durst-sibling-recounts-the-violent-ripples-below-a-charming-surface.html?_r=0|title=A Durst Sibling Recounts the Violent Ripples Below a Charming Surface|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Jonathan|last=Bandler| title =Robert Durst admits lying about wife's disappearance on HBO|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/robert-durst-hbo-jinx-documentary/22999161/|newspaper =[[The Journal News]] | publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=New York City| date = February 7, 2015| accessdate =March 15, 2015| quote =Robert Durst addresses her 1950 suicide at the family's home in Scarsdale when he was 7.

"It never went through my mind that, 'What is she doing on the roof in her nightie?'"  He didn't see her fall but said he heard the maid shouting, "'She's off the roof.'"

==Crimes for which Durst has been investigated==
Police have directly questioned Durst, and sometimes conducted searches, in connection to the disappearance of his first wife Kathie McCormack, and two homicides, Susan Berman and Morris Black. In one of those homicides, he was tried and acquitted.

===Disappearance of Kathleen McCormack Durst===
In the fall of 1971, Durst met Kathleen McCormack, a dental hygienist, whose nickname was "Kathie". After two dates, Durst invited McCormack to share his home in Vermont, where he had opened a health food store; she moved there in January 1972.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral /&gt; However, Durst's father pressured him to move back to New York City to work in the family real estate business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Charles V.|last1=Bagli  |first2=Kevin|last2=Flynn|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/movies/28durst.html?pagewanted=all| title =That's Me on Screen, but I Still Didn't Do It| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date =November 24, 2010| accessdate =March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst and McCormack returned to Manhattan, where they married in April 1973.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral /&gt;&lt;ref name=JournalNewsTimeline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/17/robert-durst-timeline/24908191/|title=Robert Durst: A timeline|work=[[The Journal News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=White Plains, New York|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before her disappearance, McCormack was a student in her fourth and final year at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in [[The Bronx]] and was only a few months short of earning her degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Kevin|last1=Flynn|first2=Charles V.|last2=Bagli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/nyregion/reopened-mystery-special-report-woman-s-disappearance-still-baffling-after-19.html|title=REOPENED MYSTERY: A special report.; A Woman's Disappearance Is Still Baffling After 19 Years|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 6, 2001|access-date=March 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had intended to become a pediatrician.&lt;ref name="CTPost"/&gt; McCormack was last seen by someone other than Durst the evening of January 31, 1982,&lt;ref name="Charley Project Kathleen"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Meaghan|last=Good|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/d/durst_kathleen.html|title=The Charley Project: Kathleen Durst Elizabeth|website=www.charleyproject.org|access-date=March 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213072427/http://charleyproject.org/cases/d/durst_kathleen.html|archivedate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/560dfny.html|title=The Doe Network: Case File 560DFNY|website=www.doenetwork.org|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her best friend's [[Party#Dinner party|dinner party]] in [[Newtown, Connecticut]]. She had arrived unexpectedly and her friend noticed she was upset. She was also wearing red sweatpants, which the friend found odd since McCormack had often dressed in much better quality clothing.

"I was hoping that would just make everything go away."&lt;ref name=HBOlies/&gt;

After McCormack had left her friend's house, she was supposed to meet her friend at a pub called The Lion's Gate in Manhattan. When she failed to show up, her friend became concerned and repeatedly called the police for several days. Days later, Durst filed a [[missing person]] report as well. A doorman at one of the two Manhattan apartments where the couple lived claimed to have seen McCormack there on February 1, which was one day after she was last seen, but also claimed that he had seen her only from behind and couldn't be 100% sure that it was her.

McCormack had been treated at a Bronx [[hospital]] for facial bruises three weeks before. She told a friend that Durst beat her, yet she did not press charges over the incident.&lt;ref name="VanityFair"/&gt; McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 [[divorce]] settlement.&lt;ref name="NYPostPrudence"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/woman-who-inspired-the-beatles-dear-prudence-once-dated-robert-durst/|title=Woman who inspired The Beatles' 'Dear Prudence' once dated Robert Durst|work=[[New York Post]]|author1=Isabel Vincent  |author2=Melissa Klein |lastauthoramp=yes |date=March 28, 2015|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition.&lt;ref name="VultureAllGoodThings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/robert-dursts-all-good-things-dvd-commentary.html|title=The Creepiest Things Robert Durst Says in His ''All Good Things'' DVD Commentary|work=[[Vulture.com|New York Magazine (Vulture.com)]]|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015|author=Alex Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time his wife disappeared, Durst had been dating [[Prudence Farrow]] for three years and was living in a separate apartment.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral&gt;{{cite news|author1=Charles V.

When McCormack's friend and sister had heard she was reported missing, they broke into her [[cottage]] hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked and McCormack's mail left unopened. They then became afraid and left.

====Investigation and aftermath====
After McCormack went missing, police said that Durst had claimed to have last spoken to her when she called him at their cottage from Manhattan. He claimed that the last time he had seen her was at [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah train station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2015/01/27/robert-durst-wife-disappearance/22405297/|title=No answer to Kathie Durst's 1982 disappearance|work=lohud.com|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was planning to board a 21:15 train to Manhattan. He also claimed that on February 4, the supervisor at her medical school called him and said that she had called in sick on February 1 and was absent from class for the entire week. It is uncertain if it was indeed McCormack who made the call. The day after Durst received the call from McCormack's medical school, he reported her as missing. The police found his stories to be full of contradictions.

He was eventually extradited to Texas for trial. 

====Trial====
In 2003, Durst was tried for the murder of Black. He employed defense attorney [[Dick DeGuerin]] and claimed [[self-defense]]; DeGuerin conducted two mock trials in preparation for the case.&lt;ref name="MashableCriss"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Mashable]]|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/16/galveston-judge-durst-acquittal-dangerous/|author=Pamela Chelin|title=Judge who presided over Robert Durst acquittal in Texas murder: 'He's very dangerous'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst's defense team had difficulty communicating with him, so they hired psychiatrist Dr. Milton Altschuler to find out why. Altschuler spent over 70 hours examining Durst and diagnosed him with [[Asperger syndrome]], saying, "His whole life's history is so compatible with a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder." Durst's defense team argued at trial that the diagnosis explained his behavior.&lt;ref name="CBS 2004-03-15"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Mystery of Robert Durst | author = Leung, Rebecca | publisher = [[CBS News]] | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-of-robert-durst-15-03-2004/ | accessdate = December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durst claimed he and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, struggled for control of Durst's .22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it.

Durst's attorneys requested a later date for the federal weapons charge trial, saying they'd need more time to prepare after rulings on pending motions.

Holm.&lt;ref name="NYTStepsBack"/&gt;

Durst traveled and lived under dozens of aliases over the years,&lt;ref name="NewsweekWork"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-it-was-work-robert-durst-315251|title=What it was like to work for Robert Durst|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|author=Polly Mosendz}}&lt;/ref&gt; using different identities to buy cars, rent apartments, and open credit card accounts.&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt; "He had a scanner, copier, and a laminating machine," a former office employee of Durst told ''[[Newsweek]]''. "What I didn't realize is that I unwittingly saw what would have allowed Robert Durst to make a fake driver's license."&lt;ref name="NewsweekWork"/&gt; Durst was also "a prolific user of private mailboxes," and apparently conducted business under a number of canine-themed names: Woofing LLC, WoofWoof LLC, and Igor-Fayette Inc.&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, Durst owned a series of seven [[Alaskan Malamute]]s each named Igor, which according to his brother Douglas all died under mysterious circumstances. In December 2014, prior to the airing of ''The Jinx'', Douglas told ''The New York Times'' that, "In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing [of] his wife with those dogs."&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTRobertInterview"&gt;{{cite news|quote="Before the disappearance of my sister-in-law, Bob had a series of Alaskan Malamutes, which is like a husky," Douglas said. "He had seven of them, and they all died, mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them. All of them named Igor. We don't know how they died, and what happened to their bodies. In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing of his wife with those dogs." What led him to that conclusion, Douglas said, was that Robert turned the word "Igor" into a verb and inflected it with a menace: "When he was in jail in Pennsylvania, he was recorded saying, 'I want to Igor Douglas.'"|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 1, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|title=Real Estate Chief Fears Troubled Sibling Has New Weapon: TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/series-on-troubled-scion-of-durst-real-estate-family-has-critic-his-brother.html|author=Jim Dwyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst was once recorded saying he wanted to "Igor" Douglas.&lt;ref name="NYTRobertSpeaks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/nyregion/for-durst-family-arrest-brings-a-tremendous-sense-of-relief.html|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015|author=Jim Dwyer|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=For Durst Family, Arrest Brings a 'Tremendous Sense of Relief'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst, however, has disputed the notion that he owned seven dogs named Igor; he owned three, he said, one that was run over and another that died in surgery after eating an apple core, "before the Igor that lasted forever."&lt;ref name="VultureAllGoodThings"/&gt;

In late 1981, while Durst was still married to McCormack, he was nearing the end of a three-year affair with Prudence Farrow, who was also married at the time. A few months before McCormack's disappearance in January 1982, Farrow called her and asked that she give him up, as friends said she wanted him all to herself. After Durst's acquittal of murdering Black in 2003, Farrow contacted law enforcement authorities with concerns for her safety, as she said Durst was angry with her for terminating their relationship three days before McCormack disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/woman-who-inspired-the-beatles-dear-prudence-once-dated-robert-durst/|title=Woman who inspired The Beatles’ ‘Dear Prudence’ once dated Robert Durst - New York Post|date=March 28, 2015|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial status and residences===
In mid 2002, Durst signed over a [[power of attorney]] to his wife Charatan, a real estate investor,&lt;ref name="NYT0903"/&gt; and it is believed their holdings remain closely intermingled.&lt;ref name="NewsweekCharatan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/shadowy-history-robert-dursts-real-estate-holdings-314764|work=[[Newsweek]]|title=The Shadowy History Of Robert Durst's Real Estate Holdings|author=Polly Mosendz|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Durst gave Charatan around $20 million of his $65 million trust settlement.&lt;ref name="PapersSeized"/&gt;

During that time he received $2 million a year from the trust.

On May 1, 2015, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Douglas had settled litigation against ''Jinx'' filmmaker [[Andrew Jarecki]], having confirmed that Robert was the source of videotaped depositions that appeared in the documentary. Robert's disclosure apparently violated the terms of his 2006 agreement with the Durst family, which had dispersed to him a lump sum of family trust assets. Although it was unclear whether Jarecki confirmed Robert as his source&amp;mdash;''The New York Times'' reported in March 2015 that Jarecki was given "unrestricted access" to Robert's personal records, including the videotaped material&amp;mdash;the settlement paves the way for Douglas to reclaim as much as $74 million of his brother's assets, effectively freezing those assets pending court judgment.

In November 2015, nearly 34 years after her disappearance, McCormack's three sisters and 101-year-old mother sued Durst for $100 million, citing his apparent role in her murder and his denial to her family of the "right to sepulcher", a New York law that grants immediate relatives access to a deceased person's body and the opportunity to determine appropriate burial.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/nyregion/family-of-robert-dursts-first-wife-sues-him-for-100-million-in-her-disappearance.html|title=Family of Robert Durst's First Wife Sues Him for $100 Million in Her Disappearance|work=The New York Times|first=Charles V.|last=Bagli|date=November 30, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successful, the lawsuit could deprive Durst of most or all of his inherited fortune.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov/&gt; McCormack's brother James had attempted in October 2015 to file a [[wrongful death]] suit against Durst on behalf of his mother, but was challenged by one of his sisters, who holds her mother's power of attorney.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov/&gt; DeGuerin commented that "there is no evidence that Robert Durst had anything to do with Kathleen's disappearance.

===Other legal issues===
In 2012 and 2013, Durst's family members sought and received restraining orders against him, claiming they were afraid of him. Durst was charged with trespassing in New York for walking in front of townhouses owned by his brother Douglas and other family members. He went on trial and was acquitted in December 2014. The judge also vacated the thirteen orders of protection his family members had taken out on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Charles V.

In July 2014, Durst was arrested after turning himself in to police following an incident at a Houston [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] drugstore in which he allegedly exposed himself without provocation and urinated on a rack of candy.

==In popular culture==
* The events surrounding Durst inspired the 2010 film ''[[All Good Things (film)|All Good Things]]'', the title of which is a reference to a health food store of the same name set up by Durst and his wife in the 1970s.

'''Sanlúcar de Barrameda 2019–2022''' is a program of events in Spain and Portugal, to be held between 2019 and 2022 in commemoration of the five hundredth anniversary of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the Earth. Events will be co-ordinated via an organisation located in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cádiz)]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanlucardebarrameda.tv/drupal/node/1366?q=node/1809 Presentado el logotipo del V Centenario de la primera circunnavegación de la tierra]. Sanlúcar de Barrameda.tv. 15 November 2010. Accessed: 26 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
The commemoration of the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] expedition, five centuries later, aims to:
* Contribute to the junction between different cultures and sciences of every people around the world.
* Facilitate the participation and integration in this commemoration of initiatives from different cities and countries.
* Make known worldwide the city that saw depart and successfully complete the first circumnavigation of the globe, one of the greatest achievements performed by humans.
* Provide Sanlúcar de Barrameda a universal city project, developing actions which serve as a celebration of the historical past of the city, while constituting a legacy for its future.

== History ==
[[File:Ceramica-Sanlucar Barrameda 1ª circunnavegación mundial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Commemorative plaque of the 1st circumnavigation of the Earth, Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cádiz), Spain]]

Although the idea of this initiative comes from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in 2003, is rooted a century earlier, in 1913, when Genaro Cavestany, land register, promoted and called for this city the celebration of the fourth centenary of that first circumnavigation, as it was the starting point&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-FnUAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Colección de los viajes y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV: Expediciones al Maluco, viage de Magallanes y de Elcano.] Volume 4 of ''Colección de los viajes y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV: Con varios documentos inéditos concernientes á la historia de la marina castellana y de los establecimientos españoles en Indias.''

This book is the Spanish translation from the original source, published in Italian in [[Venice]], 1536.&lt;/ref&gt; of that expedition.

At the time, that celebration did not take place in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, but in other Spanish cities. Since 2003, a group of people from Sanlúcar have been working on getting this time which was not possible then, and now, with more preparation and support, that will be possible. There are a large number of historical studies which prove that the expedition left and ended in Sanlúcar de Barrameda. It was the departure and arrival port of the voyages of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|exploration, discovery and colonization]] the Spanish had made by sea since the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]] and therefore it was called "the door of America".

In September 2004 this group started working in the draft of this V centenary celebration, presented it to the City Hall and began to draw up a roadmap. In June 2007, with the support from the City Hall and the ''Círculo de Artesanos'' the project ''Sanlúcar 2019–2022'' is presented. Between 2008 and 2010 the first acts to claim this event are held.

In 2010, ''Fundaciónn Eduardo Domínguez Lobato'' and ''Círculo de Artesanos'', in collaboration with the City Council and the promoters of the idea, grant the first ''Circumnavigation to Culture and History Awards'', being first winners the cities of [[Sabrosa Municipality|Sabrosa]] (birthplace of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in Portugal), [[Getaria (Spain)|Getaria]] (birthplace of [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]]) and Sanlúcar de Barrameda itself (start and end of the expedition trip). Prizes will be awarded on an annual basis to countries, cities and people who had such a significant relationship with that epic.

== Organization and acts ==
Some of the acts already performed or planned to develop this initiative are:
*Cultural Weeks on the Circumnavigation, held since 2008.
*Conferences, concerts and exhibitions.
*Presentation of the logo for this 5th centenary of the first Earth circumnavigation.&lt;ref name="sd15n"&gt;[http://www.sanlucardigital.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7617%3Apresentacion-logo-circumnavegacion&amp;catid=63%3Aturismo Presentación logo circunnavegación.] Sanlúcar digital. 15 de noviembre de 2010.

'''Simon Kenton''' (April 3, 1755 – April 29, 1836) was a [[United States]] [[frontier]]sman and soldier in West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. He was a friend of [[Daniel Boone]], [[Simon Girty]], [[Spencer Records]], [[Thomas S. Hinde]], [[Thomas Hinde]],  and [[Isaac Shelby]]. He served the United States in the [[Revolution]], the [[Northwest Indian War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. Surviving the gauntlet and ritual torture, in 1778 he was adopted into the [[Shawnee people]]. He married twice and had a total of ten children.

==Family and early life==
Simon Kenton was born at the headwaters of Mill Run in the Bull Run Mountains on April 3, 1755, in [[Prince William County, Virginia]] to Mark Kenton, Sr. (an immigrant from [[Ireland]]) and Mary Miller Kenton (whose family was Scots-Welsh in ancestry). In 1771, at the age of 16, thinking he had killed a man in a jealous rage (the fight began over the love of a girl), Kenton fled into the wilderness of [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Ohio]], where for years he went by the name "Simon Butler." After learning that his victim had lived, Kenton took back his original surname.

==Noted activities==

In 1774, in a conflict later labeled [[Dunmore's War]], Kenton served as a scout for the European settlers against the [[Shawnee]] Indians in what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In 1777, he saved the life of his friend and fellow frontiersman, [[Daniel Boone]], at [[Boonesborough, Kentucky]].

The following year, Kenton was rescued from the Shawnee in Ohio by [[Simon Girty]]. He had survived many days of [[running the gauntlet]] and various other ritual tortures that usually caused death. He was later taken about 50 miles for more torture at [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]]. There he was saved by Pierre Drouillard, an interpreter for the British Indian department and father of explorer [[George Drouillard]].&lt;ref name="backs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/explore/magazine/fallwin2003/simonkenton.htm |title=Jean Backs, "Simon Kenton-Frontier Hero" |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304213043/http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/explore/magazine/fallwin2003/simonkenton.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2006 |df= }}, ''Explore'', Fall-Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Shawnee respected Kenton for his endurance; they named him ''Cut-ta-ho-tha'' (the condemned man). He was "adopted into the tribe by a motherly squaw whose own son had been slain."&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;

Kenton served as scout on the 1778 [[George Rogers Clark]] expedition to capture [[Fort Sackville]] during the American Revolution. Independence did not mean an end to warfare; in 1793-94 Kenton fought in the [[Northwest Indian War]] with [[Anthony Wayne|"Mad" Anthony Wayne]].

Kenton started exploring the area of the Mad River Valley of Ohio and making claims as early as 1788. Kenton first saw the area a decade before while he was held as a prisoner with the Shawnee and vowed that if he survived he would return. In April 1799, Kenton and his associate, [[William Ward (frontiersman)|Colonel William Ward]], led a group of families from [[Mason County, Kentucky]] to an area between present-day Springfield and Urbana, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/urbanachampaignc00writ|title=Urbana and Champaign county|last=Writers' Program (Ohio)|first=|publisher=Urbana, O., Gaumer publishing company|year=1942|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 Kenton moved to [[Urbana, Ohio]], where he achieved the rank of brigadier general of the state militia.  He served in the [[War of 1812]] as both a scout and as leader of a militia group in the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813. This was the battle in which the Indian chief [[Tecumseh]] was killed. Kenton was chosen to identify Tecumseh's body but, recognizing both Tecumseh and another fallen warrior named [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]], and seeing soldiers gleefully eager to carve up Tecumseh's body into souvenirs, he identified Roundhead as the chief.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Allen W., ''The Frontiersmen'' (Bantam Books, Little, Brown &amp; Company, Inc., 7th Printing, 1980), pp. 687-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large boulder located on the west side of the Ritter Public Library in [[Vermilion, Ohio]], discovered in 1937 on a farm a few miles to the south, is inscribed "1784 S. KENTON," and tradition has it that it was carved by Kenton himself while in Indian custody. Documentary evidence, however, shows that Kenton was not in Indian custody in 1784, was not near Vermilion in 1784 and did not learn to write until 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermilionohio.org/vermviews/vermviews-383.htm|title=Tuff Stuff|work=Vermillion Views|date=n.d.|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Kenton married Martha Dowden and they had four children together.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt; After she died in a house fire, the widower married Elizabeth Jarboe as his second wife. He had six children with her.

Kenton died in (and was initially buried at) New Jerusalem in [[Logan County, Ohio]]. His body was later moved to [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]].

Later his widow Elizabeth Jarboe Kenton and a number of their children moved to northwestern Indiana, to an area straddling [[Jasper County, Indiana|Jasper]], [[White County, Indiana|White]], and [[Pulaski County, Indiana|Pulaski]] counties. It was heavily settled by families who migrated from [[Champaign County, Ohio]], where Kenton is buried.

==Namesakes==

Kenton, Tennessee - named after Simon Kenton, a frontiersman, Indian fighter, surveyor, and an intimate friend of Daniel Boone - is a bedroom community of 1,308 located at the heart of the quad-county area, approximately 15 minutes from four county seats, on Highway 45 West and Highway 89. Kenton is in two counties (Obion &amp; Gibson Counties) and is located 45 miles north of Jackson, Tennessee, 75 miles southwest of Kentucky Lake, 35 miles southeast of Reelfoot Lake and 5 miles from the Obion River bottom and Half Moon Lake.

{{italictitle}}
==History==

The ''Survey of Current Business'' has been published monthly since July 1921, then under the auspices of the [[Bureau of the Census]], [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], and the [[Bureau of Standards]] divisions of the United States Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/1921/0721cont.pdf|title = Survey of Current Business|date = July 1, 1921|accessdate = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting January 1994, the survey started publishing a table of contents online.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Starting February 2014, print publication of the Survey was ceased on account of low demand for the print publication as well as budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;

Past issues are available online at the BEA web site.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/date_guide.asp|title = Survey of Current Business Online: Archives|publisher = [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archives of past issues are also available from other sources.&lt;ref name=fraser-archives&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/46|title = Survey of Current Business|publisher = [[FRASER]]|accessdate = October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fdlp/&gt;

==Content==

Each issue of the ''Survey of Current'' Business includes a list of regularly reported national data, industry data, international data, and regional data. In addition, each issue contains articles about topical issues such as recent government budgets or laws or other national and international developments.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/index.htm|title = Survey of Current Business|publisher = [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and charts related to the survey can be accessed online using the BEA's iTable feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/itable/|title = Interactive Data|publisher = [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data and charts are linked to from the SCB's main page and archive pages.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

==Reception==

The ''Survey of Current Business'' is widely used by macroeconomists and financial analysts to understand the state of the US economy. The numbers reported in the SCB are often treated as standard values for reference purposes and are used to judge the accuracy of forecasts or other estimates. For instance, the [[Livingston Survey]] relies on the SCB for its quarterly variables of real non-residential fixed investment and corporate profit after taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/livingston-survey/livingston-data-sources.pdf|title = Livingston Survey: Data Sources and Descriptions|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Neanderthal Parallax''' is a trilogy of novels written by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] and published by [[Tor Books|Tor]]. It depicts the effects of the opening of a connection between two versions of [[Earth]] in different [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]: the world familiar to the reader, and another where [[Neanderthal]]s became the dominant intelligent [[hominid]]. The societal, spiritual and technological differences between the two worlds form the focus of the story.

The trilogy's volumes are ''Hominids'' (published 2002), ''Humans'' (2003), and ''Hybrids'' (2003). ''Hominids'' first appeared as a serial in ''[[Analog Science Fiction]]'', won the 2003 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]],&lt;ref name="WWE-2003"/&gt; and was nominated for the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|John W. Campbell Award]] the same year;&lt;ref name="WWE-2003"/&gt; ''Humans'' was a 2004 Hugo Award finalist.&lt;ref name="nyt040414"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWE-2004"/&gt; In 2017, the full trilogy was presented the [[Aurora Awards|Aurora Award]] for Best of the Decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release for the 2017 Aurora awards winners|url=http://www.prixaurorawards.ca/2017-prix-aurora-boreal/|website=2017 PRIX AURORA-BORÉAL|publisher=Aurora Awards|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial contact between the two worlds takes place at the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], which is also the location of a scientific research facility in the Neanderthal world.

==Terminology==
As the books unfold, the term ''human'' is used to refer to both species; both species agree to use the Neanderthal terms—''gliksin'' for members of ''Homo sapiens'' and ''barast'' for members of ''Homo neanderthalensis''—to distinguish between them.

==Barast society==
Barasts (Neanderthals) are dedicated hunter-gatherers, and have no developed concept of agriculture. Despite this, they are still technologically advanced, possessing [[quantum computer]]s, [[helicopter]]s, communications, and biological recording instruments. They live in harmony with their environment, using clean energy, living homes, and keeping a constant population. They measure long periods of time in lunar months, not years. The total barast population is much lower, numbering only 185 million worldwide compared to the gliksins' (humans') 6 billion.

===Family life===
Due to their advanced senses of smell, barasts are very sensitive to [[pheromone]]s. Accordingly, women and men live in separate communities for 25 out of every 29 days. The four days when they do come together — known as ''two becoming one'' — are the cause of a monthly celebration and holiday. All barast women have synchronized menstrual cycles, and the meeting-times are set so that conception is unlikely — except every 10 years, when another generation is purposely conceived. Generations thus grow in synchronized, ten-year cycles; no barast needs to give his age, as simply stating his generation (if this is not simply inferred from his appearance) will give the needed information.

All children live with their mothers until they reach the age of ten; boys then go to live with their fathers. Children remain with their appropriate parent until the approximate age of 18. Despite this separation of sexes, the barast find the idea of considering either sex better than the other for any reason to be completely foreign (female barast do not suffer any large-scale physical incapacity due to pregnancy). The separation is a voluntary and cultural thing, and people of both sexes are free to go where the other lives at all times, but find it physically and socially discomfiting to do so when two are not one. However, facilities and living styles are fully and truly 'separate but equal' in barast society, and in the rare event that it is too difficult or resource intensive to do so (for example, large scale scientific facilities), this separation is ignored without incident.

While opposite-sex couples form long-term bonds similar to marriage, the same is true of life during the rest of the month. All barasts would consider themselves [[bisexual]] by the gliksin definition; they form same-sex bonds while two are not one. Thus each adult who so chooses, no matter their gender, has a ''man-mate'' and a ''woman-mate''; one for procreation and the genetic family basis, the other for companionship and a family unit base when their opposite-sex partner is not present. The larger, intertwined family networks that result add cohesion to barast society.

===Government and justice===
The barast world has a single government hierarchy: each region of the globe is governed by a local ''Gray Council''; these in turn answer to the ''High Gray Council'', the world government.

About eight decades before the time of the novels, ''companion implants'' were perfected and issued to all barasts. These are comprehensive recording and transmission devices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is constantly monitored and sent to their ''alibi archive'', a repository of recordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper authorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in circumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after death; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what circumstances and or by whom a deceased person's archive can be accessed.

Any serious crime has a single punishment: the [[castration]] of the offender and all others who share at least half his genes (parents, siblings, and children). This [[eugenics|eugenic]] practice serves to keep any undesirable elements out of the gene pool without severely punishing an offender, beyond his loss of genetic heritage.

As a result, serious crimes of almost any sort are virtually unknown in the barast world. The exception is sexual crimes committed by a partner. Because the punishment for such crimes, such as spousal abuse, would include the castration of the complainant's own children, these crimes are unreported. While divorce for barast is generally a simple matter of deciding and declaring not to be with another person, those in such relationships find themselves trapped, as freeing their partner to seek a new mate opens the possibility that the new mate will report the violent activity.

Because barast physical strength is much higher than that of a gliksin, any physical violence between them is almost certain to result in death or serious injury. They thus lack any direct physical confrontation sports and martial arts (the second is lacking additionally because barast do not believe in conflict; they have had only one war in their recent history, with the loss of 83 people being considered a horrendous tragedy). Any physical violence, if reported, results in immediate imposition of castration. However, because the punishment is so severe, these incidents are not always reported officially, and if the injured party is willing to forgive, and the aggressor undertakes counseling for anger management, an incident may go unpunished. Such incident is admissible in a future legal hearing as evidence of a prior disposition to violence, however.

===Environment===
Lower population levels and the absence of large-scale agriculture mean that many species exist which are extinct on the gliksin version of Earth. These include not only birds such as the [[passenger pigeon]], but also [[megafauna]] such as the [[woolly mammoth]]. Also, forests are much more extensive because there was no need to cut them down on a large scale. Barasts have domesticated wolves as companions, but have not bred them into the many varieties of the domestic dog. A gliksin may become fearful upon seeing a barast dog, thinking it a wild wolf. A barast, seeing a gliksin's dog such as a [[dachshund]], may wonder if the creature really ''is'' a dog.

It is heavily implied that the barast did not spread to large areas of their world until after they had achieved a high level of civilization. One scene has a gliksin and a barast ancestor looking across the Mediterranean; the gliksin ancestor eagerly sets off to explore the new, strange place, while the barast ancestor notes its existence and goes home. This is consistent with their hunter-gatherer lifestyle which favors high levels of knowledge concerning the land and low migration, including a general avoidance of danger. Also, it is mentioned that barast are naturally of higher intelligence than gliksin, with average IQ being 10% higher before a several generation eugenic campaign, during which the least intelligent 10% were voluntarily sterilized to increase the species intelligence (no data is given on the post campaign IQ comparison). It is theorized that this difference is an additional reason for the lower occurrence of extinction events: because of their higher intelligence, the barast were able to recognize far earlier in their civilization that over-hunting would deplete a species.

The climate in the barast world is also somewhat cooler, because of the lack of greenhouse gases compared to the gliksins' Earth. Barasts are not as heat-tolerant as gliksins, probably because they evolved on a cooler Earth and also due to their greater muscle mass. As a result, tropical regions of their Earth are just as underpopulated as the polar regions on the gliksins' Earth. A significant story feature is the state of the Earth's [[magnetic field]]. In the barast world a reversal of polarity happened shortly before the story starts and caused no noticeable harm to the barasts. As to why the pole reversals are off by several years, it is ascribed to random small differences over the intervening 40,000 years. In the gliksin world  it is happening as the stories take place; this has an effect on the minds of gliksins, whose brain structures are different from the barasts' (see Religion).

===Language===
With the use of computer-aided communication devices, readers get to see only a glimpse of barast language. A ''dooslarm basadlarm'' refers to something like a judicial preliminary hearing with a literal translation of "asking small before asking large." The phrase ''Dusble korbul to kalbtadu'' is translated as "In a quantum-computing facility." Barast language is rendered as English when the action takes place in the barast world. One aspect of the language which can be discerned through the use of words like "gristle!" and "marrowless bone" for curses is that this register of speech is derived directly from real-world items. The customary barast greeting is "Healthy day."

===Economy===
Barast do not have a monetary economy. Each person is given what they need when they need it, and in turn is expected to work at providing a meaningful 'contribution' to society. No barast would ever dream of attempting to take more than they need from society, and because of their stable population, there are no issues with scarcity (the population level was stabilized at the point it was in order to prevent such issues from even developing).

Barast always consider their work in terms of how it contributes to society, and any work which does not contribute sufficiently is stopped. This leads to a lack of knowledge in certain areas, such as astrophysics, as such pursuits are stopped once they ceased to produce meaningful improvements in ordinary life. This also leads to some over-specialization, as driving is considered a specialized contribution and how to do so is known only to public conveyors whose sole contribution is to taxi people from point to point or to drive public buses.

Occasionally, a Barast may voluntarily remove themselves from society in order to continue work that has been deemed not meaningful or to protest when work is purposefully stopped as dangerous. This individual would move away from the community to an isolated area, and would thereafter support themselves. They would not be able to generally ask for assistance from the greater community, and would also in some cases remove their Alibi Archive implant as protest (so their life after leaving the community would not be recorded) or have it removed involuntarily (to prevent any further recording regarding dangerous work). This isolation is voluntary, and they can have visitors or opt to return to the community at any time, although returning requires that they resume providing a meaningful contribution (and cease any dangerous work, if that was the reason for leaving).

===Medicine===
Barast medicine has become largely automated, and most doctors, aside from first aid (excepting researchers), simply operate and maintain this technology. This technology is highly robust and is able to be adapted to Gliksin physiology fairly quickly after contact. 

A notable difference in medical practice is a result of the lack of squeamishness displayed by the Barast. Rather than using anesthesia for surgery, this technology uses direct neural blocks to cut off signals from any body part being operated on while the operation is performed in full view of the doctor and the patient being operated on. The Barast do not find this disturbing in the least, which one Gliksin theorizes is because, as they are still a civilization completely composed of active hunters, they have been exposed to such scenes since childhood.

===Religion===
The Barasts have no religion and no concept of religion. This is not due to a simple disbelief or worldwide atheism. The Barasts never had a religion and are not physically capable of believing in a god or gods or having religious experiences due to the structure of their brains. Prior to contact between the gliksins and the Barasts, the Barasts had no concept of a creator; an afterlife or souls never occurred to them. The Barasts do not understand how the gliksins can possibly believe in the stories their religions tell, and are sometimes frustrated with the gliksins' insistence of the truth of their beliefs. Nevertheless, the Barasts do accept religion as a part of who the gliksins are. The Barasts also do not believe that the universe had a beginning and do not adhere to the [[Big Bang]] theory. Instead, they believe the universe has always existed, and can point to scientific evidence and verified theory to back up this belief. They believe that the gliksin theories concerning an origin of the universe exist because of the gliksin need to believe in a creator, and thus a beginning, which biases gliksin science. The story ends before any large-scale intermingling and rationalization of the two races' science can begin, so the ultimate outcome of detailed comparison between these viewpoints is unknown.

'''''The Road Goes Ever On''''' is a [[song cycle]] that has been published as a book of [[sheet music]], and as an audio recording.  The music was written by [[Donald Swann]], and the words are taken from poems in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] writings, especially ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

The title of this opus is taken from "[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]", the first song in the collection.  The songs form a [[song cycle]], designed to fit together when played in sequence.

== Musical and lyrical content ==

With Tolkien's approval, Donald Swann wrote the music for this song cycle, and much of the music resembles English traditional music or folk music.  The sole exception is the [[Quenya]] song "[[Namárië]]", which was based on a tune by Tolkien himself and which has some affinities to [[Gregorian chant]].

This book has been valued even by those uninterested in the music, since it helps Tolkien's readers to better understand the [[culture]]s of the various mythological beings presented in Middle-earth, and helps [[linguistics|linguist]]s analyse Tolkien's poetry. For example, it contains one of the longest samples of the language [[Quenya]] (in the song "Namárië"), as well as the [[Sindarin]] prayer "A Elbereth Gilthoniel" with grammatical explanations.

Also, in addition to the sheet music, the book includes an introduction that contains additional information about Middle-earth. Prior to the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', this introduction was the only publicly available source for certain information about the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Publication history (book and audio recordings) ==

The first edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On: a Song Cycle'' was published on 31 October 1967, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christina Scull]] &amp; [[Wayne G. Hammond]] (2006), ''[[The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'', HarperCollins, 'Chronology' volume p.710; {{ISBN|978-0-618-39113-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Gramophone record|LP record]] of this song cycle was recorded on 12 June 1967, with Donald Swann on piano and William Elvin singing.  Side one of this record consisted of Tolkien himself reading five poems from ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.  The first track on side two was Tolkien reading the Elvish prayer "[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]".  The remainder of side two contained the song cycle performed by Swann and Elvin.&lt;ref&gt;See the scans of the LP jacket [http://www.donaldswann.co.uk/DS-LP2details.html here] and [http://rarelibrary.com/book/COL-C/151/POEMS+AND+SONGS+OF+MIDDLE+EARTH+LP+RECORD+ALBUM.html here], as well as the list of tracks [http://www.discogs.com/release/1039597 here].&lt;/ref&gt; This LP record, entitled '''''Poems and Songs of Middle Earth''''' and released by [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon Records]] (TC 1231), is long out of print and very difficult to find.

The second edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On'', published in 1978, added music for "[[Bilbo's Last Song]]."  This song was also published separately.

The third edition, published in 1993, added music for "Lúthien Tinúviel" from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which had earlier appeared in ''The Songs of Donald Swann: Volume I''.  The third edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On'' was packaged with a [[Compact disc|CD]] that duplicated the song cycle (but not Tolkien's readings) from  the 1967 LP record.  The CD also included two new recordings.  The third edition was reprinted in hardcover in 2002 by Harper Collins  ({{ISBN|0-00-713655-2}}); this had the same text and CD as the 1993 edition.

On 10 June 1995, the song cycle was performed in Rotterdam under the auspices of the Dutch Tolkien Society, by the baritone Jan Krediet together with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070518051649/http://members.chello.nl/n.jaspers1/EnSuite/ chamber choir EnSuite] and Alexandra Swemer on the piano. A CD of this concert was published in a limited edition.

== List of songs ==

The complete list of songs in this song-cycle is as follows:

# "[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]".  From ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' vol. 1, ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book 1, Chapter 1 ("A Long-expected Party") and Chapter 3 ("Three is Company").

# "[[Errantry]]".  From ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

The following additional songs were added after the first edition, but do not form part of the song cycle itself:

# "[[Bilbo's Last Song]]". Given to Donald Swann after Tolkien's death. Only in the second and third editions of the book.  On the CD but not the LP.

'''Thomas Stewart Traill''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|PRCPE]] [[Member of the Wernerian Society|MWS]] [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts|RSSA]]}} (29 October 1781 – 30 July 1862) was a Scottish [[physician]], [[chemist]], [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], [[Zoology|zoologist]] and scholar of [[medical jurisprudence]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He practiced medicine for 30 years in [[Liverpool]], and was a founder of the [[Royal Institution of Liverpool]], the [[Liverpool Mechanics' Institution]] and the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool]]. He became acquainted with the Arctic explorer [[William Scoresby]], contributing a list of animals observed in eastern [[Greenland]] to Scoresby's ''Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale Fishery'' (1823). Scoresby named [[Traill Island]] in Greenland for him.

When [[John James Audubon]] arrived in Liverpool in July 1826 Traill helped him to find a publisher for his ''The Birds of America''. Audubon named the Traill's flycatcher after him, which at one time referred to a species which included both the [[willow flycatcher]] (''Empidonax traillii'') and the [[alder flycatcher]] (''Empidonax alnorum'').

==University of Edinburgh and the Encyclopædia Britannica==
Traill returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1832 as a professor of medical jurisprudence, and served in this role until death, also serving as President of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh]] 1852 to 1854.&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; He edited the 8th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1852–61), which concluded a year before his death.

He was President of the [[Royal Scottish Society of the Arts]] 1843-44.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rssa.org.uk/history/past-presidents.shtml|title=RSSA: History: Past Presidents|website=www.rssa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840 he was living at 10 Albyn Place in Edinburgh's [[Moray Estate]] close to [[Charlotte Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1840&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Edinburgh on 30 July 1862, and was interred at [[St Cuthbert's cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; The grave contains members of both the Omond family and Traill family and stands against an outer eastern wall of the southern section.

==Family==

His daughter Mary Eliza Traill married [[Robert Omond]]. Their children included [[Robert Traill Omond]].

'''Trailer trash''' is a derogatory [[North American English]] term for [[poverty|poor people]] living in a [[travel trailer|trailer]] or a [[mobile home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spears|first1=Richard A.|title=McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions:|date=1 Oct 2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0071461078|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/McGraw-Hills-Dictionary-American-Colloquial-Expressions/dp/0071461078|accessdate=24 February 2015|quote=the poorest of people who live in run-down house trailers in bad neighborhoods.

==History==
In the mid-20th century, poor whites who could not afford to buy suburban-style [[tract housing]] began to purchase mobile homes, which were not only cheaper, but which could be easily relocated if work in one location ran out.  These &amp;ndash; sometimes by choice and sometimes through local [[zoning laws]] &amp;ndash; gathered in trailer camps, and the people who lived in them became known as "trailer trash". Despite many of them having jobs, albeit sometimes itinerant ones, the character flaws that had been perceived in [[white trash|poor white trash]] in the past were transferred to trailer trash, and trailer camps or parks were seen as being inhabited by retired persons, migrant workers, and, generally, the poor.  By 1968, a survey found that only 13% of those who owned and lived in mobile homes had [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs.&lt;ref name=isen240&gt;[[Nancy Isenberg|Isenberg, Nancy]] (2016) ''White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America'' New York: Penguin. pp.240-47 {{isbn|978-0-14-312967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers got their start in the 1930s, and their use proliferated during the housing shortage of [[World War II]], when the Federal government used as many as 30,000 of them to house defense workers, soldiers and sailors throughout the country, but especially around areas with a large military or defense presence, such as [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. In her book ''Journey Through Chaos'', reporter [[Agnes E. Meyer|Agnes Meyer]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' travelled throughout the country, reporting on the condition of the "neglected rural areas", and described the people who lived in the trailers, tents and shacks in such areas as malnourished, unable to read or write, and generally ragged. The workers who came to Mobile and Pascagoula to work in the shipyards there were from the backwoods of the South, "subnormal swamp and mountain folk" whom the locals described as "vermin"; elsewhere, they were called "squatters". They were accused of having loose morals, high illegitimacy rates, and of allowing [[prostitution]] to thrive in their "Hillbilly Havens".  The trailers themselves &amp;ndash; sometimes purchased second- or third-hand &amp;ndash; were often unsightly, unsanitary and dilapidated, causing communities to zone them away from the more desirable areas, which meant away from schools, stores, another necessary facilities, often literally on the other side of the railroad tracks.&lt;ref name=isen240 /&gt;

==In art, entertainment, and media==
{{or section|date=May 2018}}
{{list dispute|date=May 2018}}
===Music===
[[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' song "Burn Down the Trailer Park" and [[Toby Keith]]'s song "Trailerhood" and contain humorous lyrics about living in a trailer park.

[[Colt Ford]]'s song "No Trash in My Trailer" (2009) tells of a [[redneck]]-type male who throws his girlfriend out of his mobile home, the message being "there ain't no trash in my trailer, since the day I threw you outta here."

The song "Trailer Trash" appears on [[Modest Mouse]]'s album ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (1997).

[[Eminem]] refers to himself as "Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God" in his song "Rap God" from the album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'' (2013).

[[Lana Del Rey]]'s persona is portrayed as a "cheap trailer trash and everyone knows it" in the song "Boarding School". Trailer park references also appear on numerous other songs, including "Hundred Dollar Bill", "Yayo" and "Trash Magic".

===Television===
Most of the residents of the Pimmett Hills Trailer Park on ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' fit this stereotype to some degree or another.

The [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[television]] series ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'', done in [[mockumentary]] style, documents the misadventures of the residents of the Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30877">In the field of [[Egyptology]], '''transliteration of Ancient Egyptian''' is the process of converting (or mapping) texts written in the [[Egyptian language]] to [[alphabet]]ic symbols representing uniliteral [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] or their [[hieratic]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] counterparts. This process facilitates the publication of texts where the inclusion of photographs or drawings of an actual Egyptian document is impractical.

It should be emphasised that [[transliteration]] is not the same as [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transcription seeks to reproduce the ''pronunciation'' of a text. For example, the name of the founder of the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] is transliterated as ''ššnq'' but transcribed ''[[Shoshenq I|Shoshenq]]'' in English, ''Chéchanq'' in French, ''Sjesjonk'' in Dutch, and ''Scheschonk'' (''Scheschonq'') in German.

Because exact details regarding the [[phonetics]] of Egyptian are not completely known, most transcriptions depend on [[Coptic language|Coptic]] for [[linguistic reconstruction]] or are theoretical in nature. Egyptologists, therefore, rely on transliteration in scientific publications.

==Standards==
{{IPA notice}}
Important as transliteration is to the field of Egyptology, there is no one standard scheme in use for hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. Some might even argue that there are as many systems of transliteration as there are Egyptologists. However, there are a few closely related systems that can be regarded as conventional. Many non-German-speaking Egyptologists use the system described in Gardiner 1954, whereas many German-speaking scholars tend to opt for that used in the ''[[Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache]]'' (Erman and Grapow 1926–1953), the standard dictionary of the ancient Egyptian language. However, there is a growing trend, even among English-speaking scholars, to adopt a modified version of the method used in the ''Wörterbuch'' (e.g., Allen 2000).

Although these conventional approaches to transliteration have been followed since most of the second half of the nineteenth century to the present day, there have been some attempts to adopt a modified system that seeks to utilise the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] to a certain degree. The most successful of these is that developed by Wolfgang Schenkel (1990), and it is being used fairly widely in Germany and other German-speaking countries. More recent is a proposal by Thomas Schneider (2003) that is even closer to the IPA, but its usage is not presently common. The major criticism leveled against both of these systems is that they give an impression of being much more scientifically accurate with regard to the pronunciation of Egyptian. Unfortunately this perceived accuracy is debatable. Moreover, the systems reflect only the theoretical pronunciation of [[Middle Egyptian]] and not the older and later phases of the language, which are themselves to be transliterated with the same system.

===Table of transliteration schemes===
There are 24 consonantal phonemes distinguished in Egyptian writing, 
following Edel (1955)&lt;ref name=Edel1955&gt;E. Edel, ''Altäqyptische Grammatik'', Analecta Orientalia 34, 39, Rome (1955, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; transliterated and ordered alphabetically in the sequence:
''ꜣ j ꜥ w b p f m n r h ḥ ḫ ẖ z s š q k g t ṯ d ḏ''.
A number of variant conventions are used interchangeably depending on the author:

The vowel {{IPAslink|ɛ}} is conventionally inserted between consonants to make Egyptian words pronounceable in English.

===Examples===

(This text is conventionally translated into English as "an offering that the king gives; and [[Osiris]], Foremost of Westerners [i.e., the Dead], the Great God, Lord of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]; and [[Wepwawet]], Lord of the Sacred Land [i.e., the [[Necropolis]]]." It can also be translated "a royal offering of Osiris, Foremost of the Westerners, the Great God, Lord of Abydos; and of Wepwawet, Lord of the Sacred Land" [Allen 2000:§24.10].)

===Demotic===
{{see|Demotic (Egyptian)}}
As the latest stage of pre-Coptic Egyptian, Demotic texts have long been transliterated using the same system(s) used for hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. However, in 1980, [[Demotist]]s adopted a single, uniform, international standard based on the traditional system used for hieroglyphic, but with the addition of some extra symbols for vowels and other letters that were written in the Demotic script. The ''Demotic Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago'' (or [http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/PUB/SRC/CDD/CDD.html CDD]) utilises this method. As this system is likely only of interest to specialists, for details see the references below.

==Encoding==
In 1984 a standard, [[ASCII]]-based transliteration system was proposed by an international group of Egyptologists at the first ''Table ronde informatique et égyptologie'' and published in 1988 (see Buurman, Grimal, ''et al.'', 1988). This has come to be known as the ''[[Manuel de Codage]]'' (or MdC) system, based on the title of the publication, ''Inventaire des signes hiéroglyphiques en vue de leur saisie informatique: Manuel de codage des textes hiéroglyphiques en vue de leur saisie sur ordinateur''. It is widely used in e-mail discussion lists and internet forums catering to professional Egyptologists and the interested public.

Although the ''Manuel de codage'' system allows for simple "alphabetic" transliterations, it also specifies a complex method for electronically encoding complete ancient Egyptian texts, indicating features such as the placement, orientation, and even size of individual hieroglyphs. This system is used (though frequently with modifications) by various software packages developed for typesetting hieroglyphic texts (such as SignWriter, WinGlyph, MacScribe, InScribe, Glyphotext, [[m:WikiHiero|WikiHiero]], and others).

===Unicode===
With the introduction of the [[Latin Extended Additional]] block to [[Unicode]] version 1.1 (1992) and the addition of Egyptological alef and ayin to Unicode version 5.1 (2008), it is possible to fully transliterate Egyptian texts using a [[Unicode typeface]]. The following table only lists the special characters used in various transliteration schemes (see below).

====Egyptological alef, ayin, and yod====
Three additional characters are required for transliterating Egyptian:
* ''Alef'' ([[File:U-A723 LATIN SMALL LETTER EGYPTOLOGICAL ALEF.gif|7px|Egyptological Alef]], two Semitistic [[aleph]]s, one set over the other ([[Standard Alphabet by Lepsius|Lepsius]]); approximated by the digit ⟨3⟩ in ASCII);&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Peust, ''Egyptian Phonology: Introduction to the Phonology of a Dead Language'' (Göttingen, 1999), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ayin'' ([[File:U-A725 LATIN SMALL LETTER EGYPTOLOGICAL AIN.gif|7px|Egyptological Aijn]], a Semitistic [[ayin]]);
* ''Yod'' ([[File:LATIN SMALL LETTER EGYPTOLOGICAL YOD.gif|7px|Egyptological Yod]], ''i'' with a Semitistic [[aleph]] instead of the dot, both yod and alef being considered possible sound values in the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Peust, ''Egyptian Phonology'', p. 50, 99ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although six Egyptological and Ugariticist letters were proposed in August 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]]. [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2241.pdf Proposal to add 6 Egyptological characters to the UCS], 2000-08-27&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 2008 ([[Unicode versions#Versions|Unicode 5.1]]) that four of the six letters were encoded:

Another two proposals were made regarding the Egyptological yod,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]] and Bob Richmond, [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3382.pdf EGYPTOLOGICAL YOD and Cyrillic breathing], 2008-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]], [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3487.pdf Proposal to encode Egyptological Yod and similar characters in the UCS], 2008-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; the eventual result of which was to accept the use of the Cyrillic psili pneumata ({{unichar|0486|use=script|cwith=◌}}) as one of several possible diacritics for this purpose. The other options use the superscript comma (U+0313) and the right half ring above (U+0357). An new attempt for a sign called LETTER I WITH SPIRITUS LENIS was made in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Suignard, [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17076r2-n4792r2-egyptological-yod.pdf Proposal to encode Egyptological Yod and similar characters in the UCS], 2017-05-09 (cf. the later 2008 proposal).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Egyptological community objection were raised concerning this name.&lt;ref&gt;List ''Egyptian - Egyptian Hieroglyphs in the UCS'' http://evertype.com/pipermail/egyptian_evertype.com/2017-June/thread.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]] still recommends its own Unicode-based transliteration system. It uses the Middle English [[yogh]] ⟨[[ȝ]]⟩ (Unicode U+021D) for alef (hamza), a reverse sicilicus ⟨ʿ⟩ (Unicode U+02BF) for ayin, and ⟨j⟩ or Vietnamese ⟨ỉ⟩ (Unicode U+1EC9, ''i'' with [[hook above]]) for Egyptological yod.&lt;ref name="IFAO_polices" /&gt;

==Uniliteral signs==
[[Middle Egyptian]] is reconstructed as having had 24 consonantal phonemes. There is at least one hieroglyph with a phonetic value corresponding to each of these phonemes.

The table below gives a list of such "uniliteral signs" along with their conventional transcription and their conventional "[[Egyptological pronunciation]]" and probably phonetic value. 

It is possible that two phonemes /s/ and /z/ in Old Egyptian were merged in the Middle Egyptian stage.
Similarly, there are a number of hieroglyphs that may have been [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral]] in [[Old Egyptian]] which were reduced to "uniliteral" phonetic value in Middle Egyptian.

Many hieroglyphs are coloured, though the paint has worn off most stone inscriptions. Colors vary, but many glyphs are predominantly one colour or another, or a particular combination (such as red on the top and blue on the bottom). In some cases, two graphically similar glyphs may be distinguished solely by colour, though in other cases it's not known if the choice of colour had any meaning. The glyphs below are given in their predominant colour, red, yellow, green and blue (with blue including black). Glyphs in black are either polychrome (in the case of &lt;ꜣ&gt;) or are attested in multiple colours (in the case of &lt;ẖ&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Peust (1999), ''Egyptian Phonology - Ch. 2.6.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}
'''Unenumerated rights''' are legal rights inferred from other legal rights that are officiated in a retrievable form codified by law institutions, such as in written constitutions, but are not themselves expressly coded or "enumerated" among the explicit writ of the law. Alternative terminology sometimes used are: '''implied rights''', '''natural rights''', '''background rights''', and '''fundamental rights'''.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm "Committee on the Judiciary Tushnet Statement re Hearing on 'the Origin and Scope of Roe v. Wade'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808233931/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm# |date=2007-08-08 }}. [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], [[United States House of Representatives]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]. April 22, 1996. {{deadlink|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unenumerated rights will be actual rights insofar as they necessitate the systematization of positively enumerated rights anywhere laws would become logically incoherent, or could not be adhered to or maintained in the exclusion of those unenumerated items as rights. Examples of this include federal systems where constituent member constitutions have to be interpreted in relation to their membership in the federal whole, adjudicative of whether authority is rightfully [[Devolution|devolved]] or more rightly federative.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

This term alternatively, is used loosely to mean any perceived rights, often considered peremptory or intuitively fiat (such as rights innate to each individual or inherent to mankind), that are without expression or instance of articulation.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

==In Australia==
{{main|Implied rights in Australian constitutional law}}
Implied rights are the political and civil freedoms that necessarily underlie the actual words of the constitution but are not themselves expressly stated directly in the constitution. Since the 1990s the High Court has discovered rights which are said to be implied by the very structure and textual form of the Constitution. Chief amongst these is an implied right to freedom of communication on political matters, which was first recognised in ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills]]''. In addition, some protections of civil liberties have been the result of the High Court's zealous attempts to safeguard the independence of, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary.  A good example of this can be seen in ''[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]'', in which the High Court struck down a criminal law passed by the New South Wales Parliament that was directed at a single named individual in a similar manner to a [[Bill of attainder]]. The High Court also inferred a limited right to vote from the text of the Constitution in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'',  invalidating legislation that prevented all prisoners from voting.

==In Ireland==

Article 40.3 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] refers to and accounts for the recognition of unenumerated rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theundisciplined.com/2014/05/13/something-from-nothing-the-irish-unenumerated-rights-doctrine/ TheUndisciplined.com – ''Something from Nothing: The Irish Unenumerated Rights Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] is often the main source of such rights, such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to marry and the right to earn a living, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/SupremeCourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/D5F78352A387D74480257315005A419E?opendocument&amp;l=en Supreme Court of Ireland – '''The Legal System''' (''Fundamental Rights'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Republic of China==
Article 22 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] guarantees unenumerated freedoms and rights of the people that are not detrimental to social order or public welfare, now in effect in [[Taiwan]].

==In the United States==
In the United States, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] protects against federal infringement of unenumerated rights. The text reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has also interpreted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] to protect against state infringement of certain unenumerated rights including, among others, the [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters|right to send one's children to private school]] and the [[Griswold v. Connecticut|right to marital privacy]].

The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to keep personal matters private and to make important decisions about one’s health care or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/ninth-amendment-non-enumerated-rights-retained-by-people|title=Ninth Amendment: Non-Enumerated Rights Retained by People - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
