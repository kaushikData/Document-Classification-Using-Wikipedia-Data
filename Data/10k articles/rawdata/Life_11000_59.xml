      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16035">'''Animal suicide''' refers to any kind of self-destructive behavior displayed by various species of animals, resulting in their death. Although contradicting the natural progression of life and an animal's evolutionary instinct for survival, some situations may lead to an animal inducing their own death. Animal suicide in the defense of the group could be instantaneous or altruistic self-removal once an animal becomes diseased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are anecdotal reports of grieving pets displaying such behaviour after the death of their owner, or [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous animals]] refusing to feed after the death of their mate.

Some [[Parasitism|parasites]] manipulate the behavior of their [[Host (biology)|host]], causing them to expose themselves to greater risks of predation to enable the parasite to proceed to the next life-cycle stage. Some [[carpenter ant]]s and [[termite]]s use [[autothysis]], producing a sticky secretion to trap colony marauders, and [[pea aphid]]s will sometimes explode, protecting other pea aphids from ladybugs.

== Suicidal behavior ==
It is generally considered that humans are the only known beings to use weapons when putting an end to their own life. Some species might be driven to engage in suicidal behavior for the sake of others, this is an example of [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]] in animals. These actions are performed when the reproductive fitness of others outweighs the reproductive fitness of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samir|first=Okasha,|date=2003-06-03|title=Biological Altruism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/altruism-biological/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of animals dying in defense of their family or colony, such as the case of pea aphids increasing their chances of death as a response to parasitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAllister|first=Murdoch K.|last2=Roitberg|first2=Bernard D.|year=1987|title=Adaptive Suicidal Behavior in Aphids|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v328/n6133/abs/328797b0.html|journal=Nature|volume=328|pages=797–799|doi=10.1038/328797b0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vervent monkeys will alert others when a predator is near, consequently drawing attention to itself and increasing their likelihood of being attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samir|first=Okasha,|date=2003-06-03|title=Biological Altruism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/altruism-biological/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals that appear to be depressed or grieving begin to exhibit self-destructive behavior that sometimes ends in death.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hanlon|first=Larry|title=Animal Suicide Sheds Light on Human Behavior|url=http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/animal-suicide-behavior.htm|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Discovery News|date=10 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326032017/http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/animal-suicide-behavior.htm |archivedate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' reported that a [[Newfoundland dog]] had been acting less lively over a period of days before being seen "to throw himself in the water and endeavor to sink by preserving perfect stillness of the legs and feet".&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon" /&gt; Every time he was rescued he attempted to do this again before he finally held his head underwater until death.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon" /&gt; Other dogs, as well as ducks, have also drowned themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maudsley|first=Henry|title=Alleged Suicide of a Dog|journal=Mind|date=July 1879|volume=4|issue=15|pages=410–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; One duck did so after the death of its mate.&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt; Some dogs will refuse food after the death of their owner until they die as well.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Hairy-Kiri: Do animals commit suicide|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/beached_whales_in_new_zealand_do_animals_commit_suicide_.html|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the death of mourning animals is likely to be caused by depression leading to starvation or drowning, instead of the intent of suicide. In 2009, 28 cows and bulls mysteriously threw themselves off a cliff in the [[Swiss Alps]] over the span of three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists baffled as 'suicidal' cows throw themselves off cliff in Switzerland|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1209638/Scientists-baffled-suicidal-cows-throw-cliff-Switzerland.html|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=28 August 2009|author =Mail Foreign Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=May 2018}} One deer leapt from a cliff to its death so as to avoid being captured by [[hunting dog]]s.&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt; Another famous example of animal suicide is the case of the dolphin which most often portrayed Flipper, on the 1960s television show ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''. According to trainer [[Ric O'Barry|Richard O' Barry]] in the film ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]],'' Kathy, the dolphin, suffocated herself before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1973486,00.html|title=Do Animals Commit Suicide?

Animal suicide was long used to define human suicide; in the 1800s animal suicide was seen as an act of abuse, madness, love, or loyalty, the same acts human suicide was seen as.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"/&gt; Although it is impossible to determine what drives animals to self-destruction, some specific traits associated with human suicide can be successfully transferred to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malkesman|first=Oz|title=Animal Models of Suicide Trait-Related Behaviors|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|date=April 2009|volume=30|issue=4|pages=165–173|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2009.01.004|pmid=19269045|pmc=2788815|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have been unable to explain whether animals are able to consciously end their own lives.&lt;ref name=Preti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preti|first=A|title=Animal model and neurobiology of suicide|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry|date=1 June 2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=818–30|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.10.027|pmid=21354241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-destruction ==
{{See also|Autothysis}}
Some species of social insects will commit suicide in an act of altruism through [[autothysis]]. These insects will sacrifice themselves if the colony is in danger, to alert the colony of danger, or if they become diseased they will sacrifice themselves to prevent the colony from becoming diseased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpenter ant]]s and some species of [[termite]] will rupture glands and expel a sticky toxic substance thought to be an aliphatic compound in a process called ''[[autothysis]]''. Termites will use autothysis to defend their colony, as the ruptured gland produces a sticky harmful secretion that leads to a [[tar baby]] effect in defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/v0kjl37610tk2426/ Maschwitz, U. and E.

Some social Hymenoptera including bees, wasps, and ants, may use their stinger to deliver poisonous chemicals to their attacker, effectively killing both the predator and the insect in the colony's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hermann|first=Henry R.|date=June 1971|title=Sting autotomy, a defensive mechanism in certain social Hymenoptera|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02223116?LI=true|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=111–120|doi=10.1007/bf02223116|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; This self-destructive and often altruistic defense is known as sting autonomy. The stinger is easily torn from the animal's body, allowing the hazardous stinger to be left stuck in the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide-inducing parasitism ==
Certain types of [[parasite]]s will cause their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] to commit suicidal behavior, through altering how the intermediate host acts. The change in the host's actions often benefit the parasite's search for a final host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Janice|date=April 1984|title=Altered Behavioral Responses in Intermediate Hosts -- An Acanthoceptalan Parasite Strategy|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284224?journalCode=an|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=572–577|doi=10.1086/284224|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main example is the phylum [[Acanthocephala]], which will direct its host to a predator so as to be eaten by the predator, their new definitive host. The parasitic worm ''[[Spinochordodes tellinii]]'' will develop in [[grasshopper]]s and [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] until it is grown, at which time it will cause its host to leap into water to its death so that the worm can reproduce in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7927 |title=Parasites brainwash grasshoppers into death dive |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=August 31, 2005 |author =Shaoni Bhattacharya}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''S. tellinii'' only causes its host to drown when the host is already close to water as opposed to seeking it out over large distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do hairworms (Nematomorpha) manipulate the water seeking behaviour of their terrestrial hosts? |author1=F.

Infection with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' has been shown to alter the behavior of mice and rats in ways thought to increase the rodents’ chances of being preyed upon by cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webster |first1=JP |last2=McConkey |first2=GA |date=June 2010 |title=Toxoplasma gondii-altered host behaviour: clues as to mechanism of action |journal=Folia parasitologica |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=95–104 |pmid=20608471 |doi=10.14411/fp.2010.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webster |first=J. P.|title=The Effect of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' on Animal Behavior: Playing Cat and Mouse |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |year=2007|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=752–756 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbl073 |pmid=17218613|pmc=2526137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infected rodents show a reduction in their innate aversion to cat odors; while uninfected mice and rats will generally avoid areas marked with cat urine or with cat body odor, this avoidance is reduced or eliminated in infected animals. Moreover, some evidence suggests this loss of aversion may be specific to feline odors: when given a choice between two predator odors (cat or mink), infected rodents show a significantly stronger preference to cat odors than do uninfected controls.

Suicide induction in intermediate hosts has been shown to help disperse the parasites to their final hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trail|first=Deborah R.

However, infected clams are concentrated in the higher parts of the tidal flats, closer to shore, and leave conspicuous zig-zag markings in the sand. Visual and tactile cues have shown to be used by oyster catchers and other shore birds, the definitive hosts of the parasite.

== Misconceptions ==
A popular misconception is that the [[lemming]] will commit [[mass suicide]] during migration. This misconception was first popularized by media in the 1960s, such as a mention in the [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] short story "[[The Marching Morons]]" in 1951 and the 1955 comic "The Lemming with the Locket", inspired by a 1953 ''[[American Mercury]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, Muriel. "Return of the Pied Piper". ''[[The American Mercury]]'', [http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1953dec-00033 Dec. 1953, pp. 33–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Geoffrey. 1996. "One Billion of Something", in: ''Uncle Scrooge Adventures by Carl Barks'', #9.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most influential factors in this misconception was the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Disney]] film ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'', which showed staged footage of lemmings jumping off a cliff during migration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lemmings.asp snopes.com: White Wilderness Lemmings Suicide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Antaeus was seen as a member of [[Maxie Zeus]]'s New Olympians.  His origin has never been revealed, but he has super-human strength and limited invulnerability as long as he stays in contact with the natural earth. He fought [[Geo-Force]] of  [[The Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]] who defeated him. He resurfaced with the rest of the New Olympians as victims of Gog.

'''Mark Antaeus''' was the son of a [[scientist]] who injected Mark with experimental growth [[hormones]] as he grew up. Because of these hormones Mark pushed the boundaries of [[human]] agility, strength and endurance although never becoming truly [[superhuman]].

Mark became a [[Firefighter|fireman]] and a local [[hero]], idolising [[Superman]] to the extent that he had a large 'S-shield' [[tattoo]] across his back (This shield was the one worn by Superman in [[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]] foreshadowing the dark turn Mark would take). After failing to rescue a family caught in a burning building Mark had something of a [[nervous breakdown]], disappearing for over two years. When he returned it was revealed he had volunteered to [[STAR Labs]] as a [[guinea pig]] for [[cybernetic]] enhancements. Despite being horribly disfigured under his cybernetic armour the hero 'Antaeus' was blissfully happy to be able to help people and this small town hero's exploits came to the [[Justice League]]'s attention. He was quickly admitted to the JLA and shown to partake in many adventures.

Antaeus' behaviour was somewhat erratic and he came into conflict with [[Green Lantern]], [[Kyle Rayner]] who feels that he is unreasonably driven and dotes on his idol, Superman. He also draws away from his human life, cutting off his family and fiancee.

When the JLA refuse to step in to remove a [[Middle East]]ern despot, Antaeus goes against their wishes, overthrowing a hostile government and murdering their leader (who bears a striking resemblance to [[Saddam Hussein]]). Antaeus then comes into direct conflict with the JLA, he puts up a good fight but his cybernetic systems are badly damaged and he retreats. Seeing that his actions have destabilized the country and ultimately made things worse for its citizens, Antaeus is consumed with grief and regret and lets his damaged [[nuclear reactor]] (the source of his power) explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[John Arcudi]]| penciller = [[Scot Eaton]]| inker = [[Ray Kryssing]]| colorist = [[John Kalisz]]| letterer = [[Ken Lopez]]| editor = [[Peter Tomasi]]| title = '''JLA: Superpower'''| volume = |date = '''1999'''| publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an epilogue we see Superman's grief over his inability to help Mark and Mark's Helmet is placed in the JLA trophy room.

Apart from his starring role in the one shot ''JLA: Superpower'', Antaeus' only other appearance was in the [[JLA/Avengers]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]] in which all previous members of the JLA and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] appear.

[[File:Chimp Brain in a jar.jpg|thumb|right|This old jar containing a chimpanzee brain is currently preserved in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum of London]]. It is still labeled ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'', [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] replaced in 1895 by ''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]''.]]
The terms '''''Anthropopithecus''''' ([[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Blainville]], 1839) and '''''Pithecanthropus''''' ([[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1868) are obsolete taxa describing either [[chimpanzee]]s or [[archaic humans]]. Both are derived from Greek  ἄνθρωπος (anthropos, "man") and πίθηκος (píthēkos, "ape" or "monkey"), translating to "man-ape" and "ape-man", respectively.

''Anthropopithecus'' was originally coined to describe the [[chimpanzee]] and is now a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''. It had been also used to describe several other extant and extinct species, among others the fossil [[Java Man]]. Very quickly, the latter was re-assigned to ''Pithecanthropus'', originally coined to refer to a theoretical "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]". ''Pithecanthropus'' is now classed as ''[[Homo erectus]]'', thus a junior synonym of ''[[Homo]]''.

== History ==
The [[genus]] ''Anthropopithecus'' was first proposed in 1839 by the French [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] (1777–1850) in order to give a genus name to some [[chimpanzee]] material that he was studying at the time.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"&gt;Bernard Wood ''et alii'', ''Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution'', June 2013 (single-volume paperback version of the original 2011 2-volume edition), 1056 pp.; {{ISBN|978-1-1186-5099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' was established by De Blainville in 1839, the British [[surgeon]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[John Bland-Sutton]] (1855–1936) proposed the [[species]] name ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'' in 1883 to designate the [[common chimpanzee]]. However, the genus ''Pan'' had already been attributed to chimpanzees in 1816 by the German naturalist [[Lorenz Oken]] (1779–1851). Since any earlier [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] prevails over subsequent nomenclatures, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' definitely lost its validity in 1895,&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;P. K. Tubbs, "Opinion 1368 The generic names ''Pan'' and ''Panthera'' (Mammalia, Carnivora): available as from Oken, 1816", ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'' (1985), volume 42, pp 365-370&lt;/ref&gt; becoming from that date a [[junior synonym]] of the genus ''Pan''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to the current international consensus, the genus ''Pan'' includes two [[species]]: the common chimpanzee (''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]'') and the bonobo or dwarf chimpanzee (''[[Bonobo|Pan paniscus]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879,&lt;ref&gt;''Pôle international de la Préhistoire'' "[http://www.pole-prehistoire.com/index.php/fr/decouvrir/les-ressources-en-ligne/espace-documentation/86-bibliotheque-numerique/148-le-prehistorique-antiquite-de-l-homme-gabriel-de-mortillet ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l'homme'' / Gabriel de Mortillet]" {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]] (1821–1898) proposed the term ''Anthropopithecus'' to designate a "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]", a hypothetical intermediate between ape and man that lived in the [[Tertiary]] and that supposedly, following De Mortillet's theory, produced [[eolith]]s.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"&gt;[[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]], ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''homme'', Bibliothèque des sciences contemporaines, 2nd edition, Paris, C. Reinwald, 1885, 642 p. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work of 1883 ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;homme'' (''The Prehistoric: Man's Antiquity'', below quoted after the 2nd edition, 1885&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;), De Mortillet writes:

{{quote|''Nous sommes donc forcément conduits à admettre, par une déduction logique tirée de l’observation directe des faits, que les animaux intelligents qui savaient faire du feu et tailler des pierres à l’époque tertiaire, n’étaient pas des hommes dans l’acception géologique et paléontologique du mot, mais des animaux d’un autre genre, des précurseurs de l’homme dans l’échelle des êtres, précurseurs auxquels j’ai donné le nom d’Anthropopithecus. Ainsi, par le seul raisonnement, solidement appuyé sur des observations précises, nous sommes arrivés à découvrir d’une manière certaine un être intermédiaire entre les anthropoïdes actuels et l’homme''.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;}}

{{quote|We are therefore forced to admit, as a consequence of a logical deduction drawn from the direct observation of the facts, that intelligent animals who knew how to make fire and cut stones in the Tertiary Period, were not men in the geological and paleontological sense of the word, but animals of another kind, precursors of Man in the [[Great chain of being|chain of beings]], precursors to whom I gave the name ''Anthropopithecus''. Thus, by reasoning alone, firmly supported by precise observations, we have come to discover with certainty a being intermediate between the present [[Simian|anthropoids]] and Man.}}

When in 1905 the French [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and [[geologist]] [[Marcellin Boule]] (1861–1942) published a paper demonstrating that the eoliths were in fact [[geofact]]s produced by natural phenomena ([[freezing]], [[Metamorphic rock|pressure]], [[Wildfire|fire]]), the argument proposed by De Mortillet fell into disrepute and his definition of the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellin Boule]], "''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''origine des éolithes''", ''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Anthropologie'' (1905), tome 16, pp. 257–267 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the chimpanzee meaning of the genus persisted throughout the [[19th century]], even to the point of being a genus name attributed to [[fossil]] [[Biological specimen|specimens]]. For example, a fossil primate discovered in 1878 by the British [[Malacology|malacologist]] [[William Theobald]] (1829-1908) in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]] in [[British Raj|British India]] was first named ''Palaeopithecus'' in 1879 but later renamed ''Anthropopithecus sivalensis'', assuming that these remains had to be brought back to the chimpanzee genus as the latter was being understood at the time. A famous example of a fossil ''Anthropopithecus'' is that of the [[Java Man]], discovered in 1891 in [[Trinil]], nearby the [[Solo River]], in [[East Java]], by Dutch physician and anatomist [[Eugène Dubois]], who named the discovery with the scientific name ''Anthropopithecus erectus''. This Dubois paper, written during the last quarter of 1892, was published by the Dutch government in 1893. In those early 1890s, the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was still being used by zoologists as the genus name of chimpanzees, so Dubois' ''Anthropopithecus erectus'' came to mean something like "the upright chimpanzee", or "the chimpanzee standing up". However, a year later, in 1893, Dubois considered that some anatomical characters proper to humans made necessary the attribution of these remains to a genus different than ''Anthropopithecus'' and he renamed the specimen of Java with the name ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (1893 paper, published in 1894). ''Pithecanthropus'' is a genus that German [[biologist]] [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) had created in 1868.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; Years later, in the [[20th century]], the German [[physician]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Franz Weidenreich]] (1873-1948) compared in detail the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', with the characters of the [[Peking Man]], then named ''Sinanthropus pekinensis''. Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; By that time, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' had already been abandoned since 1895 at the earliest.

== In popular culture ==
The term ''Anthropopithecus'' is scientifically obsolete in the present day but did become widespread in popular culture, mainly in [[France]] and [[Belgium]]:
* In his [[short story]] ''[[Gil Braltar]]'' (1887), [[Jules Verne]] uses the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') to describe the simian aspect of one his characters, General McKackmale:
{{quote|''Il dormait bien, le général Mac Kackmale, sur ses deux oreilles, plus longues que ne le comporte l’ordonnance. Avec ses bras démesurés, ses yeux ronds, enfoncés sous de rudes sourcils, sa face encadrée d’une barbe rêche, sa physionomie grimaçante, ses gestes d’'''anthropopithèque''', le prognathisme extraordinaire de sa mâchoire, il était d’une laideur remarquable, – même chez un général anglais. Un vrai singe, excellent militaire, d’ailleurs, malgré sa tournure simiesque.''}}
{{quote|He slept well, did General MacKackmale, with both eyes shut, though longer than was permitted by regulations. With his long arms, his round eyes deeply set under their beetling brows, his face embellished with a stubbly beard, his grimaces, his semi-human gestures,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The sentence ''ses gestes d’anthropopithèque'' was translated in 1959 by Idrisyn Oliver Evans as "his semi-human gestures".&lt;/ref&gt; the extraordinary jutting-out of his jaw, he was remarkably ugly, even for an English general. Something of a monkey but an excellent soldier nevertheless, in spite of his apelike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the French by Idrisyn Oliver Evans –''The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction'' (1959), 8th series, edited by Anthony Boucher, Ace Books, New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the science-fiction novel ''La Cité des Ténèbres'' (''The City of Darkness''), written by French journalist and writer [[Léon Groc]] in 1926, the ''anthropopithèques'' (''Anthropopithecuses'') are a large herd of ape-men having reached a very low degree of civilisation.
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Comics artist|comics author]] [[Hergé]] made the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') one of the numerous [[Profanity|swear words]] of [[Captain Haddock]] in the [[comic album]] series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Algoud, ''Le Haddock illustré, l'intégrale des jurons du capitaine'', Casterman (collection "Bibliothèque de Moulinsart"), Brussels, November 1991, 93 p., 23,2cm x 15cm ; {{ISBN|978-2203017108}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In 2001, French singer [[Brigitte Fontaine]] wrote, sang and recorded the song titled ''Pipeau''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The French word ''pipeau'' refers to a type of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipe]], but in French slang ''pipeau'' also refers to a lie.&lt;/ref&gt; In this song, the chorus repeats the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'').

Pepper began making movies. Among her later film parts were small roles in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). She also performed radio parts. In 1943, she married actor [[Craig Reynolds (actor)|Craig Reynolds]] (né Harold Hugh Enfield), and the couple later had two sons. After Reynolds died in 1949 in a California motorcycle accident, Pepper was left to raise their children alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Erskine|title=A Colorful and Tragic Real Life|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10572073/the_kingston_daily_freeman|work=The Kingston Daily Freeman|date=April 29, 1967|location=New York, Kingston|page=25|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=April 26, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She never remarried. 

After gaining weight, her roles were mostly confined to small character parts on television, including several appearances on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', and ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. She made four appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', including the role of Martha Dale, mother of the title character, in the 1957 episode "The Case of the Vagabond Vixen".{{cn|date=April 2018}}

A long-time friend of [[Lucille Ball]], Barbara was considered for the role of Ethel Mertz on ''I Love Lucy'', but was passed over due to the fact that she was reportedly a drinker. [[William Frawley]] ("Fred Mertz") was, likewise, reportedly, a drinker and was already cast. It was felt that having two drinkers in the cast might eventually cause difficulties so they auditioned and found [[Vivian Vance]] to play Ethel instead.

She may be best remembered as the first Doris Ziffel on ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' in 1964, although her character's name on the "Genghis Keane" episode of ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' was Ruth Ziffel. Her role as Doris Ziffel continued on ''[[Green Acres]]'' from 1965 to 1968, until heart ailments finally forced her to leave that weekly series.  Veteran actress [[Fran Ryan]] replaced her on ''Green Acres'', which would continue to run for another three years. Her final performance was in ''[[Hook, Line &amp; Sinker (1969 film)|Hook, Line &amp; Sinker]]'' (1969), in which she played [[Jerry Lewis]]'s secretary.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Death==
Barbara Pepper died of a [[coronary thrombosis]] at age 54 on July 18, 1969, in [[Panorama City, California]]. She was buried at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1835">'''Biohappiness''' is the elevation of utility in humans through biological methods, including germline engineering through screening embryos with genes associated with a high level of happiness, or the use of drugs intended to raise baseline levels of happiness. The object is to facilitate the achievement of a state of "better than well."

Proponents of biohappiness include the philosophical abolitionist [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], whose goal is to end the suffering of all sentient beings; and the Canadian ethicist [[Mark Alan Walker]]. Walker has sought to defend biohappiness on the grounds that happiness ought to be of interest to a wide range of moral theorists; and that hyperthymia, a state of high baseline happiness, is associated with better outcomes in health and human achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Alan Walker, "In Praise of Biohappiness," IEET Monographs No. 2, December 2006, at ieet.org/archive/IEET-02-BioHappiness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bailey, "Freezing or Uploading: Which Road to Immortality Would You Choose?" at http://reason.com/news/printer/121585.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of biohappiness also has its high-profile critics, including [[Leon Kass]], who served on the President's Council on Bioethics during the presidency of George W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Kass, "The Pursuit of Biohappiness," Washington Post, October 16, 2003, at http://www.aei.org/article/19300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Parrott directing.jpg|thumb|Chase directing (1916)]]
'''Charley Chase''' (born '''Charles Joseph Parrott''', October 20, 1893 – June 20, 1940) was an American comedian, actor, screenwriter and film director best known for his work in [[Hal Roach]] [[short film]] [[Comedy film|comedies]]. He was the older brother of comedian/director [[James Parrott]].

==Life and career==
Born Charles Joseph Parrott in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Charley Chase began performing in [[vaudeville]] as a teenager and started his career in [[film]]s by working at the [[Christie Film Company]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Brian and Edmonds, Andy (1998).  ''Smile When the Raindrops Fall: The Story of Charley Chase''. The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 23. {{ISBN|0-8108-3377-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[Keystone Studios]], where he began appearing in [[bit part]]s in the [[Mack Sennett]] films, including those of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. By 1915 he was playing [[Child|juvenile]] [[Leading actor|leads]] in the Keystones, and directing some of the films as Charles Parrott. His Keystone credentials were good enough to get him steady work as a comedy director with other companies; he directed many of Chaplin imitator [[Billy West (silent film actor)|Billy West]]'s comedies, which featured a young [[Oliver Hardy]] as [[villain]].

He worked at [[L-KO Kompany]] during its final months of existence. Then in 1920, Chase began working as a film director for [[Hal Roach Studios]]. Among his notable early works for Roach was supervising the first entries in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series, as well as directing several films starring [[Lloyd Hamilton]]; like many other silent comedians, Chase is reported to have regarded Hamilton's work as a major influence on that of his own. Chase became director-general of the Hal Roach studio in late 1921, supervising the production of all the Roach series except the [[Harold Lloyd]] comedies. Following Lloyd's departure from the studio in 1923, Chase moved back in front of the camera with his own series of shorts, adopting the screen name Charley Chase.

Chase was a master of the comedy of embarrassment, and he played either hapless young [[business]]men or befuddled [[husband]]s in dozens of [[situation comedies]]. His screen persona was that of a pleasant young man with a dapper [[Moustache|mustache]] and ordinary street clothes; this set him apart from the [[clown]]ish [[Cosmetics|makeups]] and crazy costumes used by his contemporaries. His earliest Roach shorts cast him as a hard-luck fellow named "Jimmie Jump" in [[Short film|one-reel]] (10-minute) comedies.

The first Chase series was successful and expanded to two reels (20 minutes); this would become the standard length for Chase comedies, apart from a few  [[Featurette|three-reel featurettes]] later. Direction of the Chase series was taken over by [[Leo McCarey]], who in collaboration with Chase formed the comic style of the series—an emphasis on [[characterization]] and [[farce]] instead of knockabout [[slapstick]]. Some of Chase's starring shorts of the 1920s, particularly ''[[Mighty Like a Moose]]'', ''[[Crazy Like a Fox (1926 film)|Crazy Like a Fox]]'', ''[[Fluttering Hearts]]'', and ''Limousine Love'', are often considered to be among the finest in [[silent comedy]]. Chase remained the guiding hand behind the films, assisting anonymously with the directing, writing, and editing.

Chase moved with ease into [[sound film]]s in 1929 and became one of the most popular film comedians of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Lahue, Kalton C. and Gill, Samuel (1970). ''Clown Princes and Court Jesters''. A.S. Barnes and Company, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to be very prolific in the talkie era, often putting his fine [[singing]] [[Human voice|voice]] on display and including his [[Novelty song|humorous, self-penned songs]] in his comedy shorts. The two-reeler ''The Pip from Pittsburg'', released in 1931 and co-starring [[Thelma Todd]], is one of the most celebrated Charley Chase comedies of the sound era.&lt;ref&gt;Solan, Yair. "Many Big Squawks." ''The World of Charley Chase.'' {{cite web |url=http://charleychase.50webs.com/talkies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126101611/http://charleychase.50webs.com/talkies.htm |archivedate=2010-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the decade, the ''Charley Chase'' shorts continued to stand alongside [[Laurel and Hardy]] and Our Gang as the core output of the Roach studio. Chase was featured in the Laurel and Hardy feature ''[[Sons of the Desert]]''; Laurel and Hardy made cameo appearances as hitchhikers in Chase's ''[[On the Wrong Trek]]''.

''[[On the Wrong Trek]]'' was supposed to be the final Charley Chase short subject: by 1936 producer Hal Roach was now concentrating on making ambitious [[feature film]]s. Chase played a [[Character actor|character role]] in the [[Patsy Kelly]] feature [[Kelly the Second]], and starred in a feature-length comedy called ''Bank Night'', lampooning the popular [[Bank Night]] phenomenon of the 1930s. Chase's feature was plagued with a host of production problems and legalities, and the film was drastically edited down to two reels and finally released as one last Charley Chase short, ''[[Neighborhood House (film)|Neighborhood House]]''. Chase was then dismissed from the Roach studio.

==Later years and death==
In 1937, Chase began working at [[Columbia Pictures]], where he spent the rest of his career starring in his own series of two-reel comedies, as well as producing and directing other Columbia comedies, including those of [[The Three Stooges]] and [[Andy Clyde]]. He directed the Stooges' classic ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938); although he is often credited with writing the film's song "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]",&lt;ref&gt;Okuda, Ted and Watz, Edward (1986). ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts: Two-Reel Hollywood Film Comedies, 1933–1958''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 27. {{ISBN|0-7864-0577-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the tune actually originates with [[19th century|19th-century]] [[songwriter]] [[Septimus Winner]]. Recent research asserts that the Chase family's maid introduced the song to Chase and taught it to his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, Richard. "Swingin' the Alphabet Composer Finally Identified." ''The Three Stooges Journal'' (Winter 2005): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Chase's own shorts at Columbia favored broader sight gags and more slapstick than his earlier, subtler work, although he does sing in two of the Columbias, ''The Grand Hooter'' and ''The Big Squirt'' (both 1937). Many of Chase's Columbia short subjects were strong enough to be remade in the 1940s with other comedians; Chase's ''The Heckler'' (1940) was remade with [[Shemp Howard]] as ''Mr. Noisy'' (1946) while ''The Nightshirt Bandit'' (1938) was remade with [[Andy Clyde]] as ''Go Chase Yourself'' (1948) and again in 1956 as ''Pardon My Nightshirt''.

Chase reportedly suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]] for most of his professional career, and his tumultuous lifestyle began to take a serious toll on his health. His hair had turned [[Human hair color|prematurely gray]], and he [[Hair coloring|dyed]] it jet-black for his Columbia comedies. Years later Hal Roach said "I never saw him drunk at the studio, and I never saw him sober outside of it."

His younger brother, comedy writer-director [[James Parrott]], had personal problems resulting from a drug treatment, and died in 1939. Chase was devastated. He had refused to give his brother money to support his [[Substance abuse|drug habit]], and friends knew he felt responsible for Parrott's death. He coped with the loss by throwing himself into his work and by drinking more heavily than ever, despite doctors' warnings. The stress ultimately caught up with him; just over a year after his brother's death, Charley Chase died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], on June 20, 1940. He is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] near his wife Bebe Eltinge  in [[Glendale, California]].

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Charley Chase received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6630 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on February 8, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/charley-chase|title=Charley Chase {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/charley-chase/|title=Charley Chase|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed interest==
Since the 1990s, there has been a revival of interest in the films of Charley Chase, due in large part to the increased availability of his comedies. An extensive website researching his life and work, ''The World of Charley Chase'', was created in 1996, and a biography, ''Smile When the Raindrops Fall'', was published in 1998.

Chase's sound comedies for Hal Roach were briefly televised in the late 1990s on the short-lived American cable network the [[Odyssey Channel]]. Retrospectives of Chase's work organized by ''The Silent Clowns Film Series'' were held in 1999, 2001, 2006, and 2008 in New York City.

A marathon of selected Charley Chase shorts from the silent era was broadcast in 2005 on the American cable television network [[Turner Classic Movies]]. In late 2006, Turner Classic Movies began to air Charley Chase's sound-era comedies. In January 2011, several of his sound shorts were featured during Turner Classic Movies' tribute to Hal Roach Studios.

In 2007, ''[[Mighty Like a Moose]]'' (1926) was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress's [[National Film Registry]], solidifying its reputation as one of the most celebrated comedies of the silent era and cementing Chase's status as a pioneer of early film comedy.&lt;ref&gt;"National Film Registry 2007." https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kino International (company)|Kino International]] released two Charley Chase [[DVD]] [[Volume (bibliography)|volumes]] in 2004 and 2005 for their Slapstick Symposium series. The films came from archives and collectors around the world.  In July 2009, VCI Entertainment released ''Becoming Charley Chase'', a DVD boxed set of Charley Chase's early silent films.

[[Columbia Pictures]] has prepared [[Film preservation|digital restorations]] of its twenty Charley Chase shorts, in the same manner as its [[Buster Keaton]] DVD restorations. On January 1, 2013, Sony Home Entertainment released ''Charley Chase Shorts Volume 1'', part of its "Columbia Choice Collection" MOD DVD-R library. The one-disc release contains eight of Chase's starring shorts and one [[Smith &amp; Dale]] short that he directed, ''A Nag in the Bag'' (1938).  On November 5, 2013, Sony Home Entertainment released ''Charley Chase Shorts Volume 2'', another in their MOD DVD-R series, which contained the remaining twelve Chase shorts.

The '''SS ''Cheduba''''' was the third ship built at [[A and J Inglis]], Pointhouse, Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Strathdee and Stuart Cameron:[http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=1653 Cheduba (1863) of A and J Inglis]&lt;/ref&gt; She was probably built in collaboration with Archibald Denny Dumbarton and launched on Saturday, 18 April 1863.&lt;ref&gt;George Robinson and Stuart Cameron: [http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=12086 Launched 1863: SS Cheduba of Archibald Denny Dumbarton.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cheduba'' was owned by British India Steam Navigation Company Glasgow. She sank with the loss of all hands in the [[Bay of Bengal]] on 15 May 1869 while on passage from [[Calcutta]] to [[Rangoon]].

==Work==

===Aaker Model===

Aaker is the creator of the Aaker Model, a marketing model that views [[brand equity]] as a combination of [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and [[brand]] associations.&lt;ref name=schawbelinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/personal-branding-interview-david-aaker/ |title=Personal Branding Interview: David Aaker |author=Schawbel, Dan |publisher=PersonalBrandingBlog.com |date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model outlines the necessity of developing a [[brand identity]], which is a unique set of brand associations representing what the brand stands for and offers to customers an aspiring [[brand image]].&lt;ref name=bsb&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaker |first=David |title=Building Strong Brands |year=1996 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=002900151X |page=400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaker primarily sees brand identity as consisting of 8–12 elements which fall under four perspectives:
* Brand as Product – consists of [[product (business)|product]] scope, product attributes, quality or value of the product, uses, users and country of origin.
* Brand as Organisation – consists of organizational attributes and local workings versus global activities.
* Brand as Person – consists of brand personality and customer-brand relationships.
* Brand as Symbol – consists of audio and visual imagery, metaphorical [[symbols]] and brand heritage.&lt;ref name=bsb /&gt;

Aaker first introduced the model in his book ''Building Strong Brands'' (1996).

==Publications==
Aaker is the author of more than 100 articles and 14 books on [[marketing]] and [[brand management|branding]].&lt;ref name=advertisingshow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theadvertisingshow.com/en/art/1735/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710071515/http://www.theadvertisingshow.com/en/art/1735/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Author David Aaker Explains How Companies Should Beat Competitors by Making Them Irrelevant |author1=Forsythe, Brad |author2=Schilens, Ray |publisher=The Advertising Show |date=June 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simonschusterprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364/books |title=Simon &amp; Schuster Profile |publisher=SimonandSchuster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Pablo Boder''' (9 November 1886 – 18 December 1961) was a Latvian-American professor of psychology at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] who traveled in 1946 to Europe to record interviews with [[Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dein, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ldhbl I Did Not Interview the Dead], BBC Radio 4, 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During that trip, he collected over a hundred interviews totaling 120 hours on a wire recorder developed by fellow professor Dr [[Marvin Camras]]. He was the first to record the experiences of the survivors and is a highly noted primary source reference.&lt;ref&gt;David Pablo Boder Papers, 1938-1957 University of California, Los Angeles. Library. Department of Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David P. Boder, ''Topical Autobiographies of Displaced People Recorded Verbatim in Displaced Persons Camps, with a Psychological and Anthropological Analysis''. Chicago: [s.n.], 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David P. Boder, I Did Not Interview the Dead, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and career ==
Boder was born Aron Mendel Michelson to Berl and Betti (Frank) Michelson, a Jewish family living in [[Liepāja]], [[Latvia]]. The large Jewish community residing in Liepāja at that time likely allowed Boder to grow up speaking Yiddish and German, reserving Russian for speaking at school.&lt;ref name="boder"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.iit.edu/david_boder|title=David Boder : Voices of the Holocaust Project|website=voices.iit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around age 19, Boder began studying psychology, first in [[Leipzig]] and then [[St. Petersburg]]. While living in St. Petersburg, Boder married Pauline Ivianski in 1907, who gave birth to their daughter Elena later that year. They divorced in 1909.&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt;

In 1919, Boder, his second wife Nadejda, and his daughter moved to [[Mexico]], fleeing the [[Russian Civil War]]. Nadejda died in the [[1918 flu pandemic]] soon after their arrival. In Mexico, Boder learned to speak Spanish, taught psychology at the National University, and married his third wife Dora in 1925 with whom he moved to the United States soon after.&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt; Upon moving to the U.S., Boder obtained degrees from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, while also working at the Lewis Institute (which became [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]).&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt;

== European Displaced Persons Project ==
Upon the end of [[World War II]], Boder conceived of a project for interviewing displaced persons of the war, to preserve their stories and investigate the psychological effects of war. In July 1946, Boder arrived in Paris and spent the next nine weeks conducting 130 interviews in 16 locations across France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt;
By this time, Boder spoke over seven languages, allowing him to conduct interviews in the subjects' native tongue.&lt;ref name="ThisAmLife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/197/before-it-had-a-name|title=Before It Had A Name|work=This American Life|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the subjects were Eastern European Jews, primarily from Poland, but Boder also spoke with Western European Jews, non-observant German Jews, Greek Jews and non-Jewish persons.&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt;

In October 1946, Boder returned to the U.S. and began transcribing the interviews and working on a book manuscript, supported by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. In 1949, a collection of eight transcribed interviews and Boder's analysis was published under the title ''I Did Not Interview the Dead'', though this book sold poorly and went out of print.&lt;ref name="ThisAmLife"/&gt; Boder would continue to work on transcribing the interviews until 1956, when his funding from the National Institute of Mental Health ran out.&lt;ref name="boder"/&gt;

== Later life ==
In 1951, Boder interviewed persons displaced by a large flood in [[Kansas City]]. In 1952, Boder retired from the Illinois Institute of Technology and relocated with his wife to [[UCLA]] as an unpaid research associate.&lt;ref name="ThisAmLife"/&gt; Boder died of a heart attack on December 18, 1961 at age 75.&lt;ref name="boder" /&gt;

Watt was born in 1885 in [[Dunbar]], [[East Lothian]], Scotland. He had four golfing brothers: Jim, John, Robert and [[Willie Watt (golfer)|Willie]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northberwick.org.uk/watt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golf career==
While at [[Dirleton]], Watt was runner-up to [[Willie Binnie]] in the 1909 [[Dunlop Cup]], taking the second prize of £5.&lt;ref name=gh9sep1909&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rNpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1296%2C984168 |title=Scottish Professionals at Burnisland |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=9 September 1909 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Watt became the professional at [[Mortonhall]] Golf Club, just south of [[Edinburgh]].

Watt was runner-up in the 1912 [[Scottish PGA Championship|Scottish Professional Championship]]. at Dunbar, 5 strokes behind his brother [[Willie Watt (golfer)|Willie]]. He took the second prize of £15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0A8-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=20kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2848%2C5937034 |title=Scottish Professional Championship |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=15 June 1912 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went one better in the 1914 Championship at Glen Golf Club, beating Willie by 2 strokes and winning the first prize of £20. Willie led by 5 shots after the third round but took 78 in the final round to Davie's excellent 71. Willie came to the last hole needing 4 to tie but got into two bunkers and took 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VN5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oKYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5055%2C3813012 |title=Scottish Professional Championship |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=30 May 1914 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watt played in the [[1914 Open Championship]] at [[Prestwick Golf Club]] and finished tied for 25th place, again two shots better than Willie.

==Death==
Watt died on 25 April 1917 in a Kent Hospital. He was in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] and died following a leg amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Watt |work=Aberdeen Evening Express |date=27 April 1917 |accessdate=16 June 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000445/19170427/040/0003 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mortonhallgc.co.uk/roll-of-honour/&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Newington Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2001884/WATT,%20DAVID&lt;/ref&gt; His name is on the [[Dirleton]] War Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://warmemscot.s4.bizhat.com/warmemscot-ftopic1245.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johngraycentre.org/east-lothian-subjects/war-battles-military/war-memorials/dirleton-war-memorials/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Days of '36''''' ({{lang-el|Μέρες του '36|italic=yes|translit=Méres tou '36}}) is a 1972 [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] dramatic [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Theo Angelopoulos]]. Its title is a tribute to [[Constantine P. Cavafy]].

Filmed during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Regime of the Colonels]], the film draws parallels between the regime and the dictatorship of [[Ioannis Metaxas]], but it does so implicitly, in order to escape censorship. Angelopoulos elsewhere speaks of an "aesthetic of the unspoken." He points out that the most important things always happen out of the field of view, behind closed doors or on the phone. When something is said, it is only whispered.

==Synopsis==
In May 1936, in a [[Greece]] riven by political strife, a trade union leader is assassinated. Sofianos, a petty criminal and smuggler as well as a police informant and leftist agitator, is accused of the murder. Kept incommunicado in a room separate from the other detainees, his only two visitors are a member of parliament from the Conservative Party and his driver, who is also his brother. One day, Sofianos takes the member of parliament as a hostage inside his cell to obtain his release before midnight; it is not clear how he has obtained the revolver which he was using. The prison guards are powerless, while the warden is under pressure from his political bosses to find a quick resolution to the standoff.

Sofianos's lawyer tries to reason with him, explaining to his client that the weapon in his possession is a trap that has been se tup for him, and that by taking the deputy as a hostage he is playing the game of those who accuse him. The lawyer conducts an investigation to exonerate Sofianos but ends up being beaten up in a deserted street.

In the meantime, an escape attempt takes place in the prison, but three escapees are caught up in the countryside.

Under pressure from representatives of the major powers, the political and prison authorities are trying to put an end to the hostage-taking by various means, including the poisoning of the prisoner. Eventually, at nightfall, a sniper shoots Sofianos in his cell.

The next morning, the three escapees are shot and the body of Sofianos is added to the funeral truck.

'''Delmer W. "Del" Carroll''' (October 30, 1919 - May 9, 1982) was an American champion [[polo]] player, [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorse]] owner/[[Horse trainer|trainer]], and soldier during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;His first name is also spelled as "Delmar" by various entities such as [[Churchill Downs]] [http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2005/derby_history/derby_charts/trainers/105.html], the [[Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame]] [http://www.polomuseum.com/news/2003_news/2003_inductees.htm] and the [[Social Security Death Index]]. The [[New York Racing Association|NYRA]] and the [[NTRA]] both spell his son's name as [[Del W. Carroll II|Delmer W. Carroll II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Del Carroll had begun riding horses as a boy of ten which as a young man led to choosing to serve in the [[Cavalry (United States)|cavalry]] in the [[United States Army]] during World War II. He rose to the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]. According to a 1945 [[Widener University|Pennsylvania Military College]] article, he "was a member of the mechanized cavalry group that did the dangerous advance scouting during the German campaign."

Carroll's knowledge of horses led to his participation in the game of [[polo]]. One of the top twenty-five players in the world during the 1950s and 1960s, he became an eight-goal handicap player. He remained active in the game throughout his life and at the time of his death at age sixty-two still had  a four-goal handicap.
[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/23/sports/scouting-polo-tribute.html] His interest in horses also led to a career as a professional  horse trainer, conditioning Thoroughbreds for friends and fellow polo players, [[William S. Farish III]] and [[Michael Grace Phipps]].

===1972 Preakness Stakes===
Del Carroll had four horses run in the [[Kentucky Derby]] with his best result a fifth in 1966 with [[Blue Grass Stakes]] winner, [[Abe's Hope]]. He had had a sixth-place finish in the 1969 [[Preakness Stakes]] but on  May 29, 1972 he earned the most important win of his career. In that year's Preakness Stakes, run on a sloppy [[Pimlico Race Course]], Carroll's colt [[Bee Bee Bee]] took victory in the prestigious [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] race.

During his career, Del Carroll won three training titles at [[Keeneland|Keeneland Race Course]], one at [[Oaklawn Park Race Track]], and was one of the top trainers at [[Arlington Park]] in [[Chicago]] where he won 262 career races.

Alone in the early morning of May 5, 1982 Del Carroll was galloping one of his horses on the Keeneland track when he was thrown by the horse and suffered severe head injuries. He underwent surgery at [[Saint Joseph Hospital (Lexington, Kentucky)|St. Joseph's Hospital]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] but  died four days later.

==Legacy==
His son, Del Carroll II, who was his assistant  from 1970 through 1979, is now a trainer at tracks on the [[East Coast of the United States]].

His daughter, Robin Ann Carroll, who grew up with her father on the race track, is now the owner of Magazin Farms (www.magazinfarms.com) and an established thoroughbred breeder in the sport of polo.  Her son, Del Carroll Walton is an established polo player and horseman himself.

His youngest daughter, Larkspur Carroll, studied Veterinary Medicine at Ohio State University, became a doctor of vet medicine, is a practice owner/member at CORE Therapies - The Veterinary Acupuncture and Chiropractic Clinic.  She is also the mother to Aurea, Del W. Carroll's granddaughter.

{{Redirect-distinguish2|Deontology|the opposite of [[Ontology]]}} 

In [[moral philosophy]], '''deontological ethics''' or '''deontology''' (from Greek [[:wikt:δέον|δέον]], ''deon'', "obligation, duty"&lt;ref&gt;from the verb [[:wikt:δέω|δέω]] "bind, tie, fetter", via the present participle stem ''deont-'' + the suffix ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/deontology | title=Deontology dictionary definition &amp;#124; deontology defined}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes described as "[[duty]]-" or "obligation-" or "rule-" based ethics, because rules "bind one to one's duty".&lt;ref name="Waller, Bruce N 2005"&gt;Waller, Bruce N. 2005. ''Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues''. New York: Pearson Longman: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to [[consequentialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Antony. 1979. "Consequentialism". In ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd Ed.). New York: St Martins: 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtue ethics]], and [[pragmatic ethics]]. In this [[terminology]], action is more important than the consequences.

It is an ethical framework that depends on the predefined sets of rules and policies for the proper functioning of a system in the environment. The deontology is simply based on the checklist which includes certain rules to be followed while performing a particular task. According to this framework, the work is considered virtuous only if this checklist is completed.
This procedure is very simple to implement and understand. Minimum time is consumed to decide between right and wrong However, its simplicity ignores the consequences of the decision taken under this approach.

The term ''deontological'' was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by [[C. D. Broad]] in his book, ''Five Types of Ethical Theory'', which was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Tom L. 1991 ''Philosophical Ethics: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy'', 2nd Ed. New York: McGraw Hill: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Older usage of the term goes back to [[Jeremy Bentham]], who coined it before 1816 as a synonym of ''Dicastic'' or ''Censorial Ethics'' (i.e. ethics based on judgement).&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, ''Chrestomathia'' (1816), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rqIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA213  p. 213]:
"For a synonym, ''Dicastic Ethics'' may have the single-worded appellative ''Deontology''. [''Deontology''.] From two Greek words, the first of which signifies ''fit, fitting, right, becoming, proper''. Deontology&amp;mdash;an account or indication of that which, on the occasion in question, whatsoever it be, is&amp;mdash;(i.e. by him who speaks or writes, is regarded as being)&amp;mdash;''fit, fitting, becoming, proper''. It is in  ''sound'' only, and not in ''signification'', that it has any connexion with the word ''ontology'',&lt;!--misprinted as outology  --&gt; employed above. Applied to every branch of Ethics, taken in the largest sense of the word ''Ethics'', the use of such a word as ''Deontology'' affords a promise of being attended with considerable convenience. It will accord equally well with every system which ever has been, or ever can be, devised, in relation to the foundation of moral obligation :&amp;mdash;in the use of it, no such incongruity and presumption is involved, as that which is called ''petitio principii''&amp;mdash;i.e. a begging of the question&amp;mdash;an assumption of the matter in dispute."

Also explained as "the knowledge of what is right and proper": 
"Deontology is derived from the Greek words, το  δεον  (that which is proper) and  Λογια, knowledge &amp;mdash; meaning the knowledge of what is right and proper; and it is here specially applied to the subject of morals, or that part of the field of action which is not the object of public legislation. As an art, it is the doing what is fit to be done; as a science, the knowing what is fit to be done on every occasion." 
''Deontology or, The science of morality : in which the harmony and co-incidence of duty and self-interest, virtue and felicity, prudence and benevolence, are explained and exemplified : from the MSS. of Jeremy Bentham'' ed. Bowring (1834), p. [https://archive.org/stream/deontologyorthes01bentuoft#page/21/mode/2up 21].&lt;/ref&gt;
The more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term ''code de déontologie'' ([[ethical code]]), in the context of [[professional ethics]].

Depending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a '''moral obligation''' may arise from an [[Externality|external]] or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe ([[ethical naturalism]]), [[religious law]], or a set of personal or cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires).
 
==Deontological philosophies==
There are numerous formulations of deontological ethics.

===Kantianism===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]|right]]
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. Greenwood Press: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''Pflicht'').&lt;ref&gt;
Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (trans.), [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kant/immanuel/k16e/#nr1 Immanuel Kant, ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''], 1889 [Preface and Introduction to  [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Kant,+Immanuel/Die+Metaphysik+der+Sitten/Zweiter+Teil.+Metaphysische+Anfangsgr%C3%BCnde+der+Tugendlehre ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre''], 1797]. Abbott's ''deontology'' translates Kant's {{lang|de|Pflichtenlehre}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action.

Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is "good in itself" when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and "good without qualification", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:
{{quote|Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt; People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way ''because'' they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of "respect" for the law. He defines respect as "the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals|year=1785|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=23|edition=10|editor=Thomas Kingsmill Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's three significant formulations of the [[categorical imperative]] are:
* Act only according to that [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.
* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.
* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.

Kant argued that the only [[moral absolutism|absolutely good]] thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. "I will lie", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.
In his essay, ''On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns'', arguing against the position of 
[[Benjamin Constant]], ''Des réactions politiques'', Kant states that "Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (''mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius''). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [''Rechtsquelle''] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles."&lt;ref&gt;"Über ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu lügen", ''Berlinische Blätter'' 1 (1797), 301-314; edited in: ''Werke in zwölf Bänden'', vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20009192123 zeno.org/nid/20009192123]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine command theory===
{{Main|Divine command theory}}
[[Right of revolution|Although]] not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.&lt;ref&gt;Wierenga, Edward. 1983. "A Defensible Divine Command Theory". ''Noûs'', Vol. 17, No. 3: 387–407.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Ralph Cudworth]], an English philosopher, [[William of Ockham]], [[René Descartes]], and eighteenth-century [[Calvinists]] all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, Ralph. 1731. ''A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality''. Reprinted in 1996. Sarah Hutton (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath ''because God has commanded that they do not do so''. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking "right", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.

One thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.

*{http://www.Wikipedia.com/Wikipedia's Edit Page}*

===Contemporary deontology===
[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] deontologists (scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include [[Józef Maria Bocheński]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], and [[Roger Scruton]].

Bocheński (1965) makes a distinction between deontic and [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Bocheński (1965), Analysis of authority, in ''The Logic of Religion,'' New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814700501}}, pages 162–173&lt;/ref&gt; 
A typical example of epistemic authority in Bocheński's usage would be "the relation of a teacher to his students" or "the relation between an employer and his employee".&lt;ref name=annabrozek115/&gt; A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey; in contrast, an employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.&lt;ref name=annabrozek115&gt;[[Anna Brożek]] (2013), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11212-013-9175-9 Bocheński on authority], Studies in East European Thought, Volume 65, Issue 1, pages 115–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deontology and consequentialism===
{{see|Trolley problem|Consequentialism|Utilitarianism|Effective altruism}}
[[Frances Kamm]]'s "Principle of Permissible Harm" (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint which coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant's [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 1996. ''Morality, Mortality Vol. II: Rights, Duties, and Status''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people's considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. 
For instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a [[trolley problem|runaway trolley]] that would otherwise kill five [[innocent]] and immobile [[people]] onto a side track where one innocent and immobile person will be killed. 
Kamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends—such as in the organ harvesting case. 
In 2007, Kamm published a book that presents new theory that incorporates aspects of her "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity".&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 2007. 'Chapter 5: Toward the Essence of Nonconsequentialist Constraints on Harming.'. In ''Intricate Ethics: Rights, Responsibilities, and Permissible Harm''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-518969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity" is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.

Attempts have been made to reconcile deontology with virtue-based ethics and [[consequentialism]]. 
[[Iain King]]'s 2008 book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'' uses [[quasi-realism]] and a modified form of [[utilitarianism]] to develop deontological principles which are compatible with ethics based on [[Virtue ethics|virtues]] and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which are more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book.&lt;ref name="King2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = King| first = Iain| title = How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;pg=PA220| date = 2008| publisher = Continuum| isbn = 978-1-84706-347-2| page = 245 }} Page 220 of this book lists fourteen deontological principles, which it describes as "The first fourteen principles of right and wrong".&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dorian Gray syndrome''' ('''DGS''') denotes a cultural and societal [[phenomenon]] characterized by a man's extreme [[pride]] in his personal appearance and the fitness of his physique, which is accompanied by difficulties in coping with the requirements of psychological maturation and with the [[aging]] of his body.

The DGS is characterized by a triad of symptoms that overlap, and so combine [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] signs of [[dysmorphophobia]], [[narcissistic]] character traits, and the immaturity of arrested development, which often are found in [[paraphilias]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Gieler et al. eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve ephemeral youth, the man afflicted with DGS tends to consume cosmetic products and services, hair-restoration procedures, anti-impotence drugs, and [[cosmetic surgery]]; hence, he might resist the [[psychosomatic]] and [[psychodynamic]] explanations of the [[syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 47 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Dorian Gray syndrome" refers to the protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), an exceptionally handsome man whose [[hedonism]] and [[Narcissism|excessive self-love]] proved detrimental to the personal, social, and emotional aspects of his life, and who sought to escape the ravages of time and his own decadent lifestyle by having a supernatural portrait of himself age in his place.

==History==
[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The portraitist Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton observe the beauty recorded in the picture of Dorian Gray.]]
The DGS was first described in ''The Dorian Gray Syndrome: Psychodynamic Need for Hair growth Restorers and other "fountains of youth"'' (2001), in a symposium about the unrealistic male pursuit of bodily [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]] — by means of lifestyle-enhancing drugs, aesthetic surgery, and psychotropic medicines — and its consequences for his mental health as a social being.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig 2000, Brosig ''et al.'' 2001, Euler 2003 ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The culturally descriptive name of the syndrome refers to the eponymous protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), by Oscar Wilde, the story of a very handsome young man who much admires and envies the just-completed portrait of himself, and wishes that it would grow old, rather than he. In order to resist the physical corruptions of time and nature, and unable and unwilling to mature, Dorian Gray "gives his soul away", and his wish is granted.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil portrait and the narrative of the novel transgress and cite [[narcissistic]] mirror motives; as such, eternal beauty, aging, and maturation are represented with the psychological dyad of "the person and the mirror". The personal character of the man Dorian Gray is the background for the clinical description of the Dorian Gray [[syndrome]] that afflicts the patient.

==Causes==
The Dorian Gray syndrome arises from the concurring and overlapping clinical concepts of the [[narcissistic personality]], [[dysmorphophobia]], and [[Paraphilias|paraphilia]]. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamically]], the man afflicted with DGS presents an interplay among his narcissistic tendencies ("timeless beauty"), his arrested development (inability to psychologically mature), and his use of "medical lifestyle" products and services — hair restoration, drugs (for [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], weight-loss, and mood modification), laser dermatology, and plastic surgery — in order to remain young.

Although the DGS patient displays diagnostic features of said mental disorders, the syndrome describes a common, underlying psychodynamics of mental illness, which is characterized by [[narcissistic defences]] against time-dependent maturation, expressed by actively seeking the timeless beauty of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boese, ''Hippo Eats Dwarf'' (2010) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The article ''Das Dorian Gray syndrom'' (2005) reported that approximately 3.0 per cent of the population of Germany present features of the Dorian Gray syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig, B., Euler, S., Brähler, E., Gieler, U. (2005) "Das Dorian Gray Syndrom", in Trüeb, R. A. (Hg.): Smart aging. Darmstadt, Steinkopff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for Dorian Gray syndrome are:
* Signs of [[dysmorphophobia]]
* Arrested development (inability to mature)
* Using at least two different medical-lifestyle products and services:
** Hair-growth restoration (e.g. [[Antiandrogen|finasteride]])
** Antiadiposita to lose weight (e.g. [[orlistat]])
** [[Erectile Dysfunction|Anti-impotence drugs]]  (e.g. [[sildenafil]])
** Anti-depressant drugs (e.g. [[fluoxetine]])
** [[Cosmetology|Cosmetic]] [[dermatology]] (e.g. laser resurfacing)
** [[Cosmetic surgery]] (e.g. a face-lift, [[liposuction]])

==Sequelae==
Episodes of [[major depressive disorder]] and of [[suicidal]] [[crisis]] occur in the man afflicted with Dorian Gray syndrome when the [[defense mechanism]] activities, the pursuit of eternal youth, fail to indefinitely preserve his handsome face and sculpted physique; usually, anti-depressant drugs and psychotherapy are prescribed and applied to counter his feelings of failure.&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, if the man misunderstands the self-defensive character of "acting out" the DGS, and continues pursuing the timeless beauty of male youth, without being aware of the psychodynamics of narcissism, then he, as a psychiatric patient, establishes a cycle of chronic [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]]. In extreme cases of DGS, the man seeks self-destruction, by means either of [[Medication|drugs]] or with plastic surgery, or both, in order to fill the narcissistic emptiness that is the Dorian Gray syndrome.

==Analogous applications==
* In sport, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to ageing baseball players who retain their competitive edge (athleticism) with drugs that are illegal in professional sport.&lt;ref&gt;V. A Belton, ''Baseball is America'' (2010) p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In architecture, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to the rehabilitation of a building to a pristine condition greater than when the building was new.&lt;ref&gt;M. Glendinning, ''The Conservation Movement'' (2013) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harnessing Nonlinearity: Predicting Chaotic Systems and Saving Energy in Wireless Communication'''. ''Science'' 2 April 2004: Vol. 304. no. 5667, pp.&amp;nbsp;78 – 80 {{doi|10.1126/science.1091277}} [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/courses/w4070/Reading_List_Yuste/haas_04.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jaeger (2007) [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_State_Network Echo State Network.] Scholarpedia.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[recurrent neural network]] with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically 1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can (re)produce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system.

Alternatively, one may consider a nonparametric Bayesian formulation of the output layer, under which: (i) a prior distribution is imposed over the output weights; and (ii) the output weights are marginalized out in the context of prediction generation, given the training data. This idea has been demonstrated in &lt;ref&gt;Sotirios P. Chatzis, Yiannis Demiris, “Echo State Gaussian Process,” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 22, no. 9, pp. 1435-1445, Sep. 2011. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5966349/]&lt;/ref&gt; by using Gaussian priors, whereby a Gaussian process model with ESN-driven kernel function is obtained. Such a solution was shown to outperform ESNs with trainable (finite) sets of weights in several benchmarks.

Some publicly available implementations of ESNs are: (i) [http://aureservoir.sourceforge.net/ aureservoir]: an efficient C++ library for various kinds of echo state networks with python/numpy bindings; and (ii) [http://p-apex-g.jimdo.com/matlab-file/ Matlab code]: an efficient matlab for an echo state network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17232">[[Image:ThylacineHobart1933.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin the thylacine|Benjamin]] was an endling, the last known [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), photographed at [[Hobart Zoo]] in 1933.]]

An '''endling''' is the last known [[Individual#Biology|individual]] of a [[species]] or [[subspecies]]. Once the endling dies, the species becomes [[Extinction|extinct]]. The word was [[Coined word|coined]] in correspondence in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. Alternative names put forth for the last individual of its kind include '''ender''' and '''terminarch'''. The word [[Relict (biology)|relict]] may also be used, but usually refers to a population, rather than an individual, that is the last of a species.&lt;ref name="jorgensen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jorgensen|first=Dolly|title=Naming and claiming the last|url=http://dolly.jorgensenweb.net/nordicnature/?p=450|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The 4 April 1996, issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published a correspondence in which commentators suggested that a new word, ''endling'', be adopted to denote the last individual of a species.&lt;ref name="jorgensen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert M. Webster &amp; Bruce Erickson|first=|date=4 April 1996|title=The last word?|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=380|issue=386|pages=386|doi=10.1038/380386c0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23 May issue of ''Nature'' published several counter-suggestions, including ''ender'', ''terminarch'', and ''relict''.&lt;ref name="jorgensen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elaine Andrews|first=|date=4 April 1996|title=The last word|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=381|issue=272|pages=|doi=10.1038/381272d0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''endling'' appeared on the walls of the [[National Museum of Australia]] in ''Tangled Destinies'', a 2001 exhibition by Matt Kirchman and Scott Guerin, about the relationship between Australian peoples and their land. In the exhibition, the definition, as it appeared in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], was printed in large letters on the wall above two specimens of the extinct [[thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]]: "Endling (n.) The last surviving individual of a species of animal or plant". A printed description of this exhibition offered a similar definition, omitting reference to plants: "An endling is the name given to an animal that is the last of its species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangled Destinies|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/19514/tangled_destinies_bw.pdf|publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]]|accessdate=27 January 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Mike|title=The Endling exhibition, Tangled Destinies gallery, National Museum of Australia, Canberra, 2001|url=http://environmentalhistory-au-nz.org/links/publications/reviews/pdfs/robin-rev1.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Australia|accessdate=27 January 2014|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The flight of the emu: a hundred years of Australian ornithology 1901-2001'', author Libby Robin states that "the very last individual of a species" is "what scientists refer to as an 'endling'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robin|first=Libby|title=The flight of the emu: a hundred years of Australian ornithology 1901-2001|publisher=Melbourne University Press|isbn=978-0522849875|page=260|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the word was used in the ''[[Earth Island Journal]]'', in an essay by Eric Freedman entitled "Extinction Is Forever: A Quest for the Last Known Survivors".  Freedman defined ''endling'' as "the last known specimen of her species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freedman|first=Eric|title=Extinction is Forever: A Quest for the Last Known Survivors|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/extinction_is_forever|publisher=Earth Island Journal|accessdate=27 January 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The sense of an endling'', author Helen Lewis describes the notion of an endling as poignant, and the word as "wonderfully Tolkien-esque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Helen|title=Sense of an endling|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/sci-tech/2012/06/sense-endling|publisher=The New Statesman|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cut from history'', author Eric Freedman describes ''endling'' as "a word with finality."  He opines, "It is deep-to-the-bone chilling to know the exact date a species disappeared from Earth. It is even more ghastly to look upon the place where it happened and know that nobody knew or cared at the time what had transpired and why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freedman|first=Eric|title=Cut from history: An abandoned Tasmanian zoo tells the haunting tale of an ending|url=http://www.ejmagazine.com/2002a/history.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705225257/http://www.ejmagazine.com/2002a/history.html|archivedate=2008-07-05|publisher=EJ Magazine|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In the [[superhero]] [[card game]] [[Sentinels of the Multiverse]], the "Enclave of the Endlings" is a location where a being called the Terminarch preserves the last individuals of their species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sentinelswiki.com/index.php?title=Enclave_of_the_Endlings|title=Enclave of the Endlings|work=Sentinels Wiki|accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===

* The last known [[great auk]]s (''Pinguinus impennis'') were killed in 1844 for specimen collectors, after many centuries of exploitation for meat, eggs and oil for burning. A disputed sighting in 1852 has also been debated.
* The [[passenger pigeon]] (''Ectopistes migratorius'') became extinct on 1 September 1914, when the endling [[Martha (pigeon)|Martha]] died at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]].&lt;ref name="Endangered"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/dinos_eastern.php|title=Endangered Species Handbook|year=1983|publisher=[[Animal Welfare Institute]]|format=pdf|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blythe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/08/27/2299018/a-talkative-bird-gone-without.html|title=Extinct Carolina Parakeet still fascinates|last=Blythe|first=Anne|date=27 August 2012|publisher=www.newsobserver.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225025110/http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/08/27/2299018/a-talkative-bird-gone-without.html|archivedate=25 February 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once hugely abundant, millions of other passenger pigeons were eradicated by hunting.

'''George Henry Warren''' (1874 – 1923) was an American laborer who died on June 22, 1923 while building [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]

==Early life==
George Henry Warren was born in 1874 in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia, to former slaves Susan Cousins and Edward Warren. His father worked as a driver and his mother as a maid, his father's mother was a slave and his father's father was a white man. George Warren was one of 16 children. His family most likely left Virginia in the late 1880s or early 1890s, and resettled in the northwest area of Washington, D.C., Tenleytown. While in D.C. he received the average education for a skilled mulatto male in the D.C. area, and met Sarah ''Sadie'' Bell (1875 – 1968) and they were married on August 24, 1904 and the couple had two children: William Edward (1911 – 2003) and Ernest Warren (1915 – 1944).

==Mid life and death==
He was a World War I veteran. He fell off a scaffold on June 22, 1923 - while building All Souls Church - and died from his injuries.

'''''Humanist Manifesto II''''', written in 1973 by [[humanism|humanists]] [[Paul Kurtz]] and [[Edwin H. Wilson]], was an update to [[Humanist Manifesto I|the previous ''Humanist Manifesto'']] (1933), and the second entry in the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' series.  It begins with a statement that the excesses of [[National Socialism]] and [[world war]] had made the first seem too optimistic, and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version.  Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained, expressing hope that war and poverty would be eliminated.

In addition to its absolute rejection of [[theism]] and [[deism]], various political stances are supported, such as opposition to [[racism]], opposition to [[weapons of mass destruction]], support of [[human rights]], a proposition of an [[international court]], and the right to unrestricted [[abortion]] and [[contraception]].

Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the [[American Humanist Association]]'s website encourages visitors to add their own name.  A provision at the end states that the signators do "not necessarily endorse every detail" of the document, but only its broad vision, no doubt helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name.

One of the oft-quoted lines that comes from this manifesto is, "No deity will save us; we must save ourselves."

The ''Humanist Manifesto II'' first appeared in ''The Humanist'' September / October, 1973, when [[Paul Kurtz]] and [[Edwin H. Wilson]] were [[editor in chief|editor]] and [[editor emeritus]] , respectively.

== Signatories ==

The 120 original signatories to the manifesto included the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II Humanist Manifesto II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactionism''' or '''interactionist dualism''' is the theory in the [[philosophy of mind]] which holds that matter and mind are two distinct and independent [[Substance theory|substances]] that exert causal effects on one another.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Robinson|first=Howard|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward N. Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Dualism|year=2016|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one type of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], traditionally a type of [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|substance dualism]] though more recently also sometimes a form of [[property dualism]].

==Proponents==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]'s illustration of dualism. Inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the [[Pineal gland|epiphysis]] in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Arguments for dualism}}
Interactionism was propounded by the French [[Rationalism|rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), and continues to be associated with him. Descartes posited that the body, being physical matter, was characterized by spatial extension but not by thought and feeling, while the mind, being a separate substance, had no spatial extension but could think and feel.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Robb|first=David and John Heil|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward N. Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Mental Causation|year=2014|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he maintained that the two interacted with one another, suggesting that this interaction occurred in the [[pineal gland]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=|editor-last=|editor-first=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|title=Interactionism – philosophy|year=|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/interactionism|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, its most significant defenders have been the noted philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] and the neurophysiologist [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=3-492-21096-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper in fact divided reality into [[Popper's three worlds|three "worlds"]]—the physical, the mental, and objective knowledge (outside the mind)—all of which interact,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80.pdf Three Worlds by Karl Popper - The Tanner Lecture on Human Values] - Delivered by Karl Popper at The University of Michigan on April 7, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Eccles adopted this same "trialist" form of interactionism.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | first = John | last = Eccles | chapter = 6 'Brain, Speech, and Consciousness' |p=189 | title = The Understanding of the Brain|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-07-018863-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable recent philosophers to take an interactionist stance have been [[Richard Swinburne]], [[John Foster (philosopher)|John Foster]], David Hodgson, and [[Wilfrid Sellars]], in addition to the physicist [[Henry Stapp]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Chalmers|first1=David J.|editor1-last=Stich|editor1-first=Stephen P.|editor2-last=Warfield|editor2-first=Ted A.|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind|title=Consciousness and its Place in Nature|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0631217756|edition=1st|url=http://consc.net/papers/nature.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003182905/http://www.consc.net/papers/nature.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'', [[David Chalmers]] rejected interactionism, but in 2002 he reversed his position and listed it along with [[epiphenomenalism]] and what he calls "Type-F [[monism]]" as a position worth examining. Rather than invoking two distinct substances, he defines interactionism as the view that "microphysics is not causally closed, and that phenomenal properties play a causal role in affecting the physical world." (See [[property dualism]].) He argues the most plausible place for [[consciousness]] to impact physics is the [[collapse of the wave function]] in [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

The ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' argues that a non-physical mind and mind-body interaction follow necessarily from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrines of the [[soul]] and [[free will]].&lt;ref name="CathEn"&gt;Maher, Michael (1909) "The Law of Conservation of Energy", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 5, pp. 422 ff, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05422a.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
===Problem of causal interaction===
{{main|Mind-body dualism#Causal interaction}}
One objection often posed to interactionism is the ''problem of causal interaction'' – how the two different substances the theory posits, the mental and the physical, can exert an impact on one another. Descartes' theory that interaction between the mind and the physical world occurred in the pineal gland was seen as inadequate by a number of philosophers in his era, who offered alternate views: [[Nicholas Malebranche]] suggested [[occasionalism]], according to which mind and body appear to interact but are in fact moved separately by God, while [[Gottfried Leibniz]] argued in ''[[Monadology|The Monadology]]'' that mind and body are in a [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; On the other hand, [[Baruch Spinoza]] rejected Descartes' dualism and proposed that mind and matter were in fact properties of a single substance,&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; thereby prefiguring the modern perspective of [[neutral monism]].

Today the problem of causal interaction is frequently viewed as a conclusive argument against interactionism.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Calef|first=Scott|editor-last=Fieser|editor-first=James and Bradley Dowden|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Dualism and Mind|year=2014|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dualism/#SH7c|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it has been suggested that given many disciplines deal with things they do not entirely understand, dualists not entirely understanding the mechanism of mind-body interaction need not be seen as definitive refutation.&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; The idea that causation necessarily depends on push-pull mechanisms (which would not be possible for a substance that did not occupy space) is also arguably based on obsolete conceptions of physics.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

The [[problem of mental causation]] is also discussed in the context of other positions on the [[mind-body problem]], such as [[property dualism]] and [[anomalous monism]].&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

===Compatibility with the conservation of energy===
{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Argument from physics}}
A more recent related objection is the ''argument from physics'', which argues that a mental substance impacting the physical world would contradict principles of physics.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, it would violate the [[law of conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, William (1996) "Philosophy of Mind" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Nicholas Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Two main responses to this have been to suggest the mind influences the distribution but not the quantity of energy in the brain and to deny that the brain is a [[causal closure|causally closed]] system in which conservation of energy would apply.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathEn"/&gt;

=== Causal closure ===
{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Argument from physics}}
Taking the argument a step further, it has been argued that because physics fully accounts for the causes of all physical movements, there can be no place for the a non-physical mind to play a role.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; The principle, in slightly different iterations, has variously been called ''causal closure'', ''completeness of the physical'', ''physical closure'', and ''physical comprehensiveness''.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; This has been the foremost argument against interactionism in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

Some philosophers have suggested the influence of the mind on the body could be reconciled with deterministic physical laws by proposing the mind's impacts instead take place at points of [[quantum indeterminacy]].&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; Karl Popper and John Eccles, as well as the physicist Henry Stapp, have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref name="PopE"/&gt; (See [[quantum mind]].) However, [[Max Tegmark]] has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that [[quantum decoherence]] effects do not play a role in brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=Importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes|journal=Phys. Rev. E|date=April 2000|volume=61|issue=4|pages=4194–4206|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4194|url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v61/i4/p4194_1|accessdate=18 November 2012|arxiv=quant-ph/9907009|bibcode=2000PhRvE..61.4194T}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Chalmers has noted (without necessarily endorsing) a second possibility within quantum mechanics, that consciousness' causal role is to collapse the wave function as per the [[Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges this is at odds with the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] held by most physicists, but notes, "There is some irony in the fact that philosophers reject interactionism on largely physical grounds (it is incompatible with physical theory), while physicists reject an interactionist interpretation of quantum mechanics on largely philosophical grounds (it is dualistic). Taken conjointly, these reasons carry little force...".&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

There remains a literature in philosophy and science, albeit a much-contested one, that asserts evidence for [[emergence]] in various domains, which would undermine the principle of causal closure.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; (See [[emergentism]].) Another option that has been suggested is that the interaction may involve [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]] or some other currently unknown scientific process.&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (2003) "Dualism", in ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind'', ed. S. Stich and T. Warfield, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 85-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible resolution is akin to parallelism—Eugene Mills holds that behavioral events are causally [[overdetermination|overdetermined]], and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=E.|title=Interactionism and Overdetermination|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|year=1996|volume=33|pages=105–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Althusser|first=Louis|title="Contradiction and Overdetermination," in For Marx|year=1985|isbn=0-902308-79-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Paul Churchland]] have argued that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by [[Occam's razor]] a non-physical mind is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Churchland|first=Paul|title=Matter and Consciousness, Revised Edition|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262530743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Melnyk argues that overdetermination would require an "intolerable coincidence."&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

While causal closure remains a key obstacle for interactionism, it is not relevant to all forms of dualism; epiphenomenalism and parallelism are unaffected as they do not posit that the mind affects the body.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

==Relationship to other positions==
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualist causal interaction. The arrows indicate the direction of causations. Mental and physical states are shown in red and blue, respectively.]]
Interactionism can be distinguished from competing dualist theories of causation, including [[epiphenomenalism]] (which admits causation, but views causation as unidirectional rather than bidirectional), and [[Parallelism (philosophy)|parallelism]] (which denies causation, while seeking to explain the semblance of causation by other means such as [[pre-established harmony]] or [[occasionalism]]).&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

In ''The Conscious Mind'', David Chalmers argued that regardless of the mechanism by which the mental might impact the physical if interactionism were true, there was a deeper conceptual issue: the chosen mechanism could always be separated from its [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenal]] component, leading to simply a new form of epiphenomenalism.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"/&gt; Later, he suggested that while the causal component could be separated, interactionism was like "type-F monism" ([[Russellian monism]], [[panpsychism]], and panprotopsychism) in that it gave entities externally characterized by physical relationships the additional intrinsic feature of conscious properties.&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

'''''Italian submarine Adua''''' was an {{sclass-|Adua|submarine}} built in the 1930s, serving in the [[Regia Marina]] during [[World War II]]. She was named after a town [[Adwa]] in northern [[Ethiopia]].

==Design and description==
The ''Adua''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Perla|submarine|4}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|680|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|844|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|60.18|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.45|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, pp. 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|400|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.5|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Adua'' class had a range of {{convert|3180|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10.5|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|74|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]]  machine guns.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

== Construction and career ==
''Adua'' was built at the [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico|CRDA]] shipyard, in [[Monfalcone]]. She was laid down on 1 February 1936, launched on 13 September of the same year, and commissioned on 14 November 1936.  After intense 1937 spring training in the waters of the [[Dodecanese]], [[Greece]] and [[Libya]], ''Adua'' was assigned to the 23rd Squadron based at [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;[http://www.mucamonfalcone.it/aspx/StampaProspettazioneNave.aspx?idAmb=149&amp;idConNave=41&amp;idMenu=-1&amp;tp=vArchivioNavi&amp;liv=0&amp;order=0 ''Adua'' at Monfalcone Naval Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 she was transferred to [[Cagliari]] and became part of the 71st Squadron (VII Submarine Group).&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

On June 10, 1940 at the time of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s entrance into [[World War II]], ''Adua'' was already at sea, south of [[Sardinia]] (between Cape Teulada and the island of [[Galite Islands|La Galite]]) under command of Giuseppe Roselli Lorenzini.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; On June 13, she moved to an area between [[Ibiza]] and [[Mallorca]] and later to the [[Gulf of Lion]] fifteen miles east of Cape Creus. During night of June 17, 1940 ''Adua'' sighted a destroyer, but could not launch an attack. The following morning, she sighted a French convoy (five merchants and two escorts) on the [[Marseille]] - [[Toulon]] route. Not being able to approach because of the escort, she launched a single torpedo from 1,800 meters at a larger transport. However, there are no confirmations of any ships being damaged or sunk on this day at this time and this location.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

Shortly thereafter, captain Luigi Riccardi assumed command of the submarine.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

From October 22, 1940 to March 12, 1941 ''Adua'' served as the training vessel at the Pola Submarine School. During this span she carried out 46 training missions. Carlo Todaro and Mario Resio served as her commanders during this time. In mid-March 1941 ''Adua'' was transferred back to [[Taranto]], and she was again put under command of captain Luigi Riccardi.&lt;ref name="m3"&gt;[http://www.regiamarina.net/detail_text_with_list.asp?nid=84&amp;lid=2&amp;cid=2 ''Adua'' at Regia Marina]&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to May 1941 ''Adua'' was deployed in the [[Gulf of Taranto]], and also off the coast of Greece, carrying out three unsuccessful missions:

*In March, forty miles west of [[Lefkada]], then in the Gulf of Taranto;
*In April, south of [[Cape Krio]] and in [[Kythira Strait]];
*In May, between [[Alexandria]] and [[Kasos]] Strait at first, then south of [[Crete]].

On May 10, 1941 she was transferred to [[Leros]].&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

At 01:30 on June 3, 1941 she intercepted a small motor barge carrying gasoline and 72 British troops on board, including 8 officers, attempting to reach Egyptian coast. ''Adua'' took officers prisoner, and escorted the vessel to Crete, where other soldiers were taken prisoners.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

On June 4, 1941, she headed back to Taranto where the submarine underwent a three-month long maintenance at the Arsenal of Taranto.

In the middle of September ''Adua'' operated near [[Menorca]] returning to Cagliari on September 16.

On September 23, 1941 the submarine left Cagliari to set an ambush on the route of the British convoy to Malta (Operation Halberd) together with three other submarines.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;  On September 26 ''Adua'' was  near [[Cape Palos]], north of Spanish city of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]. The British convoy went undetected and reached [[Malta]]. The submarines, including '' Adua'' spotted and attacked British ships on their  return. On September 30, 1941 at 3:50 ''Adua'' detected a group of eleven English destroyers, and attacked them with a four-torpedo salvo, but missed them and then moved north. Shortly after at 5:25, ''Adua'' sent a radio transmission to the Headquarters informing them of British convoy position.&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Giorgerini,  pp. 293-299-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; She was never heard from again.

After the war, it was discovered that the submarine had been traced by two destroyers, {{HMS|Gurkha|G63|6}} and {{HMS|Legion|G74|6}} (perhaps it was the radio communication with the base that allowed British ships to locate her).&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; After having detected ''Adua'' with ASDIC, they started depth charge attacks, and at 10:30 hit and sunk ''Adua'' with all hands in the position {{Coord|37|10|N|00|56|E}} or {{Coord|36|50|N|00|56|E}}.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

==Education==
Keasling received his bachelor's degree at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] where he was a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] International Fraternity. He went on to  complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1991 under the supervision of [[Bernhard Palsson]].&lt;ref name="keaslingphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Jay D.|last=Keasling |title= Dynamics and control of bacterial plasmid replication |publisher=University of Michigan |date=1981 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304026675}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keasling performed post-doctoral research with Arthur Kornberg at Stanford University in 1991-1992.

==Research==
Keasling’s current research &lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=jay+keasling Jay Keasling in Google Scholar]. Scholar.google.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; is focused on engineering chemistry inside microorganisms, an area known as metabolic engineering, for production of useful chemicals or for environmental cleanup.  In much the same way that synthetic organic and industrial chemistry has allowed chemists and chemical engineers to produce from fossil fuel resources chemicals that we use every day, metabolic engineering can revolutionize the production of some of the same useful chemicals and more from renewable resources, like sugar and cellulosic biomass.  For many years, work in metabolic engineering was limited by the lack of enzymes to perform the necessary chemistry and tools to manipulate and monitor the chemistry inside cells. Seeing a need for better genetic tools, Keasling began working on genetic tool development, an area now known as synthetic biology.  Keasling’s laboratory has developed or adopted many of the latest analytical tools to troubleshoot our genetic manipulations.  Keasling’s laboratory has applied metabolic chemistry to a number of real-world problems including the production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin and drop-in biofuels.  Keasling has published over 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals and has over 30 issued patents.

===Artemisinin===
Malaria is a global health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills more than one million people annually.  The chloroquine-based drugs that were used widely in the past have lost effectiveness because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has become resistant to them.  Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, extracted from ''Artemisia annua'' L is highly effective against Plasmodium spp. resistant to other anti-malarial drugs.  However, there are several problems with current production methods for artemisinin.  First, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are too expensive for people in the developing world to afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Specter|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Specter|title=Denialsim How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives|year=2009|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|isbn=978-1-59420-230-8|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, artemisinin is extracted from ''A. annua'', and its yield and consistency depend on climate and the extraction process. While there is a method for chemical synthesis of artemisinin, it is too low yielding and therefore too expensive for use in producing low-cost drugs.  Third, although the World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin be formulated with other active pharmaceutical ingredients in ACTs, many manufacturers are still producing mono-therapies of artemisinin, which increase the chance that Plasmodium spp. will develop resistance to artemisinin.

Jay Keasling’s laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley has engineered both ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor to artemisinin that can be derivatized using established, simple, inexpensive chemistry to form artemisinin or any artemisinin derivative currently used to treat malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ro | first1 = D.

The engineered microorganism is capable of secreting the final product from the cell, thereby purifying it from all other intracellular chemicals and reducing the purification costs and therefore the cost of the final drug.  Given the existence of known, relatively high-yielding chemistry for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin or any other artemisinin derivative, microbially-produced artemisinic acid is a viable, renewable, and scalable source of this potent family of anti-malarial drugs.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sabl/2006/May/02-antimalarial.html An Age-Old Microbe May Hold the Key to Curing an Age-Old Affliction]. Science@Berkeley. May 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical element of Keasling’s work was the development of genetic tools to aid in the manipulation of microbial metabolism, particularly for low-value products that require high yields from sugar.  His laboratory developed single-copy plasmids for the expression of complex metabolic pathways, promoter systems that allow regulated control of transcription consistently in all cells of a culture, mRNA stabilization technologies to regulate the stability of mRNA segments,&lt;ref&gt;Carothers et al. 2011 Science 334:1716&lt;/ref&gt; and a protein engineering approach to attach several enzymes of a metabolic pathway onto a synthetic protein scaffold to increase pathway flux.&lt;ref&gt;Dueber et al. 2009 Nat. Biotechnol. 27:753&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other gene expression tools now enable precise control of the expression of the genes that encode novel metabolic pathways to maximize chemical production, to minimize losses to side products, and minimize the accumulation of toxic intermediates that may poison the microbial host, all of which are important for economical production of this important drug.

Another critical aspect of Keasling’s work was discovering the chemistry and enzymes in ''Artemisia annua'' responsible for synthesis of artemisinin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al. 2003 Nat. Biotechnol. 21:796&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ro et al. 2006 Nature 440:940"&gt;Ro et al. 2006 Nature 440:940&lt;/ref&gt;  These enzymes included the cytochrome P450 that oxidizes amorphadiene to artemisinic acid and the redox partners that transfer reducing equivalents from the enzyme to cofactors. The discovery of these enzymes and their functional expression in both yeast and ''E. coli'', along with the other nine enzymes in the metabolic pathway, allowed production of artemisinic acid by these two microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Ro et al. 2006 Nature 440:940"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang et al. 2007 Nat. Chem. Biol. 3:274&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. cerevisiae'' was chosen for the large-scale production process and was further engineered to improve artemisinic acid production.&lt;ref&gt;Paddon et al. 2013 Nature 496:528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paddon and Keasling.  2014. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 12:355&lt;/ref&gt;

Keasling’s microbial production process has a number of advantages over extraction from plants.  First, microbial synthesis will reduce the cost of artemisinin, the most expensive component of artemisinin-based combination therapies—by as much as tenfold—and therefore make artemisinin-derived anti-malarial drugs more affordable to people in the developing world.  Second, weather conditions or political climates that might otherwise affect the yield or cost of the plant-derived version of the drug will not affect the microbial source for the drug.  Third, microbial production of artemisinin in large tanks will allow for more careful distribution of artemisinin to legitimate drug manufacturers that formulate artemisinin combination therapies, rather than monotherapies.  This will, in turn, slow the development of resistance to this drug.  Fourth, severe shortages of plant-derived artemisinin are projected for 2011 and beyond, which will increase the cost of artemisinin combination therapies.  Finally, microbially-derived artemisinic acid will enable production of new derivatives of artemisinin that Plasmodium may not be resistant to, thereby extending the time over which artemisinin may be used.

To ensure that the process he developed would benefit people in the developing world, Dr. Keasling assembled a unique team consisting of his laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley; Amyris Biotechnologies, a company founded on this technology; and the Institute for OneWorld Health, a non-profit pharmaceutical company located in San Francisco, CA. In addition to assembling the team, Dr. Keasling developed an intellectual property model to ensure that microbially-sourced artemisinin could be offered as inexpensively as possible to people in the developing world:  patents granted from his work at UCB are licensed royalty free to Amyris Biotechnologies and the Institute for OneWorld Health for use in producing artemisinin so long as they do not make a profit on artemisinin sold in the developing world. The team was funded in December 2004 by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to develop the microbial production process.  The science was completed in Dec. 2007.  In 2008, Sanofi-Aventis licensed the technology and worked with Amyris to develop the production process. Sanofi-Aventis has produced 35 tons of artemisinin using Keasling’s microbial production process, which is enough for 70 million treatments.  Distribution of artemisinin combination therapies containing the microbially-sourced artemisinin began in August 2014 with 1.7 million treatments shipped to Africa.  It is anticipated that 100-150 million treatments will be produced using this technology and shipped annually to Africa, Asia, and South America.

===Biofuels===
Renewable fuels are needed for all modes of transportation.  Unfortunately, most microbially-sourced fuels can be used only as a small fraction of gasoline in conventional spark-ignition engines.  Keasling’s laboratory has engineered microorganisms to produce hydrocarbons with similar properties to the fuels now derived from petroleum.  These fuels are synthesized from plant-derived sugars, such as cellulose feedstock, which is of little economic value. Consequently, microbes can minimize the carbon footprint by minimizing the energy expenditure in sourcing fuel, such off-shore drilling and hydraulic fracturing to name a few.

Keasling and his colleagues demonstrated that ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' can be engineered to produce the fatty acid-based biofuels fatty acid ethyl esters,&lt;ref&gt;Steen 2010 Nature 463:559; Runguphan 2013 Met Eng in press&lt;/ref&gt; alkenes,&lt;ref&gt;Beller 2010. Appl Environ Microbiol 76:1212&lt;/ref&gt; and methyl ketones.&lt;ref&gt;Goh 2012. Appl Environ Microbiol 78:70&lt;/ref&gt;  As linear hydrocarbons are the key components of diesel, these biologically produced fuels are excellent diesel replacements.  However, fuels containing only long, linear, hydrocarbon chains will freeze under cold conditions.  To develop fuels suitable for cold applications, Keasling’s laboratory engineered ''E. coli'' and ''S. cerevisiae'' to produce branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway: isopentanol, a drop-in replacement for gasoline;&lt;ref&gt;Chou 2012 Appl Env Microbiol 78:7829&lt;/ref&gt; pinene, a replacement for jet fuel;&lt;ref&gt;Bokinsky 2011 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108:19949&lt;/ref&gt; and bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Peralta-Yahya 2010 Nat. Commun. 2:483&lt;/ref&gt;  Because isoprenoids add a methyl side chain every four carbons in the backbone, fuels made from isoprenoids have very low freeze and cloud points, making them suitable as cold-weather diesels and jet fuels.

One of the biggest challenges in scaling up microbial fermentations is the stability of the microbial strain: the engineered microorganism will attempt to mutate or shed the metabolic pathway, in part because intermediates in the metabolic pathway accumulate and are toxic to the cells. To balance pathway flux and reduce the cost of producing a desired biofuel, Keasling’s laboratory developed dynamic regulators to sense the levels of intermediates in the pathway and regulate pathway activity.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang 2012 Nat Biotechnol 30:354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahl 2013 Nat Biotechnol 31:1039&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chou 2013 Nat Commun 4:2595&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulators stabilized the pathway and the cell and improved biofuel yields making it possible to grow the engineered cells in large-scale fermentation tanks for fuel production.

Many of the best fuels and chemicals are toxic to the producer organism.  One way to limit fuel toxicity is to actively pump the fuel from the cell.  To identify pumps ideally suited for a particular fuel, Keasling and his colleagues bioprospected environmental microorganisms for many, different, three-component transporters and selected for the pumps most effective for a particular fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop 2011 Mol Sys Biol 7:487&lt;/ref&gt;  These transporters allowed ''E. coli'' to grow in the presence of the fuels and, as a result, produce more of the target fuel than it would have been able to do so in the absence of the transporter.

The starting materials (generally sugars) are the most significant factor in the biofuel production cost.  Cellulose, a potentially low-cost starting material, must be depolymerized into sugars by adding an expensive cocktail of enzymes.  One way to reduce this cost is to engineer the fuel-producing microbe to also produce the enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose.  Recently, Keasling’s laboratory demonstrated that a microorganism could be engineered to synthesize and secrete enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars and to produce a gasoline replacement (butanol), a diesel-fuel replacement (fatty acid ethyl ester), or a jet fuel replacement (pinene).&lt;ref&gt;Bokinsky 2011 Proc Natl Acad Sci 108:19949&lt;/ref&gt;

As a technological platform, biofuel manufacturing faces huge economic hurdles many of which depend on the market pricing of crude oil and other conventionally sourced fuels. Nonetheless, metabolic engineering is a technology that is becoming increasingly competitive and is expected to have wide-reaching effects by 2020.

'''Karma''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}; {{lang-pi|kamma|italic=yes}}) means action, work or deed;&lt;ref&gt;See:

The philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]] (particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]&lt;ref name=KarmaParveshSingla&gt;{{cite book|author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |publisher=Parvesh singla |pages=5–7 |id=GGKEY:0XFSARN29ZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=evawong&gt;Eva Wong, Taoism, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1590308820}}, pp. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's ''[[saṃsāra]]''.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

==Definition and meanings==
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Karma as action and reaction: if we show goodness, we will reap goodness.]] 
''Karma'' is the executed "deed", "work", "action", or "act", and it is also the "object", the "intent". [[Wilhelm Halbfass]]&lt;ref name=halbfass2000&gt;Halbfass, Wilhelm (2000), Karma und Wiedergeburt im indischen Denken, Diederichs, München, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with another Sanskrit word ''kriya''. The word ''kriya'' is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, while ''karma'' is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]] (2010), Hindus: Their religious beliefs and practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pp 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

Karma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma.&lt;ref name=karlpotter&gt;Karl Potter (1964), The Naturalistic Principle of Karma, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Apr., 1964), pp. 39-49&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define.&lt;ref name=wdointro&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp xi-xxv (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools of [[Indologists]] derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 3-37&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indologists include in the definition of karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1980), in Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions (O'Flaherty, Editor), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*For Hinduism view: Jeffrey Brodd (2009), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, pp. 47;
*For Buddhism view: Khandro Rinpoche (2003), This Precious Life, Shambhala, pp. 95
&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of ''karma'' arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb&gt;see:
* Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32;
* Sharma, A. (1996), On the distinction between Karma and Rebirth in Hinduism, Asian Philosophy, 6(1), pp 29-35;
* Bhattacharya, R. (2012), Svabhāvavāda and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40(6), pp 593-614&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657042}}, see article on Karma&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. [[Wendy Doniger|O'Flaherty]] claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;

Karma theory as a concept, across different Indian religious traditions, shares certain common themes: causality, ethicization and rebirth.

===Causality===
[[File:Tema Nezahat Gokyigit Park 1060584 nymphaea.jpg|thumb|240px|Lotus symbolically represents karma in many Asian traditions. A blooming lotus flower is one of the few flowers that simultaneously carries seeds inside itself while it blooms. Seed is symbolically seen as cause, the flower effect. Lotus is also considered as a reminder that one can grow, share good karma and remain unstained even in muddy circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Maria I. Macioti, The Buddha Within Ourselves: Blossoms of the Lotus Sutra, Translator: Richard Maurice Capozzi, {{ISBN|978-0761821892}}, pp 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of Hinduism. For example, at 4.4.5-6, it states:

{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Now as a man is like this or like that,
according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;

And here they say that a person consists of desires,
and as is his desire, so is his will;
and as is his will, so is his deed;
and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|3=7th Century BCE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6MPYs0AkA?url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/quotes/brihadaranyaka-upanishad-4-4-5-6 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5-6] Berkley Center for Religion Peace &amp; World Affairs, Georgetown University (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jbbu&gt;The words "deed", "acts" above are rendered from karma; see [https://archive.is/20140107061016/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/jrblack/web/SKT/DL/upanishads.html Brihadaranyaka] James Black, Original Sanskrit &amp; Muller Oxford English Translations, University of Wisconsin, United States (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought.&lt;ref name=brucer&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach, The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anguttara-Nikaya 3.4.33, Translator: Henry Warren (1962), Buddhism in Translations, Atheneum Publications, New York, pp 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Another causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.&lt;ref name=jmpj&gt;see:
* James McDermott, Karma and Rebirth in Early Buddhism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 165-192
* Padmanabh Jaini, Karma and the problem of rebirth in Jainism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 217-239
* Ludo Rocher, Karma and Rebirth in the Dharmasastras, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 61-89&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: ''phalas'' and ''samskaras''. A ''phala'' (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, ''samskaras'' are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of ''samskaras''.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown (1996), Karma, character, and consequentialism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, pp 329-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karmic principle can be understood, suggests Karl Potter,&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter's suggestion is supported by the Bhagavad-Gita, which links good bondage and bad bondage to good habits and bad habits respectively. It also lists various types of habits - such as good (sattva), passion (rajas) and indifferent (tamas) - while explaining karma. See the cited Potter reference; elsewhere, in Yoga Sutras, the role of karma to creating habits is explained with ''Vāsanās'' - see Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York, {{ISBN|0-7914-3816-3}}, Chapter 3, particularly pp 102-105&lt;/ref&gt; as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits ([[vāsanā]]), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1998), The final stages of purification in classical yoga, Asian Philosophy, 8(2), pp 85-102&lt;/ref&gt; Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (1983), "Psychology and Karma", ''Philosophy East and West'' 33 (Jan): 49-60.&lt;/ref&gt; link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person's "character", as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

===Karma and ethicization===
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence,&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt; which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself "reward and punishment", but the law that produces consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Clooney, Evil, Divine Omnipotence, and Human Freedom: Vedānta's Theology of Karma, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; Halbfass notes, good karma is considered as ''[[dharma]]'' and leads to ''punya'' (merit), while bad karma is considered ''adharma'' and leads to ''pāp'' (demerit, sin).&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1998), Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, London, see article on Karma and Rebirth (Indian Conceptions)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;see:
* James Hastings et al. (1915), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Hymns-Liberty), Volume VII, Article on Jainism, pp 469-471;

* Krishan, Y. (1988), The Vedic origins of the doctrine of karma, South Asian Studies, 4(1), pp 51-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (''saṃsāra'').&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273, 652-654}} Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.&lt;ref name=jamesloch&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb/&gt; Karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept, so suggests Creel;&lt;ref&gt;Austin Creel (1986), in Editor: Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is a fact, asserts Yamunacharya,&lt;ref&gt;M Yamunacharya (1966), Karma and Rebirth, Indian Philo. Annual, 1, pp 66&lt;/ref&gt; while reincarnation is a hypothesis; in contrast, Hiriyanna suggests&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyana (1949), Essentials of Indian Philosophy, George Allen Unwin, London, pp 47&lt;/ref&gt; rebirth is a necessary corollary of karma.

Rebirth, or ''saṃsāra'', is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 589&lt;/ref&gt; In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Karma&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching ''[[moksa]]''. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.

The theory of "karma and rebirth" raises numerous questions—such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as [[Charvaka]]s, Lokayatana abandoned "karma and rebirth" theory altogether.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

==Early development==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word  {{IAST|[[:wikt:कर्मन्#Sanskrit|kárman-]]}} (nominative ''{{IAST|kárma}}'') means "work" or "deed",&lt;ref name=krishan/&gt; often used in the context of [[Srauta]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;a neuter ''n''-stem, {{lang|sa|कर्म}}  from the root ''{{IAST|√kṛ}}'' {{lang|sa|कृ}}  "to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause, effect, prepare, undertake" [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0334.html kṛ,कृ] Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Rigveda]], the word  occurs some 40 times.&lt;ref name="krishan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krishan|first=Y.|year=1988|title=The Vedic Origins of the Doctrine of Karma|journal=South Asian Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=51–55|doi=10.1080/02666030.1988.9628366}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2016-05-01--&gt;;&lt;br&gt;

The Indo-aryans have borrowed the theory of re-birth after coming in contact with the aboriginal inhabitants of India. Certainly Jainism and non-vedics [..] accepted the doctrine of rebirth as supreme postulate or article of faith."

These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions."

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Karma in Hinduism}}

The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest Upanishads began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include ''pancagni vidya'' (the five fire doctrine), ''pitryana'' (the cyclic path of fathers) and ''devayana'' (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods).&lt;ref&gt;Colebrooke, H. T. (1829), Essay on the Philosophy of the Hindus, Part V. Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 2(1), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do superficial rituals and seek material gain, claimed these ancient scholars, travel the way of their fathers and recycle back into another life; those who renounce these, go into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge, were claimed to climb into the higher path of the gods. It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn.&lt;ref name=wmahony&gt;William Mahony (1987), Karman: Hindu and Jain Concepts, in Editor: Mircea Eliade, Encyclopedia of Religion, Collier Macmillan, New York&lt;/ref&gt; With the composition of the Epics - the common man's introduction to [[Dharma]] in Hinduism - the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories. For example:
{{Quote|
1=As a man himself sows, so he himself reaps; no man inherits the good or evil act of another man. The fruit is of the same quality as the action.
|2=[[Mahabharata]]|3= xii.291.22&lt;ref&gt;E. Washburn Hopkins, Modifications of the Karma Doctrine, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, (Jul., 1906), pp. 581-593&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the thirteenth book of the Mahabharata, also called the Teaching Book ([[Anushasana Parva]]), sixth chapter opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: "Is the course of a person's life already destined, or can human effort shape one's life?"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; see Chapter 3 and Appendix 1&lt;/ref&gt; The future, replies Bhishma, is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; pp 60-64&lt;/ref&gt; Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory. That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn't disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bruce Long, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Happiness comes due to good actions, suffering results from evil actions,
by actions, all things are obtained, by inaction, nothing whatsoever is enjoyed.
If one's action bore no fruit, then everything would be of no avail,
if the world worked from fate alone, it would be neutralized.
&lt;/poem&gt;

* There is extensive debate in the Epic Mahabharata about karma, free will and destiny across different chapters and books. Different characters in the Epic take sides, some claiming destiny is supreme, some claiming free will is. For a discussion, see: [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H. H. Ingalls]], Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 44-45; Quote - "(...) In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote - "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasize destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Halbfass,&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;
* The Nyaya school of Hinduism considers karma and rebirth as central, with some Nyaya scholars such as [[Udayana]] suggesting that the Karma doctrine implies that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Vaisesika school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
* The Samkhya school considers karma to be of secondary importance (prakrti is primary).
* The Mimamsa school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards ''samsara'' and ''moksa''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yoga school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one's behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.&lt;ref name=wmahony/&gt;
* According to Professor [[Wilhelm Halbfass]], the Vedanta school acknowledges the karma-rebirth doctrine, but concludes it is a theory that is not derived from reality and cannot be proven, considers it invalid for its failure to explain evil / inequality / other observable facts about society, treats it as a convenient fiction to solve practical problems in Upanishadic times, and declares it irrelevant; in the Advaita Vedanta school, actions in current life have moral consequences and liberation is possible within one's life as jivanmukti (self-realized person).&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

The above six schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as Vedanta school's nondualism and dualism sub-schools. Furthermore, there are other schools of Hinduism such as Charvaka, Lokayata (the materialists) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this school of Hindus, the properties of things come from the nature of things. Causality emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Franco (1981), [http://www.sudoc.fr/041081900 Lokayata La Philosophie Dite Materialiste de l'Inde Classique], Nanterre-Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli (1998), Nyaya-Vaisesika, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial problem presented to all schools of Buddhist philosophy was where the trace is stored and how it can remain in the ever-changing stream of phenomena which build up the individual and what the nature of this trace is."{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}}} is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out,{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} and "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}} In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}}
The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}{{refn|group=note|[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Bhikkhu Thanissaro]]: "Unlike the theory of [[causality|linear causality]] — which led the [[Vedas|Vedists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and tit-for-tat — the principle of ''[[Idappaccayatā|this/that conditionality]]'' makes that relationship inherently complex. The results of kamma ("kamma" is the Pali spelling for the word "karma") experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one’s state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=42}} There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=131}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} ''Karmaphala'' is not a "judgement" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos. Rather, ''karmaphala'' is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.{{refn|group=note|[[Khandro Rinpoche]]: "Buddhism is a nontheistic philosophy. We do not believe in a creator but in the causes and conditions that create certain circumstances that then come to fruition. This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations. Just as a handful of seed can ripen into a full field of grain, a small amount of karma can generate limitless effects."{{sfn|Khandro Rinpoche|2003|p=95}}}}

In [[Jainism]], "karma" conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in [[Hindu philosophy]] and western civilization.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hermann Kuhn, Karma, the Mechanism, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya - Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 24&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karmas'' are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the ''karmas'' are the [[subtle matter]] surrounding the [[consciousness]] of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.

Jain|title=Reality|date=1992|publisher=Jwalamalini Trust|url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT |page=7}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]]''- the soul which is characterized by consciousness
#''[[Ajiva|Ajīva]]''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]''- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''.
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Mokṣha]]'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]],&lt;blockquote&gt;This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''shrardha'' (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Collected papers on Jaina studies | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | editor=Jaini,  Padmanabh | year=2000 | edition=1st | location=Delhi | pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:
# Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous "Divine Entity" in Jainism)
# Jainism advocates that a soul attracts ''karmic'' matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a ''karma-bandha'' or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing [[Ratnatraya]] (The Three Jewels): ''samyak darśana'' (Right Faith), ''samyak jnāna'' (Right Knowledge) and ''samyak charitra'' (Right Conduct).
# In Jain theology, a soul is released of worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the "karma-bandha".&lt;ref name="FN2M"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=From Nigoda to Moksa: The Story of Marudevi | encyclopedia=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini | publisher=Asian Humanities Press (an imprint of Jain Publishing Company) | author=Jaini, Padmanabh S. | editor=Qvarnström, Olle | year=2003 | volume=I | location=Fremont CA | pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, ''nirvana'' and ''moksha'' are used interchangeably. ''Nirvana'' represents annihilation of all ''karmas'' by an individual soul and ''moksha'' represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage). In the presence of a ''Tirthankara'', a soul can attain ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience) and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.&lt;ref name="FN2M" /&gt;
# The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Even the ''Tirthankaras'' themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state.
# Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.&lt;ref&gt;Sancheti Asoo Lal, Bhandari Manak Mal – First Steps to Jainism (Part Two): Doctrine of Karma, Doctrine of Anekant and Other Articles with Appendices – Catalogued by [[Library of Congress|Library of U.S. Congress]], Washington, Card No. 90-232383&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in other traditions==
===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], all living beings are described as being under the influence of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'s'' three qualities. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, ''[[jiva]]s'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called "karma". The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the Gurbani's ([[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) law of karma. Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm Gurbani.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shintoism===
Interpreted as ''Musubi'', a view of karma is recognized in [[Shintoism]] as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shinto: A Celebration of Life|author=Aidan Rankin|pages=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8UWWZPxw4C&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Karma is an important concept in [[Taoism]]. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.&lt;ref name=evawong/&gt;

The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages.&lt;ref name=lkohn&gt;Livia Kohn (1998), [http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf Steal holy food and come back as a Viper - Conceptions of Karma and Rebirth in Medieval Daoism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109063052/http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf |date=9 January 2014 }}, Early Medieval China, 4, pp 1-48&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (''ming''). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.&lt;ref name=lkohn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher (1980), Buddhist influence on early Taoism, T'oung Pao, Vol. 66, pp 84-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falun Gong===
Ownby (2008) claims that Falun Gong differs from [[Buddhism]] in its definition of the term "karma" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term "''de''" or "virtue" is reserved for what might otherwise be termed "good karma" in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as "bad karma". Li says, "A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma."&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falun Gong]] teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as samsara&lt;ref name=TRAN&gt;Transcending the Five Elements and Three Realms, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html Zhuan Falun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609043918/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html |date=9 June 2011 }}, accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to the accumulation of karma.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;Transformation of Karma, Zhuan Falun Lecture 4, accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one's continued rebirth and suffering.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt; Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt;

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of "one reaps what one sows". Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a "system of transmigration", though, "in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived." Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;!-- Ownby 2008 p.110 --&gt; In the same vein of Li's [[monism]], matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Li says that "Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings." He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a "setting of delusion", and return. "That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed."&lt;ref name=ZFLII&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm Zhuan Falun, Volume II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023901/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm |date=21 August 2011 }}, published 1996, translated June 2008, accessed 2008-06-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent "opposition to practitioners' taking [[medication|medicine]] when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the [[illness]] through cultivation." [[Benjamin Penny]] shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that "karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people", Penny asks: "if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?"&lt;ref name=Fellow&gt;[[Benjamin Penny]], Canberra, 2001, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present and Future of Falun Gong, A lecture by Harold White Fellow, Benjamin Penny, at the National Library of Australia], accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that "What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking". Li also states that "An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick."&lt;ref&gt;Lectures in United States, 1997, Li Hongzhi&lt;/ref&gt; Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says "It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not."&lt;ref name=schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, ''Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?'', Akashic books: New York, 2001, pp. 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
===Free will and destiny===

One of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the [[moral agency]] problem;&lt;ref name=wrkaufman&gt;Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;[Moral responsibility] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University (2009); Quote - "Can a person be morally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explained solely by reference to physical states of the universe and the laws governing changes in those physical states, or solely by reference to the existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinely ordained path?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts:&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt; (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma:  he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his "wicked" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma? (2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate? (3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education--because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur (1976), The Problem of Evil in Indian Thought, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Macmillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold: (1) The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent - good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried. (2) Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others. (3) Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (see [[moral evil]] versus [[natural evil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reichenbach, Bruce (1990), The Law of Karma, University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|978-0333535592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (''Cetanā'') and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb&gt;Matthew Dasti and Edwin Bryant (2013), Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199922758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological indeterminacy===
Another issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere.&lt;ref name=goerl&gt;G. Obeyesekere (1968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, Practical religion, Editor: E.R. Leach, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; That is, (1) if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and (2) if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong {{en dash}} such as sickness or failure at work {{en dash}} the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.&lt;ref name=goerl/&gt;

This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

===Transferability===
Some schools of Asian religions, particularly Popular Theravada Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Charles Keyes (1983), Merit-Transference in the Kammic Theory of Popular Theravada Buddhism, In Karma, Editors: Charles Keyes and [[Valentine Daniel]], Berkeley, University of California Press;
* F.L. Woodward (1914), The Buddhist Doctrine of Reversible Merit, The Buddhist Review, Vol. 6, pp 38-50&lt;/ref&gt; Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with [[substitutionary atonement]] and vicarious punishment. It defeats the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.

In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, pp 226, see Footnote 74&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools in Hinduism, such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The problem of evil===
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the [[problem of evil]] and related problem of [[theodicy]]. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs:&lt;ref&gt;R Green (2005), Theodicy, in The Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition (Editor: Lindsay Jones), Volume 12, MacMillian Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate ([[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]), and (2) That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent). The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, "why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?" Max Weber extended the problem of evil to Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber (Translated by Fischoff, 1993), The Sociology of Religion, Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807042052}}, pp. 129-153&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2007), Karma’s suffering: A Mimamsa solution to the problem of evil, in Indian Ethics (Editors: Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pp. 171-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Kumarila’s ‘‘Slokavarttika’’; for English translation of parts and discussions: P. Bilimoria (1990), ‘ Hindu doubts about God {{en dash}} Towards a Mimamsa Deconstruction’, International Philosophical Quarterly, 30(4), pp. 481-499&lt;/ref&gt; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in ''Sribhasya''.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt; Epics such as the Mahabharata, for example, suggests three prevailing theories in ancient India as to why good and evil exists {{en dash}} one being that everything is ordained by God, another being karma, and a third citing chance events (''yadrccha'', यदृच्छा).&lt;ref name=ehudson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manmatha Nath Dutt (1895), English translation of The Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 159, verse 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata, which includes Hindu deity Vishnu in the form of Krishna as one of the central characters in the Epic, debates the nature and existence of suffering from these three perspectives, and includes a theory of suffering as arising from an interplay of chance events (such as floods and other events of nature), circumstances created by past human actions, and the current desires, volitions, dharma, adharma and current actions (''purusakara'') of people.&lt;ref name=ehudson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bailey (1983), Suffering in the Mahabharata: Draupadi and Yudhishthira, Purusartha, No. 7, pp. 109-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2001), Rethinking the Mahabharata: A Reader's Guide to the Education of the Dharma King, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226340531}}, Chapters 2 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, while karma theory in the Mahabharata presents alternative perspectives on the problem of evil and suffering, it offers no conclusive answer.&lt;ref name=ehudson&gt;Emily Hudson (2012), Disorienting Dharma: Ethics and the Aesthetics of Suffering in the Mahabharata, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199860784}}, pp. 178-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.B. Mehta (2007), The ethical irrationality of the world {{en dash}} Weber and Hindu Ethics, in Indian Ethics (Editors: Billimoria et al.), Volume 1, Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pp. 363-375&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347-364&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P. Bilimoria (2013), Toward an Indian Theodicy, in The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil (Editors: McBrayer and Howard-Snyder), 1st Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-0470671849}}, Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, particularly of the Nyaya school of Hinduism and Sankara in ''Brahmasutra bhasya'', have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person's environment given that person's karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach (1989), Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 135-149&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;P. Singh, Sikh perspectives on health and suffering: A focus on Sikh theodicy, in Religion, Health and Suffering (Editors: John Hinnells and Roy Porter), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710306111}}, pp. 111-132&lt;/ref&gt; In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with [[dharma]] and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt; In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.&lt;ref name=bilimoria/&gt;

Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Kaufman (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.&lt;ref&gt;Chadha and Trakakis (2007), Karma and the Problem of Evil: A Response to Kaufman, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp. 533-556&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to "Christian notions of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and its effects."&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meadow|first=Mary Jo|title=Christian Insight Meditation|date=28 August 2007|publisher=Wisdom Publications Inc|isbn=9780861715268|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that the Christian teaching on a [[Last Judgment]] according to one's charity is a teaching on karma.&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"/&gt; Christianity also teaches morals such as [[wikt:reap what one sows|one reaps what one sows]] ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:7) and [[live by the sword, die by the sword]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma, rhythmic return to harmony|author=Haridas Chaudhuri|pages=78 and 79|quote=The Meaning of Karma in Integral Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ve_Nim-MChcC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, however, consider the concept of Last Judgment as different from karma, with karma as an ongoing process that occurs every day in one's life, while Last Judgment, by contrast, is a one-time review at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Collyer Knox and Horace Leland Friess, The Review of Religion, Volume 1, Columbia University Press, pp 419-427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
There is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew ''midah k'neged midah'', which literally translates to "value against value," but carries the same connotation as the English phrase "measure for measure." The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather, in matters of ethics, i.e. how one's actions effects the world will eventually come back to that person in ways one might not necessarily expect.  [[David Wolpe]] compared ''midah k'neged midah'' to karma.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, David.  [https://www.sinaitemple.org/worship/sermons/toldot-training-hands-esau-voice-jacob/ "Drash."] Sinai Temple.  Los Angeles, CA.  18 November 2017.  Drash.  MP3 file.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Jung]] once opined on unresolved emotions and the [[synchronicity]] of karma;
{{Quote|When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. and Wolfgang Pauli, The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche, New York: Pantheon Books, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Popular methods for negating [[cognitive dissonance]] include [[meditation]], [[metacognition]], [[counselling]], [[psychoanalysis]], etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Permanent neuronal changes within the [[amygdala]] and left [[prefrontal cortex]] of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Richard J., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jessica Schumacher, Melissa Rosenkranz, Daniel Muller, Saki F. Santorelli, Ferris Urbanowski, Anne Harrington, Katherine Bonus, and John F. Sheridan. "Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation." Psychosomatic Medicine 65 (2003): 564–70&lt;/ref&gt; This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of [[Individuation]] or [[self-actualisation]]. Such [[peak experiences]] are hypothetically devoid of any karma ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).

=== Theosophy, Spiritism, New Age  ===
The idea of karma was popularized in the [[Western world]] through the work of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] ''law of return'' or ''Threefold Law,'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'

The Theosophist [[I. K. Taimni]] wrote, "Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions."&lt;ref&gt;I.K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Gardner ''Reincarnation: Some Testimony From Nature'' 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''last universal common ancestor''' ('''LUCA'''), also called the '''last universal ancestor''' ('''LUA'''),  '''cenancestor''', or (incorrectly&lt;ref group=R&gt;There is a common misconception that definitions of LUCA and progenote are the same; however, progenote is defined as an organism “still in the process of evolving the relationship between genotype and phenotype”, and it is only hypothesed that LUCA is a progenote.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gogarten|first1=Johann Peter|last2=Deamer|first2=David|title=Is LUCA a thermophilic progenote?|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=1|date=25 November 2016|page=16229|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;) '''progenote''', is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now [[Life|living on Earth]] have a [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theobald DL |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–22 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20463738 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T}}&lt;/ref&gt; LUCA is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the [[first living organism on Earth]], but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. 

While there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by [[phylogenetic bracketing|comparing the genomes of its descendants]], all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 [[gene]]s inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many [[co-adapted]] features, including [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] mechanisms to convert information between [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725" /&gt; However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="GogartenDeamer2016" /&gt;

LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the [[Paleoarchean]] [[era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doolittle WF|date=February 2000|title=Uprooting the tree of life|journal=Scientific American|volume=282|issue=2|pages=90–95|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|pmid=10710791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Glansdorff N, Xu Y, Labedan B|year=2008|title=The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner|journal=Biology Direct|volume=3|issue=|page=29|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-29|pmc=2478661|pmid=18613974}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few hundred million years after the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence of life on Earth]], for which there are several candidates.

[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, saying, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=C. |year=1859 |title=[[The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]] |page=490 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have separated the problem of the [[origin of life]] from that of the LUCA.

{{further information|Phylogenetic bracketing}}

By [[phylogenetic bracketing|analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups]], the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of [[DNA]] floating freely within the cell, like modern [[bacteria]]. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, [[Carl Woese]] ''et al.'', who first proposed the currently-used [[Three-domain system|three domain system]] based on an analysis of &lt;!--the 16S --&gt;[[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a "...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1990 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=2112744 |pages=4576–79 |volume=87 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 |first=C.

While the gross anatomy of LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.&lt;ref name=W1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wächtershäuser |first1=Günter |year=1998 |title=Towards a Reconstruction of Ancestral Genomes by Gene Cluster Alignment |journal=Systematic and Applied Microbiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=473–74, IN1, 475–77 |doi=10.1016/S0723-2020(98)80058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |title=What is Life? |first=Michael |last=Gregory |publisher=Clinton College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20071213110350/http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=The universal nature of biochemistry |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=805–08 |date=January 2001  |pmid=11158550 |pmc=33372 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wächtershäuser, G. |title=From pre-cells to Eukarya – a tale of two lipids |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=13–22 |date=January 2003  |pmid=12492850 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genetic code]] was most likely based on DNA,&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Patterns In Palaeontology: The first 3 billion years of evolution |first=Russell J. |last=Garwood |year=2012 |journal=Palaeontology Online |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=1–14 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2012/patterns-in-palaeontology-the-first-3-billion-years-of-evolution/ |accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies suggest that LUCA may have been defined wholly through [[RNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael  |last=Marshall |title=Life began with a planetary mega-organism

 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four [[nucleotide]]s: [[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]], and [[deoxyguanosine]]. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[enzyme]], [[DNA polymerase]]. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and  [[DNA repair|repair]] enzymes including [[DNA topoisomerase]] and [[DNA ligase]]. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as [[histone]]s. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide [[codons]] which redundantly coded for 20 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;
If the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide [[thymidine]] was replaced by [[uridine]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The genetic code was expressed into [[protein]]s. These were assembled from free [[amino acid]]s by [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of a [[messenger RNA]] via a mechanism of [[ribosome]]s, [[transfer RNA]]s, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big [[50S]] and a small [[30S]].  Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by [[ribosomal protein]]s. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 [[amino acids]] were used, only in [[Chirality (chemistry)|L-isomers]], to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein [[enzymes]] catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The cell contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane.

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, Albermarle Street. 1859. pp. 484, 490.&lt;/ref&gt; The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one..."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"/&gt;

When the LUCA was hypothesized, [[cladogram]]s based on [[genetic distance]] between living cells indicated that [[Archaea]] split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high [[salinity]], [[temperature]] or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the [[black smoker|deep ocean vents]], where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the [[Eukaryota]] than to the [[Bacteria]], although many details are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xie, Q. |author2=Wang, Y. |author3=Lin, J. |author4=Qin, Y. |author5=Wang, Y. |author6=Bu, W. |title=Potential key bases of ribosomal RNA to kingdom-specific spectra of antibiotic susceptibility and the possible archaeal origin of eukaryotes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29468 |year=2012 |pmid=22247777 |pmc=3256160 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029468|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729468X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yutin, N. |author2=Makarova K.S. |author3=Mekhedov S.L. |author4=Wolf, Y.I. |author5=Koonin, E.V. |title=The deep archaeal roots of eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1619–30 |date=August 2008  |pmid=18463089 |pmc=2464739 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding segments]]. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the [[Paleoarchean|Paleoarchean Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egel|first1=Richard|title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life|journal=Life|date=March 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=170–212|doi=10.3390/life2010170|pmc=4187143|pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the [[Chargaff's rules|AT/GC]] rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.

In an earlier hypothesis, [[Carl Woese]] (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through [[horizontal gene transfer]] among an ancient community of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woese C |title=The universal ancestor |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6854–59 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9618502 |pmc=22660 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6854 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6854W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved.&lt;ref name="majortransinevolution"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Major Transitions in Evolution | last=Maynard Smith | first=John | authorlink=John Maynard Smith |first2=Eörs |last2=Szathmáry |author2link=Eörs Szathmáry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1995 | location=Oxford, England | isbn=0-19-850294-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.

Ground-breaking research by [[William F.

'''Leslie William "Les" Coffelt''' (August 15, 1910 &amp;ndash; November 1, 1950) was an officer of the [[White House Police Force|White House Police]], who was killed while successfully defending [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] against an armed attack on November 1, 1950 at [[Blair House]], where the president was living during renovations at the White House.

Coffelt was wounded during the [[Truman assassination attempt|assassination attempt]], which two [[Puerto Rican independence movement|Puerto Rican nationalists]] carried out. Though mortally wounded by three bullets, Coffelt returned fire moments later and killed one of the attackers with a single shot to the head. The other was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to death; Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and the man was released from jail in 1979.

Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rico's status, Truman authorized a [[Puerto Rican constitutional referendum, 1952|referendum in Puerto Rico in 1952]] to determine its relationship to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hunter| first1 = Stephen| authorlink = Stephen Hunter| last2 = Bainbridge, Jr.

==Personal life==
Leslie Coffelt was born to Will Coffelt and Effie Keller in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] town of [[Oranda, Virginia]]. His siblings were Harry, Hollis, Norman, and Mildred. He grew up [[hunting]] and handling [[firearm]]s. Coffelt was the second in his family to graduate from [[high school]], and he was described by those who knew him as an expert [[sharpshooter]]. He grew up to be a quiet, good-humored man who was well liked.{{fact|date=September 2016}}

Coffelt met and fell in love with Chessie Elinor Morgan of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]], who was training to become a [[nurse]]. Coffelt and Morgan were married on October 5, 1937, in [[Prince George's County]], [[Maryland]]. They moved into an apartment in Washington. Coffelt was also a Freemason and a member of Potomac Lodge #5 F.A.A.M. in Georgetown, Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cornwell|first1=David|title=Potomac Lodge #5 F.A.A.M.|url=https://www.facebook.com/potomaclodge/photos/pcb.660645497437292/660643260770849/?type=3&amp;theater|website=facebook.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1928, Coffelt left Oranda to look for a job in [[Washington, D.C.]], and became a police officer with the [[Metropolitan Police Department]] in 1929. He was assigned to Precinct 3, which ran the length of [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]]. In 1936, he resigned to become a building technician.

In 1941, Coffelt returned to the Metropolitan Police. In 1942 he requested and was awarded a transfer to the White House Police.

That year, as the US entered World War II, Coffelt was drafted and assigned to B Company, [[300th Infantry]] [[Regiment]], [[United States Army]]. Coffelt served less than two years and never made it overseas; the Army gave him a medical discharge. In 1945, he returned to duty with the White House Police.

On November 1, 1950 would-be assassins [[Griselio Torresola]] and [[Oscar Collazo]], Nationalists who supported the independence of Puerto Rico from the [[United States]], attacked officers at the [[Blair House]] in order to assassinate President Truman. He was living there because of a major renovation at the [[White House]] for structural problems.

Torresola approached from the west side while Collazo engaged Secret Service agents and White House policemen from the east. Torresola approached the guard booth at the west corner of the Blair House and fired at Coffelt from close range. His three shots struck Coffelt in the chest and abdomen, mortally wounding him. A fourth shot passed through the policeman's tunic.

Torresola shot two other policemen before running out of ammunition, then moved to the left of the Blair House steps to reload. Coffelt went out of his booth and fired at Torresola from 31 feet away, hitting him behind the ear and killing him instantly. Coffelt limped back to the booth and blacked out. He died of his wounds four hours later in a hospital.

==Aftermath==
President Truman wrote in a letter a short time later:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm sorry I didn’t get to talk to you and (cousin) Nellie at the dinner or after it. But I'm really a prisoner now.

&lt;br/&gt;...The grand guards who were hurt in the attempt on me didn't have a fair chance. The one who was killed was just cold bloodedly murdered before he could do anything. But his assassin did not live but a couple of minutes – one of the S.S. ''(Secret Service)'' men put a bullet in one ear and it came out the other...

&lt;br/&gt;The S.S. chief said to me, "Mr. President, don't you know that when there's an Air Raid Alarm you don't run out and look up, you go for cover." I saw the point but it was over then.

&lt;br/&gt;Hope it won't happen again. They won't let me go walking or even cross the street on foot. I say 'they' won't, but it causes them so much anguish that I conform ... But I want no more guards killed. - Letter from Truman to his cousin, Ethel Noland, dated November 17, 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVVffTwVVy4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Off the Record: The Private Papers of Harry S.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Coffelt's Tomsbstone.jpg|thumb|350px|Coffelt's tombstone at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]
Coffelt's widow, Cressie E. Coffelt, was later asked by the President and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to go to Puerto Rico, to accept the condolences and expressions of sorrow for her husband's death from various Puerto Rican leaders and crowds. Mrs. Coffelt made a speech acknowledging that the island's people were not responsible for the acts of Collazo and Torresola.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Oscar Collazo was convicted and sentenced to death in federal court; Truman [[pardon|commuted]] the sentence to life imprisonment. Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a [[Puerto Rican constitutional referendum, 1952|plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952]] to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hunter| first1 = Stephen| last2 = Bainbridge, Jr. | first2 = John  | year = 2005| title = American Gunfight: The Plot To Kill Harry Truman&amp;nbsp;– And The Shoot-Out That Stopped It| publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster| location = New York| pages=4, 251| isbn = 978-0-7432-6068-8| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people voted to continue as a Free Associated State, as established in 1950.

Private Coffelt was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on November 4, 1950 in Section 17, Site 17719-59. His [[epitaph]] reads, "White House Policeman: Who Gave His Life in Defense of the President of the United States During an Assassination Attempt at the Blair House, Washington, D.C."  To this day, Coffelt is one of only four Secret Service members to take a bullet while defending the President, the others being Donald Birdzell and Joseph Downs, who were wounded during the same incident, and [[Tim McCarthy]]. McCarthy was wounded in the abdomen by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] during the [[Ronald Reagan assassination attempt]]. Coffelt is still the only Secret Service member to have been killed whilst defending a U.S. President.

A plaque at the Blair House commemorates Coffelt's sacrifice, heroism, and fidelity to his duty and his country. The day room for the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service's Uniformed Division]] at the Blair House is named for Coffelt as well.

In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] commuted Collazo's sentence to time served, and granted the man release. Collazo returned to Puerto Rico, where he died in 1994.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

"Many of you know me as a legendary boxer, and I'm proud of that," he said. "However, that journey was not always easy. When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I had no one to depend on except myself. I realized that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In July 2017, after his controversial defeat to [[Jeff Horn]], Pacquiao said: "I love this sport and until the passion is gone, I will continue to fight for God, my family, my fans and my country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manny Pacquiao: Jeff Horn defeat will not stop legend fighting|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/40579411|publisher=BBC|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional career===
[[File:Pacquiao - PBA-Kia Sorento player.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Pacquiao warming up before a game]]

On April 17, 2014, Pacquiao announced his intentions to join the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] as the playing coach of [[Kia Sorento (PBA team)|Kia Motors Basketball team]], an incoming expansion team for the PBA's [[2014–15 PBA season|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ph.news.yahoo.com/pacquiao-picks-17-pba-jersey-number-185521218.html Manny Pacquiao will play at the PBA, picks jersey no. 17]. sports.yahoo.com.ph (November 3, 2010).

He previously played in the semi-professional basketball league, [[Liga Pilipinas]], for the MP-Gensan Warriors, a team that he also owns. He made his debut in the Smart-Liga Pilipinas Conference II in January 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = Pacquiao can't deliver KO punch for GenSan | publisher = Manila Bulletin Online | date = January 16, 2009 | url = http://96.31.84.32/node/194795 | accessdate = May 16, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120709080351/http://96.31.84.32/node/194795 | archivedate = July 9, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decision, he was criticized by others specifically online by [[netizens]], saying that Pacquiao could not handle boxing together with [[basketball]]. Pacquiao stated, "It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what they are saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolante|first1=Mikkel|title=Amid criticism, Manny Pacquiao insists: 'I can coach, play for Kia in PBA'|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/amid-criticism-manny-pacquiao-insists-i-can-coach-play-for-kia-in-pba|website=Interaksyon.com|publisher=Sports5|accessdate=May 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526014439/http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/amid-criticism-manny-pacquiao-insists-i-can-coach-play-for-kia-in-pba|archivedate=May 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 9, 2014, he submitted his application for the upcoming [[2014 PBA draft|rookie draft]] to the commissioner's office. His camp also hopes that the board of governors "respect" his request to be not drafted until Kia's turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PacMan Sasali na sa Rookie Draft (PacMan will pursue going into the rookie draft)|url=http://pba.inquirer.net/47501/pacman-sasali-na-sa-rookie-draft|website=pba.inquirer.net|publisher=Philippine Basketball Association and INQUIRER.net|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pacquiao-apply-pba-drafty Boxing gym to sit next to basketball court as Manny Pacquiao prepares for Kia role, Algieri title defense], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacquiao also owns a team in the [[PBA Developmental League]] (PBA D-League), the MP Hotel Warriors, which debuted in the league's 2014–15 season. He was briefly a co-owner of the [[Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas]] (now known as [[Pilipinas MX3 Kings]]), an [[Asean Basketball League]] team. As well as the founder of [[Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/06/13/from-humble-origins-gensan-mpbl-now-nation-wide-league-42890&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kia Picanto (2014–2017)====
Pacquiao was picked 11th overall in the first round of the [[2014 PBA draft]] by the [[Mahindra Enforcer|Kia basketball team]], being the oldest rookie to be drafted in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kia selects Manny Pacquiao with 11th overall pick |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/376188/sports/basketball/2014-pba-draft-kia-selects-manny-pacquiao-with-11th-overall-pick |website=GMAnews.com |publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] |accessdate=August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2015, Pacquiao tallied his first career point after making a shot in the free-throw on a match they won against the then-[[Purefoods Star Hotshots]]. He never scored again in the game in five minutes of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manny Pacquiao scores first career point in the PBA against Purefoods|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/440379/manny-pacquiao-scores-first-career-point-in-the-pba-against-purefoods/story/|website=gmanetwork.com/news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2016, Pacquiao scored a career-high four points in a 97-88 victory against the [[Blackwater Elite]], also sinking the first three-point field goal in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sacamos|first1=Karlo|title=image: http://www.spin.ph/assets/images/www/v2/follow_us/follow_us.jpg   BASKETBALL PBA With surprise three-pointer, Manny Pacquiao surpasses his PBA career high|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/manny-pacquiao-knocks-down-three-pointer-to-surpass-career-total|website=spin.ph|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pacquiao was supposedly lined-up for the Senate Defenders basketball team in the [[UNTV Cup]] Season 5, but decided that he will not play in the tournament due to his existing contract as a player and coach of Mahindra Enforcer in the PBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/pacquiao-wont-play-in-untv-cup-pineda/282425/|title=Pacquiao won't play in UNTV Cup – Pineda|publisher=[[The Manila Times]]|last=Ramos|first=Josep T.|date=August 27, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, when Pacquiao's three-year rookie deal as a player with the Picanto expired, the team didn't renew his contract again. Speculations swirled about Pacquiao possibly signing with the [[Blackwater Elite]] after its owner Dioceldo Sy said in an interview that he offered Pacquiao a roster spot and a coaching job. Four weeks later, his coaching contract with the Kia Picanto also expired, effectively making him available in the free agent market both as a coach and a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Gerry|title=Manny Pacquiao parts ways with Kia, stays mum on next PBA step amid offer to join Blackwater|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/manny-pacquiao-parts-ways-with-kia-stays-mum-on-next-pba-step-amid-offer-to-join-blackwater|website=spin.ph|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Pacquiao took his first lead role in Violett Films' ''Lisensyadong Kamao'' (Licensed Fist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lisensyadong kamao (2005)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478701/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is titled so because (according to director Tony Bernal), being a boxer, Pacquiao is licensed to use his hands.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2008, Pacquiao starred with [[Ara Mina]] and [[Valerie Concepcion]] in ''Anak ng Kumander'' (Son of Commander). The movie was not a commercial success and was panned by critics.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Upon the expiration of his contract with ABS-CBN, Pacquiao signed with [[GMA Network]] as an actor in September 2007.

In 2012, American actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] was reportedly in talks with Pacquiao over co-starring in one of Stallone's future films.

==Controversy==

===Tax evasion case===
On November 26, 2013, a few days after Pacquiao's victory over [[Brandon Rios]], the Philippine [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) issued a freeze order on all of Pacquiao's Philippine bank accounts due to his alleged failure to pay [[Philippine peso|₱]]2.2 billion in taxes for earnings he made in his fights in the United States from 2008 to 2009. A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao's Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for non-resident alien payment by his [[Top Rank|promoter]] to the BIR's US counterpart, the [[Internal Revenue Service]], as well as a letter from [[Bob Arum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/337272/economy/moneyandbanking/pacquiao-shows-us-tax-document-but-bir-says-it-has-no-proof-of-payment|title=Pacquiao shows US tax document but BIR says it has no proof of payment|work=gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case. The BIR had maintained that taxes were due even if all taxes had been paid to the IRS in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/04/18/17/pacquiao-says-he-wants-to-end-p22-b-tax-case|title=Pacquaio says he wants to end P2.2-B tax case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Pacquiao, in a video statement posted by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], made a comment on the issue of same-sex marriage.

Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with [[Max Kellerman]]. Pacquiao's promoter [[Bob Arum]] stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008, causing even more confusion as Pacquiao, now facing a lawsuit, had just previously stated that he suffered the injury during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/05/arum-says-pacquiao-has-had-shoulder-injury-since-2008/|title=Arum says Pacquiao has had shoulder injury since 2008|work=Boxing News 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such caste-based councils are common in the inner regions of several Indian states, including Haryana, [[Punjab]], western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and parts of [[Rajasthan]], and have been operating with government approval for years.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; In any event, the state government expressed no concern about the ruling of the ''khap panchayat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-04-04/india/28143211_1_village-in-kaithal-district-khap-jat-community|title='Marriage, murder, judgment, it was all wrong'|last=Sengupta|first=Nandita|date=4 April 2010|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khap panchayat's ruling was based on the assumption that Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala [[gotra]], a [[Jat]] community, and were therefore considered to be siblings despite not being directly related and any union between them would be invalid and [[incestuous]]. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.&lt;ref name=ht&gt;{{cite journal|date=14–27 July 2007 |title=All for 'honour' |journal=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |volume=24 |issue=14 |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2414/stories/20070727003103500.htm |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412144515/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2414/stories/20070727003103500.htm |archivedate=12 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=the_australian&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/india-at-odds-as-caste-culture-turns-to-killing/story-e6frg6so-1225849033844|title=India at odds as caste culture turns to killing |date=3 April 2010|first=Amanda|last=Hodge|publisher=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a [[Karnal]] district court sentenced the five perpetrators to be executed, the first time an Indian court had done so in an honour killing case.

==Background==
Manoj's and Babli's families lived in Karoran Village, [[Kaithal]].

==Development of the relationship and subsequent marriage==

In 2005, Manoj and Babli began to show interest in each other.&lt;ref name=Lohumi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100326/haryana.htm#1|title=6 of girl's kin held guilty |first=Bhanu P.|last=Lohumi|work=[[Tribune Company]]|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=3 May 2010|location=Karnal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manoj was four years older than Babli.

She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. If I did walk into the room while they were talking, Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning." She continued, "I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other. I asked her to dissuade Babli or quickly marry her off before word of their dalliance spread."&lt;ref name=Gayatri&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100331/khapdiktat.htm#3|title=A love story with a full stop|first=Geetanjali|last=Gayatri|date=30 March 2010|work=Tribune Company|publisher=The Tribune|accessdate=4 April 2010|location=Kaithal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, on 5 April 2007, Chanderpati last saw Manoj. "He ate his food and left to sleep at the shop since he had a class XII compartment exam in English to take the next day. Unlike other days, next morning, he did not show up." The following day Babli's uncle arrived to speak with Manoj. According to Chanderpati, "He said he had come to recover some money that Manoj had borrowed, had tea and left when I told him that Manoj was away for an exam. We only discovered late in the evening that Babli, too, was missing and the two had run away." Manoj had eloped with Babli to [[Chandigarh]] and married her on 7 April at a [[Durga]] temple, their commitment to one another transcending their willingness to abide by societal norms.&lt;ref name=Gayatri/&gt;

Furious with the marriage, Babli's family asked for intervention from the local ''khap panchayat'',&lt;ref name=NDTV/&gt; which annulled the marriage.&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt; The ''khap'' also announced a social boycott on Manoj's family. Anyone who kept ties with them would be fined [[Indian rupees|Rs.]] 25,000.&lt;ref name=joshi/&gt;&lt;ref name=indiatoday/&gt; Ompati tried to persuade her family that Babli did nothing dishonourable and that she and Manoj would move back home soon.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;

The couple's bus left for Delhi, but ''en route'' at 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm, Babli's relatives stopped the bus near Raipur Jatan village, about {{convert|20|km|mi|}} from Pipli.

Also, few honour killing cases went to court, and this was the first case in which the groom's family in an honour killing filed the case.&lt;ref name=the_australian/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=thehindu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/indian-honour-killing-men-face-death-20100331-rcqo.html|title= Indian 'honour killing' men face death |date=31 March 2010|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to the press, former Home Minister Chidambaram slammed the ''khap panchayats'', asking tersely, "Who are these khap panchayats?

Surat Singh, director of the Haryana Institute of Rural Development, [[Nilokheri]], anticipated that the verdict will end the diktats of ''khap panchayats''. The ''khaps'' had never worried before because their "political bosses refrained people from acting against them. With this verdict, those who try to impose a medieval order on society will think twice".&lt;ref name=indiatoday/&gt; Political analyst Ranbir Singh agreed that the judgement will "act as a deterrent".&lt;ref name=indiatoday/&gt; Additional [[Advocate General#India|Advocate General]] Arun Walia hailed the decision: "before passing ruthless judgments, the members will surely take note of this decision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/245899/Verdict-a-deterrent-for-%E2%80%98Taliban-style-courts%E2%80%99.html |title=Verdict a deterrent for 'Taliban-style courts' |date=31 March 2010 |publisher=[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)|The Pioneer]] |accessdate=16 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616065909/http://www.dailypioneer.com/245899/Verdict-a-deterrent-for-%E2%80%98Taliban-style-courts%E2%80%99.html |archivedate=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chanderpati===
Days after the verdict, a ''[[The Times of India]]'' headline hailed Chanderpati, who struggled years for justice, as "Mother Courage" for having done "what even top politicians and bureaucrats have shied away from doing—taken on the dreaded khap panchayats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-04-01/india/28136711_1_khap-panchayat-karnal-sessions-court-chandrapati|title=Mother courage: She took on khaps to avenge son, bahu|last=Bhatia|first=Ramaninder K.|author2=Sukhbir Siwach|date=1 April 2010|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanderpati now lives with her two daughters and remaining son under the protection of two policemen.

After the court judgement, state authorities began to take on the ''khap panchayats'', and consequently, many village [[sarpanch]]es (village heads) supporting these councils were suspended.&lt;ref name=TOI2/&gt; Top Jat leader and former minister [[Randeep Surjewala|Shamsher Singh Surjewala]] said, "The diktats and fatwas issued by so-called gotra khaps on breaking of marriages and other similar issues would lead to 'Talibanisation' of society as such decisions were illegal and against the constitution."&lt;ref name=diktat/&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-30/chandigarh/28132980_1_khap-panchayats-khap-leaders-illegal-bodies|title=Law tightens noose around khaps|first=Sukhbir|last= Siwach|date=30 March 2010|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=The Times Group|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2010, in a [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] session, Chidambaram proposed a bill that included "public stripping of women and externment of young couples from villages and any 'act which is humiliating will be punished with severity{{'"}} in the definition of honour killing&lt;ref name=Faraz/&gt; and that would "make khap-dictated honour killings a distinct offence so that all those who participate in the decision are liable to attract the death sentence".&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt; He insinuated that the proposed law would place the "onus of proof on the accused".&lt;ref name=Faraz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100806/nation.htm#1|title=Law on honour killings soon: PC|last=Ahmad|first=Faraz|work=Tribune Company|publisher=The Tribune|date=5 August 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-24/india/28311582_1_honour-killings-karnal-court-khap-leader|title=Haryana against honour killing law|first=Sukhbir|last= Siwach|date=24 August 2010|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=The Times Group|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2010 ''[[The Times of India]]'' article anticipated that the bill would not pass in the monsoon session of Parliament in the same year.&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt;

'''Mukesh Chand Mathur''' (22 July 1923 – 27 August 1976), better known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Mukesh''', was an Indian playback singer. Mukesh is considered to be one of the most popular and acclaimed playback singers of the [[Hindi film industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance |last= Gopal |first= Sangita |author2=Sujata Moorti |year= 2008 |publisher= University of Minnesota Press|isbn= 0-8166-4579-5 |page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema'' by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen.

Mukesh was also popular as being the voice of actors [[Raj Kapoor]], [[Manoj Kumar]], [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]], [[Sunil Dutt]] and [[Dilip Kumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/mukesh-remembering-the-singer-with-the-midas-touch/story-kTGymf56kD6so2K4tL0dDO.html|title=Mukesh: Remembering the singer with the midas touch |author=Rohit Vats|website=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mukesh was born in [[Delhi]] in [[Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdul Jamil Khan |title=Urdu/Hindi: An Artificial Divide: African Heritage, Mesopotamian Roots, Indian Culture &amp; Britiah Colonialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nH1HBxdA1UIC&amp;pg=PA316 |year=2006 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=978-0-87586-438-9 |pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIsBeVv1qDE&amp;t=884|title=Exclusive : Neil Nitin Mukesh &amp; Nitin Mukesh In Conversation With Karan Thapar|date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Zorawar Chand Mathur, an engineer, and Chandrani Mathur. He was the sixth in a family of ten children. The music teacher who came home to teach Mukesh's sister, Sundar Pyari, found a pupil in Mukesh, who would listen from the adjoining room. Mukesh left school after the 10th grade and worked briefly for the Department of [[Public Works]].  He experimented with voice recordings during his employment in Delhi and gradually developed his singing abilities and also his musical instrumental skills.

==Singing career==
Mukesh's voice was first noticed by [[Motilal Rajvansh|Motilal]], a distant relative, when he sang at his sister's wedding. Motilal took him to [[Mumbai]] and arranged for singing lessons by Pandit Jagannath Prasad. During this period Mukesh was offered a role as an actor-singer in a Hindi film, ''Nirdosh'' (1941). His first song was "Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To" as an actor-singer for ''Nirdosh''. He got his break as a playback singer for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film ''Pehli Nazar'' with music composed by [[Anil Biswas (composer)|Anil Biswas]] and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri. The first song that he sang for a Hindi film was "Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De".

Mukesh was such a fan of singer [[K. L. Saigal]] that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/mukesh-remembering-the-singer-with-the-midas-touch/story-kTGymf56kD6so2K4tL0dDO.html|title=Mukesh: Remembering the singer with the midas touch|last=Vats|first=Rohit|date=27 August 2014|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=17 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/mukesh.html|title=Famous Indians – Mukesh|last=|first=|date=|website=iloveindia.com|publisher=|access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song "Dil Jalta Hai...", he remarked, "That's strange, I don't recall singing that song".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director [[Naushad Ali]], who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film ''[[Andaz (1949 film)|Andaz]]''. Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of [[Dilip Kumar]] in this movie and [[Mohammed Rafi]] sang for [[Raj Kapoor]]. He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: ''Anokhi Ada'' (1948), ''[[Mela (1948 film)|Mela]]'' (1948), ''[[Andaz (1949 film)|Andaz]]'' (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in hit songs like "Jeevan Sapna toot gaya" were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar-Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose [[Mohammed Rafi|Rafi]] as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. Mukesh recorded highest number of songs for Shankar Jaikishan ie 133 songs followed by kalyanji Anandji ie 99 songs. Out of 4 Filmfare awards, Mukesh won 3 awards for Shankar Jaikishan songs 

In 1974, Mukesh received [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]] for the song "Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai" from ''[[Rajnigandha]]'' (1974), and [[Filmfare Award]]s for the songs "Sab Kuch Seekha Humne" in the movie ''Anari'' (1959), "Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai" in ''Pehchaan'' (1970), "Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki" in ''Beimaan'' (1972) (all the three songs composed by Shankar Jaikishan) and "[[Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein]]", the title song of film ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976) (composed by Khayyam). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to his failing health due to his worsening heart problem.

Mukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo after Shankar Jaikishan. From "Naina hai jadoo bhare..." ''Bedard Zamana Kya Jane'' (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and "Main hoon mast madari..." ''[[Madari]]'' (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to "Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo" ''[[Darinda/ 1977]]'', the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like "Chhalia mera naam...", "Mere toote hue dil se...", "Dum dum diga diga" ''[[Chalia]]''(1959), "Mujhko iss raat ki tanhai mein..." ''[[Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere]]'' (1960),  "Hum chhod chale hain mehfil ko..." (Ji Chahta Hai), "Humne tumko pyar kiya hai jitna..." (Dulha Dulhan), "Chal mere dil lehraake chal..." ''[[Ishara]]'' and "Dheere se chalo..." ''[[Johar Mehmood in Goa]]'',"Main to ek khwab hoon..." and "Chand si mehbooba ho..." ''[[Himalay Ki Godmein]]''(1965), "Waqt kartaa jo wafaa..." ''[[Dil Ne Pukara]]'',"Deewanon se yeh mat poocho..." ''[[Upkar]]'', "Khush raho har khushi hai..." ''[[Suhaag Raat]]'' and "Humsafar ab yeh safar kat jaayega..." ''[[Juari]]'',  "Chandi ki deewaar..." and "Le chal le chal mere jeevan saathi..." ''[[Vishwas]]'' (1969),  "Koi jab tumhara hriday tod de..." ''[[Purab Aur Paschim]]'', "Darpan ko dekha..." ''[[Upaasna]]'', "Jo tumko ho pasand..." ''[[Safar]]'' and "Mujhe nahin poochni tumse beeti baatein..." ''[[Anjaan Raahein]]'' (1970).

Out of the numerous songs he gave his voice to, "Kahin door jab din dhal Jaaye" from ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]''(1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|wTqcXXRANkw|Kahin Door Jab Din Dhal Jaaye – Mukesh – Anand 1970 HD}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ek Pyaar ka Nagma hai" from ''[[Shor (film)|Shor]]'' (1972), "Maine Tere Liye Hi Saat Rang Ke" from [[Anand (1970 film)|''Anand'']] (1972), "Sab Kuch Seekha Humne" from ''[[Anari]]'' (1959), "Jeena yahan marna yahan" and "Kehta hai Joker" from ''[[Mera Naam Joker]]'' (1971) are the most popular among his fans and followers.&lt;ref name="Movie Madaari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemadaari.in/2016/07/mukesh-ki-kahaani-unsung-singing-legend-hindi-cinema/|title=Mukesh Ki Kahaani-Story of the most unsung singing legend of Hindi Cinema|last=Ganguly|first=Souvik|date=22 July 2016|website=Movie Madaari|publisher=|access-date=| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002011919/http://www.moviemadaari.in/2016/07/mukesh-ki-kahaani-unsung-singing-legend-hindi-cinema/| archivedate=2 October 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an actor and producer==
Mukesh started his career as an actor singer in the film ''Nirdosh'' in 1941, with Nalini Jaywant as his heroine. His second film was ''Adab Arz'' in 1943. He played a guest role in Raj Kapoor's film ''Aah'' in 1953.  He acted as a hero in the film ''Mashooka'' in 1953, opposite Suraiya and in the film ''Anurag'' (1956) (he was also the co-producer and composer in the film), opposite [[Usha Kiran]] and ''Mridula Rani''. Mukesh also produced a film ''Malhar'' (1951) with hero Arjun &amp; heroine Shammi with Darling Films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006715/bio Mukesh].

== Appreciation ==

Mukesh was a favourite of renowned Indian spin-bowler [[Bhagwath Chandrasekhar]]. When the sound of a Mukesh song drifted to the pitch, Chandrasekhar's acknowledgement of the tribute would bring a roar from the crowd. [[Sunil Gavaskar]] wrote that sometimes he hummed a Mukesh tune on the field to inspire Chandra. Chandra's passion affected team-mates [[Syed Kirmani|Kirmani]], [[Gundappa Viswanath]], and even some journalists.&lt;ref name="Suresh Menon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1125092/coffee-with-chandra | title=Coffee with Chandra | publisher=[[ESPN Cricinfo]] | work=The Cricket Monthly | date=6 November 2017 | accessdate=7 November 2017 | author=Menon, Suresh| authorlink = Suresh Menon (sports writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google commemorated Mukesh on his 93rd birthday anniversary in 2016.

==Personal life==
Mukesh married Sarla Trivedi Raichand, daughter of Raichand Trivedi. Sarla's father was a millionaire. With no proper house, an erratic income and what was then considered in India a supposedly "immoral" profession (singer in movies), the consent of Sarla's father for this marriage could not be obtained and Mukesh and Sarla were forced to elope. They got married in a temple in [[Kandivali]] on 22 July 1946, Mukesh's 23rd birthday, with the help of the actor [[Motilal Rajvansh|Motilal]] and from the residence of R. D. Mathur. Everyone made dire predictions of unhappy days and divorce, but both weathered the lean days and celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary on 22 July 1976, four days before his departure for the USA. The couple had five children – Rita, the singer [[Nitin Mukesh|Nitin]], Nalini (d. 1978), Mohnish and Namrata (Amrita). The actor [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] is a grandson of Mukesh (son of Nitin).{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Death==
Mukesh died of a heart attack on 27 August 1976 in [[Detroit, Michigan]], US, where he had gone to perform in a concert. That morning, he got up early and went to take a shower. He came out panting and complaining of chest pains. He was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead. The rest of the concert was completed by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and surprisingly his son [[Nitin Mukesh]] . His body was flown to India by [[Lata Mangeshkar]], where a grand funeral ceremony was held in the presence of several actors, with personalities of the [[Indian film industry]] and fans paying tribute. When news of his death reached [[Raj Kapoor]], he burst into tears, and remarked, "I have lost my voice,"{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} which is a testimony to the association of Mukesh's voice (in playback) to the immensely popular songs of Raj Kapoor's films. A famous song of the 50's featured on Bharat Bhushan ''Aa laut ke aa ja mere meet'' is another example of his earlier melodies, as is ''Dil tadap tadapke keh raha hai'', picturised on Dilip Kumar.

After Mukesh's death, his newer, hitherto unreleased, songs were released in 1977 in films such as ''[[Dharam Veer (1977 film)|Dharam Veer]]'', ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'', ''Khel khiladi ka'', ''Darinda'' and ''Chandi sona''. The year 1978 also featured a considerable number of Mukesh's songs in films such as ''Aahuti'', ''Paramatma'', ''Tumhari kasam'' and ''Satyam Shivam Sundaram'', where Mukesh sang his last film song ''Chanchal sheetal nirmal komal'' for [[Raj Kapoor]]'s younger brother, [[Shashi Kapoor]]. From 1980 onward, Mukesh's voice was heard in many later released films such as ''Shaitan mujarim'', ''Premika'', ''Patthar se takkar'' (1980), ''Sanjh ki bela'', ''Maila anchal'' (1981), ''Aarohi'' (1982), ''Chor mandali'' (1983), ''Nirlaj'' (1985), ''Love and God'' (1986), ''Shubh chintak'' (1989), and his last known release of ''Chand grahan'' (1997).

'''Mohammad Nasir Hussain Khan''' or '''Nasir Hussain''' (16 November 1926 – 13 March 2002) was an [[Indian film]] producer, director and screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adieu:Nasir Husain – HUM KISISE KUM NAHEEN (1977)|url=http://www.screenindia.com/old/20020322/ftribute.html |date= |publisher=[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a career spanning decades, Hussain has been credited as a major trendsetter in the history of [[Hindi cinema]]. For example, he directed ''[[Yaadon Ki Baraat]]'' (1973), which created the [[Bollywood]] [[masala film]] genre that defined Hindi cinema in the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote and produced ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'' (1988), which set the Bollywood [[Musical film|musical]] [[Romance film|romance]] template that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Ray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chintamani"/&gt; Akshay Manwani wrote a book on Hussain's cinema titled ''Music, Masti, Modernity:  The Cinema of Nasir Husain''.&lt;ref name="Manwani"/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Hussain first worked with Qamar Jalalabadi when he joined [[Filmistan]] as a writer in 1948. The famous films he wrote for Filmistan include ''[[Anarkali (1953 film)|Anarkali]]'' (1953), ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955), and ''[[Paying Guest]]'' (1957). Filmistan was the breakaway studio from [[Bombay Talkies]]; it used mid-budget formula productions and sold on star value and music. [[Sashadhar Mukherjee]] was a part of the breakaway team, and he gave Hussain ''[[Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957 film)|Tumsa Nahin Dekha]]'' to direct. The film made a star of [[Shammi Kapoor]].

Kapoor and Hussain made another hit, ''[[Dil Deke Dekho]]'' (1959), for Filmalaya, the breakaway group of Filmistan. The film introduced [[Asha Parekh]], who would be the lead in all of Hussain's films until ''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'' (1971).  He was also in a long romantic relationship with her, but it ended because he was already a married man with two children, and Parekh didn't want to be labeled a homewrecker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/i-was-enamoured-by-nasir-saab-asha-parekh-21139.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Hussain's wife was Margaret Francina Lewis, an assistant choreographer he met at Filmistan.  They married and then she changed her name to Ayesha Khan.  She worked as an assistant choreographer on some of his productions.&lt;ref name="Manwani"&gt;Manwani, Akshay. ''Music, Masti, Modernity:  The Cinema of Nasir Hussain''.  HarperCollins Publishers India. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  He outlived his wife.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/mar/13nasir.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Own production===
Hussain then set up Nasir Hussain Films and turned producer-director. He made musical hits like ''[[Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai]]'' (1961), ''[[Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon]]'' (1963), ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' (1966), ''[[Baharon Ke Sapne]]'' (1967), ''[[Pyar Ka Mausam]]'' (1969), ''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'' (1971), ''[[Yaadon Ki Baraat]]'' (1973), and ''[[Hum Kisise Kum Naheen]]'' (1977).

Hussain, [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], and [[R.D. Burman]] collaborated on ''Teesri Manzil'', ''Baharon Ke Sapne'', ''Pyar Ka Mausam'', ''Caravan'', ''Yaadon Ki Baraat'' and ''Hum Kisise Kum Naheen''.

Hussain wrote and produced the musical cult hit ''Teesri Manzil''. [[Vijay Anand (Hindi film maker)|Vijay Anand]] directed the film, which starred Hussain's regular actors Shammi Kapoor and Asha Parekh. Originally Dev Anand was signed for the film but due to differences with Hussain he opted out and Kapoor was cast.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Shammi Kapoor to CNN IBN telecast after his death, on 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also hired [[R.D. Burman]] for the first time to compose the songs ("O Haseena Zulfonwali", "O Mere Sona Re", "Deewaana Mujhsa Nahin", "Tumne Mujhe Dekha", "Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyaar Tera").  After the songs became evergreen hits, Burman would compose for all of Hussain's films for the next 19 years, ending with ''[[Zabardast]]'' (1985).

Hussain's ''Yaadon Ki Baraat'' was written by [[Salim-Javed]], who had written ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' the same year. Both films dealt with the hero wanting to avenge his father's death, and both featured [[Ajit Khan|Ajit]] as the villain. ''Yaadon Ki Baraat'' has been identified as the first [[masala film]].&lt;ref name="bhaumik"&gt;Kaushik Bhaumik, [https://thewire.in/24564/an-insightful-reading-of-our-many-indian-identities/ An Insightful Reading of Our Many Indian Identities], [[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]], 12/03/2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58|title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema’s Greatest Screenwriters|last=Chaudhuri|first=Diptakirti|date=2015-10-01|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin UK]]|isbn=9789352140084|language=en|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late career===
As ''[[Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai]]'' (1981), ''[[Manzil Manzil]]'' (1984) and ''[[Zabardast]]'' (1985) all flopped, Hussain's son [[Mansoor Khan]] took over the reins of Nasir Hussain Films, although Hussain continued to write scripts and dialogues for films like ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'' (1988) and ''[[Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander]]'' (1992). In ''Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak'', he introduced his nephew [[Aamir Khan]] as a hero. ''Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak'' was a milestone in the history of Hindi cinema, setting the template for Bollywood musical romance films that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Ray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ray|first=Kunal|title=Romancing the 1980s|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Romancing-the-1980s/article16898867.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 December 2016|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chintamani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chintamani|first=Gautam|title=Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak: The Film That Revived Hindi Cinema|date=2016|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=9789352640980|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Qayamat_Se_Qayamat_Tak_The_Film_That_Rev.html?id=BZYOvgAACAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussain received a special Filmfare Award in 1996 for his contribution to Hindi cinema.

Hussain died in Mumbai on 13 March 2002 following a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=-HnGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=nasir+hussain+died&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=87kWOCO34R&amp;sig=u5kx-HZYQC1LgLUAs1X9nFxh8lM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn7O_V8uXbAhUC-lQKHUW0BTc4ChDoAQhfMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=nasir%20hussain%20died&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Asha Parekh stated in an interview that she had not seen him the last year of his life, as he became reclusive because of his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiavarta.com/Startrek/Archives.asp?Page=&amp;ID=IEE20020314053551&amp;dt=3/14/2002 indiavarta.com – Startrek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">'''Neuroepistemology''' is an empirical approach to [[epistemology]]—the study of knowledge in a general, philosophical sense—which is informed by modern [[neuroscience]], especially the study of the structure and operation of the [[brain]] involving [[neural networks]] and neuronal epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Neuroepistemology: What the neurons knowledge tries to tell us|author=Zambrano, Yuri|isbn=9781300086703|publisher=Physik'a Publishing, Co. |year=2012 |page=529 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9hHiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] has written about the topic and, in her book ''Brain-Wise'', characterised the problem as "how meat knows".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy |chapter=Epistemology |page=270 |author=Patricia Smith Churchland |isbn=978-0-262-03301-5 |year=2002 |publisher=The MIT Press |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Assumptive framework ==
Menachem Mazabow wrote that it "is necessary... to state the set of assumptions that are seen as fundamental to any neuro-epistemological inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Neuro-epistemology: A Post-modernist Analysis of the Neuro-sciences |author=Mazabow, Menachem, Alban Burke, &amp; Anita Stuart |publisher=Health SA Gesondheid |year=2004 |page=57 |url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/hsa/article/viewFile/10251/2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: 
# The significance of revealing the suppositions which influence one’s behavior (the self-reflexive connection between meaning and behavior).
# The larger socio-politico-historical contextual effects on one’s individual assumptions.
# The power relations deeply rooted in the dominant discourses in a field and their overpowering effect on different modes of thought.
# The unavoidably context-dependent and subjective nature of all concepts, compared to objective systems of validity. 
# The importance of examining embedded assumptions and of concentrating on the association between idea and context.
# The affirmation that appropriate theorizing is a certainty of our nature as language observers and directing theorists in the direction of improving awareness of their fundamental responsibility.
# The assertion that the concept of efficacy, instead of objective validity should be the fulcrum in the evaluation of theory.

== Application ==
Brown has noted the "tacit bias" in any observation, which is rooted in "assumptions on the nature of mind" that shape the research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Preliminaries for a theory of mind |author= Brown, JB |publisher=Goldberg, E ed.1990: Contemporary Neuropsychology: The Legacy of Luria |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Hanlan and Brown, theory does not arise from data alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Micro-genesis: Historical review and current studies. |author1=Hanlan, ER  |author2=Brown, JW.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Ardila, A &amp; Ostrosky, S  eds  Brain organization of language and cognitive processes. |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick has stated that it is impossible to pursue a difficult programme of research in neuroscience without some preconceived ideas, seen as inevitable by Churchland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The astonishing hypothesis: The scientific search for the soul. |author= Crick, F. |publisher=New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a unified science of the mind-brain. |author= Churchland, PS. |publisher=Cambridge: MIT Press. |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein, Brailowsky and Will have opined that such preconceptions about the central nervous system have tended to hamper research in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Brain repair.|author1=Stein, DG |author2=Brailowsky, S. |author3= |author4=Will, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Oxford University Press. |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neurotropic virus''' is a [[virus]] that is capable of infecting [[nerve cells]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/neurotropic Word Reference:  Neurotropic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
A neurotropic virus is said to be '''neuroinvasive''' if it is capable of accessing or entering the [[nervous system]] and '''neurovirulent''' if it is capable of causing disease within the nervous system. Both terms are often applied to [[central nervous system]] infections, although some neurotropic viruses are highly neuroinvasive for the [[peripheral nervous system]] (i.e. [[herpes simplex virus]]). Important neuroinvasive viruses include [[poliovirus]], which is highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive, and [[rabies virus]], which is highly neurovirulent but requires tissue trauma (often resulting from an animal bite) to become neuroinvasive. Using these definitions, herpes simplex virus is highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system and rarely neuroinvasive for the central nervous system, but in the latter case may cause [[herpesviral encephalitis]] and is therefore considered highly neurovirulent. Many [[Arbovirus|arthropod-borne]] neurotropic viruses, like [[West Nile virus]], spread to the brain primarily via the [[blood system]] by crossing the [[blood-brain barrier]] in what is called [[Viremia|hematogenous dissemination]].

== Examples ==
Neurotropic viruses that cause infection include [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese Encephalitis]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis]], and [[California encephalitis virus|California encephalitis]] viruses; [[polio]], [[Coxsackie A virus|coxsackie]], [[Echovirus|echo]], [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[influenza]] and [[rabies]], as well as diseases caused by members of the family [[Herpesviridae]] such as [[herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex]], [[varicella-zoster]], [[Epstein–Barr]], [[cytomegalo]] and [[HHV-6]] viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =9103870 |author= Hotta H. | volume=55 | issue=4 | title=[Neurotropic viruses--classification, structure and characteristics]. | date=Apr 1997 | journal=Nihon Rinsho | pages=777–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those causing latent infection include herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses. Those causing slow virus infection include [[measles virus]], [[rubella]] and [[JC virus|JC]] viruses, and [[retrovirus]]es such as [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] 1 and [[human immunodeficiency virus]].

== Research use ==
Neurotropic viruses are increasingly being exploited as research tools, and for their potential use in treatment. In particular, they are being used to improve the understanding of the nervous systems circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HpJFw-qCp1kC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=%22brain+research%22+%22Neurotropic+viruses%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CPqSJaELyf&amp;sig=49VIL4syJ1ibYCPn07vt9RkR5Jg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QAvGS8rvNYTisQPmu9m2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brain%20research%22%20%22Neurotropic%20viruses%22&amp;f=false Advances in Virus Research, Volume 55, Karl Maramorosch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/74/8/1016.abstract Neurovirological methods and their applications, P G E Kennedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other neurotropic infections ==
Several diseases, including [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]], [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] resemble a slow neurotropic virus infection&amp;mdash;but are, in fact, caused by the infectious proteins known as [[prions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =9103870 |author= Hotta H. | volume=55 | issue=4 | title=[Neurotropic viruses--classification, structure and characteristics]. | date=Apr 1997 | journal=Nihon Rinsho | pages=777–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Nicholas Maw''' (5 November 1935 &amp;ndash; 19 May 2009) was a British [[composer]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], Maw was the son of Clarence Frederick Maw and Hilda Ellen Chambers. He attended the [[Wennington School]], a boarding school, in [[Wetherby]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. His mother died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was 14. He attended the [[Royal Academy of Music]] on [[Marylebone Road]] in London where his teachers were [[Paul Steinitz]] and [[Lennox Berkeley]]. He then studied in [[Paris]] with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and [[Max Deutsch]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/arts/music/20maw.html|title=Nicholas Maw, British Composer, Dies at 73 |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Allan Kozinn]]|date=19 May 2009| accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 until 2008, Maw served on the faculty of the [[Peabody Institute]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he taught [[music composition]].&lt;ref name="opera"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/issue/article.aspx?id=5286&amp;issueID=336|title=Obituaries: Composer Nicholas Maw dies at seventy-three; voice teacher Richard Miller; scholar William Ashbrook; veteran singers Eric Garrett and Robert Nagy.| work=[[Opera News]]| author= | date= August 2009 |volume=74 |issue=2 | accessdate= 30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously served on the faculties of [[Yale University]], [[Bard College]], [[Boston University]], the Royal Academy of Music, [[Cambridge University]], and [[Exeter University]].

===Personal life===

In 1960, Maw married Karen Graham, and they had a son and a daughter. Their marriage was dissolved in 1976. He took up residence in [[Washington, DC]] in 1984, living there with his companion Maija Hay, a ceramic artist, until his death.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He died at home on 19 May 2009, at age 73, as a result of [[heart failure]] with complications from [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

On Sunday 6 November 2011, [[BBC Radio 3]] broadcast a 2-hour tribute called, "Nicholas Maw: A Celebration". The program featured performances of Maw's Violin Concerto, an orchestral suite drawn from his opera, ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'', and two choral works (''One foot in Eden still, I stand'' and ''Hymnus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vl51 |title=Sunday Concert: Nicholas Maw: A Celebratio |publisher=BBC Radio 3 |date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositions==
Maw is best known for ''Scenes and Arias'' (1962) for three female voices and orchestra, the orchestral pieces ''Odyssey'' (1987) and ''The World in the Evening'' (1988), the guitar work ''Music of Memory'' (1989) and a violin concerto (1993) written for [[Joshua Bell]]. His music has been described as [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-romantic]] but also as [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] and [[atonal|non-tonal]] (for instance ''Personæ'', his cycle of piano pieces).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In 2002 an opera, ''Sophie's Choice'' (based on [[William Styron]]'s [[Sophie's Choice (novel)|novel]]), was [[contract|commissioned]] by [[BBC Radio 3]] and the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. It was premièred at the Royal Opera House under the [[Conducting|direction]] of Sir [[Simon Rattle]], and afterwards received a new production by stage director [[Markus Bothe]] at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] and the [[Volksoper Wien]], which had its [[North America]]n premiere by the [[Washington National Opera]] in October 2006. Mezzo-soprano [[Angelika Kirchschlager]], who sang Sophie in London, reprised the title role at the National Opera, joined by American baritone [[Rod Gilfry]] as Nathan Landau, the schizophrenic man who initially rescues Sophie and then persuades her to join him in a [[suicide pact]]. Maw also prepared a concert suite for orchestra based on the music.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

A performance of ''Odyssey'' took place in BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] on 9 December 2005, and was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 two days later. [[Simon Rattle]] has also conducted a recording of the work with the [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

People in societies with a high power distance are more likely to conform to a hierarchy where "everybody has a place and which needs no further justification".&lt;ref name="GH-1" /&gt; In societies with a low power distance, individuals tend to try to distribute power equally. In such societies, inequalities of power among people would require additional justification.&lt;ref name="GH-1" /&gt;

==Development and studies on the theory==

===Geert Hofstede===

====Cultural dimensions theory====
Hofstede, the famous business anthropologist, developed the [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|cultural dimensions theory]], used widely as a crucial framework for cross-cultural communication. It is the earliest theory that could be quantified and used to explain perceived differences between cultures and has been applied extensively in many fields, especially in cross-cultural psychology, international business, and cross-cultural communication. It was driven by the statistical procedure (also called 'factor analysis') to make the development, based on the result of a global survey of the values of IBM employees conducted  from 1967 and 1973. Hofstede's theory identified six dimensions of culture, which are power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, short-term vs long-term orientation, and indulgence vs self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An Interview with Geert Hofstede|last = Hoppe|first = Michael|date = Feb 2004|journal = The Academy of Management Executive (1993–2005)|volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75–79|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power Distance Index (PDI) ====
The Power Distance Index is designed to measure 'the extent to which power differs within the society, organization and institutions (like the family) are accepted by the less powerful members'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Hofstede|first = Geert H.|year = 1997|title = Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind |edition=second |location = New York |publisher = McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-707474-6|page= 27}} Originally published in 1991 as ''Cultures and organizations: software of the mind: intercultural cooperation and its importance for survival''.&lt;/ref&gt; It indicates the level of power distance and dependent relationships in a country by assigning a score to each country. The PDI also represents society's level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. As Hofstede stressed, there is no absolute value and PDI is useful only as a method to compare countries.&lt;ref name="Velo-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Velo|2011|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede derived the power distance scores for three regions and fifty countries from the answers given by IBM employees in the same type of positions to the same questions. The detailed steps to calculate the PDI is as follows:

1. Prepare three survey questions:
* How frequently, in their experience, are they afraid to express disagreement with their managers? (mean score on a 1-5 scale from &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;very frequently' to 'very seldom')&lt;ref name="GHH-25"&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstede|1997|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinates' perception of their boss's actual decision-making style (percentage choosing either the description of an autocratic or of a paternalistic style, out of four possible styles plus a 'none of these alternatives')&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
* Subordinates' preference for their boss's decision-making style (percentage preferring an autocratic or a paternalistic style, or, on the contrary, as type based on majority vote, but not a consultative style)&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
2. Pre-code the answers so that they are represented by a number (e.g. 1,2,3,4...)

3. Compute the mean score for the answers of equal sample of people from each country or percentage for choosing particular answers

4. Sort the questions into groups which are called clusters or factors by using a statistical procedure

5. Add or subtract the three scores after multiplying each with a fixed number

6. Add another fixed number
* '''Lower PDI Culture: '''Low PDI cultures: In lower PDI cultures, the emotional distance is relatively small. There are more democratic or consultative relations between expecting and accepting power. People are relatively interdependent to the power holders, and there is relatively low inequality of power distributed among the people. Under these circumstances, the decentralized authority and flat management structure is common though not universal. It means that both managers and subordinates will, on average, be relatively less concerned with status, and the distribution of decision-making responsibility is extensive. Thus, the 'open door' policy is more easily used then elsewhere, which means the individuals in superior positions are not only more likely to be open to listen to those in inferior positions, but subordinates are also more likely to be willing to challenge or give suggestions to their superiors. For example, in this culture, if one wants to get a promotion, one would prefer to get their ideas across to their boss directly. Examples of countries with low PDI are the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Nordic countries.&lt;ref name="Smit"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Smit, Chris |date=26 April 2012 |title = Power Distance or PDI|url = http://culturematters.com/power-distance-or-pdi/|website = culturematters.com|accessdate =14 September 2015}} (self-published)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High PDI Cultures:''' These are cultures in which the power relations are paternalistic and autocratic, and where there is centralized authority. In other words, there is a wide gap or emotional distance which is perceived to exist among people at different levels of the hierarchy. There is considerable dependence of people on power holders, which, in psychology, is known as counter-dependence (denounce, but with negative sign). In the workplace, the subordinates are willing to accept their inferior positions. The boss, in turn, may be not asked for broad participation in the process of decision making. Thus, unlike in lower PDI cultures, the 'open door' policy has been replaced by an autocratic leadership style, which means subordinates may be unlikely to approach and contradict their bosses directly.&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt; For instance, even though employees may want to be promoted, it is entirely their boss's decision and they have no say in it.  Generally, countries with high power distance cultures hold that there is nothing wrong with inequality and thus, everyone could be in specific positions. Additionally, people in higher positions  usually display and promote the use of status symbols: powerful individuals would not eat lunch at the same cafeteria as people in lower positions, and there are large numbers of supervisors who are entitled to special privileges, for example. Belgium, France, Malaysia, and the Arab World can be regarded as examples of countries or regions with high PDI cultures.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

==== Limitation of Hofstede's model on power distance ====
Hofstede's study made a great contribution to the establishment of the research tradition in cross-cultural psychology. However, limitations still exist.

Firstly, each stage of the research process reappears as a political act of neutralization—of making the unneutral seem neutral. The questionnaire reflects a large power distance: its questions were explicitly designed to resolve the normative concerns of researchers. To further explain, it primarily served the concerns of those who needed to do comparative analysis and created it through "coercing a culturally distinct axis of comparison" on a variety of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ailon|first = Galit|year=2008 |title =Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Culture's consequences in a value test of its own design|journal = Academy of Management Review |doi=10.2307/20159451 |jstor=20159451 |volume=33 |pages=885–904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the questionnaire adopted an obviously western methodology to analyze non-western countries and it is also relatively selective in representing the inequality within the western countries. For example, the PDI concentrated on the boss and subordinate relationship, which could be seen as biased, as it ignores other forms of western inequality. Apparently, the questions failed to measure  the racial, colonial, and broader class inequalities which should be taken into account into the  measurement of power distance.

===Other notable studies===

====Early studies====

=====Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter=====
In the middle of the last century, Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter&lt;ref name="Haire"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haire|first1=Mason|last2=Ghiselli|first2=Edwin E. |last3=Porter|first3=Lyman W. |title=Managerial Thinking: An international study |series=Research program of the Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California |publisher=Wiley|location=New York |oclc=925871372}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the differences in preferences for power among different cultures with remarkable outcomes, even though they did not mention the concept of power distance. The methodology they adopted was by questionnaire, which was based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs with some modification. The aim of the questionnaire was to evaluate how managers from 14 countries were satisfied regarding their needs when they were in their current positions. The dimensions that were linked to power distance across cultures in their questionnaire were autonomy and self-actualization.
Autonomy
* The authority that comes with their management position.
* The degree to which independent thinking and action are allowed in their management positions.

Self-Actualization
* The chance for personal progress and advancement in management positions.
* The sense of self-achievement one derives from being in a management position.
* The sense of achievement from being in a management position.

In accordance with the responses to the questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive ones mean greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative ones mean lesser satisfaction. Their results are presented in Table 1.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
|{{harvnb|Haire|1966}} || Autonomy || Self-Actualization
|-
| Nordic European || .36 || .25
|-
| Latin European || -.16 || .23
|-
| Anglo American || -.14 || -.09
|-
| Developing || -.25 || -.11
|-
| Japan || -.25 || -.11
|}

Upon the figures listed in the table, some implications are drawn. They are complicated, and summarized as follows:
– Nordic-Europeans who were surveyed were extremely contented with the satisfaction of their desire for power;
– Anglo-Americans were rather discontented; and
– the other clusters desired more power than they currently had in their positions

One important implication from this study is that countries can be clustered according to their preference for power. Besides this, some of their differences can be explained by the influence of the following factors: the predominant religion or philosophy, an established tradition of democracy, the long-term existence of a middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in each country.

=====Mulder=====
Another major study of power distance was the one that was undertaken by Mauk Mulder.&lt;ref name="Mulder"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mulder|first1=Mauk |year=1977 |title=The Daily Power Game |series=International series on the quality of working life |publisher=Martinus Nihoff Social Sciences Division|location=Leiden, the Netherlands |isbn=978-1-4684-6953-0 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder's laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek “power distance reduction”.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; He found that:
# More privileged individuals tend to try to preserve or to broaden their power distance from  subordinates.
# The larger their power distance is from a subordinate, the more the power holder would try to increase that distance.
# Less powerful individuals try to decrease the power distance between themselves and their superiors.
# The smaller the power distance, the more likely is the occurrence of less powerful individuals trying to reduce that distance.

From these findings, he concluded that a condition of quasi-equilibrium had arisen. In this condition, power holders have achieved a certain distance from people who lack power, and this distance is hard for the powerless to bridge.

====After Hofstede – The GLOBE Study====
Following Hofstede,&lt;ref name="Hofstede-2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert H. |year=2001 |title=Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviours, institutions and organisations across nations |publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California |edition=second |isbn=978-0-8039-7323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GLOBE project defined "power distance" as “the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be shared unequally.”&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is different from the definition of "power distance" used by other authors, see {{harvnb|Mulder|1977}}, as the relative difference in power between the powerful and the powerless.&lt;/ref&gt; Power distance was then further analyzed as one of the nine cultural dimensions explained in the “Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness” (GLOBE) Research Program, which was conceived in 1990 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=House|first1=Robert J.|last2=Hanges|first2=Paul J. |last3=Javidan|first3=Mansour|last4=Dorfman|first4=Peter W.|last5=Gupta|first5=Vipin |year=2004 |title=Culture, Leadership, and Organizations The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-0-7619-2401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the major premise that leader effectiveness is contextual, the research was conducted by believing that the social and organizational values, norms and beliefs of those who are being led are closely connected to the effectiveness of the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoppe|first1=Michael H. |year=2007 |title=Culture and Leader Effectiveness: The GLOBE Study |url=http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/globesummary-by-michael-h-hoppe.pdf|website=Inspire!Image!Innovate!|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLOBE measures the practices and values that exist at the levels of industry (financial services, food processing, telecommunications), organization (several in each industry), and society (62 cultures).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are presented in the form of quantitative data based on responses of about 17,000 managers from 951 organizations functioning in 62 societies throughout the world, which shows how each of the 62 societies scores on nine major attributes of cultures, including Power Distance, and six major global leader behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding power distance, GLOBE researches cultural influences on power distance values, practices and other aspects, including 'Roots of Power Distance', 'The Psychological Stream and Power' and 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance'. It also investigates how family power values are taught, and makes a comparison of high versus low power distance societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance', four primary factors affecting a society's level of power distance are explained separately, and they are the predominant religion or philosophy, the tradition of democratic principles of government, the existence of a strong middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in a society's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the four fundamental phenomena, there always exists connections; however, it is concluded that a society's main beliefs, values, and religion, will have the strongest and longest lasting influence on power distance. Then, this will be moderated by a democratic tradition and the existence of a strong middle class to some extent. Moreover, the two factors are both expected to affect narrowing power distance. Therefore, for a Roman Catholic society, which is exposed to democracy and a middle class, would be on the way to narrowing power distance. Though its level of power distance could be reduced over time, it would still be higher than a Protestant country, which has a democratic tradition and a large middle class. Finally, a large proportion of immigrants in a given society makes the low power distance trend stronger in all circumstances presented above. In addition, it is concluded that regardless of religion, any society that does not have a tradition of democracy or a significant middle class will have a substantially high power distance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and effects ==
Power distance is such a significant dimension in cross-cultural environments that it is unconsciously influencing people's behaviour in different countries, which contributes to so–called 'cultural norms'. These 'cultural norms', shaped by perceptions and acceptance of power inequality to a certain degree, lead to various reactions when facing same situations or in the same environment. However, there are some consequences resulting from acquiescence in inequality in organizations and societies, especially for high power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt;

=== The workplace ===

==== Effects on management style ====
In organisations with high power distance, employees acknowledge their lesser standing, and are respectful and submissive towards their superiors; who in turn, are more likely to give orders rather than consult with their employees while making decisions. Status symbols are often displayed and flaunted. Employers or managers would not have meals together with their subordinates, and might have private facilities such as rooms, parking lots, and elevators. Having a high level of education is important to climb the corporate ladder, and the higher-ranking members of the organization are often paid much more than their employees in comparison with companies with lower power distance.&lt;ref name="Velo"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Veronica|last=Velo |year = 2011|title = Cross-Cultural Management |location = New York |publisher = Business Expert Press |isbn = 978-1-60649-350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in businesses with low power distance, bosses are not as concerned with status symbols and would be more open to employee discussion and participation. Employees are less submissive to their superiors, and are more likely to make themselves heard or to challenge the management.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

==== Effects on employees' behaviour of help seeking ====
In high power distance regions, people in the higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors with more rights of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kirkman B.

It is a common phenomenon that junior employees turn to their seniors for help and advice when getting into a new environment. Yet, some researchers recently attested that employees and junior staff from high power distance countries are less likely to seek help from their supervisors.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt; One of the reasons is that lower ranking staff have few chances and time to meet the high ranking managers in person. The hierarchical system is far more sophisticated and restricted that subordinates are usually only able to reach their immediate supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Lonner|first1=Walter J. |last2=Berry |first2=John W. |last3=Hofstede |first3=Geert H. |year=1980 |title=Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research Reference in Entrepreneurship }} [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496209 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is widely believed that the action of asking for help is equivalent to incompetence or lack of ability, which subdues themselves into an unfavourable circumstance. What is worse is that some of the supervisors who are incapable of solving more complicated problems will become suspicious of his or her subordinates, regarding the problems as a challenge to their status and capabilities, or even as humiliation from the lower ranking staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee |first=Fiona |year=2002 |title=The Social Costs of Seeking Help |journal=The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=17–35 |doi=10.1177/0021886302381002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such climates have gradually reinforced employees to think that it is more effective and efficient to deal with difficulties by themselves, rather than talking to their managers. The indisputability of power and authority widens the gap between different levels, while the acceptance of inequality consolidates the endurance among the bottom, stopping the subordinates seeking help from the top.

There is another main perspective that leads to a larger gap between the supervisors and subordinates. In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks rather than human beings that are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bochner S. |author2=Hesketh B. | year = 1994 | title = Power distance, individualism/collectivism, and job-related attitudes in a culturally diverse work group | url = http://doi.org/czwm4x | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 233–257 | doi=10.1177/0022022194252005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, task orientation emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since there is a lack of communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinates' willingness of seeking help from supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madlock P. E. | year = 2012 | title = The influence of power distance and communication on Mexican workers | url = http://doi.org/3d2 | journal = International Journal of Business Communication | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 169–184 | doi=10.1177/0021943612436973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.&lt;ref name="Ji"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ji, Yang |author2=Zhou, Erhua |author3=Li, Caiyun |author4=Yan, Yanling  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title=Power Distance Orientation and Employee Help Seeking: Trust in Supervisor as a Mediator |journal=Social Behaviour &amp; Personality: An International Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1043–1054 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2015.43.6.1043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In charitable behaviour ===
According to research, people from high power distance countries are generally less responsible towards charitable behaviours than people from low power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Winterich"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Winterich, Karen Page  |author2=Zhang, Yinlong  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014 |title= Accepting Inequality Deters Responsibility: How Power Distance Decreases Charitable Behavior |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=274–293 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Winterich/publication/262403906_Accepting_Inequality_Deters_Responsibility_How_Power_Distance_Decreases_Charitable_Behavior/links/0c9605379fd62f31c2000000.pdf |subscription=yes |doi=10.1086/675927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for this phenomenon is that the rooted perception and acceptance of inequality somehow blinds their eyes to any unfair or inappropriate situations, which they may consider as a normal social circumstance and simply accept it rather than making a change.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1976 |title=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=13 |issue=3  |pages=303–308 |jstor=3150746 |doi=10.2307/3150746 }} republished from {{Cite book|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1975 |chapter=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |title=Advances in Consumer Research, Volume 2 |editor=Schlinger, Mary Jane |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |publisher=Association for Consumer Research|pages=21–32 |url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=5742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Festinger Leon |author2=Carlsmith James M | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulatively, the more inequality they accept, the less inconformity they will notice, and the less responsibilities they will take eventually. The consequence is high power distance enlarging the gap between human beings in terms of relations and wealth conditions. Conversely, people in low power distance countries are more sensitive towards any unequal phenomena. Their unacceptance of dissonance endows them with a greater sense of responsibility for adjusting or correcting the problems in person.&lt;ref name="Cummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger" /&gt;

==== Influence of controllable/uncontrollable needs ====
The types of needs are influencing people's charitable behaviour regardless of their power distance backgrounds. The needs generated are classified into controllable and uncontrollable categories, where the occurrence of the former is due to lack of effort while the occurrence of the latter is due to unforeseeable events such as natural disasters. The ability of whether individuals are able to control the situations affects how they will react to the raising needs.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancourt |first=Hector |year=1990 |title=An Attribution–Empathy Model of Helping Behavior: Behavioral Intentions and Judgments of Help-Giving |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=573–591|doi=10.1177/0146167290163015 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brickman, Philip |author2=Rabinowitz, Vita Carulli |author3=Karuza, Jurgis, Jr. |author4=Coates, Dan |author5=Cohn, Ellen |author6=Kidder, Louise  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1982 |title=Models of Helping and Coping |journal=American Psychologist |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=368–384 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.4.368}} [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ262702 ERIC number EJ262702]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shaver, Kelly G. |year=1985 |title=The Attribution of Blame: Causality, Responsibility, and Blameworthiness |location=New York |publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-96120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, the level of power distance does have an influence over a society's reaction towards controllable needs. People with high power distance background perceive most of the issues as rightful inequality, hence are reluctant to get themselves involved with 'troubles', and therefore most of the time they choose to turn a blind eye on such petty things. Conversely, low power distance societies are intolerant with unfairness and thus their higher sense of responsibility motivates people to make an effort in eliminating dissonance in every possibility.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt; Yet, there seems to be an exception. It is found that people are not sympathetic at all to those in trouble due to internal-controllable reasons. In other words, it is most likely that people reckon those who are lazy, careless, greedy or indulgent, deserve such hardship and punishment, instead of giving a hand to them to go through the difficulties.&lt;ref name="Skitka"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Skitka, Linda J. |author2=Tetlock, Philip E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1992 |title=Allocating Scarce Resources: A Contingency Model of Distributive Justice |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=491–522 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(92)90043-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, even if there is an evident unequal phenomenon emerging, the willingness of charitable behaviours are attenuated to the least in both high and low power distance countries.

On the other hand, people tend to be more responsible in terms of uncontrollable needs, whereby they are more willing to offer aid to. It is assumed that people consider that the aid for uncontrollable needs will not greatly change societal rightful inequality, and hence generous assistance and help will be offered to those in need regardless of power distance background.&lt;ref name="Betancourt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skitka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karasawa"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karasawa, Kaori |year=1991 |title=The Effects of Onset and Offset Responsibility on Affects and Helping Judgments |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=482–499 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00532.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerner Melvin J. |author2=Reavy Patricia | year = 1975 | title = Locus of Control, Perceived Responsibility for Prior Fate, and Helping Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90029-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, a sense of duty is more likely to be raised, where people tend to undertake charitable behaviours.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

==== Influence of communal/exchange relationship norms ====
The relationship norms behind the needs also affect the sense of responsibility. The types of relationships are mainly classified as exchange relationships, in which people are expecting a reasonable privilege or benefit in return for offering aid; and communal relationships, where those giving assistance are wholeheartedly and generously taking care of those in need without any expectation of material return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aggarwal Pankaj |author2=Law Sharmistha | year = 2005 | title = Role of Relationship Norms in Processing Brand Information | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 453–64 | doi=10.1086/497557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Clark, Margaret S. |author2=Ouellette, Robert |author3=Powell, Martha C. |author4=Milberg, Sandra  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1987 |title=Recipient's Mood, Relationship Type, and Helping |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=94–103 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.94 |pmid=3612495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, people are more likely to refuse to aid when encountering needs associated with exchange relationships rather than needs with communal relationships, which has proved to alleviate the influence of power distance belief and increase the willingness and responsibility of assistance.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brockner, Joel |author2=Paruchuri, Srikanth |author3=Idson, Lorraine Chen |author4=Higgins, E.

Therefore, Winterich recommended that charitable organizations in high power distance countries should stress the significance of uncontrollable needs or salient communal relationship norms, through which the populace are more easily motivated to make a difference on social inequality.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

=== Examples of cultures with high and low power distance ===
Malaysia has one of the highest levels of power distance, with a score of 100 on Hofstede's Power Distance Index (PDI).&lt;ref name="GH-2"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

They would perceive hierarchy in organisations as mirroring intrinsic inequalities. Leaders are expected to be autocratic, and to instruct their subordinates on what to do. Malaysian society is often centralised, and opposition to authority is generally not welcomed.&lt;ref name="GH-2" /&gt;

With a PDI score of 11, Austria is one of the countries with the lowest levels of power distance. Austrians believe in independence, equal rights, approachable leaders, that chain of command should only be for convenience, and that supervision should facilitate and empower. Power is typically decentralised, with leaders often consulting or relying on their subordinates. First names are usually used even with superiors, and communication is direct and two-way.&lt;ref name="GH-3"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

== Linked factors ==

=== Climate ===

It has been hypothesized that there is a link between climate and power distance, with societies in warmer climates more likely to have a higher power distance than societies in colder climates. As food and other necessities are relatively easier to come by in warm, comfortable climates, survival is not as difficult, and thus there is no need for rigorous discipline, preparation, or hardship. It has been argued that these conditions would give rise to a situation whereby it is beneficial for strict organisation and direction to come from superiors in order to propel people to cooperate effectively, even if it goes against the will of some people.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

On the other hand, in colder, harsher climates, it is imperative for individuals to have discipline and prudence to work hard and make the right decisions in order to survive. In these societies, if one were to be lazy and rest for a day instead of searching for food, they might not be able to survive. Therefore, self-discipline and restraint is paramount in these climates. With these qualities ingrained in the people, social order does not need to be enforced externally.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

=== Democracy ===

It has been asserted that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where it is not ingrained into the minds of the people since young age that there are unquestionable hierarchies in life that should not be disputed. It has been found that the 'ideological breach between labour and conservatives' is exceedingly polarised in high power distance socieites, while in low power distance cultures, people would tend to try to attain balance between the two extremes in order to avoid damaging and draining conflicts. This is why unions in high power distance cultures are usually formed by corporations or governments, while those in lower power distance societies are usually less 'ideological' and more 'practical'.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

'''''Shenzhou 9''''' ({{zh|s=神舟九号}}) was the fourth manned [[spacecraft]] flight of [[China]]'s [[Shenzhou program]], launched at 18:37:24 [[China Standard Time|CST]] (10:37:24 UTC), 16 June 2012. ''Shenzhou 9'' was the second spacecraft and first manned spacecraft to dock with the [[Tiangong 1]] space station, which took place on 18 June. The Shenzhou 9 spacecraft landed at 10:01:16 CST (02:01:16 UTC) on 29 June in [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. The mission's crew included the first Chinese female astronaut, [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]. The next mission was ''[[Shenzhou 10]]'', which launched on 11 June 2013.&lt;ref name="2point6billion" /&gt;

== History ==
On 12 March 2012, it was announced that the initial crew selection roster for the mission included female astronauts.&lt;ref name="peopledaily" /&gt; The crew were unveiled to the press on 15 June. China's first female [[astronaut]] would be [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]. Liu was selected ahead of her fellow female astronaut prospect [[Wang Yaping]].&lt;ref name="Space.com 2012-06-15" /&gt; This mission also featured the first repeat astronaut, [[Jing Haipeng]], the commander of the mission.&lt;ref name="LFP 2012-06-18" /&gt; Shenzhou 9 was the 9th flight in China's Shenzhou program and the fourth manned spaceflight. The mission's launch was 49 years to the day after that of the first woman in space, cosmonaut [[Valentina Tereshkova]].&lt;ref name="Space.com 2012-06-15" /&gt;

== Mission preparations ==
The Shenzhou 9 spacecraft arrived at [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre]] in the northwestern [[Gobi Desert]] on 9 April 2012 and its carrier rocket, the [[Long March 2F]], arrived on 9 May.&lt;ref name="launch3" /&gt; On 9 June 2012, the Shenzhou 9 spacecraft and its carrier rocket were rolled out to launch pad.&lt;ref name="thehindubusinessline" /&gt; On 12 June 2012 underwent system-wide joint exercises, and final health checks were completed the following day.

=== Expedition Ceremony ===
On June 16, 2012, the Expedition Ceremony was held at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. [[National People's Congress]] Standing Committee Chairman [[Wu Bangguo]] attended the ceremony. The astronauts, [[Liu Wang]], [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]], and [[Jing Haipeng]], rode to the launch tower and turned in the entrance with the assistance of support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2012/06-16/3968395.shtml|script-title=zh:神九发射在即航天员已进入飞船舱内|publisher=中国新闻网|date=2012-06-16|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2012/06-16/3968395.shtml|title = God nine astronauts launch soon enter the spacecraft cabin | publisher = China News net | year = 2012 | language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The Long March 2F rocket was launched on 16 June 2012 at 10:37 UTC.

Shenzhou 9 docked with China's first space lab [[Tiangong-1]] at 06:07 UTC on 18 June, marking China's first manned spacecraft rendezvous and docking.&lt;ref name="NSF 2012-06-18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cmse-2012-06-10/&gt; This docking was remotely controlled from a ground station.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2012-06-24/&gt; After about 3 hours, when the pressures inside the vessels were equalized, Jing Haipeng entered into Tiangong-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/19/content_15510702.htm|title=China successfully completes space docking|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later,  Shenzhou 9 detached from the station and then redocked manually under the control of crew member [[Liu Wang]], making it the first manual docking for the Chinese program.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2012-06-24/&gt;

Shenzhou 9 landed by parachute in [[Siziwang Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]] on 29 June 2012.&lt;ref name=ABCShen&gt;{{cite web |title=China's first female astronaut touches down|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date= 29 June 2012 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-29/chinese-astronauts-return-to-earth/4100648|accessdate= 29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slender Man''' (also known as '''Slenderman''') is a [[fiction]]al [[supernatural]] [[character (arts)|character]] that originated as a [[creepypasta]] [[Internet meme]] created by [[Something Awful]] forums user Eric Knudsen (also known as "Victor Surge") in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/06/03/the-complete-terrifying-history-of-slender-man-the-internet-meme-that-compelled-two-12-year-olds-to-stab-their-friend/|title=The complete history of ‘Slender Man,’ the meme that compelled two girls to stab a friend|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|date=2014-06-03|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-06-21|last2=Dewey|first2=Caitlin|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is depicted as a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless head and face and wearing a black suit.

Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking, abducting or traumatizing people, particularly children.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Legends"/&gt; The Slender Man is not confined to a single narrative but appears in many disparate works of fiction, typically composed online.&lt;ref name="creep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/columns/darkdreams/11906-Slender-Man-Birth-of-an-Urban-Legend|title=Slender Man: Birth of an Urban Legend|work=The Escapist|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiction relating to the Slender Man encompasses many media, including literature, art and video series such as ''[[Marble Hornets]]'', wherein he is known as '''The Operator'''. Outside of online fiction, the Slender Man has become an internet icon and has influenced popular culture, having been referenced in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' with the [[Enderman]] character and generated video games of his own, such as ''[[Slender: The Eight Pages]]'' and ''[[Slender: The Arrival]]''. He has also appeared in a [[Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story|film adaptation of ''Marble Hornets'']], where he was portrayed by [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], and an [[Slender Man (film)|eponymous film]], where he was portrayed by [[Javier Botet]].

Beginning in 2014, a [[moral panic]] occurred over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several violent acts, particularly a [[Slender Man stabbing|near-fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl]] in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]], [[Wisconsin]].

The Slender Man was created on June 10, 2009, on a thread in the [[Something Awful]] [[Internet forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/slender-man-how-a-myth-was-born/2182945|title=Slender Man: How a myth was born|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/slenderman-wisc-stabbing-article-1.1815135|title=What is Slenderman, and what does it have to do with the Wisc. stabbing?|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thread was a [[Photoshop contest]] in which users were challenged to "create paranormal images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Cathay|title=Beware the Slender Man: Intellectual Property and Internet Folklore|journal=Florida Law Review|date=6 March 2017|volume=70|issue=1|page=10|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3005668|url=https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3005668|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=User: Gerogerigegege|title=Create Paranormal Images - The Something Awful Forums|url=https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3150591|website=forums.somethingawful.com|language=en|date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forum poster Eric Knudsen, under the pseudonym "Victor Surge",&lt;ref name=copy/&gt; contributed two [[black and white photography|black-and-white]] images of groups of children to which he added a tall, thin, spectral figure wearing a black suit.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;&lt;ref name=dane&gt;{{cite web| title=Why Slenderman Works: The Internet Meme That Proves Our Need To Believe |first=Patrick |last=Dane |url=http://whatculture.com/history/why-slenderman-works-the-internet-meme-that-proves-our-need-to-believe |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although previous entries had consisted solely of photographs, Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of text&amp;mdash;supposedly from witnesses&amp;mdash;describing the abductions of the groups of children and giving the character the name "The Slender Man":

The quote under the first photograph read:

{{quotation|We didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time…|1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead.&lt;ref name=dane/&gt;}}

These additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of fiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own visual or textual contributions.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open-Sourcing Horror: The Slender Man, Marble Hornets, and genre negotiations |journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society |volume=15 |issue=3 |year= 2012 |DOI=10.1080/1369118X.2011.642889 |first=Shira |last=Chess |pages= 374–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dane/&gt;

In her book, ''Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology'', Professor Shira Chess of the [[University of Georgia]] connected the Slender Man to ancient folklore about [[fairy|fairies]]. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are often difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and [[Changeling|kidnaps children]].&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt;

===Development===

The Slender Man soon went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]],&lt;ref&gt;There is some dispute over whether the Slender Man qualifies as a viral phenomenon, since under some definitions, viral phenomena must spread quickly, while the Slender Man initially spread rather slowly. Some therefore prefer the term "spreadable" to viral. See {{cite book| last1= Chess |first1= Shira| last2= Newsom| first2= Eric| year= 2015| title= Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; spawning numerous works of [[fanart]], [[cosplay]], and online fiction known as "[[creepypasta]]"&amp;mdash;scary stories told in short snatches of easily copyable text that spread from site to site. Divorced from its original creator, the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by multiple authors within an overarching mythos.&lt;ref name=creep&gt;{{cite web |title=The definitive guide to creepypasta—the Internet’s urban legends |first=Aja |last=Romano |url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/definitive-guide-creepypasta-slender-man/ |website=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of the Slender Man mythos first appeared on the original Something Awful thread. One of the earliest additions was added by a forum user named "Thoreau-Up", who created a folklore story set in 16th-century Germany involving a character called Der Groẞman, which was implied to be an early reference to the Slender Man.&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt;{{rp|36}} The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user "ce gars". It tells of a fictional [[film school]] friend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature-length project, ''[[Marble Hornets]]''. The video series, published in [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] style on [[YouTube]], forms an [[alternate reality game]] describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The ARG also incorporates a [[Twitter]] feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named "totheark".&lt;ref name="Contemporary Legends"&gt;

Because the Slender Man's fictional "mythology" has evolved without an official "canon" for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities are not fixed but change depending on the storyteller.&lt;ref name=shirachess&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is Slender Man? |first=Caitlin |last=Dewey |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/06/03/who-slender-man/7LHDT69RcChSIaHg8CUUsJ/story.html |date=June 3, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, [[tentacle]]-like arms (or merely tentacles),&lt;ref name=creep/&gt; which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it.&lt;ref name=shirachess/&gt; He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man is often associated with the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tall, skinny, scary—and all in your head |first=Kristin |last=Tillotson |website=startribune.com |date=April 27, 2011 |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/120717934.html?refer=y |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a "Slender sickness"; a rapid onset of [[paranoia]], nightmares and delusions accompanied by [[nosebleed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Origins of Slender Man, the Meme That Allegedly Drove 12-Year-Olds to Kill |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Laura |last=Stampler |url=http://time.com/2817725/slender-man-killing/ |date=June 3, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early stories featured him targeting children or young adults. Some featured young adults driven insane or to act on his behalf, while others did not, and others claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his attention.&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt; The web series ''Marble Hornets'' established the idea of proxies (humans who fall under the Slender Man's influence) though initially they were simply violently insane, rather than puppets of the Slender Man. ''Marble Hornets'' also introduced the idea that the Slender Man could interfere with video and audio recordings, as well as the "Slender Man symbol", which became a common trope of Slender fiction.&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt; [[Graphic violence]] and [[list of body horror media|body horror]] are uncommon in the Slender Man mythos, with many narratives choosing to leave the fate of his victims obscure.&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt; Shira Chess notes that "It is important to note that few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender Man might be, and what his specific intentions are- these points all remain mysteriously and usefully vague."&lt;ref name=shirachess/&gt;

===As folklore ===
&lt;!-- Do NOT add material to this article unless it is reliably sourced. --&gt;
Several scholars have argued that, despite being a fictional work with an identifiable origin point, the Slender Man represents a form of digital folklore. 
Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt; Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt;

Andrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.&lt;ref name="Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Peck|first = Andrew |date = 2015 |title = Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age | journal=Journal of American Folklore | volume=128 | issue=509 |pages=333–348|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.128.509.0333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls “reverse ostension.” [[Ostension]] in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).&lt;ref name="“The sort of story that has you covering your mirrors”:The Case of Slender Man"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tolbert |first = Jeffrey A. |date = 2013 |title = The sort of story that has you covering your mirrors":The Case of Slender Man |url = http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |journal = Semiotic Review |issue = 2 |access-date = 13 July 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074358/http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |archivedate = 10 October 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Thomas Pettitt of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the "[[Secondary orality|Gutenberg Parenthesis]]"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by [[oral tradition]] and [[campfire]] tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, expanding and evolving with time.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Media scholar and folklorist Andrew Peck attributes the success of the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.&lt;ref name="Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age" /&gt;

Although nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or listening to stories.&lt;ref name="“The sort of story that has you covering your mirrors”:The Case of Slender Man"/&gt; This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Bill |date=2001 |title=Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults: Legends We Live |location=Jackson |publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, [[George Noory]]'s ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'', a radio [[call-in show]] devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man.&lt;ref name=tldr&gt;{{cite web |title=#13 - Managing a Monster - On The Media |website=TLDR |first1=PJ |last1=Vogt |first2=Alex |last2=Goldman |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/story/managing-monster/ |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, an article in the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' described his origins as "difficult to pinpoint."&lt;ref name=shirachess/&gt; Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title=Digital Human: Tales |work=BBC |year=2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nl671|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shira Chess describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for "helplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces."&lt;ref name=shirachess/&gt; Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third-party observation.&lt;ref name="Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age"/&gt; Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for ''The Elm'', has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern [[fear]] of the unknown; in an age [[Information overload|flooded with information]], people have become so unaccustomed to [[ignorance]] that they now fear what they cannot understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind You: The Cultural Relevance of Slender Man |first=Tye |last=Van Horn |url=http://elm.washcoll.edu/index.php/2013/02/behind-you-the-cultural-relevance-of-slender-man/ |date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troy Wagner, the creator of ''Marble Hornets'', ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Tina Marie Boyer noted that "The Slender man is a prohibitive monster, but the cultural boundaries he guards are not clear. Victims do not know when they have violated or crossed them."&lt;ref name=shirachess2/&gt;

==Copyright==
Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the [[public domain]]. Several for-profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public.&lt;ref name=copy&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Internet's creepiest meme mutated from thought experiment to Hollywood blockbuster |first=Miles |last=Klee |website=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=August 21, 2013 |url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/slender-man-meme-marble-hornets-movie-origins/ |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of [[copyright]] has less to do with money than with artistic integrity: "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional."&lt;ref name=tldr/&gt; As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company [[Mythology Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=screengems/&gt;

On May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old girls in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha]], [[Wisconsin]] held down and stabbed a 12-year-old classmate 19 times.

In terms of the arrangement Geyser would remain at the mental hospital where she had been staying for the past two years for at least a further three years.

On February 1, 2018, the Associated Press reported that Geyser had been sentenced to 40 years in the Wisconsin mental hospital, the maximum sentence allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=ap |number=959182536705478657 |date=1 February 2018 |title=BREAKING: Judge sentences Wisconsin girl to maximum 40 years in mental hospital in Slender Man stabbing case. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing the story, an unidentified woman from [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], told a [[WLWT]] TV reporter in June 2014 that her 13-year-old daughter had attacked her with a knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving the Slender Man, who the mother said motivated the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamilton Co. mom: Daughter's knife attack influenced by Slender Man|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/hamilton-co-mom-daughters-knife-attack-influenced-by-slender-man/26370588?_escaped_fragment_=WAFFp#!WAFFp|first= Brad| last= Evans|date=June 6, 2014|website= [[WLWT]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spliced''''' is a Canadian [[animated television series]] produced by [[Nelvana]] in association with [[Teletoon]].

==Plot==
''Spliced'' is a [[Revisionism (fictional)|modern take]] of [[H. G. Wells]]' 1896 science-fiction fantasy, ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nurun.com |url=http://www.thesudburystar.com/2010/04/15/genetic-experiments-yield-goofy-results-in-spliced |title=Genetic experiments yield goofy results in 'Spl... &amp;#124; Entertainment |publisher=Sudbury Star |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spliced marginally distorts Wells' characters in this modern twist by making the mutants the result of genetic experiments created by [[recombinant DNA]] rather than Wells' original vivisection process. As with the original story, these experimental results, plus one platypus not in the original story, live on an isolated tropical island that is called "Keep Away Island" in the cartoon. The [[mad scientist]] who created them was arrested and removed by authorities via boat. Left to their own devices, these mutated beasts form a functional society.

==Characters==

* Peri (short for failed exPERIment number 13) is a mutant of indeterminate species and purpose. In the episode where Peri happens upon the lab notes concerning his creation, Entree ends up using the pages as toilet paper before Smarty-Smarts can actually read them to determine Peri's purpose. Peri lives in a plane that crashed on the island. Peri is an expert bowler, and he and his best friend Entree developed their trademark game, "bucket-stick-fruit-ball." Peri is voiced by [[Rob Stefaniuk]].
* Entrée (named in reference to the [[entree|main course of a meal]]) is Peri's best friend. Entrèe was created as the perfect food animal, with a cow's udders, a pig body, a chicken's wings and comb, and a [[shrimp]] tail.&lt;ref name="character"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletoon.com/en/tv/spliced|title=Spliced|work=Teletoon|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he has no legs, Entrée "walks" on his teats, named Nugget, Pokey, Cranky, Commodore Uddersworth, Tina, A.J., Nippocles, and an unnamed eighth which Entrèe darkly claims speaking its name "will give it power." Entree's teats are capable of time travel and light show effects. Fittingly, his home is a giant pizza oven and his bed is a [[barbecue]] grill. Entrèe is evil, in the sense of always seeking instant self-gratification, no matter the cost. Much of the time Entree's selfishness ends up causing more destruction than Mr. Smarty Smarts' intentional evil. Entree is a glutton, loving to gorge on anything, even things that aren't normally edible, but ''especially'' [[mayonnaise]]. Entrée is voiced by [[Joe Pingue]].
* Two-legs Joe is a two-legged [[rhinoceros]] out of whose high and pointy upper hindquarters a mostly silent bird character named Lord Wingus Eternum grows.&lt;ref name="character"/&gt; Two-Legs Joe is the mayor of the town this society of mutants inhabits, which to his great frustration is constantly being wrecked, burned, and blown-up by the innocent yet highly destructive childlike behavior of Peri and Entree, especially when they play in the doctor's abandoned laboratory. Joe's thing, since he has a  rhino's weight upon two massive legs, is ''stomping''. Joe loves to stomp, and he loves to stomp Peri and Entree, and especially Entree, after they destroy his town. Wingus, perched on the high point of Joe's back end, is of the species that was the Doctor's "first, and also his best, creation," according to Wingus. It turns out that Two-Legs Joe is ''actually'' a mutant growth on Wingus' leg. Such are the hazards of messing with DNA. Two-legs Joe is voiced by [[Patrick McKenna|Pat McKenna]], and Wingus is voiced by [[Tom McCamus]].
* Patricia is a [[platypus]] that happened to live on Keep Away Island when the Doctor set up shop.&lt;ref name="character"/&gt; She feels very lonely on Keep Away Island being the only creature that is not spliced. She is an author and has been shown writing a book of poetry as well as the novel: "Marzipan Meadows and the Kingdom of Adventure". She is a master of the martial art "Plat Kwon Do". Patricia is voiced by [[Katie Crown]].
* Princess Pony Apehands has the head and tail of a [[pony]] onto the body of a [[ape]].&lt;ref name="character"/&gt; She is one of the more aggressive mutants, but because she has the mental capacity of a very young girl, she doesn't quite understand how big and strong she is and often hurts others when she is simply trying to play with them or give them a hug. She also has a rather short temper, and will intentionally hurt any mutant who angers her.  Her tree house is located deep in the forest and is completely pink inside, and she herself is colored pink and purple. She wears a ballet [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and slippers and enjoys very girly things. Although she's a girl, her voice is quite masculine and deep. Princess Pony Apehands is voiced by Kedar Brown.
* Compuhorse is a horse with a computer implanted. He has very limited animation, for example: He cannot move his lips but speaks similarly to [[Stephen Hawking]], with a synthesized voice through his keyboard. His best friend is Calcupony and his rival is AlphaDonkey. Compuhorse is voiced by [[Patrick McKenna|Pat McKenna]]. In the virtual game "Cube Whacker" he's known as OmegaSteed. OmegaSteed is voiced by [[Mark Dailey]].
* Fuzzy Snuggums is a small explorer seeking adventure beyond the island but always fails. He often begins talking with the phrase "Expedition note...". Long ago, Fuzzy was chosen by the doctor to combat against robots of another scientist from another island, but could not be stopped and was later reassigned for exploration. At that time, his opening sentence was "Execution note..." (demonstrated in the episode "Sgt Snuggums"). The Doctor made him indestructible, which is fortunate, considering his exploration attempts usually backfire upon him painfully. Though usually small and cute, Fuzzy's true form personality, which can resurface under extreme circumstances, is that of a giant, musclebound brawler. It was revealed by Lord Wingus in the episode "Stompabout", that were Joe to never get angry again, Fuzzy would rule the island, enslaving all of its occupants. Fuzzy is voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]].
* Mister Smarty Smarts is a villainous dolphin, chimpanzee and a [[Jack Russell Terrier]] with a well-developed primate brain,&lt;ref name="character"/&gt; and the main antagonist of the series who attempts to take over the island. He resides in a lair which is located on a slope of the volcano. He is quite egotistical, believing the rest of the island inhabitants to be fools. He also has some [[cross-dressing]] tendencies, often looking for an excuse to wear a dress. Mister Smarty Smarts is voiced by Mike Kiss.
* Octocat is a combination of a cat and an octopus, who is Mister Smarty Smarts' assistant/minion (although it is shown that they share a romantic relationship of some sort), whom he met after they both crashed their cars together. Unlike the other mutants, she cannot talk, conversing solely in meows, but the others are still able to understand her. Like Fuzzy, she too was created to be a super-soldier, and can also assume a musclebound fighting form.

[[Image:Double eight -1.JPG|thumb|The common [[stevedore knot]].  If the ends were joined together, the result would be equivalent to the mathematical knot.]]

In [[knot theory]], the '''stevedore knot''' is one of three [[prime knot]]s with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] six, the others being the [[6₂ knot|6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot]] and the [[6₃ knot|6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot]]. The stevedore knot is listed as the '''6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knot''' in the [[Alexander–Briggs notation]], and it can also be described as a [[twist knot]] with four twists, or as the (5,&amp;minus;1,&amp;minus;1) [[pretzel link|pretzel knot]].

The mathematical stevedore knot is named after the common [[stevedore knot]], which is often used as a [[stopper knot|stopper]] at the end of a [[rope]].  The mathematical version of the knot can be obtained from the common version by joining together the two loose ends of the rope, forming a knotted [[loop (topology)|loop]].

The stevedore knot is [[invertible knot|invertible]] but not [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]].  Its [[Alexander polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = -2t+5-2t^{-1}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

its [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander–Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = 1-2z^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and its [[Jones polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = q^2-q+2-2q^{-1}+q^{-2}-q^{-3}+q^{-4}. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|6_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexander polynomial and Conway polynomial are the same as those for the knot 9&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;, but the Jones polynomials for these two knots are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Stevedore's Knot|urlname=StevedoresKnot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the Alexander polynomial is not [[monic polynomial|monic]], the stevedore knot is not [[fibered knot|fibered]].

The stevedore knot is a [[ribbon knot]], and is therefore also a [[slice knot]].

The stevedore knot is a [[hyperbolic knot]], with its complement having a [[Hyperbolic volume (knot)|volume]] of approximately 3.16396.

[[File:1985 CPA 5654.jpg|thumb|Savitskaya on Soyuz T-12, and her spacewalk]]
'''Svetlana Yevgenyevna Savitskaya''' ({{lang-ru|Светла́на Евге́ньевна Сави́цкая}}; born 8 August 1948) is a retired [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aviator and [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] who flew aboard [[Soyuz T-7]] in 1982, becoming the second woman in space. On her 1984 mission she became the first woman to fly to space twice, and the first woman to perform a [[spacewalk]].  She set several [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records as a pilot.

==Training==
Svetlana Savitskaya was born in a privileged family.  Her father, [[Yevgeniy Savitskiy]], was a highly decorated fighter pilot during the Second World War, which later brought him to the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|Soviet Air Defense]].

Without the knowledge of her parents, Savitskaya began parachuting at the age of 16.  When her father heard about it, he further promoted this tendency.  On her seventeenth birthday she already had 450 parachute jumps.  Over the next year, she led record [[Space diving|stratosphere jumps]] from 13,800 m and 14,250 m.&lt;ref name="TTO2012"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Ben |url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=k_uZiCp5icUC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=savitskaya+14,252&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y5E3UO0x5w&amp;sig=nT67eQYBOGi2AqRRZ8lMB5yCLW0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=test%20pilots%20school&amp;f=false|title=Tragedy and Triumph in Orbit: The Eighties and Early Nineties |language=en |date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=614 |isbn=9781461434306 |DOI=10.1007/978-1-4614-3430-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1966, she enrolled in the [[Moscow State Aviation Technological University|Moscow State Aviation Institute]] (MAI), where she also took flight lessons.  In 1971 she was licensed as a flight instructor.  After graduating from the MAI in 1972, she trained as a test pilot at the [[Fedotov Test Pilot School]], graduating in 1976.&lt;ref name="TTO2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShLI2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2002 |editor-last=Знаменская |editor-first=Наталья |title=ШЛИ со временем |trans-title=ShLI in Time |url=https://search.rsl.ru/ru/search#yf=2002&amp;yt=2002&amp;q=%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC |language=RU |edition=2 |location=Жуковский |publisher=ООО "Редакция газеты "Жуковские вести" |pages=400 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1978 she went to work for the aircraft manufacturer [[Yakovlev]], as a test pilot.

Between 1969 and 1977 she was a member of the Soviet national team for aerobatics.  At the [[FAI World Aerobatic Championships]] in July 1970 at [[Hullavington Airfield|Hullavington]], she flew a [[Yakovlev Yak-18|Yak-18]] and won the world championship together with an all-female team.  At the 1972 World Championships in [[Salon-de-Provence]] she placed third; in 1976 in Kiev with a [[Yakovlev Yak-50 (1975)|Yak-50]], fifth.

== Soviet space program ==
[[image:1983_CPA_5375_(1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Savitskaya on a postam stamp]]
In 1979, Savitskaya participated in the selection process for the second group of female cosmonauts.  On June 30, 1980, she was officially admitted to the cosmonaut group.  She passed her exams on February 24, 1982.

=== First flight: Soyuz T-7 / T-5 ===
In December 1981, Savitskaya prepared for her first space flight, a short-term flight to the space station [[Salyut 7]], replacing the [[Salyut 7#Resident crews|original crew]].  The commander of this mission was [[Leonid Popov]], with his third flight; it was flight engineer [[Aleksandr Serebrov|Alexander Serebrov]]'s first flight.

The launch of Soyuz T-7 took place on August 19, 1982. This made Savitskaya the second woman in space, 19 years after [[Valentina Tereshkova]].  The three cosmonauts docked with the space station the following day, where they were welcomed by [[Anatoly Berezovoy]] and [[Valentin Lebedev]].  This was the first time a space station had a mixed gender crew.  Savitskaya was assigned the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 as a private area, but slept as well as the men in the space station.  On August 27, 1982, Popov, Savitskaya, and Serebrov returned to Earth in Soyuz T-5.

In 1995, Savitskaya gave an interview to Baltimore Sun journalist Clara Germani. She recalled encountering some sexism from her male crewmates and that upon entering Salyut 7 for the first time, [[Valentin Lebedev]] presented her with an apron and told her "to get to work". She stated that "I was quickly able to establish a working, professional relationship with them."

=== Second flight: Soyuz T-12 ===
In December 1983 she was assigned to her second flight, including an EVA, three weeks after American astronaut [[Kathryn D. Sullivan|Kathy Sullivan]]'s flight and EVA assignment were made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americaspace.com/2012/02/10/a-cog-in-a-political-machine-the-career-of-svetlana-savitskaya/|title=A Cog in a Political Machine: The Career of Svetlana Savitskaya|date=2012-02-10|work=AmericaSpace|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, it was to be a short-term mission to Salyut 7, this time bringing tools to the station so that the third resident crew, the [[Salyut 7#Resident Crew|Salyut 7 EO-3]], could repair a fuel line.

On July 17, 1984 Savitskaya launched aboard [[Soyuz T-12]], together with Commander [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]] and research cosmonaut [[Igor Volk]].  On July 25, 1984, Savitskaya became the first woman to [[Extravehicular activity|spacewalk]], conducting EVA outside the [[Salyut 7]] space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes, during which she cut and welded metals in space along with her colleague Vladimir Dzhanibekov.&lt;ref name="SpaceFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/savitskaya_svetlana.htm|title=Biographies of USSR / Russian Cosmonauts|date=9 August 2012|website=Space Facts|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbiter-forum.com/showthread.php?t=9213|title=Space welding anniversary!|date=16 July 2009|website=Orbiter-Forum|publisher=Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the [[List of spacewalkers|57 Soviet/Russian spacewalkers]] through 2010, she is the only woman.  The return to earth took place on July 29, 1984.

Savitskaya recalled that, during her second mission, she expressed concern about the extravehicular welding exercises, as "I did not understand the point of it. We might burn our spacesuits or the exterior of the station." but her overall excellent performance on both flights silenced critics who questioned a woman's capability to perform space missions.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-11-14/news/1995318054_1_savitskaya-duma-communist-party/2|title=Space heroine as hard-line hopeful Russian election: Svetlana Savitskaya, the first woman to walk in space, is a top Communist candidate in the once all-powerful party's comeback bid in the Duma.|website=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible third spaceflight ===
Upon returning to Earth, Savitskaya was assigned as the commander of an all-female Soyuz crew to Salyut 7 in commemoration of [[International Women's Day]].  In February 1985, however, the radio contact with Salyut 7 was lost; the space station was rescued by the &lt;u&gt;[[Soyuz T-13]]&lt;/u&gt; mission in the summer of 1985.  When the next mission had to be stopped in November 1985, due to an illness of the commander [[Vladimir Vasyutin|Vasyutin]], the women's flight was finally canceled.  In addition, after two unsuccessful flights in 1983, [[Soyuz T-8]] and [[Soyuz 7K-ST No. 16L|Soyuz T-10-1]], not enough Soyuz spacecraft were available.  Later it would have been possible to fly with a [[Soyuz-TM]] to the space station [[Mir]].  However, this plan was not pursued due to Savitskaya's pregnancy in 1986.

== Subsequent activities ==
Savitskaya is married, with one child, a son born in 1986.&lt;ref name="brighthub"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing But The Facts About: Svetlana Savitskaya |url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/space/articles/21373.aspx |publisher= Brighthub| accessdate= April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1986, she graduated from the [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University|Moscow State Technical University Bauman]].  From 1983 to 1994 Savitskaya held a position of Deputy Head of [[Energia (corporation)|NPO Energia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energia.ru/en/news/news-2016/news_07-25.html|title=S.P. Korolev RSC Energia - News|website=www.energia.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A committed communist, Savitskaya was elected as a people's deputy of the USSR from 1989 and a people's deputy of Russia in 1990, a position she held until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pilot-cosmonaut of the USSR, Svetlana Savitskaya, turns 65|url=https://www.ruaviation.com/news/2013/8/9/1851/|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Russian Aviation|date=9 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007214247/https://www.ruaviation.com/news/2013/8/9/1851/|archivedate=7 October 2013|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duma directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duma Deputies Alphabetical Listing|url=https://www.usrbc.org/government/russian_government/russian_government_state_duma/deputies_alphabetical/16|accessdate=20 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180053/https://www.usrbc.org/government/russian_government/russian_government_state_duma/deputies_alphabetical/16|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not welcome the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, noting that everything her parents had worked hard to build was destroyed almost overnight and she was "glad they did not live to see it".&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt;

Savitskaya retired in 1993 from the Russian Air Force with the rank of Major.  In 1994/95 she worked as an Assistant Professor in Economics and Investment at the Moscow State Aviation Institute.  In 1996, she was elected a deputy of the [[State Duma]] representing the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], and has been re-elected four times since then. She presently serves as Deputy Chair of the Committee on Defence, and is also a member of the Coordination council presidium of the National Patriotic Union.&lt;ref name="Duma directory" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The American Way of Death''''' is an exposé of abuses in the [[funeral home]] industry in the United States, written by [[Jessica Mitford]] and published in 1963. An updated revision, '''''The American Way of Death Revisited''''', completed by Mitford just before her death in 1996, appeared in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071006115307/http://www.salon.com/books/sneaks/1998/07/29sneaks.html Review of ''The American Way of Death Revisited'', Salon, July 29, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Mitford's husband, [[civil rights]] lawyer [[Robert Treuhaft]], persuaded her to write an investigative article about the American funeral industry.&lt;ref name="LQ" /&gt; Though her article on the subject, "Saint Peter Don't You Call Me" published in ''Frontier'' magazine, was not widely disseminated, it caught considerable attention when Mitford appeared on a local television broadcast with two industry representatives.  Convinced of public interest, she wrote ''The American Way of Death'', which was published in 1963. In the book Mitford harshly criticized the industry for using unscrupulous business practices to take advantage of grieving families.

Feeling that death had become much too sentimentalized, highly commercialized, and, above all, excessively expensive, Mitford published her research, which, she argues, documents the ways in which funeral directors take advantage of the shock and grief of friends and relatives of loved ones to convince them to pay far more than necessary for the funeral and other services, such as availability of so-called "grief counselors," a title she claims is unmerited. The book became a major bestseller and led to Congressional hearings on the funeral industry. It was one of the inspirations for filmmaker [[Tony Richardson]]'s 1965 film ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'', which was based on  [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s short satirical 1948 [[The Loved One|novel of the same name]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hill, ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' Bloomsbury, 2001, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; tellingly subtitled "An Anglo-American Tragedy".

In keeping with her wishes, Mitford herself had an inexpensive funeral, which cost $533.31 – she was cremated without a ceremony, and the ashes scattered at sea; the cremation itself cost $475.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016crbo_books1?currentPage=all "Red Sheep: How Jessica Mitford found her voice" by Thomas Mallon 16 Oct 2007 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral company was the Pacific Interment Service, which prides itself on "dignity, simplicity, affordability".&lt;ref&gt;An expensive way to go. (The Business of Bereavement), ''[[The Economist]]'' (US edition), January 4, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Judith Newman in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' commented, "This revised and updated version of her book is no less startling, or entertaining, than the original was," and also notes that Mitford "is also prescient in predicting the rise of bottom-line-above-all corporate funeral home chains like Service Corporation International and the Loewen Group, which, as Mitford reports, are now consolidating (read: devouring) mom-and-pop operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Judith| last=Newman | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/04/bib/981004.rv115616.html | title= The American Way of Death Revisited | publisher=''New York Times''| date=| accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bess Lovejoy of ''[[Lapham's Quarterly]]'' wrote in an extended review of the 1998 updated revision, "The book is a narrowly conceived exposé, a screed against expensive funerals and the men who sell them, not an analysis of how or why funerals got that way. It’s interesting to contrast Mitford’s book with the seminal death texts of the past, such as the two in the fifteenth century that were both called The Art of Dying, or the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead. Those works helped individuals prepare for death by prescribing a series of attitudes and rituals designed to ensure a good death and a better afterlife. Such rituals helped people grapple with death’s great challenge to the self; they made death mean. By contrast, Mitford’s book is a Consumer Reports of death."&lt;ref name="LQ"&gt;{{cite news | first=Bess| last=Lovejoy | url=http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/death/fond-farewells | title= Fond Farewells: Jessica Mitford’s An American Way of Death took down an industry few people knew about, but that everyone would one day need. | publisher=''Lapham's Quarterly''| date=| accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Day The Earth Nearly Died''''' is a British documentary produced by [[BBC]] to the [[science]] and [[philosophy]] series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' in 2002. The program focuses on the mystery of the [[Permian extinction]], which scientists believe killed over 90% of all life on earth at the end of the [[Permian]], some 250 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann_NG-2000"&gt;Hoffmann J.H. (2000), “When life nearly came to an end”, ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' '''198'''(3): p. 100-113.&lt;/ref&gt; The program features scientists like [[Adrian Jones (geologist)|Adrian Jones]], [[Vincent Courtillot]], [[Gregory Retallack]], [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], [[Michael Benton]], [[Michael R. Rampino]] and others.

==Synopsis==
The program features [[palaeontologist]]s and other scientists as they try to find clues to the great extinction. In the program, it is argued that the Permian extinction came in 3 stages; the first was caused by volcanic activity in the great [[Siberian Traps]]. This is proposed to have caused global warming, which in turn killed much of the life on land. Second, it warmed up the sea, which killed much of the marine life. As the sea became warmer, the ocean floor released a massive amount of [[methane]]. As the methane reached the [[atmosphere]], the earth became even warmer, which led to the extinction of even more lifeforms on land. In the program, the extinction is argued to have lasted less than 1 million years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/dayearthdied.shtml The Day The Earth Nearly Died], ''www.bbc.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tory Foster''' is a [[fictional character]] from the 2004 TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', portrayed by [[Rekha Sharma]].

==Character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
Tory, like the other members of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The Final Five (Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh)|Final Five]], was originally from a planet called [[Earth in science fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]]. This Earth had been colonized by the 13th Tribe (composed of [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] from the planet [[Kobol]]) roughly 4,000 years before the events of the series (c.152,000 BC as revealed by the final episode). Tory and [[Galen Tyrol]] were in a relationship in their past lives - they lived together and planned to get married. Tory and the other members of the group that would later be known as the Final Five were working to recreate the resurrection process their Cylon ancestors used to employ on Kobol, a process that had fallen out of favor on Earth due to procreation. They had some advance knowledge of the impending destruction due to warnings from people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Tory looked like a man. When Earth was destroyed roughly 2,000 years ago the Final Five arranged to have themselves resurrected aboard a sub-light ship orbiting earth. They then left to find the Twelve Colonies and warn them about treating their artificial life with respect or face the same doom that befell Earth. By the time the Final Five completed their sublight journey thousands of years had passed, and they arrived near the end of the first Cylon/human war. Meeting the Cylon centurions, the Five offered to show them how to create humanoid cylon models in exchange for the centurions ending the war. The Final Five created eight models. However, the first model ([[John Cavil]]) destroyed the seventh model ([[Number Seven (Battlestar Galactica)|Daniel]]) out of fraternal envy. Cavil then killed the Final Five and boxed their minds for years, later resurrecting them in new bodies and reprogramming them to think they were humans from the Twelve Colonies. Presumably, he also reprogrammed the other Cylon models to not think about the Final Five or investigate their identities, and that to do so would constitute heresy.

In her new life, before [[the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies]], Tory was a precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi on Caprica for five years. In this capacity, she became an expert on [[opinion poll|polling]].&lt;ref name="The Cult of Baltar"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the nuclear attack on the Colonies she was driving down a road on Caprica and got hit by the force of a nuclear shockwave.  Her car was destroyed and she was injured, but she managed to survive the shockwave and was presumably picked up by a Raptor that landed nearby looking for survivors.

Following the death of [[Billy Keikeya]], Tory Foster becomes one of [[President]] [[Laura Roslin]]'s chief aides and advisors. She takes a particular responsibility for managing Roslin's election campaign. One of her first moves is to take an opinion poll, the results of which clearly show Roslin leading her presumptive opponent, [[Tom Zarek]].&lt;ref name="The Cult of Baltar"/&gt; She plays a part in finding a human foster mother for the half-Cylon child [[Hera Agathon]] and is one of the few people who know the child is alive.&lt;ref name="Downloaded"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Downloaded| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counsels Roslin during the Rya Kibby case, as she weighs up the consequences of appeasing the [[pro-life]] beliefs of the Gemenese and the need to repopulate the human race versus the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under Colonial law before the attack.&lt;ref name="The Cult of Baltar"/&gt;

After Roslin's executive order criminalizes abortion throughout the fleet, [[Vice-President]] [[Gaius Baltar]] announces his candidacy in the forthcoming election, and garners Zarek's support as campaign manager (and eventual Vice-President&lt;ref name="Precipice"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Precipice (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Precipice| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The discovery of [[New Caprica]] and the Baltar-Zarek campaign's pro-settlement position swings much popular support away from Roslin. With Roslin's at first tacit, and later explicit, approval, Foster conspires with [[Colonel]] [[Saul Tigh]] and others to rig the election in Roslin's favour. The deception is discovered by [[Lieutenant]] [[Felix Gaeta]] on account of a typographical mistake on one set of ballot papers, and Baltar is sworn in as Roslin's successor.&lt;ref name="Lay Down Your Burdens"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation of New Caprica by the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], Foster joins the human resistance movement, again serving as Laura Roslin's aide. She works to compile a list of known Cylon collaborators among the human population.&lt;ref name="Precipice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupation"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Occupation| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helps to organize the swift and orderly evacuation of the civilian population to their assigned vessels, and is one of the last people to see [[Maya (Battlestar Galactica)|Maya]] and her adopted daughter [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera/Isis]] as the evacuation takes place. Despite having two bodyguards, Maya does not make it off New Caprica, Hera is captured by [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]], and Foster personally apologizes to Roslin for what she sees as her failure.&lt;ref name="Exodus"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roslin's second [[inauguration]] as President of the Twelve Colonies, Foster resumes her former duties as a presidential aide.&lt;ref name="Collaborators"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Collaborators| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few episodes of season 3, her mental condition starts deteriorating, and she starts hearing music. In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, "[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]", she, along with [[Samuel Anders]], [[Saul Tigh]], and [[Galen Tyrol]] become aware of the fact they are Cylons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07085/770732-352.stm Ronald Moore confirms they are Cylons in this interview]&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[music]] (which turns out to be "[[All Along The Watchtower]]," as performed by [[Bear McCreary|Bear McCreary's]] brother &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bearmccreary.com/html/blog/blogmain.htm|title=Bear's Battlestar Galactica Blog|accessdate=2007-12-11|author=Bear McCreary|work=|date=2007-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203082341/http://www.bearmccreary.com/html/blog/blogmain.htm|archivedate=2007-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) only they can hear, and a "switch" that goes off within them (as Chief Tyrol mentions). Foster and Anders have experienced at least the beginnings of a physical relationship. As the Cylon fleet attacked, Tigh defiantly declared "Whatever else I am, I'm an officer in the Colonial Fleet and if I die today, that's the man I'll be." Following this speech, Foster reported to the CIC to aid President Roslin.

Season 4 opens with Tory Foster continuing her participation in clandestine final-four Cylon meetings (Anders, Foster, Tigh, Tyrol). Tigh suggests Gaius Baltar as a potential source of information, citing Baltar's previous time spent among the Cylons;  Foster attempts to gain Gaius' confidence via professed admiration and seduction. Despite her initial objection to actual sexual relations, she has sex with Baltar during which she weeps.&lt;ref name="Six of One"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)| title= Six of One | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baltar asks why she is crying, she says it's just something she does, and things could be worse: she could be a Cylon. Baltar tells her he believes Cylons can feel, and, touched, she stops crying and kisses him in earnest. Subsequently, she seems to be spending more and more time with Baltar, not necessarily just to gain information. In "[[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]," she attends one of Baltar's monotheism rallies, and appears to be approving.

When she discovers [[Cally Tyrol]] has overheard one of the clandestine meetings, she follows her to a [[Colonial Viper|Viper]] launch tube, dissuades Cally from killing herself and her son, and secures the infant, but Foster then ejects the mother out the tube herself.&lt;ref name="The Ties That Bind"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)| title= The Ties That Bind | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster shows no guilt. She appears to have embraced both being a Cylon and her own version of Baltar's teachings, allowing her to by-pass such feelings and adopt an almost hedonistic approach to life. She declares herself to be "perfect", something that disturbs fellow Cylons Tigh and Tyrol, and is in marked contrast to Tigh's and Caprica Six's guilty consciences ([[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]).

Later, Foster meets with President Roslin, who first pleasantly comments about Foster's positive change in mood any time she is aboard Galactica. Roslin asks Foster to find out who was sharing the rumors of the president's shared visions to Baltar, then sticks the dagger in, telling Foster she is very aware that she is sleeping with Gaius Baltar. Before Foster can say a word, Roslin tells her there are enough reports of her visitations to "make her a charter member of his nymph squad.&lt;ref name="The Cult of Baltar"/&gt;" Foster confesses to believing in Baltar's spiritual message, but Roslin is feeling quite betrayed and turns her back on her to do other work, ordering her away ([[Guess What's Coming to Dinner?]]).

Out of the known members of the Final Five, Tory seems to be embracing her Cylon-self more than the others. The other three are attempting to maintain their human selves (the same way that [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Boomer]] did). This results in a change to her personality.

After Downloaded Three is unboxed, now knowing the identities of the Final Five, and brought to Galactica, Foster stays true her earlier affinity for her Cylon side. Under the pretence of bringing Laura Roslin her medication, she flies to the Cylon basestar, where she is introduced to her fellow Cylons and tells Roslin and Baltar about her true nature. During the ensuing stand off between Three and Galactica over the remaining three Cylons, she helps Three's cause by informing her of Lee Adama's perceived weaknesses (Revelations).

When the fleet arrives at Earth and discovers it is a barren world destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe and once populated by Cylons, Foster and her fellow Final Five Cylons begin remembering details about their past lives on the planet. One detail she clearly remembers is how Anders used to be a musician and used to play a song he wrote for her and their friends, Galen Tyrol and Saul and Ellen Tigh. She and Tyrol were also lovers at the time ([[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]).

Since being publicly identified as a member of the Final Five Cylons, Foster has taken up full-time residence on board the rebel basestar, living with the Twos, Sixes (less Caprica-Six), and Eights (less Sharon Agathon &amp; Sharon Valerii). Her fellow Cylons appear to have also given her equal status in their command hierarchy, as evident by her behaviour during Gaeta's Mutiny. When Laura Roslin is smuggled aboard the basestar, Foster is content to abandon the fleet to its own turmoil and simply jump away to safety, a notion her fellow Cylons support. Though she repeatedly argues against involving the basestar in the counter-coup efforts, she ultimately concedes to Roslin's plan ([[Blood on the Scales]]).

During Gaeta's mutiny Sam Anders is shot in the back of the skull. When he regains consciousness he remembers his and the others former life on Earth and after. He recites the history as fast as he could to the other Final Five, including Tory Foster. Like the other Fives, she was a scientist attempting to reinvent resurrection technology. To her and Galen Tyrol's mutual shock she learned they were once lived together as lovers and were engaged to be married. (No Exit)

After Anders's apparently unsuccessful (in that he never regained consciousness) surgery and his comatose state, Foster urges the other Finals and Caprica Six to leave for the Baseship and abandon the fleet in order to strike out on their own without humanity. Then Ellen Tigh, the Fifth Final, arrives after apparently being rescued from Cavil by Sharon "Boomer" Valerii. The Final Five debate the merits of staying with the fleet versus leaving. When the matter is put to a vote, Tyrol and Foster vote to leave and Tigh votes to stay. Though Anders is in a coma during this debate, Tyrol reminds the others Anders had previously pleaded with Colonel Tigh to stay with the fleet, and they agree to count Anders's vote thusly. This means the vote is a 2-2 deadlock with Ellen Tigh holding the deciding vote. Ellen is conflicted and postpones her decision, as she is upset by her discovery of the relationship between Saul Tigh and Caprica Six. Later, driven by jealousy, resentment and anger over Saul Tigh conceiving a child with Caprica Six and the implication he loved Caprica Six more than he ever did Ellen, Ellen makes her decision and votes with Foster and Tyrol to leave humanity. However Caprica Six's miscarriage, possibly brought on by stress caused by an attack in Dogsville and personal confrontations with Ellen Tigh over the true love of Saul Tigh, changes the situation. Foster and the others reluctantly decide to stay, since the loss of Caprica Six's pregnancy means Hera Agathon has become the only remaining hope of Cylon continuity ([[Deadlock]]).

As the Five recover from the tragedy of the miscarriage, Tory commiserates with the others, including a Tyrol desperate to save the life of Boomer, who was about to be transported for trial on the Baseship. She agrees with Ellen Tigh they cannot interfere with Cylon due process other than being witnesses. At Joe's Bar, Tory hears Kara Thrace playing the piano and recognizes the tune as the song switching on the Final Four in the nebula. She confronts Thrace to find out where she learned that song. Thrace informs her it was a song her father played for her as a child. Later off-screen she told them she was playing the music notes written as a drawing by Hera Agathon. By this time, Sharon Valerii had already abducted Hera and escaped back to Cavil's Baseship ([[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]).

Tory continues to congregate with the Final Five, who are by now a close-knit group watching over their comatose member (Anders). However, the group temporarily loses Tyrol as he is imprisoned for his role in unwittingly allowing Valerii to kidnap Hera and escape. Ellen Tigh urges the Adamas to search for Hera on the Cylon Homeworld, and is emphatically supported by Anders's wife [[Kara Thrace]]. Tory abstains from voicing her own opinion on the matter, but she agrees with Ellen's recommendation and helps arrange the Heavy Raider reconnaissance mission after Adama gives his permission ([[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]).

Tory reluctantly volunteers for the mission to rescue Hera, partially due to the insistence of [[Galen Tyrol]]. She assists Ellen in maintaining the link between Anders and ''Galactica'' during the battle. After agreeing to share resurrection technology with the Cylons in exchange for a truce, Tory becomes nervous the sharing process will involve a pooling of her memories with the rest of the Five, which will reveal the truth about the murder of Cally. Tory therefore asks the others to pledge that no matter what they find out about each other, they will forgive each other for it. Tigh agrees and the Five start the process, but when Tyrol sees her memory of murdering Cally he flies into a rage, breaks the download to strangle Tory, and ultimately snaps her neck in retribution. The Cylons of Cavil's faction see this as a betrayal since Tory's death broke the download and resume hostilities.

'''''Tuck Everlasting''''' is a 1981 American film based on [[Natalie Babbitt]]'s [[Tuck Everlasting|1975 book of the same title]].

==Background==
After Keller made the T.V. movie Skeleton Key, he met up with [[Natalie Babbitt]] at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. He liked her novel [[Tuck Everlasting]] and decided to produce and direct a film based on it. Filming was done in 1980 and was released on June 6, 1981. The film isn't well known, as most people associate "Tuck Everlasting" with the book or [[Tuck Everlasting (2002 film)]]. However, the film can be found on VHS and rarely on DVD. It used to occasionally air on T.V.

== Plot==
The story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters' little forest and became immortal (hence the name "Tuck Everlasting").

During an autumn harvest carnival in the fictional town of Treegap at the turn of the century, somewhere in upstate New York, a young man named Jesse Tuck (Paul Flessa), who is immortal, is riding on the Ferris wheel where he works. He decides to show off the crowd by doing dangerous stunts. People begin to notice including a man in a yellow suit. The man who runs the Ferris wheel stops its motor, causing it to stop spinning which leaves Jesse on top. This makes a constable to threaten to charge the man if the boy gets hurt. Jesse begins doing dangerous stunts which frightens the crowd. The Ferris wheel's brake fails and when somebody bumps into it, it causes the wheel to turn causing Jesse to fall to the ground, causing people to think he is dead. After sitting, Jesse opens his eyes and jumps up, scaring the crowd. Angered the constable runs after Jesse.

Meanwhile, a very, bored 12-year-old girl Winifred Foster (Margaret Chamberlain) is sitting on her front lawn. She is so bored that she begins talking to a turtle which goes waddling by. She tells the turtle how much she hates it at home, and that she is not allowed to go to the fair. Two boys talking about Jesse are walking by. After talking to the turtle her mother and Grandmother call her in for lunch and then to practice piano. She says goodbye to the turtle as it goes to hide in a bush.

The next scene shows the Tucks at their pond on the other side of the wood, at their brown one story house. Mae Tuck (Sonia Raimi) is talking to Angus Tuck (Fred A. Keller) but is called "Angus" only a couple of times throughout the whole movie. He is simply known as "Tuck," or "Mister Tuck." She asks him why he isn't waking up as it is already mid-morning. He says he likes sleeping as he dreams about he and his family are in heaven and never knew about Treegap. But she tells him he has to wake up to get the area ready as they will be having their ten-year reunion with their boys, Jesse and Miles, and that nothing is going to change. Still asleep, he tells her to put her shawl away as the  weather hasn't changed. Tuck warns her about going into town or the woods. But she says otherwise. She then asks Tuck to fix her music box even though she is leaving in a few hours. He makes up excuses not to fix it but he agrees to fix it when she's back. She says she promised to keep it going as long as she lived. After Tuck asks what the boys have been doing, she then turns to talking about how fast time flies. And states 10 years is "as long as it takes to make a pot of coffee." She is on her horse in the late afternoon admiring the mountains and grasslands and cornfields of the upper New York countryside. 

The next scene shows a large beech tree with twisty branches. At the bottom of the trunk, underneath an opening, is a small bubbling spring less than a foot wide.

Meanwhile, Winnie is allowed outside again, as her mom practices piano. She swings on her swing, which resembles a [[noose]]. She then looks at the bush the turtle hides in, and notices it covered with [[fireflies]]. She manages to catch one. The man in the yellow suit (James McGuire), the same man from the fair. He greets her and starts asking questions about fireflies but it then turns to questions about her personal life after she looses the firefly. After asking her if they have lived there long, she responds, they lived there forever.

Her grandmother notices the man and comes out and asks the man what he is doing on their property. She hears the sound of Mae's music box but she's certain it's elves that live in the woods and come out every 10 years.

It's bedtime and Winnie is listening to her Grandmother telling Winnie's parents that it's the elves but her parents object. Father, Mr. Foster (Marvin Macnow) tells the Grandmother to cut it out because he doesn't want Winnie in the woods due to a murder which occurred there.

The next morning, Winnie's mother chases a bunch of rabbits away from her raspberry bush. The [[milk float]] for the town comes to their house. Winnie takes her chance to escape while mother and the milkman are talking about the elves and Tom Sullivan (the man who killed his wife in the wood.) She doesn't know that the man is watching her, as he had been hiding there overnight. She runs to the entrance of the wood and then walks slowly and admires the wildlife running around and listens to the birds chirp. She notices the large beech tree, and she sees Jesse in one of the branches. He notices her staring and jumps down. He then starts drinking out of that little spring under it. He notices a feather and picks it up. They notice each other and they begin talking, when Winnie wants a drink, he keeps pulling her back from it. After she asks how old he is, he says 104, but then says he's 17. She feels the water, noticing that it's clean and cold, but he interrupts saying it's terrible, and keeps her from drinking. She tries to drink it but he pulls her back and helps her climb the tree, as it's nice and cool. Mae is coming, with Miles, and still playing the music box. She recognizes it from that night. She says it's elf music but Jesse tells her it's just their mom. Winnie's Grandmother is not to far behind, so they grab Winnie and take her to their place. On the way there is the same man, but holding a pistol. Only Winnie knows the man exists, and so he starts asking the Tucks questions. He says the gun doesn't work and fires it at Miles. They both claim it was just a misfire even though he actually shot Miles. The man lies saying it's only a blank. On the way there, after crossing a bridge less river, Miles carries her across and Jesse shows off his immortality by jumping into a deep part of the river. After she begins panicking when he doesn't surface, Jesse scares her by putting his hand on her shoulder. Unknown to them, but the man was watching the whole entire time.

They go to the Tucks house where Tuck is outside working on his wooden horses. Tuck is surprised to see her and offers her to go swimming with the boys, which angers Mae. Winnie enjoys watching them play in the pond. Jesse tries to get Winnie to get into the water by splashing water. While Jesse and Winnie were playing, Miles, Mae and Tuck became increasingly worried about the man in the yellow suit.

Since the Tucks don't have a dining area in their home, they eat supper in their den, Winnie gets lonely and asks to be taken home. They tell her their story. 

Tuck says that 87 years ago, they came from the east, to find a place to live, and at the time, it was part of a large forest, and after a while of traveling they came to the area which is the now the wood. So they rested by the tree with it's knobby roots, they drank the water, even the horse, everybody except the cat, named "Ginger." They later developed a farm, and a house, and began living a good life. But then when Jesse was getting rid of some branches but fell out of the tree and it was believed that he broke his neck. And then one night at sunset, hunters saw the house and they shot her, mistaking her for a deer. The bullet when right through and didn't even leave a mark. Tuck got bit by a copperhead, Jesse ate poison mushrooms, and Mae cut herself slicing bread. After making friends, they realized that they were not getting any older. Miles was then more than 40, had a wife and a daughter, but he still looked to be 25. Their friends began to leave them, there was talk of witchcraft and black magic. They were forced to leave the farm but later went back and they noticed the tree and the spring. The tree hadn't grown one width since they saw it, and realized it must've been the spring. Tuck then demonstrates b melting a spoon in a fireplace using his bare hand and making a ring out of it. 

Early the next morning, Tuck takes Winnie out on a row boat out on the pond and tells her the dangers of selling the water, as somebody will most likely make it into a business, and just that little spring could create a world war.

Meanwhile, the man is riding on the Tuck's horse to Winnie's house.

While Tuck is giving good advice, he is interrupted when Miles yells that the horse had been stolen. They believe the man stole it, they ask Winnie and she tells them about the man asking questions and coming to her house but she couldn't finish as she begins crying into Tucks chest while he hugged her. Tuck says, "I forgot what it was like being scared." Mae is up in the attic area where doves live, and so she "uncorks the bender." Music begins to play and they dance around.

Meanwhile, the man rides Tucks horse to the Fosters house where he makes a deal where he'll find Winnie with the constable and look for her if they give him the wood. They don't know why he wants it.

Back at the Tucks, Winnie and Mae talk about Jesse and they have a "woman to woman" talk. Later that night, as Winnie's sleeping on the couch, Jesse wants her to drink the water when she's 17 so they can be with each other forever.

That night, the man and the constable are riding on different horses, the constable decides to stop and let his horse rest, the man decides to go on farther. The constable tells the man not to do anything.

A bit later, Winnie is sleeping when she hears a noise and gets scared when woken up. She asks if it's Jesse when it's actually Mae again. Mae says, "No, he's asleep, but dreaming of you I bet." Mae hums [[Hush, Little Baby]] to her.

The next morning there is a layer of snow on the ground. At breakfast time, Tuck begins to mention his concerns about the horse. Miles couldn't get any fish for flapjacks as the pond is to icy. Jesse comes down for breakfast and Tuck asks Winnie if she wants to come home but the man interrupts them, breaking the constables promise. He tells about how he was a little kid and was told tales about a family that would never die. Afterward. he pulls out his old pistol and pulls Winnie outside, threatening to make her drink the water and use her as a circus show and make the water a business, which Tuck warned about. He puts the gun to Winnie's head and threatens to kill her when Tuck comes with his [[double-barreled shotgun]] and shoots the man in the spine send him flying off of the hill and landing on a branch. The constable surprises them, and introduces himself as "Constable Thomas." Tuck is arrested and put in the town jail. If the man survives, Tuck will be free, if he dies, then he will be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. The next day Winnie is back home, but is only sitting sadly on her swing. They believe she's in shock and think she had a horrible experience.

The next morning, the milk wagon comes, and the milk man says the man died that night, and Tuck will be hung. As the carriage is leaving, Jesse jumps off the back, and when Winnie tells him, Jesse says they will break Tuck out of jail at Midnight.

That night, the grandfather clock chimes 12 and Jesse comes through the back window. They jump out of the window and run by foot to the sheriffs, using an ear of corn as a torch. They use [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]]s and [[firecrackers]] to distract the constable, as he deals with a group of teenagers who he believes are lynchers while the Tucks are busy at work. They replace Tuck with Winnie and they all say goodbye to her.

The next morning Winnie's father is directing her home and then they both apologize to each other. They notice a group of boys who Winnie becomes friends with later on.

Back at home, Winnie is a few years older, and her grandmother is on her last legs, as all she's doing is sitting and knitting. The doorbell rings and a salesman is selling turtles for stew, Winnie notices one of the turtles and realizes that it's her turtle. She gets to keep it but the man warns her that if he finds it again, it will be made into stew. Winnie upset, runs upstairs to her room.

Winnie, a teenager now is in a dry cornfield talking to the turtle, she still has a bottle of the spring water that Jesse gave to her and pours it all over the turtle, but then she realizes that if they do try to kill it and it doesn't work, then they'll wonder, so she puts it into the woods and hides it.

There is an epilogue at the end. It's the late 1970s and Mae and Tuck are driving a Late 1960s [[Chevy C/K]] and they are saddened and also surprised how much changed over the years. They decide to stop and ask where Winnie could. They drive through the modern day Treegap and stop at a diner and grab coffee. They ask the waitress behind the counter about the wood, she tells them that lightning destroyed the whole forest and was replaced by a bunch of houses. The waitress asks a customer who says last he heard when one of the sons became elected to Congress. They find a cemetery and find out that Winnie died in 1976. While sad that she had passed away, they were glad that she didn't drink the water. Jesse's working back at the carnival, now modern and meets a girl on a carousel named Katheryn Foster, most likely Winnie's granddaughter. Mae and Tuck get back into their truck when Tuck notices the turtle. He moves it while saying, "Darn fool thing thinks it's gonna live forever." The movie ends with the truck driving away back east never to return. The last shot shows Winnie's turtle, watching the cars pass as the credits roll.

'''United States lightship ''Buffalo'' (LV-82)''' was a [[lightvessel|lightship]] built in 1911 for the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] and stationed off [[Point Abino Light Tower|Point Abino, Ontario, Canada]] to help guide vessels heading for the harbor at [[Buffalo, New York]].
During the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]], ''LV-82'' stayed at its assigned station and was sunk with the loss of all six crew members.&lt;ref name="Point Abino"&gt;{{cite web|title=Point Abino Lighthouse|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1089|website=Lighthousefriends.com|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1914 the wreckage of ''LV-82'' was located two miles from its assigned location in 63 feet of water. Following two failed salvage attempts, ''LV-82'' was raised from the bottom using pontoons and sent to be refurbished.&lt;ref name="Point Abino"/&gt;

[[File:Lightship LV-82 After Sinking.jpg|thumb|left| Lightship ''Buffalo'' (LV-82) after it was raised in 1915]]
The ''Buffalo'' was in service until 1936 when she was decomissoned. It is unknown what became of LV-82 after her decommissioning. She was either scrapped in 1942, or was sunk by vandals in 1945.&lt;ref name="Association"/&gt;

[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|187px|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in 1869]]

The '''''Übermensch''''' ([[German language|German]] for "Beyond-Man", "Superman", "Overman", "Superhuman", "Hyperman", "Hyperhuman"; {{IPA-de|ˈˀyːbɐmɛnʃ}}) is a [[concept]] in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also sprach Zarathustra}}), [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] has his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. It is a work of philosophical [[allegory]], with a structural similarity to the [[Gathas]] of [[Zoroaster|Zoroaster/Zarathustra]].
&lt;!-- The following statement was removed on 9/26: There is no consensus regarding the precise meaning of the ''Übermensch,'' nor on the importance of the concept in Nietzsche's thought. There are other conceptions of [[superhuman]] nature besides those that are labeled Übermensch. It was removed in spite of this comment preceding it in the editing box: Please DO NOT REMOVE this statement without discussion on the talk page first. It is required if the article is to maintain a neutral point of view. Officially used for the Medic in tf2. --&gt;

== In English ==

In 1896, [[Alexander Tille]] made the first English translation of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', rendering ''Übermensch'' as "Beyond-Man". In 1909, [[Thomas Common]] translated it as "Superman", following the terminology of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 stage play ''[[Man and Superman]]''. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix "super" to capture the nuance of the German ''[[über]]'' (though in Latin, its meaning of "above" or "beyond" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character [[Superman]] (whom [[Fredric Wertham]] described&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as "un-American and fascist"). Kaufmann and others preferred to translate ''Übermensch'' as "overman". Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German prefix ''[[über]]'' can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.&lt;ref&gt;''Duden Deutsches Universal Wörterbuch A–Z,'' s.v. über-.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically. The adjective ''übermenschlich'' means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Übermenschlich. PONS.eu Online Dictionary. Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.&lt;/ref&gt;

==This-worldliness==
Nietzsche introduces the concept of the Übermensch in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the Übermensch to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fullfillment to draw them away from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 - English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; "I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietsche, F. (1885) - p. 4, Original publication - "Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des Übermenschen werde."&lt;/ref&gt;  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The Übermensch grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.

Zarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the Übermensch to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of God and the creation of new values==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Zarathustra ties the Übermensch to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. "God is dead" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.

Zarathustra presents the Übermensch as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the Übermensch acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.

In order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Übermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).

==As a goal==
Zarathustra first announces the Übermensch as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an Übermensch, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarathustra contrasts the Übermensch with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the sprit of the Übermensch.

According to [[Rüdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the Übermensch with a program of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the Übermensch relates to the creation of new values.

==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==

For [[Rüdiger Safranski]], the Übermensch represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and "evil", to become an "artist-tyrant". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any idealistic, democratic or humanitarian interpretation of the Übermensch: "The word Übermensch [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, Christians, and other nihilists ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, §1)&lt;/ref&gt; Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the Übermensch for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the Übermensch to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the eternal recurrence==
The Übermensch shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.

Laurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the Übermensch as the object of serious aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part due to the fact that even the Übermensch can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The Übermensch lies in the future — no historical figures have ever been Übermenschen — and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.

Stanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the Übermensch from the charge of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.

Others&lt;!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---&gt; maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the Übermensch is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the Übermensch, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.

Still others&lt;!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---&gt; suggest that one must have the strength of the Übermensch in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the Übermensch will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

==Nazism==
The term Übermensch was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;&lt;ref name="Alexander 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's Übermensch became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html "Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers - Page 7"], Court TV Crime Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of "inferior humans" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]]. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, "I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], "Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is" [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecce_Homo.html?id=tVL-Dmg6TlUC]&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of "Polish blood in their veins",&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Mencken]], "The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche", T. Fisher Unwin, 1908, reprinted by University of Michigan 2006, pg. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nnEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;as_brr=3]&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would be "having all anti-semites shot" as an answer to his stance on anti-semitism. Nietzsche died long before Hitler's reign, and it was partly Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] who manipulated her brother's words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, [[Bernhard Förster]], a prominent German nationalist and antisemite.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://users.utu.fi/hansalmi/forster.html |author=Hannu Salmi |title=Die Sucht nach dem germanischen Ideal |year=1994|language=de}} Also published in ''Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft'' 6/1994, pp. 485-496&lt;/ref&gt; Forster founded the ''Deutscher Volksverein'' (German People's League) in 1881 with [[Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1970, pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
The thought of Nietzsche had an important [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|influence anarchist authors]]. Spencer Sunshine writes: "There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman' — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"&gt;[http://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/ Spencer Sunshine, "Nietzsche and the Anarchists"]&lt;/ref&gt; The influential American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], in the preface of her famous collection ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', defends both Nietzsche and [[Max Stirner]] from attacks within anarchism when she says "The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the Übermensch. It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the Übermensch also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of [[Master-slave morality|weaklings and slaves]]."&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__Anarchism_and_Other_Essays.html ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'' by Emma Goldman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunshine says that the "Spanish anarchists also mixed their class politics with Nietzschean inspiration." [[Murray Bookchin]], in ''[[The Spanish Anarchists]]'', describes prominent CNT–FAI member [[Salvador Seguí]] as "an admirer of Nietzschean individualism, of the ''superhombre'' to whom 'all is permitted'." Bookchin, in his 1973 introduction to [[Sam Dolgoff]]'s ''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project. Bookchin says that "workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The comic-book hero [[Superman]], when [[Jerry Siegel|Jerome "Jerry" Siegel]] first created him, was originally a villain modeled on Nietzsche's idea (see "[[The Reign of the Superman]]").{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was re-invented as a hero by his eventual designer, [[Joe Shuster|Joseph "Joe" Shuster]], after which he bore little resemblance to the previous character. However, Superman does find an adversary in the mold of the Nietzschean Übermensch in the recurring arch-villain [[Lex Luthor]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} his greatest enemy on Earth. Luthor is preceded, even, by a supervillain resembling Siegel's original concept for Superman bearing the synonymous name of '[[Ultra-Humanite]]'. A direct reference to the term occurs in the episode "Double Trouble" of the TV series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' in which a German-speaking character calls the title character "{{lang|de|verfluchter Übermensch}}" ("cursed Superman").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Grossman |title=Superman: Serial to Cereal |year=1976 |page=67 |location=New York |publisher=Popular Library |isbn=0445040548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tenth season of the show ''[[Smallville]]'', an alternate Lionel Luthor refers to Clark as the "Übermensch". Overman is an [[Alternative versions of Superman|alternate version of Superman]], from [[Earth-10]], an Earth where the [[Axis victory in World War II|Axis Powers won World War II]].&lt;ref name="supermanbeyond1"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Grant Morrison]] | Penciller = [[Doug Mahnke]] | Inker = Christian Alamy, Rodney Ramos, Tom Nguyen, Walden Wong | Title = [[Final Crisis]]: Superman Beyond | Volume = | Issue = 1 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jack London]] dedicated his novels ''[[The Sea-Wolf]]'' and ''[[Martin Eden]]'' to criticizing Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch and his radical [[individualism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bridgwater |title=Nietzsche in Anglosaxony: A Study of Nietzsche's Impact on English and American Literature |location=Leicester |publisher=Leicester University Press |year=1972 |page=169 |isbn=0718511042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which London considered to be [[Selfishness|selfish]] and egoistic.
* [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 play ''[[Man and Superman]]'' is a reference to the archetype; its main character considers himself an untameable revolutionary, above the normal concerns of humanity.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* [[James Joyce]] utilizes the ''Übermensch'' in the first chapter of his novel [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]. Joyce makes [[Buck Mulligan]] say it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=James|title=Ulysses|year=1922|publisher=Shakespeare &amp; Co.|isbn=0-679-72276-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the ''Uebermensch''. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen."
* In [[The Power (1956 novel)|''The Power'']], a 1956 book by Frank M. Robinson, the villain consciously models himself upon Nietzsche's Übermensch, and a quotation from Nietzsche serves as the book's motto.
* In real life, [[Leopold and Loeb]] committed murder in 1924 partly out of a superficially Übermensch-like conception of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/index.html "Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers"], Court TV Crime Library&lt;/ref&gt; Their story has been dramatized many times, including in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', the 1959 film Compulsion based on Meyer Levin's novel, the 1994 film ''[[Swoon (film)|Swoon]]'', the 2002 film ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'', and the 2005 Off-Broadway musical ''[[Thrill Me]]: The Leopold and Loeb Story''.
* A character in the show ''[[Dollhouse (show)|Dollhouse]]'' (Season 1, Episode 12; titled "Omega") references Übermensch in relation to Nietzsche when trying to describe a person that had the memories, skills, and intelligence of dozens of people uploaded into their (single) mind by means of futuristic technology.
* The Medic character in the video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' will sometimes chant "I am the Übermensch!" for one of his "Cheers" voice commands.
* In the Disney TV Cartoon, Pepper Ann, in an episode titled "Effie Shrugged", Effie, a physically imposing bully teaches Pepper Ann some basic information on Übermensch.
* [[David Bowie]]'s song titled "[[The Supermen]]", from his 1970 album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]'', was inspired by the work of Nietzsche. Bowie later said "I was still going through the thing when I was pretending that I understood Nietzsche... And I had tried to translate it into my own terms to understand it so 'Supermen' came out of that."&lt;ref&gt;David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination - David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.267&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Avatar Press]] comic book series, "[[Über]]", written by [[Kieron Gillen]] uses the idea in an alternate universe during [[World War II]] in which [[Nazi Germany]] creates superhuman soldiers.
*A chapter in the novel [[Old School (novel)|Old School]] by [[Tobias Wolff]] is entitled 'Übermensch'. It humorously castigates [[Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand's]] better-and-bigger-than-life characters and satirically depicts the narrator/main character as deluded, because of Rand's [[The Fountainhead]], in his belief that he is superior to others.
*The TV show ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' features a race of genetically engineered super-humans called [[Nietzscheans]] who follow the philosophies and teachings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Social Darwinism]]. The Nietzscheans regard themselves as superior to "[[Kludge|Kludges]]" (ordinary unmodified humans) and are often referred to as "Übers", pejoratively, by such humans.
